"K_92","Null","116","166","22 March 2014"," How Did Veronica Roth Approve this Movie?
","I have read all three books written by Veronica Roth. I came in with expectations of character profiles and I reviewed the characters on IMDb. I understand that all book-to-movie adaptations make it difficult to fit in all the elements and are not perfect. It's impossible to portray the book word for word. Despite knowing all of this, I came in with a low expectation.<br/><br/>As I suspected, the tall and beautiful Shailene Woodley is definitely not the small and weak Tris we imagine while reading the book. A lot of the character profiles were 'off.' However, Shailene gave an excellent portrayal of how she developed from a shy dependent girl to a confident fearless warrior.<br/><br/>The opening to the movie indicates we are in 'Chicago,' and that we are separated into the five factions because of the war. There is no explanation of why the war happened, where and who with. Just that we have the huge fence to keep each other safe and we don't know what's out there.<br/><br/>Elements were definitely rushed and lacked intensity. The characters that were not featured in this movie are revolutionary figures in the second, making it impossible to have a movie without them. Key characters were left out or barely mentioned. Drew, Edward, Molly & Susan don't exist in the movie. There's no relationship at all with Susan and Caleb, as they left her out. Peter's entourage is completely removed. Edward has a couple brief mentions in the movie including the capture the flag game and on the leader board. Otherwise, the entire eye stabbing scene doesn't exit. We don't see Peter for who he really is. The intensity of taunting Tris and making it difficult for her at Dauntless headquarters is glossed over. We see Peter make a name for himself when he beats Tris in the fight. Molly has barely two lines in the movie. One of the lines Molly has complimented Tris. In the book she's part of Peter's entourage and they hate each other. I find that Peter is too soft in the movie and he isn't enough of a jerk. In the book he's way more nasty.<br/><br/>Elements of the Dauntless training were not victorious as they're supposed to be. There was no focus on how vital Dauntless training is and that they do it well. There was no desperation to survive the training like there was in the book. You saw the rankings change, but the intensity in the fights and the will to survive was never built up.<br/><br/>Members of the family have the choice to visit on visiting day. This scene was replaced with Tris' mother sneaking into the Dauntless compound to be updated about her progress in the Dauntless training. She warns her about doing too well and asks her to remain in the middle of the pack. It's not revealed that the mom isn't going to visit Caleb, nor does she ask Tris to visit Caleb and ask him to find out what's in the serum. Instead, Tris on a whim visits Caleb. <br/><br/>The movie was way too focused on the romance of Tris and Four. Four softens up to Tris way too easily. He's supposed to be edgy and guarded. Details about Four were supposed to be revealed in his fear landscape. Four seems unfazed by his fear landscape. This scene is so critical in the book, it's the first time we are supposed to see how vulnerable Four really is. Four never tells Tris to call him Tobias. In Tris' fear landscape, she sacrifices herself for her family. In the movie, she faces her family and the gun is aimed at them.<br/><br/>I can't even talk about the ending. It was completely changed. I might have appreciated the ending if I hadn't read the books. There were elements of the ending I quite enjoyed, but it's still very rushed. I understand that they needed to end the movie with no cliffhanger, but my sister who had not read the books still had questions about the ending. <br/><br/>Overall, I rate the movie as a C+. Other discrepancies include Tris taking credit with Christina after the win in the Capture the Flag scene, Will dying at the same scene as the mother (rather than in the Dauntless compound), Tris not showing her displeasure with Four and yelling at him, as well as Peter not begging for his life to be included with Tris, her dad, Caleb and Marcus. As well the initiate who jumps from the train and falls to her death, Al's crush on Tris, Four getting drunk, and overall many scenes that never showed the struggle of being that character. Near the end when the dad, Caleb, Marcus & Tris have to catch the train to the Dauntless compound, there's no struggle from any of the characters jumping on or off the train. Dad and the others jump like they have done it a million times and Caleb never complains. When they jump into the netting below, Tris asks each of them, 'you good?' 'you good?' There was a lot of odd phrases that Tris never used.<br/><br/>There were quite a few memorable scenes including the aptitude test, the fear landscapes, the simulations, the tense moments Tris and Four had that were very true to the book including the capture the flag scene, as well as the zip lining experience. ﻿"
"aker995","2","248","374","7 April 2014"," Most predictable movie ever- I cannot believe Andreea Negoita liked it.
","As I said, the movie was extremely predictable. I knew what was going to happen before it did and I honestly felt like I was watching it for the 3rd time! There were no twists, no suspense, no surprises. I could not believe that there would be so many clichés and unrealistic scenes. Instead of an ""action/adventure film"" I saw a boring love story. I can't imagine how unbearable it must have been for those who read the book..<br/><br/>*SPOILER* The following scenes are examples of why the plot was so obvious and boring: <br/><br/>We knew that Tris would not go into the same faction as her family, we knew which one she'd choose, we knew that she'd fall in love with Four, we knew that she wouldn't get kicked out of training, we knew that Four would find out that she was a Divergent but wouldn't tell anybody etc... Moreover, the scene where Tris and Four fight is so unrealistic and again, the fact that he started fighting on her side was way too PREDICTABLE. <br/><br/>*END OF SPOILER*<br/><br/>To me, Divergent looked like a bad version of the Hunger Games and I am really surprised that so many people liked it. Unless you are a teenage girl who finds Theo James hot and unless you have never read any books or watched any other movies in your life, I see no reason why you would want to waste 2 and a half hours of your life watching Divergent."
"kevinmorice","4","377","588","11 April 2014"," More holes than a colander
","Much like similar teen girl action movie series this one kills itself early on by introducing so many holes that the house of cards that they then try to build has no foundation. <br/><br/>Before the credits are even over the story makes less than no sense. Having destroyed civilisation in a world war (ok) Chicago survives. The survivors had enough materials to build a massive wall around the city, 300ft high, but can barely feed themselves. Now they have split into 5 factions (actually 6 because they throw a lot of people out and call them 'factionless') and this somehow magically creates peace. <br/><br/>So none of that makes sense, and much like Hunger Games, having built a nonsensical premise we now follow a teenage girl as she turns into a super-soldier capable of jumping of buildings fighting off trained armies single-handed (using a cheap looking paint-ball gun). All the while with her buff and perfectly capable new boyfriend doing as little as possible to help her. <br/><br/>Oh and I forgot a quick detour while we ride a pointless zip wire through some buildings for absolutely no reason than to try and spend some of the left over special effects budget.<br/><br/>And occasionally Kate Winslet pops up, but is shot from funny angles all the time while they try to make her baby look less visible. Not that they need to as her bad blonde hair is distracting enough.<br/><br/>All in a total waste of 2 hours. Just go and watch Twilight or Hunger Games for the same movie done slightly (but not a lot) better."
"tandrei2001","5","203","323","27 March 2014"," mediocre
","I went to see this movie misled by the high rating on IMDb. Unfortunately it looks like Hollywood makes movies for people with short memory. I admit I haven't read the source book, but I guess I wouldn't, judging by what came out of it. I hereby venture myself in saying that the book is also a bad SciFi novel. It has way to obvious imports from well known themes that have been exploited to the brim by today (like the ""perfect"" society that sacrifices diversity for peace, the ""different"" guy that stands-up to the system, the genuine technology that controls individuals (poorly described, by the way), the fear confrontation ad the list could go on and on. It is not essentially bad to bring these themes in a movie, but I see nothing new, original here. So... if you have seen Equilibrum and the Hunger Games then you know it all. Movies today are just mobile phones... keep reproducing ""features"" from the competition, while it is supposed to be an art. Another thing can't stand in movies in general is the poor IT incursions. I am talking about the scene in which Jeanine is asked to turn off the ""control system"" which consists of a huge touch screen in which she just hits some ""cancel"" button. That was really pathetic... Anyone could have done that right? Another thing that I can't stand, is the cheap psychology things in these movies. They are all based on some sort of psychoanalysis which is long time deprecated in therapy. But it is somehow considered to be ""cool"" and ""trendy"" by producers to insert these kind of flavour into the movies to make it more profound. Or are they just as stupid and ignorants as the target viewers? Anyhow... to me, this is bad taste in art. If you want to really go for it, you must do way better that that and if you can't, then at least make it more interesting. It is also true that movies like ""Inception"" don't occur every month, but once they do... they set a trend and everybody will just take a byte of it. Don't get me wrong, it is a ""watchable"" movie, perhaps a little too long for its story, which, by the way, is very predictable and full of clichés. I read some users claiming it resembles ""The Hunger Games"" and so it is, especially with the modest ending that awkwardly announces a sequel. I could predict how the story developed and ended after the first 15 minutes and that's what makes this movie mediocre. Script is mediocre, but at least it does not abounds in stereotypes so it's bearable. What can be said about acting... there is no acting in this kind of movies, you only need to be young and good looking, be able to learn your part and you're done. It's not that the actors are bad, but the movie itself is not based on any acting mastery and just because of that, the girl gets a plus for making something out of it. I am curious if the ratings will stay as high as now in time."
"Logan-22","3","95","148","24 March 2014"," A boring, sanitized version with no chemistry between the leads
","I read the trilogy (which was nothing special and kept getting more annoying each sequel), but at least the first book had some kind of * something * to it. The movie sucks. It is boring and there is very little action (and what little there was is over too fast and not very thrilling). The violence is sanitized with the only real blood being when Four nicks Tris's ear with a knife toss. The two most horrifying scenes in the book are not even included: the attempted rape of Tris by Peter's gang and the transfer girl who jumps from the train and misses the Dauntless rooftop to splat on the street below. Tris doesn't have a ""save the cat"" moment early on and provides no real reason to ever like her.<br/><br/>The story takes too long to get going, then the training goes on forever, only to have the ending feel rushed. Not once did I feel anyone's life was in danger. Not once did I perceive any credible romantic chemistry between Tris and Four. Not once did I laugh, cry, or feel anything but bored. And it goes on for two and a half hours! Ugh. Sure, the production values are high, but who cares if I can't relate to any of the characters or the story? It's just a dumb waste of time. I didn't hate it (only because I scored a free ticket), but have no desire to watch the sequels.<br/><br/>However, I'm glad Divergent made a bunch of money opening weekend to pave the way for other YA books to be adapted into films, but they need to do a better job. The reason all the recent YA adaptations tanked at the box office is because they sucked (Vampire Academy, Beautiful Creatures, City of Bones). The only decent one I can remember was Warm Bodies."
"galdude9021","1","70","107","19 July 2014"," Greatly disappointed
","I was actually pretty excited about watching this movie. My cousin thought it was great and better than Hunger games, so I read the books before I watched the movie. I liked the books, but there were a few things I wasn't satisfied about. The relationship between Tris and Four is confusing and spontaneous, completely out of the blue and random. In the movie it is worse. They barely know each other, Tris' ear gets cut from Four, then Tris is making out with Four topless. They didn't include a lot of the important characters, like Uriah and Peter's crew. They barely acknowledged the characters they did put into the movie and there seemed to be no importance in them. Al's suicide was a big thing in the book and it didn't really make an impact in the movie, there was no significance, I wouldn't have felt any emotion if I hadn't read the book. Will, Christina, Tris and Al's friendship is too muted and you don't really get to know any of the characters well, the character development was non-existent, . Four of the characters I couldn't really tell apart from the others, Will, Al, Peter and Drew looked pretty much identical. Too much is left out and there are too many changes added to the movie that make no sense. In Tris' fear landscape it seems that Four is trying to rape her and she has to violently fight him off. In the book it is playful and she ends up laughing it off. Edward's knife stabbing in the eye accident is also left out and that was an incredibly important scene.<br/><br/>This movie just really disappointed me, I never really get disappointed with movies, but this just frustrated me too much.<br/><br/>The books and movie both had great potential but were just a little bit off."
"Bruce722","5","191","312","6 April 2014"," Mediocre at best.
","When reading the book, I had concerns about how well it would translate to film. It's a book without much action and most of the narrative is internalized to the protagonist. Books like that tend to struggle to adapt well and Divergent is no different. The director tried to make changes to the story in order to try and make it work but I honestly think it was futile. It's just not a good story for a 2-hour interpretation. Even at that, I would rather have seen the story stay true and struggle to adapt than change and struggle. All in all, it was set up to fail from the beginning. Shailene Woodley and Theo James gave solid performances and the special effects and action sequences were done well but they made the film watchable and slightly enjoyable at best."
"Stiobhan","3","106","168","28 April 2014"," Made for teens TV Movie would best describe this
","Although lacking any real sustained exciting action parts, this would probably appeal to under 16 year old's.<br/><br/>I really have a problem with the voting, as according to it's current evaluation by over 48 thousand viewers it is 7.5 which essentially means that it should be better these movies which were rated less than 7.5: Man of Steel (2013); Captain America: The First Avenger (2011); X-Men; X-Men 2; X-Men 3; X-Men Wolverine; Iron Man 2; Iron Man 3; Oblivion; Superman Returns (2006); Independence Day (1996); Transformers (2007); and Stargate.<br/><br/>This movie is just awful; no substance, and worst of all it's set up to allow for the making of a sequel.<br/><br/>The only good thing about a sequel is that they won't have to do too much to make the sequel better than this."
"TheAnimalMother","8","27","38","8 September 2014"," ""Don't Try And Define Me.""
","I have to say that the producers would have to be stupid not to use Burger again as the director. He did such a great job with this one. I thought I was going to see a film that was mostly aimed at teens. However the story alone makes this far superior to most teen oriented films. In fact this didn't feel much like a teen film at all. The fantasy story is a great metaphor for our current society, it's simply a very relevant film. The directing here was spot on. The story as fun as it is, does have a few holes, sure, but they are easy to look over because they are such small holes. The film simply works as a commentary piece on political philosophy, and as an entertaining action film laced with some romantic tension. In my view this film was far, far superior to the very teen oriented and very one dimensional Hunger Games, and it's certainly more unique as well. Woodley is impressive here, clearly showing the ability to play a very layered and complex character.<br/><br/>8/10"
"david-selin","4","397","680","16 April 2014"," Four
","Four is the name of an important character in the movie. Apparently, it stands for poor writing, poor directing, poor casting, and poor acting.<br/><br/>Let's start with the poor writing. Obviously this movie would be more enjoyable if one had read the book. Well, I hadn't, and therefore I was confused because the back-up story was non-existent. The movie takes place in an dystopian society. However, nobody tells what really happened to the world. Without adding any spoilers, it is hard to specify why the quality of the writing is constantly so poor, but let's just say that the story is so full of holes it looks like an emmental cheese. <br/><br/>Poor directing. Good directing could have compensated for the ludicrous writing, but in Divergent they seem to form an unholy alliance. The scenes lack credibility - especially the action ones. Because of this, Divergent is a movie for the children at best. <br/><br/>There are three characters that look somewhat the same. It took constant effort to keep on track on who is who. The absurd changing of the scenes didn't help. However, the biggest mistake of the casting crew was hiring Shailene Woodley. Sure, it is cool to see a relatively new face in a big budget movie, but there is a reason why it is so rare - they cannot act. <br/><br/>The previous statement takes me to the final part, which rendered this movie close to unwatchable. The actors consist of young and inexperienced actors mostly. Because of the cheesy writing and directing, their acting seems even more horrible than it already is. Again, without including any spoilers, I won't go any deeper, but just watch the so-called ""chemistry"" between Tris and Four... Makes you feel awkward, huh?<br/><br/>Finally, I want to clarify that I usually like dystopian films. In this case, I was expecting a rating of 7 or 8, so I'm still quite shocked because the movie fell below my expectations so badly. It just makes me so disappointed that this kind of budget goes to absolute waste because of these flaws I mentioned above. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you are a big fan of the books!"
"claudio_carvalho","5","39","58","13 September 2014"," Stupid and Senseless Concept of Society
","In a post-apocalyptic dystopia, the world is destroyed and only Chicago has survived with a society divided into five factions: Abnegation (the selfless), Amity (the peaceful), Candor (the honest), Dauntless (the brave), and Erudite (the intelligent). The teenager Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) belongs to the Abnegation that rules the society but she fells outcast and attracted by the Dauntless. When she is sixteen years old, she is submitted to an aptitude test to indicate in which faction she will stay for the rest of her life, but she learns that she has aptitude to be in the Abnegation, Erudite and Dauntless. Further, she learns that she is a Divergent that is destroyed by the government. On the next day, she chooses to join the Dauntless where she changes her name to Tris and is trained by Four (Theo James). They fall in love with each other and soon Tris discovers that the Erudite are planning to take over the power from the Abnegation and become the ruling faction. <br/><br/>""Divergent"" is an adventure movie with a dull and lame story based in a stupid and senseless concept of society. The dystopia does not make any sense and everything is idiotic in the story: the society, the plot, the romance, the way the Dauntless jump from the train, the conclusion. If there is a faction formed for the most intelligent people, it seems to be obvious that they should rule this chaotic society. Tris kills many soldiers but she leaves Jeanine alive in the end. My vote is five.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Divergente"" (""Divergent"")"
"mreynolds9662","1","87","139","6 July 2014"," I wish I had the option of giving a Zero
","This movie was terrible. It was awful. And infuriating. It made no sense. This movie is the epitome of crap. In fact, instead of watching this near 2 1/2 hour movie, watch a piece of crap. It will have a better plot than this flick. The first hour and forty-five minutes (precisely) are spent on the wrong thing. It makes reference to the ""government"" (cough CAPITOL) to being some sort of evil, but rather focuses on Tris becoming part of a cult. It doesn't even make clear what they do. It gives no reason to why they are in ""factions"". There were so many plot holes I would have thought Tommy Wiseau wrote it. The guys name is Four. Four. Apparently the author of the book thought, ""Well, anyone who reads this is a moron anyway."" Four. Why? Why? WHY???? I understand that this garbage was only put together to make money, but did they have to assume everyone is an idiot? Couldn't they at least let it make sense? Or shorter? Or less cheesy? Or better acted? Or more focused? Or more intelligent? There was a point when Tris argues with Kate Winslet's character that them choosing isn't a matter of free will. Or at least she almost does. Right when it seems like the movie has any brain they shut it down in a hurry. There is way too much wrong about this movie. If I continue I will only be hurting myself by spending more than ten minutes thinking about this movie."

","Of course this movie is made for a very young female audience so I have problems to identify myself with the targeted audience. The good point about the movie is, that the heroine is not complelty depending on her male counterpart, so its none of the ""girls-are-mentaly-and-physically-too-weak-to-exist-without-man"" movies, but thats about it. If you want to watch something about strong female characters try the legend of Korra. The rest of this movie is terrible, especially the huge amount of brain bleeding inducing logic errors.<br/><br/>SPOILERS!!!!!!!!! For Soldiers knife throwing, jumping from trains and excessive hand-to-hand combat are the most important skills. As well as being complelty fearless...people throw knifes at you and you aren't allowed to be afraid? Yes, thats the stuff marines are made of. Being a soldier has nothing to do with endurence, guns, tactics and unimportant stuff like that real life soldiers train.<br/><br/>Being ""divergent"" not fitting into a faction is something rare...at least thats what the characters say...funny how the rarest thing turns out to be a majority.<br/><br/>The training officer sits at the same table as the rookies, but the rookies aren't allowed to talk to him? Yeah, makes sense.<br/><br/>A rookies says something stupid to a teacher...and they put in into the world wide newspaper...yeah, nothing else interesting happening.<br/><br/>Oh, I nearly forgot, the actual most important thing for a solider is house climbing. Know a soldier who hasn't climbed the empire state building? He's a noob.<br/><br/>These are just some of the terrible brain bleeding inducing logic errors in this movie. If you are a 8 year old girl you might be able to accept them, but for everybody else this movie isn't watchable."
"MovieSonic","9","55","86","29 July 2014"," Best tween film in ages
","I'm glad I got around to watching this, I'm not sure who's writing the negative reviews or what they were expecting but I can honestly say that this is the best tween film I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>It IS a tween film, it's blatantly aimed at young girls and as a ""twenty-something"" youngish female, I'm not embarrassed to say that I really enjoyed this film. It's pure fantasy fodder of course but here's what I liked about it:<br/><br/><ul><li>the relationship between the two leads develops naturally i.e. they don't see each other and go 'you're my soulmate', in fact they don't really get on at first so this is believable and refreshing</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the lead actress (Shailene Woodley) playing Tris is extremely natural and one of a very few actors I've ever seen who has convinced me that they are grieving (usually grief in films is just 'oh, they're dead, I'm so upset' ... swiftly moves on with their day..) - Actually both of the leads (Theo James as well) play their roles really well</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I loved the point of view shots like when Tris looks at Four during the training and you see it from his perspective and then the camera cuts to his face to get his reaction to the look she gives him (there are other similar scenes) and it just adds to the effect of feeling like these are real people and I empathised with them more as a result </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Yeah the background story for the city is quite thin but who cares, stranger things have happened in the real world and what I like is that we're given a sense of 'this is what they've been told but is that what's really happened?'. I'm not sure if that's in the book or if the film makers wanted to add some realism for us grown-ups but when they question what's out there, I got the feeling this might be similar to The Island (2005) - that's not a spoiler it's just my opinion and probably totally off base</li></ul><br/><br/>I have now watched this film about 4 or 5 times because I really liked so much of it: the fighting was believable for me because I think we've all gotten used to flashy choreography and sound effects but that's not what real fights look like or how they sound so for me, these fight scenes are really good. I liked the weapons because they kept it simple and for training, they're a good idea.<br/><br/>Probably the thing I liked the most is the fact that ""it's not all about Tris"". I mean, it IS all about Tris but it's not 'totally in your face, the world revolves around Tris and no-one else matters' all about Tris... What I mean is that there are some ""films"" out there which spend their entire running time having the supporting actors running around warning the lead actress not to have sex with her boyfriend lest he destroy her vagina but in this film, the lead actress often shares centre stage with her new best friend, there are a lot of scenes where she is in the background looking out as opposed to a lot of shots of her standing alone / in the centre and we see her friend fighting too; the focus is just not 'always' on her. Having said that, I do think that there could have been even 'more' focus on the people around her. First of all, had we gotten to know her friends better, we might have empathised with them more (trying not to include spoilers!) and also, this will sound harsh but it needs saying, I'm sick of seeing 'ethnic' people in minor or reduced roles: what a waste of Mekhi Phifer! I wish that Zoë Kravitz had been given more to do, yes she had a decent amount of screen time but I would have liked to maybe see her 'fearscape' and... that's about it for ethnic characters I think... yep.<br/><br/>I liked that Jai Courtney's character didn't go overboard as the villain but again, his character was a little one dimensional and I would have liked to have seen some more interaction and dialogue between him and Four just to flesh out their background story.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet honestly did the best she could with her part and it's a massive credit to her that she managed to make me severely dislike her and believe that she was evil with just a few odd lines here and there. Her role is to literally just pop into the film every now and then to be a bit menacing and give off a female-Hitler vibe (bright blonde hair). But she pulls it off in my opinion. There's no point in elaborating on why someone is pure evil, we know this exists, it's happened in the real world and it's still happening so her role didn't distract from the believability of the story.<br/><br/>Overall, I liked the subtlety of the story. There is no sex, no profanity, no overt 'I love yous' yet it didn't come across as 'after-school-specially' at all. Also, I never groaned out loud once or cringed or had to hide my face behind a pillow while someone professed their undying love for someone they just met a week ago. The dialogue was realistic with occasional over-rehearsed acting from some of the supporting cast but I really loved this film. Go into it knowing it's a tween film and that there won't be a lot of intelligent scientific explanations for things and you'll probably enjoy it as much as I did.<br/><br/>9/10"

","This is perfect storm of bad movie making: a stupid story, bad acting and bad directing. Who is ultimately to blame? Money grubbing CEO's. Who else? <br/><br/>Thanks to the mega-success of the Hunger Games and Harry Potter, Hollywood's scouring young adult books, like some pedophile in a playground, looking for new material to get their greasy hands on. <br/><br/>Divergent is one of those series. I've not read the books, but in the movie, you belong to one of 5 factions. Our heroine does not - she's divergent - and that apparently frightens the powers that be. <br/><br/>Why? Because individualism is seen as a threat. In much the way independent film makers are perceived a threat in Hollywood. <br/><br/>What follows is one inane, dumb, idiotic scene after another.

"a236570","5","20","29","23 March 2014"," Long-winded while straying from the book
","This book to movie adaptation wasn't terrible, especially if your only knowledge of Divergent was from the trailer. However, faithful readers of the book will be sorrily disappointed. The movie follows our young soon to be hero Beatrice Prior as she tries to decide which faction to choose to live in for the rest of her life. In her world, society is broken up into five factions: Abnegation, Erudite, Amity, Candor, and Dauntless. Once an individual turns 16, a test is administered that lets you know which faction you should choose. Beatrice ends up choosing Dauntless after being told her testing results were inconclusive because she's divergent, and that's the biggest problem I have with this movie.<br/><br/>In the book, this information is conveyed with the utmost importance. Divergence is serious, deadly serious. If anyone were to find out her secret, Beatrice would be dead on the spot. In the movie however, the divergent reveal is casual in comparison. In fact, everyone seems to know that divergents are being hunted, and the leader of this man-hunt, who also happens to be the head of Erudite, Jeanine, is all over the Dauntless compound. In the book Erudite's shocking involvement isn't discovered until much later, which allows all the other clues laid throughout the book to fall into place. In the movie, it's a given.<br/><br/>I can understand that some changes need to be made for book to movie adaptations, but the changes made here add nothing to the story. In fact, they greatly diminish it. There is no longer the constant threat of being discovered a divergent, because the severity of being a divergent is so down played. Erudite's betrayal to Abnegation isn't a real surprise the way it's laid out in the movie, and Beatrice's Dauntless training doesn't show the harshness, cut-throat, and violent way situations were handled.<br/><br/>There are many other finer points to be made surrounding topics like Four and Beatrice's relationship, Beatrice's relationship with her family, and much more, but they're too long to list. All in all if you haven't read the book, the only drawback to this movie is its length, coming in at just under 3 hours. If you're a fan of the book however, prepare to be disappointed, as this is a greatly watered down version of Veronica Roth's thriller."
"Jac23443","1","62","104","29 March 2014"," The truth about movies like this one...
","If this is truly based off a book, then God help those who actually thought this movie was good. Personally I have not read the books, although from what I saw in this movie, I am glad I never have. What kind of movie is this anyway? There was nothing pinnacle about this movie, nothing iconic, nothing that caused me to want to get up out of my seat and scream at the top of my lungs that was incredible because its all been done before. The army being controlled for God's sake was a pathetic attempt at being the slightest bit menacing, if menacing was what they were going for, it was pathetic. Then don't even get me started on the point where Tris gets to Kate Winslet, seriously!! No security to guard the most important person in the whole movie, the person who was behind the taking over of ABNIGATION, seriously?! Okay. There was barely any character development in any of the other characters except for Tris and Four and even that was done poorly (the revelation that the father beat Four when he was younger, if the movie really wanted fear to be felt, my God they failed). This movie SCREAMED young adult book, but then again the Hunger Games was a young adult trilogy, and all I could do was cover my mouth and hope the characters didn't die, and I know there is a part one and two coming out soon. This movie left no cliffhanger, nothing to the imagination, nothing to make a person ponder positively over what they just saw, it just happened to happen. There was nothing that dazzled and that is something I am noticing in most movies coming out these past few years. There isn't an elaborately put together story, its just put together in the way that's most clear to its audience, it is almost as if creators of movies nowadays don't want a thinking audience. AND THAT IS SAD, as sad as this movie was. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, due to its soggy and cringe-worthy script, poorly placed emotion, and over-told story. Thank God I got Game of Thrones, the Hunger Games, and Marvel movies to save me from movies like this. Seriously folks do not waste your money on this movie! I am giving this movie a five out of ten due to the fact that it tried, but it wasn't anywhere near as great as it could've been."

","Every studio hopes for a hit YA franchise, and in particular for Lionsgate-owned Summit Entertainment, the imperative is even stronger seeing as how they had unearthed that lucrative segment with the 'Twilight' series. And so 'Divergent' comes with high hopes that not only will it become hit YA property, it could potentially enjoy the same astronomical success as 'The Hunger Games', especially since both are of the sci-fi genre set in a post-apocalyptic world with fresh young faces.<br/><br/>Adapted from Veronica Roth's book, it imagines a dystopia where society is organised into five distinct factions based on personality types, each understanding and playing its role in order to keep the peace. These are Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless and Erudite, the names rather self-explanatory in describing what they represent. Youths are tested at the age of 16, given two likeliest factions from the results of a hallucinatory test, and then at a Choosing Day ceremony made to pick one of the two in which they choose to belong.<br/><br/>As narrated by our lead character Beatrice Prior (The Descendants' Shailene Woodley), there are those fit into more than two categories which are labelled 'divergents' and cast out to live as homeless vagabonds on the pretense that they do not belong. Needless to say, Beatrice is a titular 'divergent', and warned by her testor (Maggie Q) that she must keep this information secret lest she be the subject of a witchhunt led by the leader of the snobbish Erudite faction Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet). So at her ceremony, unlike all the others, she exercises her free will to join the Dauntless, who train to be soldiers keeping the peace.<br/><br/>Even with the task of laying franchise groundwork, it is both surprising and disappointing how much time the movie spends inside the subterranean Pit where Tris and the rest of her initiates train under the tough yet tender Instructor Four (Theo James) and the harsh and controlling leader Eric (Jai Courtney). From sparring to knife throwing to shooting, screen writers Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor spend about an hour laying out Tris' Dauntless boot-camp training and the dynamics between the trainees, in particular with two Candors - one a snide competitor played by Miles Teller and the other a loyal friend played by Zoe Kravitz.<br/><br/>There is of course the budding romance between Tris and Instructor Four, the latter of which turns out to be a 'divergent' himself and who ends up teaching her how to overcome the final 'fear test' of her training. At no point however does director Neil Burger inject a sense of urgency into the proceedings, which unfold relatively unhurried and without consequence until the final half-hour. It is at best a drag, at worst a bore, and while parallels have been drawn between Tris' training and Katniss Everdeen's in 'The Hunger Games', you'll find the former here oddly devoid of danger or purpose.<br/><br/>Only in the last segment is there some measure of thrill as a power struggle between the Erudites and the Abnegations build up into real conflict unfolding on the streets of an already war-ravaged Chicago. Burger assumes that his audience's patience will eventually pay off in a rushed final act that throws everything it can into the mix - including some heavy urban warfare, exposition, shifts in character - but it is a peculiar case of 'too much too late' that ends up making you frustrated more than anything else. There is little poignancy even with two key supporting characters meeting their demises within the short span of ten minutes, and that is also a result of the film's flawed construct, which diminishes the familial bonds illustrated in the novel between Tris and her parents (Tony Goldwyn and Ashley Judd) and twin brother (Ansel Elgort).<br/><br/>With little chance to flex her acting muscles, Woodley is hardly any match for Jennifer Lawrence, and indeed doesn't quite grasp her character well enough to put forth a consistent and compelling portrait of Beatrice. At least she does share some screen chemistry with Underworld: Awakening's Theo James, the bond that builds slowly between them rather winning to say the least. Other thespians like Winslet and Judd give solid supporting turns, though they are yet again hemmed in by a ham-fisted script that hews too closely to the book's straightforward prose.<br/><br/>On his part, Burger tries his best to build a convincing vision of a futuristic Chicago, but fails to convey the extent of a hyper- militarized and technologically advanced society on the verge of factional conflict. The postwar cityscape hardly leaves much of an impression, though the drug-induced mind trips that Beatrice takes boasts some degree of visual ingenuity that recalls Burger's far superior work in 'The Illusionist' and 'Limitless'. Worthy of special mention though is the score by Junkie XL (with Hans Zimmer listed as executive music producer), which hits the right notes more than you would expect in certain scenes.<br/><br/>Still, it's hard to imagine 'Divergent' being the kickstarter the way the first 'Hunger Games' movie was; though both share similar narrative blueprints, this adaptation feels inert where the latter is lively, failing to engage its audience with its female teenage protagonist's rite of passage. Unless you're a fan of the books, you'll probably be lukewarm about the next instalment 'Insurgent' whose production is already underway; indeed, true to its title, there is something off about 'Divergent' that never quite reconciles even till the end of the movie."

","The opening scene shows a familiar post-apocalyptic city labeled as Chicago, inviting the audience's expectation of Mad-Max-ish fodder. But something does not look quite right – the city is not in complete rabbles, but instead has more than half of the skyscrapers still in good conditions. Then we see people, crowds we expect to see in a normal big city, carrying on with life in orderly, civilized manner. This is made possible, as we are told, because of the wall, which immediately reminds me of ""Warm Bodies"" (2013) in which a similar wall (in nature if not in grandeur) keeps out zombies. What THIS wall keeps out is unknown, even at the end of the movie (at least to those who have not read the books), setting up the scene for future installments.<br/><br/>Inside the city we have an orderly post-war world where human beings are divided into 5 factions living in harmony, at least superficially: Abnegation (selfless), Erudite (intelligent), Dauntless (brave), Amity (kind) and Candor (honest). At coming-of-age, protagonist Tris (Shailene Woodley), originally from Abnegation, goes through the mandatory character test which helps (but not dictates) which faction to choose. Following the motto ""faction before blood"", once the choice is made, the individual leaves family behind, unless it happens to be in the same faction as chosen. <br/><br/>The complication in Tris's case is that the test is inconclusive, marking her as a ""Divergent"", a rare non-conformist considered a danger to the entire community, usually hunted down and exterminated. The kind-hearted test administrator (Maggie Q) suppresses the damning revelation, rendering it possible for Tris to exercise her choice just like everybody else. She opts for Dauntless, leaving her model family of loving parents and brother (who similarly chooses Erudite).<br/><br/>The longest sequence of the movie, Tris's painful (in more ways than one) training and ultimate acceptance into Dauntless, is predictability institutionalized. That is not to say that it is incompetently rendered, but just reflects my summary line. Most important, she meets Four (yes, his name and I don't know if there is any connection to Number Four in ""I am Number Four"") (Theo James) the good guy in the pair of good-trainer-bad-trainer, with predictable developments.<br/><br/>At 139 minutes, this movie is too long. The two leads are competent, action-adequate and very good to look at. You can't help but wish, however, that Woodley has more material to work with, remembering her Golden Globe nominated role as George Clooney's character's daughter. Two stellar supports, Ashley Judd playing Tris's mother and Kate Winslet playing the ambitious Erudite leader, are welcomed additions but their roles are somewhat lacking in dimensions.<br/><br/>I note that just like the various YA adapted movies before it, ""Divergent"" sequel installments are already in pre-production. Although I won't be exactly holding my breath to discover what the wall tries to keep out, I'll probably watch them, if only because they are not in 3D (hopefully)."
"jackmeat","7","19","29","21 August 2014"," Stands out against other similar minded movies.
","Settling in to this film, I expected to see Hunger Games again. Set in a near-future Chicago, what we see is another take on the dystopian society. The central plot here is that growing up in this walled in world, everyone must fit into one of five classes. But of course, the question here is what if you don't fit into the nicely packaged definition of a single class, then you must be Divergent, or in this movie, a danger to the perfect society. When our main character, Tris (played very well by Shailene Woodley)finds out she is Divergent she must hide this secret and discover the reasons why it is such a secret and why society fears Divergents. I'll leave all of that for you to watch unfold in the various physical and psychological training exercises that are portrayed on screen. In a nutshell, the world painted is similar to that of Equilibrium but with much less action. This is not a bad thing, since this allows the cinematographer to reveal a very wonderfully crafted view of this world. The pacing of this movie moves along nicely as we plod through Tris trying to fit in as a part of the Dauntless clan. Friendships are made, lost, and so on as expected. Even more so is the romantic involvement with the mysterious Four (or 4) played by Theo James (which I believe over acted his part entirely too much). So the mystery of why the government wants to kill all Divergents must be unraveled and this leads to the majority of the story. I was happy with just sitting back and enjoying the view during many of the scenes that were almost breathtaking. Not reading the book, I hope that the movie did well to portray the story but I also know it is a trilogy so they couldn't go from start to finish all at once. Stand alone I believe the movie was quite well made and under-appreciated, swept under the rug by the highly successful Hunger Games series. You will be hard pressed not to see the similarities between them. I am looking forward to seeing what else this world has in store for us and would recommend that moviegoers join me to find out. Will you see silly acted parts, and scenes that are just there to draw you in with nice landscapes and perfectly choreographed music, YES. But why would anyone complain about something like that? I know I wouldn't. Enjoy this film, you won't regret the time you spent on it."
"cltyler1","8","189","361","20 March 2014"," From a viewer who went to this simply to accompany his girlfriend...
","Divergent is gripping and intelligently brought to life on the big screen from the director who brought us ""Limitless"" and ""The Illusionist."" Are we seeing something of similar essence with the ""Hunger Games"" series? Yes. However, my personal take was that the characters were more engaging and the plot was as well in this film. Shailene is excellent at the helm, and really brings forth a convincing portrayal of a heroine battling in a world where chaos and tragedy envelope the characters. Her graceful emergence from shy personality to dominance is done artfully and really speaks to her ability as an actress. Theo James is also exceptional in the co-pilot role and almost effortlessly seems to pull off the bad boy with standards persona in a manner I haven't seen since Will Smith in his prime. The plot is high octane and especially more gritty than I first imagined. The emotion raw in intensity and empathic build. As a guy who was just going to this film to act as arm candy and a shoulder to lean on for my highly enthused girlfriend, I can write this piece while honestly saying that my eyes were glued to the screen the entirety of the film and was pleased to see this film do such an excellent job at developing both the plot and characters involved in it. Highly Recommend."

"scott1-912-252003","9","17","26","22 May 2014"," Left me thinking for days after
","I took my 12 year old son to the movies on a ""guys day out"" last weekend. We left Mom and sister/daughter at home. Anyway, we had a great time and it was a good movie to take my kid to see. I must say this isn't a hugely serious review, but a review nonetheless. When a movie leaves me thinking about it for days or weeks after I watch it, there is something to that. There is also something to be said about how this story relates to modern present society. Square pegs go into square holes, and when someone is too divergent, they seem to suffer in our shallow, worker bee society. The movie was entertaining from the beginning to the end, however I felt like there was no closure in the final scene. This is probably because the story is a series, as it should be, if it's based on the books. I loved the way the movie made me think about myself. This is where the genius of this film blossoms. Everyone I've talked to about the film, and everything I've read on the Divergent fan site is rooted in how people feel about themselves and how they fit into our current society and culture. Because all the excitement, plot, and direction of the film is borne out of the Dauntless faction, I've noticed that everyone who's watched the movie now wants to be Dauntless. Why not? It's exciting and they are pretty bad-ass with the black clothing and tattoos. For me personally, I was Dauntless as a former cop who sports his share of ink, but now a full fledged Candor or maybe even an Abnegation since I'm one of five running our local government. Really, I'm Divergent like most people. We generally don't fit into one category as human beings and that's the moral of the story here. Human nature is eternal and cannot be curbed no matter how you structure your society. The film as a whole was really well done. The plot flows, the tension is always there, the mystery seeps in now and then, and the action is outstanding. The lead actress is pretty, yet tough and smart, but young and has a lot to learn. That is the point though. Bottom line is that I loved the movie and I'm still thinking about it a week later. I will definitely own the movie when it comes out on disc. I can't wait to play it for my wife and daughter.<br/><br/>I also found out that the lead actress is from my home town and went to my high school. I'm more than double her age, but it is very cool that she is from my neighborhood and went to my school. Because of this, the movie has even more meaning to it because, again, the story made me think about how I relate to this world and where I fit in.<br/><br/>You can also take the faction quiz on the fan site. Everyone in my family took the test. My son and I came out as Candor the honest. My wife Dauntless the brave, and my daughter Erudite the intelligent. Of course this was just for fun, but interesting because there is truth in those results. (my candor is coming out again). This movie will be very successful because it's a lot of fun and a great story.<br/><br/>Update (Spoilers!): I read the book and really enjoyed it. There are some differences from book to movie, but I have to say the movie (all things considering) did a great job with keeping the story in line with the book. Tris was never last on the points board. She was first initiate by the end. The stun darts were paintballs in the book. The movie skipped the very important scene with the factionless man on the street. Mom didn't sneak into the warehouse. She came to the pit on visiting day. Tris never visited her brother, didn't fight the first day, mastered the gun the first day, wasn't going to be executed by three with guns, but by drowning in a tank, etc. Lots of details left out or changed in the movie, but it was still done very well and reading the book AFTER watching the movie didn't ruin it."
"DareDevilKid","9","13","19","29 July 2014"," A Riveting Dystopian Sci-Fi Yarn
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 4/5 stars<br/><br/>This is one of those rare occasions that a movie based on a recent young-adult novel has been done right, so savor it for what it's worth. And, worth it is, quite a lot, going by the terrific 2 hour 10 minutes ride you get through the stark dystopian landscape of ""Divergent"". What's more, the movie is not just about bleak dystopian locations and the direct bearing they have on the daily lives of their characters, but it also shrewdly manages to raise some highly pertinent questions about our own existence and what sort of world we could be leaving for the coming generations. The most uplifting fact about ""Divergent"" is that it pulls off this unexpected act through astute direction and some incredibly nuanced performances we usually don't associate with summer blockbusters.<br/><br/>While, Kate Winslet is an old warhorse and has played practically every type of role with grace and confidence, Shailene Woodley is a revelation, and proves yet again why her name is being taken in the same breath these days with Jennifer Lawrence as one of Hollywood's brightest, upcoming female talents. She captures the desperation, confusion, grit, determination, vulnerability, and tenacity of her character with the kind of self-assured conviction and realism you'd associate with seasoned performers. Kate Winslet as usual just shows up and reminds us of her immense abilities in every frame she's in, playing the villain with menace and an uncompromising faith in her misguided beliefs. Ashley Judd lend great support in the few scenes she's in. Sadly, the rest of the cast offers nothing worth penning down.<br/><br/>Now we all are well aware that this film is based on the first of a series of best selling fiction novels by author Veronica Roth, but as alluded to earlier, it's an aberration that the core elements of a good novel are retained while making it viable for a cinematic audience within cinematic time-constraints. For this reason alone, due credit must be bestowed upon screen-writers Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor for brilliantly adapting a recently loved novel, fresh in readers' memory, and transforming into a crisp screenplay that the Director and producers could work with. But, a screenplay - adapted or original - no matter how good, needs proper guidance, and this is provided with assured measure through the watchful eyes of Director, Neil Burger (known for accomplished efforts such as ""The Illusionist"" (2006), ""The Lucky Ones"" (2008), and ""Limitless"" (2011)). Alwin H. Küchler's cinematography could have been engaging and Richard Francis-Bruce and Nancy Richardson's editing could have been crisper, but thankfully they do not steer too far away from the plot.<br/><br/>""Divergent"" not only gives us a fantastically entertaining blockbuster to thrill and chill us for w hours plus, it also offers up a thought- provoking sci-fi tale, which begs us to reflect on some startling points it raises even while we're being enthralled by the proceeding on-screen - something of an oddity in modern cinema. Along with being faithful to Roth's book, it also builds a strong cinematic universe apt for the screen and successfully manages to engage both sections of viewers - those who've enjoyed Roth's novel and even those who have no prior knowledge of the happenings of her dystopian fiction series. ""Divergent"" is basically a must-see for all who enjoy a thoroughly gripping, judicious sci-fi tale."

Not one of the subplots made any since and most of the characters accept the leads were poorly introduced. <br/><br/>They set up divergence as if it is a special ability but its not. Its just a tittle. The main character Trice never really comes off with anything that looks like a special ability. The fact that there are no contrasting examples of her special ability make her ability hard to see. She just a girl falling in love. <br/><br/>The movie is slow as molasses and until you get to say 45mins into the movie you want to fall asleep. The plots are all incomplete and at the end you have no summary of what just happened.<br/><br/>The society they set up in the movie is not realistic in anyway. The Dauntlets are basically a group of wild side party teens and they act like they are tough when none of then really show a capacity to fight or defend. Though the story sets them up as the defender or police of this world.<br/><br/>There are pointless scenes like a zip-line scene that seems to come out of no where and have no relevance to the plot or the development of their NON-hero Hero. <br/><br/>The movie is like a mesh of other films like, they use the color look of Twilight and try to set the 2 main character up in the same romantic way. The world reminds you much of The Hunger Games but has much much less action and much less relevance. There is even has a touch of Matrix to it accept with all that technology they had no gun that could fire in rapid succession. Everyone in the movie pulled guns and most of the time they did not shoot. <br/><br/>Nothing is cohesive in this movie and I would rather you go see a re-airing of Spanglish, Tremors or Judge Dred if you want to see a much better movie. <br/><br/>I am a guy so maybe this movie was made for ladies more than men but I really did not like this fragmented, inconclusive, cheesy movie.

Peter came off as a light hearted jerk instead of a dangerous sociopath and Four just happened to suddenly like Tris. These were important things to develop. Instead, time was taken to have a show down with Janine at the end??? It wasn't just the deviation from the book. I saw this movie with a Divergent-virgin and he asked me multiple times if it was almost over. He felt lost and confused. I understand when movies are changed because the book just doesn't play out but that did not appear to be the case.<br/><br/>This was very disappointing and I frankly expected more with Roth being part of the production team."

It had me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. This movie is inspiring and motivational. It is the type of movie that shows that accepting people for the flaws and their strengths is important and that everyone is different in their own way and that it's okay to be who you are.

","I ignored this movie at first since it was released close to hunger games, looked the same, and had the least good movie trailer. but that trailer did it no justice.<br/><br/>this is a movie for those with some imagination. likes dis-utopian worlds or maybe apocalyptic worlds. some said the story is unbelievable. how can everyone be a work drones except one woman? well I'll tel you, this is exaggerated but it still reminds me of old social / communism ideal world. everyone has its place and does what he is told for joint harmony. this reminds me of my parents always doing what is needed what they are told and expecting me to do something just because everyone else do it. and like in communism everything is good and peaceful and right. except the leaders which can do what they want to shape it. oh and kill those who pose a threat to them. yep communism.<br/><br/>but no there's a new generation. just like my gen. the Y generation, that stopped doing what we are told, and instead started to ask ""Y"" questions - so did this one girl. there are others like her but she had the best instinctive to make a change (you'll see). all the charterers have a relevant background to how they act because of who they were. now they choose to do things different because of who they really are now. and that is what makes the shift. this could have happened a few years before or in another 100 years. when doesn't matter, only they who and why do.<br/><br/>so whats wrong with it? 1. well it is a bit cheesy at times. they romantic part is predictable, simple yet believable in the movie world. 2. somewhat predictable. the story doesn't hide the main characters and the big issue, this is not a spy/cops thriller. there is no big twist. you enjoy following the characters and chain of events and how the characters react to it.<br/><br/>I think this movie does everything hunger games did not: 1. its shorter. no need to wast your money and times. 2. the world is much more believable. not relevant but this is still our world. not a fully crazy imaginary one. our world just something happened. only this city matters. maybe there are others, maybe there are not. some said that hey don't understand how a poor civilization built this city but the civ isn't poor at all. its spends its wealth where it needs. some parts look bad, some look good.<br/><br/>so final words, this is movie is a fun ride all along. those who didn't enjoy it are either too oldish (45+) to understand the idea (those who said this is a teen movie should realize under 40 isn't' teen, they are just too old for it). or maybe too dense to see beyond the basic simple story to see the message. this is our world. serfs and lords. kids and parents. workers and business men. those who do as they are told, those who try to control the lesser ones and those who try to find the in between. do what you want because you believe it to be right. if you are one of those, you will enjoy this great and fun movie. I know I did.<br/><br/>9/10 from me. yep. and I'm not a teenager. 30+ straight male, how do you like that?"
"mmaq63","2","30","52","24 March 2014"," Not a better love story than Twilight
","I'm a 19 year-old female and yes, I've read Divergent and am currently on the third book in the series. It is honestly one of my favorite book series'. With that said I'd like to say that I was wary about seeing this movie at first because I had heard some bad things about it, but I figured it couldn't be THAT bad. I was wrong. Before the opening credits had even finished, I knew I would be disappointed.<br/><br/>1. I realize that it's hard for directors and writers to fit all of the events from the book into a 120-ish minute movie, but I just can't comprehend how they concluded that this would be the best way to execute the story. Key events were missing and/or changed. Many characters that play an important role in later books are completely cut from the movie, thus probably resulting in more plot/event changing in later movies. Basically a movie with the same name and some similar characters to Roth's book, but other than that, almost nothing in common.<br/><br/>2. Watching the movie, it felt like the actors were trying too hard. The whole movie seemed quite superficial and all of the characters were unbelievable. They were saying their correct lines but it just didn't seem genuine at any point, probably because the writers were rushing to fit everything into the time limit. There were a lot of very cheesy moments that made me roll my eyes or cringe at how awkward they were. Four (Theo James) was probably the most believable character. And that's being generous. I suppose it's not the cast's' fault for being given what they had to work with.<br/><br/>3. It was way too easy for the main characters. Tris gets kicked out of Dauntless, goes to the train and just is invited back in without a second thought. Then at the end Marcus just happens to know where the Erudite are controlling the simulation and when Tris and Four are trying to stop Jeanine there just HAPPENS to be a serum and injector right by Tris and Four?<br/><br/>4. The movie seemed way too rushed. It was like the writers were trying to fit a whole story in so they wouldn't make book fans angry, which was completely pointless since half the story was changed anyways. Tris' mom and Will both die, Tris finds her dad and other surviving abnegation, Marcus knows where the Erudite are controlling the Dauntless and four of them randomly leave the other abnegation without any explanation to break into the Dauntless headquarters that they automatically find and stop Jeanine all in under 10 minutes. At least the directors found a way to squeeze it all in...? I can't even imagine what it would've been like seeing this movie without having read the book. Too many questions were left unanswered. I could barely keep up and I've read the book. So many important plot points or ideas were never touched or explained in the way the book does. We never get to actually become attached to any characters so by the time Tris' parents both die I couldn't bring myself to care. At the same time it felt painfully slow. When the movie finally gets to the ""good"" part (when the mind-controlled Dauntless invade Abnegation) I was more than ready to leave the theater and pondering what I'd be having for dinner.<br/><br/>5.The relationship between Tris and Four did not seem real at all and felt forced. throughout most of the movie Four is being a complete asshole (more, in my opinion, than in the book.) to the point where it seems completely unlikely that he and Tris could ever be anything even close to friends and then all of a sudden he wants to let Tris inside his head, randomly kiss her, and then hold hands going off to battle before the finale scene were he and Tris exchange ""I love you""s. It happened way too fast for it to be a real relationship. This movie really made me appreciate the slow-churning romances in hunger games and even the vampire-werewolf love triangle movie that must-not-be-named.<br/><br/>My advice is that if you're ever planning on reading the books (which I highly recommend) DO NOT SEE THE MOVIE FIRST. This confusing, rushed, unrealistic movie ""Based on the book series"" will probably discourage you from reading the books. <br/><br/>Overall I really don't see how they are going to make a second movie anything like the second book. Hopefully they'll go the twilight/Hunger games route and get a new director for the second movie. Or maybe just forget they ever made the first."
"ironhorse_iv","7","8","11","11 September 2014"," If one choice could define you. I have chosen to watch the film. My test results for the film is that; it's a pretty good movie
","Divergent was indeed made to capitalize on the popularity of the Hunger Games book & film series by author Suzanne Collin. Some people might say, it's a total rip-off, but in my opinion, author Veronica Roth was influence by the books and inspiration to make her own. It's no differ, than Suzanne Collins taking elements from previous novels like George Orwell's 1984 and Koushun Takami's Battle Royale. For people to say, Divergent is a total rip-off of Hunger Games is an understatement. If anything, the movie is more influence by novel works like Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel's Dart, Orson Scott Card's Ender Games, and J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter. Even the movie takes bit of its story from films like 2010's Inception by Christopher Nolan & Mark Water's 2004's Mean Girls. Other influences come from the Meyers-Briggs personality tests, Milgram experiment, and attitude toward divergent thinking (ATDT). This is a Psychology major fan film. With all this influences, Divergent create its own identify. The movie starts out in a futuristic dystopian Chicago, society is divided into five factions: Abnegation (the selfless), Amity (the peaceful), Candor (the honest), Dauntless (the brave), and Erudite (the intelligent). Members join a faction based on their preference but are initially given a suggestion by an aptitude test. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) has grown up in Abnegation, the faction that runs the government, yet has always been fascinated by Dauntless. Every year, 16-year-olds undergo a serum-based aptitude test that indicates the faction into which they would best fit, but something went wrong, with Beatrice's test; as she shows that she has more than one personality trait, meaning that she's a Divergent. Since Divergents can think independently and the government therefore cannot control them, they're considered threats to the existing social order. The premise can be too far-fetched, improbable and illogical. You have to suspense your disbelief on this premise, as it's hard to believe that people can only have one personality trait. Since, it's a Sci-fiction film, anything is really possible. Personally, for a movie that supposedly has a lot of one-dimensional personality characters, these characters really do have a lot of divergent type traits. The pacing is a bit slow, as most of the time, the film focus on her time with the Dauntless. The training kinda did go a little too long. The plot could be a bit confusing, with all the tests, they go through and seeing how some test matter and some don't. The whole exposition somewhat got lost between the transfer from book to screen, as it wasn't that clear to the audience. Seeing how this film is the first one of the 3 books with the sequels Insurgent and Allegiant on their way. This movie will leave you with more questions, than answers, if you haven't read the books. Even if you readt the books, there are some minor different from the book to the film. The dream scenes were a bit longer in the book. Some characters such as Peter (Miles Teller)'s level of bullying is reduced to verbal comments as in the book, he's more engage in sexual abusing, and physical provoke her. Another big missing piece from the book is one of the character getting stabbed in the eye. Hopefully, they can fit that in, the next movies. Nothing too big was change in this film, so it's a fairly well adapted movie. The acting is pretty good for the most part. Shailene Woodley nearly quit acting in 2011, so it's good that she didn't, as she was great as the main lead. Theo James as her love-interest was pretty cool to have. The only problem is that Theo James acting really doesn't stand out. If anything, he kinda could be mistaken for James Franco. The supporting cast made out of Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Ray Stevenson, Zoë Kravitz, Miles Teller, Tony Goldwyn, Maggie Q and Kate Winslet were all great in their own roles. The movie could need some more minority characters. I don't know if it's part of the story, with the white washing due to its being a post-apocalypse or Hollywood just being ethnic bias. After all, the United States seems to be home to large groups of immigrants of many races and ethnicities and they rarely depicted in films like this. Even Hunger Games had more ethnic characters than this. It really doesn't look like people from Chicago. I also would like not everybody looking like a model. It kinda hurts the realistic tone that the film is possible to represent. The movie was shot beautifully by director Nick Berger. The mirror scene alone had some really good symbolism. The music choice was pretty good. My favorite had to be Run Boy Run – Woodkid. I wouldn't say this movie is a chick flick or only for young adults as there is enough material for everybody to relate to. Overall: It's a surprisingly good YA sci-fi action drama thriller adaptation. I'll be looking forward to the sequels."
"a-williamson217","5","27","47","21 March 2014"," Not the best...
","I've never read the books, so i don't know how it compares to the movie yet, but here's my opinion: I think that it was too easy for the main characters. There was very little conflict, and not too many obstacles for the main characters to overcome. For instance; Tris is told that she's kicked out of the Dauntless group, yet 5 minutes later she follows the group and the very same person who kicks her out has nothing against it. Also, the 'limitless ammo', 'bad-shot bad guys' and 'one shot death' clichés just make the movie a whole lot worse. Also, there's no real explanation to anything. I don't know if they explain the Divergents' invulnerability to the serums and tests in the books, but all of that was completely unclear to me during the film. I have to say, at the end of the day, 5 might be a little bit nice on the critiquing chart, but i think it's appropriate for the amount of money and work put into the film."
"Oliver_films","10","14","22","14 December 2014"," Amazing story line and beautiful acting throughout
","This film has two of the most recent actors who have become more popular recently and also a long loved actress Kate Winslet. i think this film is one of the best in its category as it not only pushes that amount of scenes which includes violence and nail biting moments to the limit.<br/><br/>This film is really the first of its kind it includes all types of techniques from the actors and also the fact about the camera focuses on the emotions of the characters which emphasises what the film is about and links in still with the main storyline.<br/><br/>This is a film i would recommend for anyone seeking adventure, drama and action in a film also there will be a sequel to this film called Insurgent."
"prince_c3","3","39","72","23 March 2014"," Paid Publicity and Paid Critics
","I usually don't write reviews and on occasion when the movie is really amazing or when movie is really worst, but that movie still end up with above 6 ratings by Critics. So Divergent is one of those movies where producers, directors and production houses instead of spending money and time on script, editing, acting and direction decided to spend all the energy on publicity and promotions. More than 90% of users reviews are negative and still the movie given as 7.7 stars I mean isn't is the biggest proof that producers well paid the critics too. Well, before the movie release they start promoting movie which is the typical case of every big budget movies but they started promoting actress and actor of the movie in every magazine and newspapers, basically they wanted to create a reel life imitating real life scenario between the leading pair the way it happened with Twilight series and because of that, the Twilight series otherwise one of the worse Vampire/Ware-wolf series made lot of money they bank on Kristen and Robert Pattison love chemistry, so the production houses tried to bank on Shailene & Theo chemistry in real life, but it seems that Shailene is not only pretty but she is smart as well, she has lot of potential and she didn't play that game. SO many comments already written about the flaws in the movie I don't think I need to reiterate them here. Overall very disappointing movie in all departments. The only thing is Shailene Woodley and I believe she is promising but still she is no Jennifer Lawrence and I don't think Divergent would become Hunger Games series. Another bad thing about this movie is unlike Twilight series which has low stars ratings which is justified this movie got 7.7 stars rating is ridiculous."
"stan-hudales","1","33","60","30 May 2014"," Expensive though Cheap
","The story had potential, but only accomplishes to create a mindless money grind for Hollywood.<br/><br/>Divergent, or Different is a highly misleading name for this movie, since it is extremely compliant to the ongoing Hollywood stream of creating all too obvious ""we're going to make # sequels to this movie."" If the characters were anywhere near emphatic or the actors actually had any acting skills, this could have saved the movie a little bit, but lack of story and well; basically anything worth while makes me draw only one reasonable conclusion.<br/><br/>Please change to title to: ""Die a virgin!"" So that you give the audience an actual reasonable idea of what to expect in the movie; a cheap teen movie suited for the lowest common denominator."
"yoitsjaydee77","5","19","32","3 April 2014"," Eh... Could've done SO MUCH better
","Honestly when I first read Divergent, I was clinging onto the front of my chair and really excited when I heard that the movie was coming out. I was satisfied, but dissatisfied by the movie. SATISFIED: I was really satisfied with some of the scenes such as the zipline. Now the zipline was something I was angry and happy about. I thought just the journey through the ziplining was cool and the music was amazing. It was also really cool how in the initiation and they were eating, Max told all the initiates to rise and they picked them up and I thought that was really cool. I also liked how the Dauntless were always hooting and shouting when running and I pictured it exactly like that. I really liked the soundtrack. Kind of made it epic and cool in that sense. The ferris wheel scene was really cool too The action and the fighting scenes were amazing and intense.. a bit too long though. DISSATISFIED: Now back to the ziplining, the fact that the initiates just easily dragged Tris along was a bit confusing. Also the fact that Uriah is barely.. probably not even mentioned in the movie is just unbelievable. He becomes one of Tris' very good friends throughout the series. The love of Four and Tris seems VERY confusing and forced. The chemistry is very intense and sexy, but.. seriously. ""Are you kidding? What makes you think you can talk to me?"" like. in the book you were so nice and crap and now you're and asshole. cool Four real cool. And an asshole to an implied and questionable sex scene to immedietly saying ""I love you"" is just A BIT strange don't you think? This whole movie in general seems too rushed like. no. nonono. Like all the characters that were meant to be important were just brushed over. Al's death seems so unimportant, you don't even get to dive in who Will is making his death seem also not important as it should have been, Edward is not even mentioned which is strange because his hatred of Peter in the second book will not be well explained when it comes out like. That's the guy who stabs Edward in the freaking eye for goodness sakes. The scenes are all chronologically wrong. Especially the ""visiting day"", the capture the flag/ziplining scene, Tris to Caleb's visit, and omg so much more. Also what's with the Tris getting cut out and running back on the train part? And Eric saying ""Who let you out?"" And Tris saying ""Me""... Eric responding ""Okay""??? Like.. you're okay with someone riding along who you CLEARLY cut out? Seriously? And you don't do anything about it? I was expecting something like her getting literally thrown off the train. Also, the roles of the factionless were unexplained. They just seemed like helpless little hobos that you don't want to be with. They run jobs such as running the trains and cleaning up mess. And the jerkish hateable parts of Peter.. weren't present. He wasn't an asshole. He wasn't even an asshole. He was supposed to, but it seemed like he was trying to hard. I love Miles Teller, but he CANNOT play a bully.. it just doesn't work out like that.. And what's with the ""Hey Tris, that was pretty cool"" said by Molly? Molly and Tris are legit enemies. not friends. Also the determination of the initiates for surviving and ACTUALLY GETTING IN DAUNTLESS was brisked over as well as the dangers. The pit isn't even a pit. The chasm? What chasm? And what happened to the Dauntless girl who died from jumping off the train? That was supposed to symbolize that even the Dauntless aren't safe. Talking about cast.. the acting.. some of it was.. not. good.. like Al's line when throwing knives, the ""scared of being shot at by an airborn knife"" line was just said. not even acted. Tris gets shot running with Four at the end, but.. recovers? She runs perfectly after. If I got shot in the shoulder, I'd probably be crying the whole time. Like seriously.. How come Jeanine was so nice? like. isn't she a bitch? or supposed to be that is? ""Stop. Are you hurt?"" This was said by Jeanine when Tris was at the Erudite Compound to visit her brother. Is she even supposed to care? Also, in the book, when Tris goes to try to stop the sim, she finds Four ALONE IN THE ROOM CONTROLLING THE COMPUTERS. Okay. alone. controlling computers. no. He was being tested.. or so I think.. and he was with other Erudites and Jeanine who happened to be there. Oh and also. If you're going to put Jeanine there, at least kill her instead of knocking her down.. seriously.. How come Tris gets to grab the flag and not Christina? I thought that was supposed to be vital for their friendship, at least to Tris. And the fact that Tori was a bitch in the room taking the aptitude test was weird.<br/><br/>There's actually more but.. you know :)"

"chicagopoetry","2","25","44","23 March 2014"," The Most Boring Movie I've Seen In Years
","I couldn't believe how boring Divergent was. There's no plot whatsoever. Nothing happens. It's like a bad episode of Star Trek. What did they spend $85 million on? There's no special effects whatsoever unless you consider a computer generated landscape of a futuristic Chicago a special effect. The acting is weak. The two main characters are completely miscast for a romance, it's borderline pedophilic. The filmwork feels like it was shot on a vid-cam. I would have walked out about three quarters of the way thru but didn't want to disturb the others in the theater so I just sat there yawning and rolling my eyes. What a stupid movie. I guess with this type of trash appealing to the Twilight slash Hunger Games crowd I should say, Oh mah gawd gag mah with a spoon."

Entire chunks of the plots were missing- and not subtle ones either. Very KEY EVENTS ARE NO WHERE TO BE FOUNS WITHIN THIS FILM. it is a waste of time to go see it in theaters. If you must watch it, I suggest just going to redbox or another rental place when it comes time for the movie to be released. And I am not trying to be that negative person that leaves bad reviews on anything and everything. Usually it is very easy for me to find the good in something but not in this.

I knew she would not pick her home faction as her choice it was pretty f*****g obvious she would do that hahaha I thought the reaction of her parents was pretty f*****g funny too I had almost no sympathy for them for the entire movie their characters were rather pathetic really.<br/><br/>We could all tell that Kate Winslets Character was going to be a villain towards the end of the movie and even her character sucked too, her motives and beliefs were very questionable and didn't really make any sense.<br/><br/>When Tris meets Four it was very obvious that they were going to get it on later and their relationship seemed very rushed and actually pretty pointless.<br/><br/>BUT WOW THIS MOVIE HAS ALMOST NOTHING ORIGINAL ABOUT IT!!!!------I saw everything coming, come on guys what the ****?

As far as I knew their only f*****g powers were in the dream simulator or whatever it was called and those weren't even special powers. Otherwise Divergents were pretty pointless.<br/><br/>To finish this review up the script sucked, the acting was okay, the visuals were okay, plot was dumb and nothing special, characters were not really developed well.<br/><br/>Do not watch this movie if you have any sense of what makes a good movie it really is a waste of your time."
"aharmas","1","27","49","21 March 2014"," Fizzling Form of Flattery
","I've decided to go back and give ""Divergent"" a second opportunity so I could appreciate all the great things I had heard about it, its story, action, acting, and how it worked so well that we could expect sequels to let us partake of more of this trio of novels by Roth.<br/><br/>After sitting through more than two hours of something that supposedly happens in the not so far future, a dystopian society where the government has decided to divide into four sections, which depend on the citizens' qualities, and because now there's harmony and everything runs smoothly, peace has been achieved, or so we are made to believe.<br/><br/>To be fair, there are good things in the movie, and because they are pretty good, it's only appropriate to give credit where it is due. Ms Kate Winslett once again proves to the world the lady can handle just about any acting job you give her. In ""Divergent"" she's the leader of one of the sections, and she looks and acts the part. In fact, she's so convinced she's so perfect for her job, she takes on the job of improving what's already a perfect society, and every time, balance is off, someone is going to suffer. Winslett is cold, efficient, imposing, and pretty good in her ""Divergent"" persona. She's already played aristocrats (""Titanic""), interestingly, she's also given us a chance to witness her talents as a member of the lower classes, too, when she throws caution to the wind and joins Jack in the same film. Even better, she's proved that she can survive in a world where a totalitarian leader takes over, without questioning anything about it (""The Reader""). Here she's nothing else than a very smart and sophisticated cold mass assassin, and she gives us a performance to relish, a performance that shines and stands over the rest because there's very little else in this film to call worthy.<br/><br/>And yet, there is Ashley Judd, badly cast as the rebel mother who surprises us with her stealthy moves, as a survival soldier who sacrifices her stability to save her family. She tries really hard with that steely core of hers to give her character substance, but the role is so ludicrous and poorly written that I couldn't help laughing instead of feeling devastated in her big scene. I remembered how much I have loved in much better material.<br/><br/>Now, on to ""Divergent""... The material suffers from the lack of originality. We've seen this before in much better guise in more entertaining films, and sadly, the other trio of books and films have come out not long ago. The setting is the future, the masses have been oppressed, and the revolutions have started... Does that sound familiar? In addition to that a few other authors must be wondering why other people just borrow without even trying to hide the fact. At least in the case of Potter, the references were elegant, more of a good tribute, and having those phrases in Latin or something like that, makes the whole experience more palatable. It doesn't hurt that the characters are indeed much better written. One certainly wishes there was more magic in ""Divergent"".<br/><br/>In addition to the fact that we are dealing with an unoriginal and paradoxically slow action film, full of noise, a loud and disturbing score that doesn't support but impedes our enjoyment of the muddy photography and the very interesting editing techniques, we have two leads that have absolutely no chemistry and a leading character that seems to believe that strength equals a vacant look. There's no transformation from whatever it is supposed to be at first, insecurity, indecision, confusion, to the hardened, both physically and psychologically scarred heroine. It's problematic because the entire premise rests on this transformation, and as pretty as the lead is, there's definitely not much of a heroic soul here. Anyone can hold an automatic gun and pretend they are a good shoot, but we have no Daniel Craig, Jennifer Lawrence, Scarlett Johansson, or anyone involved in the Marvel Universe here. They're both fictional, too, and much better written, performed and realized.<br/><br/>I was having a bit of a problem with the setting of the story. Instead of leading through an hour of training sessions and escapades, and a very confusing testing session, I was hoping that someone would explain that train. Why does it keep running? What's going on with the way this society allows the people that don't to wander around? Why are some places to high tech, looking so futuristic, but we have other residences that could pass for Amish in the way they are portrayed? Someone wasn't really doing much to create a believable universe.<br/><br/>I couldn't help comparing this film with another one where people engage in the deception of the masses through entertainment but have to become resourceful in order to survive, and there are flashes of social instability that eventually germinate into chaos and revolution. It does help that there is a more solid script and a main character that shows her flaws, her troubles, her growth, and her steel core with her acting, instead of a narration that well, helps get me confused and distracted me to the point I thought I was narcoleptic. <br/><br/>Enter at your own risk. If you see this, you might not need that mind controlling serum after all."

Climax music for a random walking scene, with nothing Epic going on? Check. A police force faction who acted like complete a**holes for no reason? Check. They would run everywhere for no apparent reason, act loud and make noise for no reason. Ohh here is the best part, they would climb up to the overhead subway, again for no reason, and the train would not stop at stops, it would keep going so they needed to jump into it. <br/><br/>Wait it gets better, they end up in their headquarters where it looks worst than a run down prison, then next scene they decided to get tattoos, and they are in a swanky upscale lounge with everyone's hair done.

","Spoiler alert! This series is absolutely amazing. I'm an avid fan of science fiction all the way back to Metropolis to Buck Rogers to Star Trek to Barbarella to Star Wars to Avatar. What makes this series so cool is the social fiction more than the science fiction. Not to downplay cool science fiction threads and special effects along with the stunts but the future's social structure in this premiere of the series is just absolutely brilliant. Many science fiction stories take you on a journey,adventure,exploration beyond our world but I always like social fiction based upon our existing world and what could be. The thing about movies is being taken away to that larger than life essence for a while, Divergent is no exception; except that maybe it does it more exceptional than most movies do."

","I watched the movie without having read any of the series, and yet, it is apparent that the movie did the books justice. I absolutely like how there is less romance and more substance this movie has compared to other similarly themed movies. The casting crew did a great job by choosing the lead actor and actress. The depth of the characters development is proper. Thus, this movie is also entertaining for adults. I sense good chemistry among the casts. The lead actress successfully portrays a confused yet brave teenager and captures innocence, while the lead actor renders a mature vibe that help save the movie from being categorized as another superficial teenage love story."

","So I went into this movie wanting to be impressed by it. I didn't know much about it but was hoping for it to be a fun movie. I waited patiently for what had to be around 3 hours for the plot to pick up and get interesting. I checked my watch and alas only about 30 minutes had actually elapsed and to my further dismay the movie never did get interesting and the plot remained rather lack luster.<br/><br/>I usually love movies set in a dystopia, but this one was on par with watching paint dry. The acting was average and that's being very generous. The action was weak. The plot was weaker. The romance forced. The characters were flat.<br/><br/>Also try not to laugh when Tris yells ""stop it"" to the bad guys during a scene that isn't suppose to be funny yet you can't help but laugh at how ridiculous it is.

I read the books and saw the movie and thought both were very good -- not incredible, but good, deserving of 8 out of 10. One the key complaints is the same one you always hear when a movie is adapted to a book: how could they have not included scene/event/character x,y or z from the book? So and so does this in the book, but in the movie they do y. And so on. Give me a break. Does this really need to be repeated? You can't really convert a book perfectly into a 2 hour movie. You just can't. Characters get cut, shortcuts are made to the plot. Live with it or don't see the movie. Getting to the movie itself now. Yes, there are flaws and some logical missteps. But overall, the world that is created is visually appealing and interesting, the character (especially Woodley) do a good job, and the last portion, while a bit rushed perhaps, is engaging. I would say that the source material itself is not 10 out of 10 material, and the movie conforms to my rating -- very good, but not a 9 or a 10. If you can get over the book/movie thing, you will enjoy this movie."
"demon1-234-440958","3","19","33","23 March 2014"," A Good Start That Became A Legendary Disaster
","Alright, let me start by saying that while I've read all 3 books, I am the type that will ignore that when watching a movie and take things as they are.<br/><br/>Now, Divergent is a cool concept. The movie started off reasonably well: it flowed consistently, the visuals were nice, and the acting was decidedly as good as you can hope for. I've got no real complaints about the acting as, while there were a few times I thought it was off, I rather doubt I'd ever find a film I found completely flawless.<br/><br/>So if the acting is good and the story flows well, why do I give it a 3 star, right? Ah, that's just a sad story in itself. For starters, the movie hints at the ending all throughout it: they openly talk about the Divergent being hunted, quite casually I might add; it shows the Erudite working closely with the Dauntless; talk of the Erudite planning against the Abnegation is common; and, the coup de grace, Four (played by Theo James) has a vial of serum they're bringing into Dauntless, that he admits is dangerous!<br/><br/>Alright, now to get to my biggest issue with this film: the ending. First of all, the Erudite are logical geniuses, where is the logic in them engaging Four, a Dauntless legend, in hand-to-hand combat while they've got guns and can attack from a distance? Even more worse than that, in what way does it make sense for Tris and Four to leave Jeanine alive after she controlled all the non-Divergent Dauntless? She's got the leaders of the faction at her beck and call, and her own faction, it wouldn't be hard for her to do the same thing all over again!<br/><br/>Taking into account the story line the remaining two parts take (Insurgent and Allegiant), there are at least 14 things about the movie that cause issues with the remaining films (yeah, someone got me to count them up, though I stopped at 14).<br/><br/>Looking at the book Insurgent alone, there will be a notable issue just in the first scene at Candor as Four and Tris can't possibly be accused of running the simulation. I suppose they can say it's treasonous to leave Jeanine alive, but meh, that wasn't well thought out. There's also the issue that is the Dauntless-born being friendly with Tris: the zip line scene shown in the movie was much less personal than it was in the book, and it never showed Tris being friendly with Uriah or any of the others outside of that (which is weird seeing as Uriah is one of the top initiates, and among Tris' best friends).<br/><br/>I give the movie a 3 star rating because I feel the acting and scenery were at least quite decent, but I can't give it a high grade because it doesn't matter if the acting is spot on in an immaculate scenery if the dialogue and story line are complete crap. It may be passable in a comedy, but not here.<br/><br/>And now for my final disappointment, and that is with casting: Shailene Woodley: Sorry, but I just don't see her as being the plain, helpless chick that Tris is supposed to be initially. She's never exactly plain looking, gives a decent showing as helpless in the beginning but it just doesn't match up right. Her height doesn't really match up with the height match with Four either, though I can let that part slide.<br/><br/>Miles Teller: This guy just seemed too happy to be someone playing Peter. Peter's character is typically vicious, sadistic, and mildly calculating. Miles seemed to be smiling too much in a joyous way to match up with the persona that Peter's character gives."
"Spazplayer20","7","85","178","21 March 2014"," DIVERGENT may have just saved young adult adaptations in Hollywood.
","DIVERGENT delivers where so many of the recent young adult novel film adaptations have failed. I saw this film not having read the book and on its own it stands very well. <br/><br/>First off the bad:<br/><br/>1) action sequences feel slow and not natural. You can tell that the actors were not particularly familiar with hand to hand combat, not to say their characters weren't supposed to be but even when they're supposed to know how to fight it feels lackluster. 2) obvious age difference between the two main characters. 3) high school Clich feel for the first half of the film. <br/><br/>Now with that said ^ here is what Worked: <br/><br/>1) length. Often we see film adaptations of novels try and cram everything into 90 or 100 mins but Divergent takes its time. Normally this would be a drawback but the film makes good use of the extra time (the film is 145 mins) to really progress. 2) the performances of the main characters are solid. Nothing amazing but the dynamic between the two main characters works well. - the visual style of the film is very good. The dystopian city of Chicago is very well realized. 3) brings to light moral and societal problems. Suprizingly deep for a young adult film.<br/><br/>OVERALL divergent is a good film. It fails in few places but succeeds in most that count. With the failure of young adult movies such as Percy Jackson, Divergent healthily separates itself from them. I would recommend seeing it. There WILL be a sequel."

"captaincameron","6","28","53","22 March 2014"," Stunningly average
","I always click ""may contain spoilers"" in case I slip, but I try not to offer any. And as i write this review, I should admit that I never got around to finishing the book, so I can't say how true the film was to it. But I can say how true the film was to, well, films in general, and that was this: average. The pacing was poorly assembled. How the world came to be the way that it was was never explained. Why Kate Winslett was in the movie was unfathomable. This may be a spoiler, so stop reading if you wish to avoid such, but when our heroine and others are being trained in hand-to-hand combat, they adopt some sort of weird ""I'm hugging a skinny person to my chest"" stance with their hands and keep their legs almost entirely straight. This is guaranteed to have them get the crap kicked out of them. But the good points: the characters were consistent all the way through. Good point, I guess that was. My advice: Wait for this one to hit the premium channels. More advice: While Divergent was the first in a trilogy, and Hollywood has a way of making a trilogy into four or five or seven movies, don't expect a sequel. This really was that sort of weak."
"Stautis","5","19","34","14 April 2014"," Is this what has become of writing?
","The thoughts going through my head during the majority of this movie was: ""Has this really been published as a book?"" and ""This seems like something I could write"". And I just don't tell myself that, it actually seems vaguely similar to something I wrote years ago on an exam. <br/><br/>Welcome to a world where all the guys look strangely familiar and have forgettable names. Apparently there has been some sort of war that almost wiped out humanity. A small part of the population has however managed to seal Chicago off. The founding fathers of this society has clearly been reading up on dystopia and has come to a conclusion that Hunger Games is the way to go. Only smaller. This is all acted out where plot holes are blatantly overlooked and the identity of a character really isn't that big a deal.<br/><br/>Suffering from a lot of vibes similar to that of the vastly inferior first Hunger Games movie. One can see a movie going for the same social commentary void of the core originality. The originality was also lacking, although not to the same degree, in the aforementioned film. <br/><br/>This obviously isn't to much of a problem seeing as how it's really not THAT similar in the way the movie gets the message across, but there are very similar traits to this film and you can draw some lines that would be hard to credit for being original. As I haven't read the book i can't say if that's something to blame on the author of the book or the writers working on the screenplay. To me it seems like whoever was in charge of what was going on towards the end of the film got a bit sick of working on this. <br/><br/>There are scenes in this movie where you may find the dialogue laughable or spine-tingling and cringeworhty. This goes for the story as well, when you're not able to tell where this movie is headed it takes a turn for the worse. However, don't worry, the guy next to me proved that predicting this movie from start to end isn't really an achievement. <br/><br/>I'm not gonna say that the acting was terrible, but it had it's definitive weak moments. Towards the end, and I don't think this will surprise anyone, there is a crying scene. It may actually be one of the most annoying moments I've ever seen on the silver screen or on any screen for that matter. <br/><br/>I could go on pointing everything that is wrong with this movie, but i won't. There are redeeming factors to this movie. I think the cinematography has some shining moments, maybe with a bitter aftertaste of pretentiousness. Anyone familiar with the musical works of Woodkid will know that his music has cinematic traits as a result of several years behind the camera, which I personally think is great. It really goes along well with this trendy and ""not-so-dark-dystopian"" world. <br/><br/>Ultimately it seems like a mix of Equilibrium and, as i already have mentioned to the point where it becomes boring(much like the message of this movie) The Hunger Games. You take the mush, cover it in 100$ bills, add a relatable teenage identity crisis, some predictable romance and overthrowing of a government and you have yourself a hit, at least among the younger generation. <br/><br/>Clearly though they haven't gotten it all wrong. My younger sister at the age of 16, seemed to think much better of this film. Hmmm... Go figure."

There is also a different relationship between Tris and Four in this movie that in the book, and I like the book version better.

In addition the age gap between the main characters, Tris and Tobias (Four), seems a bit off. Just a few missed scenes and minor details, I would have liked a more realistic transition into Tris and Tobias' relationship, as it seemed a bit abrupt and confusing. The original book focused a bit more on Tris' evolution from her original faction to Dauntless, this gave the character more depth in my opinion. I would have also liked to see more about Tris and her friends (maybe an intro to Uriah or some of the other dauntless-born initiates would have been nice). For someone who has not read the original novels this is an interesting movie and would be very enjoyable. I would recommend those who have NOT read the books to see the movie."

","I didn't watch this when it came out in movie theaters because I thought the preview looked stupid and basic. I was partially right. It is a basic form of a dystopia fighting to become a utopia. It is very similar to the hunger games which is why I dropped from 10 to 9 in ratings. Other than it being too similar to the hunger games, it was a good movie. I was not expecting both of Tris' parents to die. I did wish Tris and Four had more scenes together. Maybe in their new series they will explore their relationship further. I was not a fan of how it ended. Tris and Four just left the dystopia with all the leaders still alive. Obviously, they will come back for revenge. Overall, I can watch it over and over again because they picked a very good cast. I also underestimated Shailene. I use to watch her ""secret life"" show on ABC family, so I was expecting her to be an over dramatic character. She played this part well."

","Divergent"" is all about identity—about searching your soul and determining who you are and how you fit in as you emerge from adolescence to adulthood. So it's all too appropriate that the film version of the wildly popular young adult novel struggles a bit to assert itself as it seeks to appeal to the widest possible audience.<br/><br/>It's the conundrum so many of these types of books face as they become pop-culture juggernauts and film franchises: which elements to keep to please the fervent fans and which to toss in the name of maintaining a lean, speedy narrative? The ""Harry Potter"" and ""Hunger Games"" movies—which ""Divergent"" resembles in myriad ways—were mostly successful in finding that balance.<br/><br/>In bringing the first novel of Veronica Roth's best-selling trilogy to the screen, director Neil Burger (""Limitless"") and screenwriters Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor have included key moments and images but tweaked others to streamline the mythology and move the story along. The results can be thrilling but the film as a whole feels simultaneously overlong and emotionally truncated."
"Thrashman88","9","8","12","2 November 2014"," The Dystopian Future Is In Vogue
","I'm amazed to read most reviews here. It seems to me that most IMDb readers/users think of themselves as ""film noir"" critics, or maybe the second coming of Roger Ebert. When I watch a movie, I like being entertained. Sure, the story must be good but not necessarily plausible. If that was the case, movies like STAR WARS or even TITANIC would've been colossal failures. <br/><br/>DIVERGENT was such a movie: entertaining, teen-oriented, post- apocalyptic fun. In the not so distant future we find out that there was a terrible war. Little is said who started it or what provoked such devastating war. What it is clear is that mankind survived and made strict rules for its new society in order to ensure the peace. This new society has been classified into different personality categories, or factions: abnegation, candor, dauntless, Amity and Erudite. Each strata of this new society complements the other factions so to keep a harmonious balance. The members of this society reach a certain age (18, I guess), they go through a series of tests that will define their definite personality, regardless if they come from a different faction. This new society's motto is ""faction before blood"", so one has to be more loyal to his or her faction than to their families. Those who do not fit in any faction are called (most obviously) faction less, but they do not pose a threat to society, simply an uncomfortable burden (they are the homeless, the tramps, the scum). As the movie moves along we find out that there is another profile of people who also don't fit in, but pose a supposedly ""serious threat"" to society. These are called ""divergent"" and are to be terminated as soon as they are spotted. Divergents possess qualities of all factions, they are like a ""greatest hits"" of factions.<br/><br/>As you might guess, the movie revolves around a girl named Beatrice ""Tris"" and her finding that she is a ""divergent"" and how she must survive in a society that has no room for her kind.<br/><br/>Shades of THE HUNGER GAMES are evident all over the place. THE MATRIX too, even FLASH GORDON (1980), but all done in very good taste. I found myself enjoying DIVERGENT significantly more than THE HUNGER GAMES (at least the 1st installment), which I'd like to remind all IMDb critics is a ""light version"" of BATTLE ROYALE. We get to see Kate Winslet (TITANIC) as the baddie. It was never clear to me if she was the President or what, but she seems to be in charge of this new society. Ashley Judd and Tony Goldwyn are in there too and that's about it as far as ""names"" in this picture. All other actors are basically teens or twenty somethings, so yes, there's a strong effort from the filmmakers to attract a young audience (like THE HUNGER GAMES). <br/><br/>Anybody who's worked for a big, multi-national corporation will quickly see the similarities between the dystopian society portrayed in this movie and the company they might work for. Companies ALWAYS want to label their employees, as if we could only be ONE type of personality, so I found this intriguing. I supposed most ""Roger Eberts"" in IMDb barely perceived this. Was it a predictable movie? Most movies are, in a way. All Disney movies have happy endings, don't they? Being predictable is not a sign of being a BAD movie. I found DIVERGENT getting more interesting and interesting as frames passed by. It has good special effects and the acting is quite bearable. Trust me, I've seen far, far worse movies that end up being praised as the ultimate in cinema. <br/><br/>If you didn't like the movie, that's OK, you're entitled to think and say whatever, just as I'm entitled to say that DIVERGENT was a truly entertaining, interesting and fast paced futuristic movie. If you ask me, I enjoyed it far more than the over-blown HUNGER GAME series."

Also the romantic angle looks completely unnatural and forced.

The most idiotic part was the parents' death scene: cry like hell for the mother, don't even bother for the father. Overall, totally not impressed: uninteresting, not original, and extremely long . But I don't know what I expected actually. Maybe the books are interesting, who knows. After seeing the movie I won't read them.

"ngillylan","3","13","22","24 March 2014"," Not even close to the book
","I understand that all book-to-movie adaptations make it difficult to fit in all the elements and is impossible to portray the book word for word. I just figured the main characteristics and scenes would have been included.<br/><br/>For instance, the tall and beautiful Shailene Woodley is definitely not the small and weak Tris we imagine while reading the book. A lot of the character profiles were 'off.' However, Shailene gave an excellent portrayal of how she developed from a shy dependent girl to a confident fearless warrior.<br/><br/>The opening to the movie indicates we are in 'Chicago,' and that we are separated into the five factions because of the war. There is no explanation of why the war happened, where and who with. Just that we have the huge fence to keep each other safe and we don't know what's out there.<br/><br/>Elements were definitely rushed and lacked intensity. The characters that were not featured in this movie are revolutionary figures in the second, making it impossible to have a movie without them. Key characters were left out or barely mentioned. Uriah, Zeke, Drew, Edward, Molly & Susan don't exist in the movie. There's no relationship at all with Susan and Caleb, as they left her out. Peter's entourage is completely removed. Edward has a couple brief mentions in the movie including the capture the flag game and on the leader board. Otherwise, the entire eye stabbing scene doesn't exit. We don't see Peter for who he really is. The intensity of taunting Tris and making it difficult for her at Dauntless headquarters is glossed over. We see Peter make a name for himself when he beats Tris in the fight. Molly has barely two lines in the movie. One of the lines Molly has complimented Tris. In the book she's part of Peter's entourage and they hate each other. I find that Peter is too soft in the movie and he isn't enough of a jerk. In the book he's way more nasty.<br/><br/>Elements of the Dauntless training were not victorious as they're supposed to be. There was no focus on how vital Dauntless training is and that they do it well. There was no desperation to survive the training like there was in the book. You saw the rankings change, but the intensity in the fights and the will to survive was never built up. the Chasam scene with Christina was not intense enough. In the book the Chasam is like a waterfall with rocks below... the water beats against Christina's back making it hard for her to grip the railing. In the movie only 3 little water drops fall on her hand... really??? <br/><br/>Members of the family have the choice to visit on visiting day. This scene was replaced with Tris' mother sneaking into the Dauntless compound to be updated about her progress in the Dauntless training. She warns her about doing too well and asks her to remain in the middle of the pack. It's not revealed that the mom isn't going to visit Caleb, nor does she ask Tris to visit Caleb and ask him to find out what's in the serum.Instead, Tris on a whim visits Caleb.<br/><br/>The movie was way too focused on the romance of Tris and Four which didn't play well either. Four softens up to Tris way too easily. He's supposed to be edgy and guarded. Details about Four were supposed to be revealed in his fear landscape. This scene is so critical in the book, it's the first time we are supposed to see how vulnerable Four really is. Four never tells Tris to call him Tobias. In Tris' fear landscape, she sacrifices herself for her family. In the movie, she faces her family and the gun is aimed at them.<br/><br/>I can't even talk about the ending. It was completely changed. I might have appreciated the ending if I hadn't read the books. There were elements of the ending I quite enjoyed, but it's still very rushed. I don't understand why the scene of Tobias telling Tris he think he may be in love with her was cut out! There were quite a few memorable scenes including the aptitude test, the fear landscapes, the simulations, the tense moments Tris and Four had that were very true to the book including the capture the flag scene, as well as the zip lining experience.<br/><br/>Overall, I rate the movie as a C+. Other discrepancies include Tris taking credit with Christina after the win in the Capture the Flag scene, Will dying at the same scene as the mother (rather than in the Dauntless compound), Tris not showing her displeasure with Four and yelling at him, as well as Peter not begging for his life to be included with Tris, her dad, Caleb and Marcus. As well the initiate who jumps from the train and falls to her death, Al's crush on Tris, Four getting drunk, and overall many scenes that never showed the struggle of being that character. Near the end when the dad, Caleb, Marcus & Tris have to catch the train to the Dauntless compound, there's no struggle from any of the characters jumping on or off the train. Dad and the others jump like they have done it a million times and Caleb never complains. When they jump into the netting below, Tris asks each of them, 'you good?' 'you good?' There was a lot of odd phrases that Tris never used."

","Divergent is yet another bestselling novel I've never heard about, and part of yet another young adult trilogy, by yet another female writer (Veronica Roth) I've, again, never heard about. Also, this is yet another movie I would never have watched, had I not had to write this blog – basically because it looks awful, boring and unoriginal. Before I turn this into a rant against this newest fashion everyone seems to be crazy about, I'll talk about the movie. Divergent is probably best summed up in an anecdote: while trying to point out the difference between The Hunger Games and Divergent, the latter's director Neil Burger started explaining what it was about – and his explanation could have easily been applied to both movies. Ironically, Divergent hails individuality while being a copycat itself.<br/><br/>Divergent is set in a post-apocalyptic Chicago, where people are divided in five factions, depending on their virtues: the Erudite are smart, the Amity are kind, the Candor honest, the Dauntless brave and the Abnegation selfless. Beatrice (Shailene Woodley) and her family are Abnegation, but she and her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) have to take the aptitude test to determine which faction they truly belong to. Beatrice's results are inconclusive, she's dubbed Divergent and must keep this secret. Eventually, she chooses the Dauntless faction and starts a difficult training after which the weakest ones will be cast out and become factionless – all the while, hiding her true, Divergent nature, as Divergents are being hunt down and killed.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, Divergent didn't turn out to be as bad as I thought it would be. It might be because the director is Neil Burger, who also directed Limitless and The Illusionist, which are good movies. Also, the acting isn't bad, although, sometimes, somewhat underwhelming. This applies especially to Kate Winslet, who plays the 'bad girl' in the movie, the Erudite Jeanine – and the fact that she's bad is evident from the first moment she's on screen, just because she's cold and falsely kind. Her character isn't developed any further, she remains irritatingly perfect, as if that was enough to make a good villain. But in this case, the problem is mostly of the screenwriters – and probably the novelist, who created the interesting setting and faction system, but didn't exploit their potential fully or elaborate them enough to avoid plot holes and inconsistencies.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, the movie reminds much of The Hunger Games, but I don't see that as the movie's (or the book's) bad quality. What surprises me is that, after all those silly young adult flicks we've had and still have, people and mostly teenagers are, once again, interested in the same old story – just check out Divergent's box office results. The market is saturated and it's extremely difficult to create a new YA series that will be truly good anymore. Divergent (the movie, but I doubt the book is better, at least story-wise) isn't good: it's predictable, filled with clichés, boring, too long, unoriginal and so on. And still, the book came out and it was a success, and the movie came out and was a success, too – and this will most likely happen to all the other similar novels and movies that will be published in the future. I can only say, if you want to get rich fast, just write a teen love story, with a wannabe social commentary, not set on out planet and/or in our time, and you're guaranteed to succeed.<br/><br/>Rating: 5/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/"
"chrispybacon123","2","11","18","5 June 2014"," Wanted to love it...but I was really disappointed
","(My spoiler isn't until the very end) I don't just dislike this movie because I read the book- I really wanted to like it and was looking forward to seeing it. But yes the book was incredibly good and the movie did not do it justice at all. Even if I hadn't read the book, my opinion wouldn't change. There was no character development- leaving the audience detached from the characters. They also didn't develop any of the characters relationships - not Tris' with her fiends Christina, Will, and Al, and especially not with Four. There should have been good, emotional moments in the movie but there just weren't. <br/><br/>Normally I can get pretty emotional when it comes to movies but I am sure that if Tris and Four had just died at any point, I would not have been upset because there was no attachment thanks to the TOTAL LACK of character development. <br/><br/>I understand that they can't fit everything that happened it the book the way it happened because movies have time limits, but I think they very poorly chose what moments to include. <br/><br/>All the parts I was looking forward to were either not included or were completely devoid of emotion and intensity. <br/><br/>SPOILER: The moment when Tris has to shoot her best fiend Peter should be sad because he's her best friend- but it's not because their relationship never developed so the audience can hardly know how good of friends they were. If I hadn't read the book I'm not sure I would've even recognized who he was- even if I did it wouldn't have been an emotional moment because the audience didn't really get a chance to know his character, or any of the others for that matter."
"billygoat1071","5","20","37","21 March 2014"," Stunning Expositions
","Divergent has recently been called the next big thing. People are expecting this series to match with Harry Potter and mostly The Hunger Games. It could be just another one of those dystopian future tales that revolts against a tyrannical government, but the concept sounds a little transcendent that can somehow relate to the young adult readers. But the story itself is lacking a definite center, forcing the action to come out when it needed to without any slow burn at the ticking bomb. It's almost like any of the genre's generic films: exposition over substance. Though the exposition here is at least more than great visuals, it manages to make it all exciting despite that it generally isn't. Divergent is competent in filmmaking, but mediocre on themes.<br/><br/>The films has a decent way to introduce the world and it truly is intriguing to explore the surfaces. It's so intriguing, the actual storytelling ends up being contrived without any growth. The threat just suddenly distracts the nearly endless exposition, but what really suffers is the subtext. The film doesn't seem to be interested in snagging its thematic potential, all what this narrative is capable of is innovating. This is a common problem to the YA genre, apparently, and the momentum and conflict once again just pops up out of nowhere.<br/><br/>This underwhelming storytelling is thankfully carried by a more fascinating and delicious vision. Neil Burger creates it into larger-than-life, and they are much entertaining than what the script tries to deliver. Everything just moves briskly and makes sure that it doesn't miss a satisfying thrill. The coolest scenes are proof that these filmmakers have big ambition to the project and yet the narrative fails to justify it. The cast has also done well. Shailene Woodley and Theo James are competent enough as the heroes, and Kate Winslet somewhat elevated her villainous character.<br/><br/>Divergent could be like one of those vapid YA's such as Beautiful Creatures, Mortal Instruments, or whatever. Except this one is probably the best among since it has a craft that at least made it watchable. But then the meat is not well defined. It's frustrating because the ideas are just right there on display and you don't know where the potentials have gone. The bright side is there are more cool sequences, like the zipline ride and the wannabe parkour from a train (with the Woodkid soundtrack), than mouth sucking subplots that the genre has been iterated in years, we could use more of that. But there are bigger things to complain here, there really seems to be something far more compelling beneath the concept. So for now, we at least get a movie that has better focus to intrigue our imaginations and not teenage hormones."

I gotta admit that the books are awesome, the story is intriguing. And I cant wait to watch the movie. And then I went to theater to watch the movie. From the beginning, I have doubt about the cast. Based on the book, Tris' body should not be that big. And after the movie played, everything was falling into ashes. The casts are awful. I expect that peter would be someone who have an arrogant face, but instead.. Jainine, Kate winslet is an awful choice. Jainine should be played by Charlize Teron, or someone who have a typical face like that. And I felt that the casts are lack of chemistry. The story. Yeah I get it that it's impossible for a based-on-book-movie to have exactly same story like the book. I didn't expect that it would be this different. They ruined the whole story. Everything is changed. Its like I was watching a different movie with the same title. I came with some expectation that the movie wouldn't be as good as the book, because it always happened, but I shocked that they could for god's sake made it that awful.

"TyRawrrnosaurus","3","28","55","20 March 2014"," 'Divergent' Conforms to Uninspired Fan Service with Little Clarity
","In a very quick introduction voice over by Tris we are told that after a massive war society was broken into five factions to ensure it never happens again. Why the war happened, who it was with, and how it ended is never discussed, but at least Chicago has a large security fence as tall as a skyscraper surrounding the city to protect against a giant T-Rex or something. Planes must not be an issue either because they could easily fly over the fence, but we never see any flown; technology in this world is used for guns, digital display panels, seeing into a person's dreams, and instant tattoos, not for rebuilding a more suitable world to live in - that would be silly.<br/><br/>Tris was born within the Abnegation faction aka the just and loyal Hufflepuffs. Abegnation are the leading figures of government because of their selflessness. She lives with her mother Natalie, father Andrew, and brother Caleb who is also taking the aptitude test despite being older, which makes no sense per the rules stating 16-year-olds must take the test and choose a faction.<br/><br/>Now that Tris is 16-years-old, she must partake in a process where she is told to drink an unknown liquid to determine which clique she belongs to. Based on her results, she may find herself fitting in with Dauntless aka the courageous Gryffindors; Candor aka the ready-minded Ravenclaws; Erudite aka the cunning Slytherins; or the last group known as Amity who just farm and have no real stakes or voice in the entire film.<br/><br/>Tris' results of her aptitude test are inconclusive and discovers she is a rare breed known as Divergent. Those labeled Divergent can fit into any faction because they are capable of having more than one personality trait – explanation as to why everyone else cannot achieve the same level of basic human nature is not provided. Through a sorting hat-like process, after wasting time with an aptitude test that tells each teen which faction they should belong to, everyone is able to choose a faction, via a blood sacrifice, they'd like to shack up with for the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>Luckily for Tris, her aptitude test proctor Tori allowed her to walk away despite one line of dialogue telling us Divergents are a threat to the system. Evidence to prove Divergents are dangerous to the way of life is never explained well enough to truly justify as a threat. So Tris hides her little secret anyway and chooses Dauntless because she would not want to become factionless, a nomadic people without a home who are not accepted into any of the five factions – doesn't that make them Divergent? While spending almost an hour through a rigorous training regime to prove to us she is the one, we are introduced to a love interest named Four (Theo James). Four is the eye candy until the main conflict presents itself almost two-thirds of the way into the movie; the Erudites want to overthrow Abnegation as the leaders because selflessness is too weak and not logical. Heaven forbid anyone should be able to think beyond their means.<br/><br/>With a taxing two hour and twenty minute run time, Divergent is a complete clunker. The real grit of the story doesn't begin until well over an hour in and it isn't until the last thirty minutes that some kind of resolve needs to happen. Since I haven't read the book, I'm not sure if it is Roth's lack of imagination or the screenwriters Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor's failure to bring the book to life, but Divergent is absolutely devoid of any kind of world building to make this film stand out besides its loony way of assigning factions to its citizens. They even use the Chicago's L transit system to ride into Hogwarts, I mean Dauntless.<br/><br/>Strangely, there seems to be no adults anywhere unless they play a small role in the plot, and yet there are so many kids running around. The bulk of the movie is focused on these kids and their plight to fit into Dauntless. Tris and Four's parents become a convoluted piece of the puzzle near the final act, adding little relevance, clarity, emotional depth, or importance. Janine, an Erudite and President Snow rip-off, is one of the few adults we get to know and acts as the main antagonist, posing as a faceless, unmotivated, and irrational villain.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Woodley and James are able to have enough chemistry on screen to provide some redeeming qualities. Another case of beautiful people falling for beautiful people. Without Woodley, Divergent could not stand a chance. There is also a Ron Weasley-esque sidekick for Tris named Christina as well as a Neville-esque boy named Will.<br/><br/>Visually unimpressive with an uninspiring score that does nothing to better the film's lack of a personality, Divergent struggles even on a superficial level. Even a larger budget than most YA adaptations can't set it apart from the rest. Sets do not feel lived in and the different factions are hardly explored, making the world even more unbelievable than it already is.<br/><br/>Themes of discovering who you are, understanding your place in the world, and standing up for yourself are practically force fed, but in the final third of the film the moral teachings diminish and Divergent transforms into a popcorn action flick. Burger tries to materialize high concepts of freewill, totalitarianism, and the human condition, but misses the mark by focusing more on the romance and action than answering the bigger questions.<br/><br/>Divergent is simple fan service at its best; it even ends so abruptly that no ramifications of Erudite's actions, Tris' Rebellion, or Dauntless' coup d'etat are mentioned. Anyone going into this movie without having read the books is going to end up confused or annoyed by the sheer lack of coherence."

I was hooked !<br/><br/>I went to see the movie, and well. It's another Twilight, really. The pace is really slow, it all centers around an uninteresting love story, 100% predictable. The dystopian society don't make sense, and is pretty ridiculous : like hell people would live in 5 groups, mingle everyday, and be satisfied with the situation for 100 years.<br/><br/>WARNING : SPOILER ALERT And come on, who says ""I don't want to go too fast"" after their first kiss ?<br/><br/>Anyway, if you want a predictable movie, with cheesy dialog, really slow pace, boring love story and such, this movie is for you.<br/><br/>I still rated it 3 stars, because to be honest, I laughed a lot trying to predict was what gonna happen next, and succeeding all the time.<br/><br/>(Some people will probably say ""but, it's an adaptation from a book, so it's normal"", but then I'd replay : ""there are thousands of books around here that deserve a movie adaptation, why pick this one?"""

As young adults, they got to chose which one they want to join. Surprise surprise, we find ""divergents"", people that don't fit into the system and are threatening its existence. They are chased and killed in a totalitarian system. Sounds familiar? I hope so, otherwise you have missed lots of movies in the last decades. The last one I have seen was ""Upside Down"", and it wasn't a great movie either, but it is so much better. And it has only a score of 6.4, I just really don't understand that.<br/><br/>There's really not much to say about the movie itself.

","""I don't want to be one thing, I want to be good, honest, & kind."" It is here. Like kids waiting for cookies in the oven. The moment of truth has come. From the beloved book by Veronica Roth, Hollywood has their grasp on this baby, diaper inside out. So how was it?<br/><br/>I always wanted to see a 60s, 70s stylized sci-fi, Pink Floyd inspired. Unfortunately, the style nowadays settles with fake, eye-rolling & desensitizing teen material, separating young people's appreciation with good cinema for this. So where does Divergent fit in? Come on, where doesn't it? This is the epitome of modern-day, 3-week cinematic hit, & forgotten two star snore on a Sunday afternoon 2 years from release on Shaw. Yeah, the acting, the story, & the vision here is flat all around. These actors will get their fame & clinch a lifetime spotlight in Young People's magazine, & TMZ laughs. So it's another wretched teen blockbuster. The look of this dread, it's disgusting & destroys my palette. <br/><br/>I believe a Juno-quirky teenage styled flick, fused with an intense sci-fi is an interesting conception. However, the game plan & execution results show. Now Imagine a Rainbow, Pull-n-peel licorice, if each peel was a different color & was pre-pealed, & each peal defined a film genre, you'd have the layout for Divergent. <br/><br/>It's not free nor comfortable. To satisfy hormone-confused teens, they heavily coat it with held-back character interactions & motivations, never reaching or exploring above or below the norm. Maintaining teen-equilibrium content of an awkward nature, which in itself is awkward, with one somehow managing to free themselves & enjoy that in an unbelievably grand fantasy universe as it's backdrop. Tis unmixed, left to dry. Too afraid of doing or even trying. It remains a scattered vision not knowing what it is, forgetting what it is, & leaving asking the critic's swear word: why?<br/><br/>There's a big twist. I read the book, & it is a rhythmically flowing experience filled with page-turning thrills and emotion. The film, which many passion-lacking productions exploit easily, breaks down the story to so many different visions, it's as if several directors manhandled the project. The story was compromised in the process. Nothing was clear nor soothing or enduring. Every 5 minutes I felt I needed to re-engage myself because the music went off the page too often to care.<br/><br/>It is on the verge of a Broken Picture. Maybe that's the vision, a new revolution in cinema we are yet to settle with. Maybe this picture is ingenious in every way. You'll have to go see for yourself, if you dare to tread such sociopathic material. Be my follower, Diver."

","I'm a huge fan of the books. The psychological angst and inner fight that Tris has to fight with and against. How she want, but cant, conform into the norm of society. How she, a little girl, is hated and despised for something she has no influence over. The books have so many layers of meaning that I sometimes marvel at it. <br/><br/>Now to the movie. I tried to watch it as a movie, not a adaption, and think I did fairly well. Yet there are a few (or many) things that really bothered me. The lack of chemistry between the lead actors. The acting in general wasn't very good except for Kate Winslet and Shailene Woodley who delivered with what they got. Yet, I am marveled over how plan, dull and one dimensional the film was. I never felt anything about the inner struggle of Tris or the psychological terror that the environment is filled up with. <br/><br/>Divergent is a inconsistent tale that some will enjoy for the same reasons they enjoy Twilight (which I still haven't figured out how one can). The only reason I'm giving it a 5 instead of a 4 is due to Winslet and her performance. Even though her character (that is one of the most complex and sophisticated antagonist I've ever read about)is made into the classical villain with megalomania."
"ptom3","9","61","134","22 March 2014"," Movie Review: Divergent
","I suppose this will be as much a book review as it is a movie review. I went with a group of friends and saw Divergent yesterday morning. The Pg-13 film was 139 minutes long. I will start my review by saying it was over in the blink of an eye and left me wanting so much more.<br/><br/>Prior to the release, critics blasted the film. It received an average 3.5 out of a possible 10 Stars on I.M.D.B. This made me apprehensive. Critics also kept comparing Veronica Roth and her novels to Suzanne Collins and The Hunger Games. Scathing reviews said that Divergent was nowhere near as equally riveting as The Hunger Games. <br/><br/>The stories are nothing alike. The only similarities I saw come from a strong female teen lead character. Is Katniss anything like Beatrice (Tris)? I suppose, but she is also completely different; motivated by a unique set of circumstances. No. I change my mind. Other than both being female, and teens, and the main characters of their own trilogies -- there are no other similarities. (Do not get me wrong. I enjoyed The Hunger Game books, and so far, the movies. I am just missing the point as to why the two sets of books/movies are being compared. There isn't one. And they shouldn't be).<br/><br/>Personally, if you have not read the book Divergent and see the movie, I suspect the movie will be complicated. Not un-followable, just complicated. The plot is not simplistic despite being geared toward teens. I do know several people who have since seen the movie without having read the book and enjoyed the film just the same. Anyway . . .<br/><br/>Set in a futuristic Chicago, a community is enclosed behind an electrified fence. The community is split into 5 Factions to keep things running smoothly. The intelligent faction is known as the Erudite; the honest, Candor. The peaceful people are known as Amity, and the brave, Dauntless. The selfless faction, the one Beatrice belongs to, is Abnegation. One is born and raised in the faction of their parents. On your sixteenth birthday, teens undergo a test to see which faction they actual belong in. Regardless, a person can pick to be in any of the other four factions, or stay in the faction they were raised in. <br/><br/>When a teen chooses to leave the faction they were raised in, it is upsetting. They must say goodbye to their family. There is a good chance they will never see them again. And if you fail in your knew chosen faction, you can not return home. You become what is actually the 6th faction. The Factionless -- those who don't belong to any faction, and live like the homeless, scavenging for food, and clothing, and shelter. . .<br/><br/>Beatrice's test results are inconclusive. They do not point to any one faction. Instead, they point to them all. She is what the government calls, Divergent. This is dangerous. Divergent do not think like anyone else, and therefore are a threat. Forced to keep the test results a secret, Beatrice must pick where she feels she best belongs.<br/><br/>Abnegation has always been in charge of the local government because they are selfless and can therefore be trusted with politics. Beatrice discovers a plot by the Amity to overthrow the Abnegation. Chemical injections given to Dauntless will leave their minds susceptible to suggestion, making them dangerous and unstoppable --since the Dauntless train to be warriors, the police of the nation, the protectors of all.<br/><br/>The movie is constantly compelling. The time flies. Beatrice (Tris) is played by Shailene Woodley. Never heard of her before. She nailed the role of Tris. (She reminded me of a young Tatum O'Neal. The way she talked. Something about her eyes, too. (The Fault in Our Stars will be released later this year, starring Woodley, as well). With forthcoming releases of Insurgent and Allegiant, she will surely be a star to watch.<br/><br/>Theo James portrays Four. He also someone I have never heard of prior. At first, he was not what I pictured when reading the novel. Seemed a little too old. However, as the movie progressed, I think I saw what casting directors picked up on during auditions. He was Four. No way around it.<br/><br/>While directed by Neil Burger, written by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor, Roth did not give up her creative input. She also helped write, and co-produce the film. Good for her. Although some story elements from the novel are missing, overall the movie stayed mostly true and on point. <br/><br/>Compelling and action-packed, great acting, and some intense scenes (yeah, I jumped once or twice), I found Divergent so entertaining. I cannot wait for the next in this bound to be popular trilogy. <br/><br/>Phillip Tomasso Author of The Vaccination Trilogy www.philliptomasso.com"

The premise was interesting enough, the direction and styling effective, the movie's story world construction well-executed, the story-telling and pacing engaging, the acting performance by the two leads and Winslet and Maggie Q well-balanced, believable and non-jarring, the resolution was convincing enough... <br/><br/>So what's up with the 40%/ 4 stars hysteria among the pro critics? I have my theories...<br/><br/>In general movies get anywhere between 1:1, 1:2, or 2:1 audience love it VS critic love it ratio. This one got 2:1. Which means, the film not only hit the right note with a progressive crowd, it also diverged greatly from an unspoken dogma. 40% pro critic here and elsewhere, wow, obviously Divergent hit a sensitive nerve with the film industry's Erudite equivalent. It seems, Divergent the movie is itself a divergent in its own context, a potentially uncontrollable menace to a rigid, retentive, non-divergent, evidently HOMOGENEOUS English language film critic culture...<br/><br/>But in this case, I'd go by the Audience's score. For starters, a 1000000X larger sampling size is always more objective than a few hundred homogeneous Erudites. <br/><br/>My rule is, movies with 1:1 audience:critic ratio, the rating is most objective. 1:2, the truth is somewhere in between. But if it's 2:1, the critics are upset about some game-changing ""threats"", and the truth leans strongly toward the audience. Works for me anyway... I call this the AUCRIT Ratio. Feel free to test it yourself. <br/><br/>Onto Divergent...<br/><br/>I've never read the book. I do keep my expectations on neutral when watching a mainstream big-concept film - especially yet another adapted post-apocalyptic science fiction targeting young adults.<br/><br/>Those who expect futuristic science fictions to have primarily male leading characters esp in power positions, invincible biological strength, brute force solution, outcomes determined by technology especially Very Cool Weapons, non-stop magical actions, hot sexy androids and fetish costumes will be disappointed. <br/><br/>Those who *demand* award-winning plot and ""logical"" science in futuristic fiction movies are just being hysterical, for they tend not to notice the fantastical magic, bad physics and overkill tech in their ""serious classic"" science fictions - from star trek, star wars, 2010, batman to iron man are equally full of gaping logical holes, mostly with no award-winning plot-craft.<br/><br/>Truth is, ""hard"" science is evolving constantly, and science fiction flicks are not made to be 100% accurate or to win awards (if so Blade Runner still wins today), but to explore possibilities in highly-compressed scenarios, to inspire, to enlighten, and foremost, to entertain.<br/><br/>In today's myopic, easily self-satisfied world which classifies and judges people by preconceived notions about ethnicity, gender, profession, appearance, merits, we are constantly divided by rigid specialization, subjective education qualification rules, redundant scientific dogmas, simplistic morality yardsticks, always under pressure to choose factions: With-Us-Or-Them, for or anti welfare/ abortion, JLaw-vs-Hathaway, Pepsi or Coke, the in-betweens be damned.<br/><br/>Identity by Tribe (and inevitably the side-effect of xenophobia and authoritarianism) is a timely topic, how The Power That Be and their obedient citizenry react to the exceptional, multi-talented, multifaceted generalists who dare to defy categorization.<br/><br/>And this is no Twilight. More Hunger Games meet Enders Game. Definitely gender-neutral in appeal, at least among under 30's. Not everything with strong female lead written by female authors equates Hunger Games or Twilight or Harry Porter. Some ancient mindsets need to get used to the brave new world with the other half of the human population, women, being visible half of the time.<br/><br/>The lead actors also defy categorization in their own way. Here's yet another hot young male lead who has brain and brawn and talent and emotional depth all rolled into one person...yet another intelligent and talented and cute young female lead who doesn't over-groom herself nor perpetually pout nor seem like she's out to please everyone or martyr herself. Does the world need more unaffected chicks and unassuming hunks? Of course, there's never enough of those on screen.<br/><br/>Divergent may not be The Matrix or Inception grade, but why should it be. I was definitely engaged and entertained. Good enough for me."
"Samuel-johnson1090","4","13","23","27 April 2014"," Disappointing if you've read the book, dull if you haven't.
","Recently went to see this movie, having been a big fan of the book. Dystopian stories are something I find fascinating. That being said, this is very reminiscent of a futuristic version of Hunger Games. Strong female protagonist from a group not looked upon highly. Said protagonist takes a huge chance, which in The Hunger Games eventually leads to her fighting corrupt government...not a spoiler, because I'm not saying anything about Divergent. If it's the exact same plot that's not my fault.<br/><br/>And nothing is wrong with them having extremely similar plots. It's how the directors go about it. The grit and grunge of a dystopian world can be done well. This movie, however, did not do so. Many of the darker instances of the book that help truly develop the characters lack intensity in the movie, if they're in at all. The dialog is stilted; it's how many people write their first story. ""Instead of me writing what's happening and why, I'll just have my characters blatantly say it.""<br/><br/>The only thing that gives this movie any saving grace are the actors portraying these roles. You hate the bad ones, you love the good ones. Their acting cannot save the dialog. Or story. Or set design. Or the soundtrack many other reviewers have been raving about. If you want the soundtrack just go buy an Elie Goulding CD.<br/><br/>On the whole, not worth seeing in theaters. It's an entertaining plot that is toned down for mass appeal. Too much is shoved in. There are many scenes that should be shortened, and a select few that should be lengthened. <br/><br/>If you read the books, you'll enjoy the movie. If you're under the age of 15. Even then, you'll be noticing the disappointment in Woodley's eyes as she realizes this film is mediocre at best. It seems like a young Veronica Roth got excited to see her name on the big screen and gladly sold out to make a relatively family friendly movie, following the teenage rebellion girl trend, despite the fact that the entire concept of the book is that Tris is different."

"batista_fan","1","13","23","27 March 2014"," Another failed adaptation... *Sigh*
","Last year, book to movie adaptations were very hit and miss. The Mortal Instruments City of Bones was an example of an absolute terrible adaptation. Completely butchered, over adapted to the point were it's like a parody of the source material. I'm not a purist, but it was simply down right sad. Nothing like the book. Then I saw Catching Fire which was an example of a near perfect book to movie adaptation. Characters nailed it, not over adapted, and properly paced. This movie Divergent however was exactly like The Mortal Instruments movie. As someone who read the books, this adaptation was an absolute embarrassment. <br/><br/>One: This movie was over adapted! Too many important, meaningful scenes and components from the books were cut out, leaving us a Hollywood wrecked, cobbled together pretender of the book. <br/><br/>Two: The evil characters were not evil. Plus an added bonus, most of them were devoid of character development Peter wasn't evil, he barely got any screen time! And his entourage of sociopaths, who oppressed and tried to kill Tris in the book were done terribly. Molly had two lines during the entirety of the film, and one was complimenting Tris! Drew was the worst, he was non-existent in the film. No screen time for him. And Eric, totally a one dimensional character. Lack any emotion or character development or even a reason for him to even exist in the story! <br/><br/>Three: There was little to no conflict in this movie for the protagonist Tris. Without conflict, there is no narrative, no plot progression, and ultimately no entertainment value. Things were resolved so easy in the movie it was ridiculous. Tris is told she has failed initiation; which never happened in the books, and she just stays against orders of her superiors without complaint. What? Not plausible by any means. <br/><br/>They should just cancel the squeal because there's no talent, evident of this movie. <br/><br/>1/10"

","I went to see this movie yesterday with two good friends of mine. One of them had read the book with me, while the other one had not. The entire movie was brutal to sit through for all of us. Those who had read the book were severely angry over the lack of context, events, and even characters that Veronica Roth's novel contained. Those who hadn't read the book sat there confused at some points, and bored at others. The lack of Tris and Four's developing relationship made it sudden and awkward, very far from the book's snowball of romantic events. The acting was also extremely bland, and a lot of the characters did not develop enough to form a connection with the audience.<br/><br/>I do not foresee any other movies being made from this series. It's impossible! The characters that were not featured in this movie are revolutionary figures in the second, making it impossible to have a movie without them. Do not go see this move, please. Do yourself a favor and read the book, it is much better."
"greedydrunk","4","12","21","23 March 2014"," Probably not for adults of either gender.
","First I want to say I have no problem with a female protagonist, there have been quite a few movies like that lately and I have watched and enjoyed several. I do though notice how willingly the book/movie writers deviate from strong women characters to ""isn't it great to have a boyfriend"" characters. I assume this is for the younger audience who haven't had their idealism beaten down by the actual dating world. <br/><br/>So lets get to the good and bad points of this movie:<br/><br/><ul><li>The relationship pacing in this movie was good. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The faction idea is awful, people in factions grow to distrust other factions, its human nature (think of how countries distrust each other, religions and even different high schools in the same city or cliques in the same high school).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The idea of the factionless is awful, so now you have a group your are actively oppressing, yup that wont cause problems.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>So they don't allow divergence but they don't check for it until you are a certain age and then they just kill you? And no one seems to have a problem with that?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dauntless are taught to be brave though taking huge risks and possibly suffering death and are constantly chastised for either being a coward or too reckless, which one is it? Think of the knife throwing scene or the zip line scene or the initial jump into darkness.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Reckless soldiers are bad soldiers, think of the armed forces in your country, they are nothing like these guys yet they are tasked with the same job.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>They seem to have a few types of guns, most of them silly looking but they don't have any other type of weapons which I thought was odd.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I assume the factionless can have children, can they join a faction? If not then they are going to start multiplying. The dauntless are going to really cause a problem here by throwing out semi trained young men and women who can reproduce and have military training.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why does that train seem to be wherever they need it to be? and does anyone else besides Dauntless ride it?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>""Why does everyone keep saying that to me?"" BANG! I laughed at that.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Chances are that people in different factions are going to fall in love with each other, they seem to be in close proximity enough for that to happen, how is that dealt with? What if a baby comes of that?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Mind control drug works on the soldiers for hours yet works on the old lady for like 5 minutes just so they can have a scene where she realizes what she has done. Also who wouldn't have backups?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I might have missed this but where are your skilled labourers falling under? Like your electricians or computer engineers etc. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>What purpose is there for having all that mind control drug in the control center?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Son meets father that beat him which results in half a second of awkwardness then its over.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tris wants to take it slow which I think is a good message for younger women, I didn't realize from the movie alone that this was only because she has intimacy problems.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Faction over blood: NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN, can you imagine siding with the people you picked carrots with over your family?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Four turns down a promotion to leadership twice but appears to have the same job as Eric in leadership any ways.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There is a relationship between Tris and the Old lady where she seems to think that Tris is special, Tris does get a lot more attention than anyone else does from this woman yet that comes to nothing. </li></ul><br/><br/>Seriously I could go on and on and on but these things killed my ability to suspend disbelief like I was able to do for Hunger games, and when you cant suspend disbelief those two and a half hours that this movie is really really drags on (sort of like this review)."
"tegan-rayne23","1","16","30","4 July 2014"," The movie is never as good as the book, this movie proves it.
","I am normally a movie person, but the book to this changed my mind. I couldn't put it down, I found myself getting lost in the story as if it was happening around me. I half wanted to see the movie and half did not, because I knew it would not be exactly the same as book. I was hoping that there wouldn't be a lot of significant changes to the story line. I felt that the casting was not thought out, a 30 year old Theo James playing an 18 year old, who is in a relationship with 22 year old Shailene playing an 18 year old Tris. Just looking at the two you can see that there is a large age difference but what makes the casting worse is that they don't have any on-screen chemistry. Many parts of the book that I thought were important were left out, starting with parts like the Aptitude test. Tori had to alter the simulation to put Tris in the bus because of her actions in the first part of the simulation she had only ruled out Amity. In the movie, she only goes through the knife choice and dog simulation. If the full part was in the movie it would explain a lot more.<br/><br/>Tori's attitude in the movie seems quite hostile where as the way that I read the scene was that she was concerned for Beatrice's wellbeing. Many scenes were completely different from the book. In the book during initiation there is a Family day where family members have the choice of visiting their children if they have transferred factions. In the movie this does not happen. Tris' mum sneaks in and speaks to her in secret. Through-out the movie Tris has to encounter Jeanine first at the choosing ceremony and then in the Dauntless compound, while she's walking through the halls and other times like when she is doing her final assessment. This does not happen in the book. Most of the movies attack simulation scenes differ from the book. When the Dauntless soldiers take Tris and Tobias to Jeanine in her office, they argue about the need to create a new serum to control the Divergent. Tobias lunges at Jeanine. The Dauntless soldiers stop Tobias while Jeanine injects him with the new serum. The new serum is created to manipulate minds, and it does, Tobias reaches for Tris and strangles her. After the guards separated them, Jeanine sends Tobias off to guard the control room and sends Tris for her execution. Tris wakes up in a glass tank, after being hit over the head, which is where her mum saves her from just before she drowns. In the movie they take the couple to Jeanine but it doesn't seem like they are in her office, more like a filing room. There is a struggle and Tobias does lunge at Jeanine but he Jeanine just says to the guards to bring Tobias with them and to get rid of Tris. Tris is taken outside and made to kneel, which is when her mum saves her. <br/><br/>In the book when Tris gets to the control room she finds Tobias on his own. She battles him, it takes her a while but she realises that she needs to fight the simulation because she will not win against him. By surrendering to him something in his brain clicked and he could see Tris. They stop the simulation and remove the simulation data. In the movie Tris finds Tobias tied to a seat, watching the screens which show the attack on the city, Erudite walking around, Dauntless soldiers on guard. He had been injected with the new serum, so when Tris set him free he attacked her. This is when they begin to battle, she does come to the same conclusion as the book, but in the movie Jeanine is in the control room amongst the other Erudite. Once Tobias came out of his manipulated state, he and Tris fight the soldiers in the room together. Jeanine runs to the computers to make sure the simulation is running accordingly, and Tris throws her knife into Jeanine's hand pinning it to the computer. Tris demands that Jeanine stop the simulation, but Jeanine refused. Tris thinking as fast as she can to stop Jeanine, see's a syringe and a vile of the simulation serum. Tobias grabs it and chucks it to Tris, which she uses to inject Jeanine. Once injected, Tris ordered her to shut the simulation down, which she did. The book contained a lot of dialogue which haven't been transferred to the movie, which removes context. In the book Four shouts at Tris while he is throwing knives at her head, the dialogue is simple but effective. This frustrates Tris and makes her more determined. As everyone else leaves the room Four tries to ask if Tris is OK, but she just shouts at him about the taunting, he tries to hint to Tris that he is being tough on her because he cares for her. In the movie, there's not a lot of conversation. Four doesn't say much to Tris while doing this, but he does ask Eric a question. When everyone leaves, Tris yells at him but unlike the book Tobias turns the conversation around to say that Eric wouldn't have let him stop if he hadn't have hurt her. In the book when Peter is being beaten in the initiation rankings by Edward, Peter stabs Edward in the eye with a butter knife. In the movie there is no mention of this, which I think is a mistake because he returns in the next movie. I wish I could re-write, re-cast this entire movie so that it was more like the book."

The plot is not original, the actors are average, the effects both visual and audio below average, the action sucks pretty much, why should this movie get more that a 6? Teens choosing a different path from their parents one, how original. Getting tattoos, how daring. Playing capture the flag with some drug- paint-ball weapons... I could go on for long, but not as long as the movie did: 140 min of teens doing teens stuff.

","It's a kids' movie. As my wife and I left the theater an 8-year-old behind us said he'd seen it three times. We could barely get through one showing. It's so bad that we broke into laughter at some of the silly, stereotypical dialog and predictable plot elements. Kate Winslet walks through her part as though she'd been blackmailed into appearing. Kafka it is not. Not even close. It is obviously derivative of Hunger Games and does not even pretend to be the morality play or political satire that some seem to think it represents. The closest it comes to a ""genre"" is a Hong Kong martial arts film, but most of those are better. None of the characters act or react like real people. It's not good science fiction, not good fiction of any other kind."
"MrILoveTheAnts","4","10","17","22 March 2014"," It's a better love story than Twilight, but not as good as Hunger Games.
","""Die A Virgin"" is the story of a girl trying to find her place in the world. But the factions want her dead for some reason or other, I think it's because she's can lucid dream while doing acid. It's not very well explained.<br/><br/>For $80,000+ million dollars this movie actually looks really good. It's a nice semi-original looking world, like a mix of ""I Am Legend,"" with ""Aeon Flux."" All of the exterior shots were great, but interiors really needed some work. I don't think they could afford chairs or feature really. There's a lot of people in mono-colored rooms all wearing the same colored cloths. All the guns, whether they're the training guns, the real guns, or the future guns, all make the same fake zappy sound effect that make people just want to lay on the ground regardless of where they got shot. This removes the emotional impact to the audience has when someone actually gets shot so when people die it's like nothing happened at all. Actually the lead girl gets shot in the leg in one scene and is up and about running in the next. The hand to hand combat is nice but then there are these flat shootouts where people are just hiding behind cover, shooting at one another. These shootouts lack the creativity of a good action movie.<br/><br/>Her parents are throw away characters who show up for these bland shoot outs and ...<br/><br/>*** Spoilers *** ... die almost immediately. Shailene Woodley is a decent lead and does a good job of acting when her mother dies, but because this is just a women that might as well just have a name tag that says ""MOM"" on it, I just didn't care. They needed a tender moment or two to establish what this women actually meant to Tris, a little thing she did as a child, or something with her hair, a saying or something that becomes her last words, Something! She has a tattoo I think so that's something but not exactly the same as being the women who put a flower in her hair when she was young. It doesn't help that she's wearing gray for the entire movie either! They're just bland characters that get shot and I really think it's just to spice up these shootouts? So the end of the movie happens and they kill all the people in the room except for Kate Winslet's character. And they forget to kill her on the way out, I'm guessing because they need to make two squeals out of this piece of crap. This is the women who basically started a war and orchestrated the mass genocide of Tris's family and faction. I really wished this movie had the balls to have Tris grab her by the hair, drag her out into the street, and effing execute her for her crimes against humanity... but nope, we have to complete this lack luster 90 minute love story between Tris and Four. She has to say things like ""Both my parents died today,"" apparently without any tears coming out of her eyes either! They have to flee the city on this run away train no one seems to be driving for some reason or other too."

","Divergent is an entertaining movie to sit and enjoy, that's for damn sure, it was actually better than what my expectations preceded. Shailene Woodley shines in her staring role as Beatrice, and Theo James is so perfect for his co staring role as Four. My absolute favorite actor here though is hands down Kate Winslet, she is so focused, determined, and unapologetically devoted to her maniacal plot, and it's obvious that she gave it her all the entire way through. The costume design is wonderfully constructed, especially for the Elite characters like Winslet. And the set direction is awesome to look at, very well put together. The action sequences are pretty standard PG-13 action movie material, not meaning that in a bad way, just saying you know what you're getting when it comes to that specific issue. The plot is very intriguing and it will for sure keep you interested and wanting more. Ashley Judd is great to see on screen here as well, a very noble addition to the well rounded cast, she is caring, adventurous and warm hearted in her motherly role to Beatrice. I really loved the dialogue back and forth between the characters too, very intelligent and witty. I cannot wait to sit and watch Insurgent, and then Allegiant, crossing my fingers in hopes they will prove themselves worthy, like this first installment did. An 8/10 for Divergent!"
"iconic-sr","7","5","7","20 September 2014"," Another Film Adaptation
","Brief Overview: Divergent is a movie based off the book by Veronica Roth also titled, ""Divergent."" I am going to start off by saying that I did enjoy this film, but there were a lot of bland moments and plot points that were covered in similar movies.<br/><br/>The Positives: One thing that I really enjoyed was how well the movie stayed true to the book, starting with the cast. Shailene Woodley plays the leading role Tris, who is an awkward and remote teenage girl living in a futuristic society divided into factions. Woodley has also in the 2014 release, ""A Fault in Our Stars"" which has been met with positive reviews. She was also scheduled to play Mary Jane in the 2014, ""The Amazing Spider Man 2,"" but her scenes were removed from the final cut (and for Spider Man fans, she may return for the third installment, maybe). What I liked about Shailene's portrayal is that she does do a good job playing a plain personality, and just being plain in general. She was definitely not going to win a beauty contest when this movie was shot (which may be a problem for some), but that is the way she is supposed to be. The book makes important notes that her appearance does not stand out and she is somewhat of an outcast. Moving on to other performances, Theo James plays the role of one of her faction leaders, also known as ""Four."" He also lives up to his novel counterpart by giving the vibe that he lives on a completely different planet with virtually no tolerance. Another positive aspect is the chemistry between Tris and Four which really makes the movie stand out.<br/><br/>The Negatives: In many ways, this film feels like a branch off of ""The Hunger Games."" Just watching the scenery, action, and the way the camera is handled gives me some Deja Vu. Also a lot of the character traits for the protagonist are strikingly similar. On a different note, ""Divergent"" lacks the ""explosiveness"" required to keep full attention of the general audience. I just feel that the script was slightly under par and maybe even disappointing for all the potential this franchise has.<br/><br/>The Conclusion: I gave this film an overall rating of 7/10. I think this film would be more satisfying if you have previously read the book, but it is by no means a bad movie if you haven't. I recommend this film for most viewers."

"nina_xue","6","8","13","10 April 2014"," Divergent - Just another Hunger Games?
","For those who haven't read the Divergent series by Veronica Roth, you might be wondering about all the similarities between this film and The Hunger Games – both set in a dystopian future with a very powerful 'state' controlling every aspect of life, society divided up into a number of classes and a fearless lead female who's willing to fight and take on the State. Well, you would have wondered right. But having said that, The Hunger Games turned into a massive box office success for a reason and if it ain't broke don't fix it right?<br/><br/>I found the concept quite fascinating – society is divided into 5 different factions based on their personality traits. But, as expected with teenage fiction, it was a little too oversimplified for my liking. Another issue I had with the faction system was the overlap between Abnegation and Amity, as they both value kindness, peacefulness and forgiveness as their core life principles. So isn't Amity just a less extreme version of Abnegation, disguised as a bunch of barefoot hippies?<br/><br/>But much in the way that The Hunger Games made us all wish we were the archery- extraordinaire brave enough to volunteer ourselves as tribute to save our doe-eyed younger sister alongside the boy who threw bread at us, there are also many qualities that are admirable in Tris. Perhaps a major difference between her and Katniss was the fact that Tris rejected the selfless values she was brought up with in favour of her true identity as Dauntless. At the heart of the film is a story about identity and having the courage to stay true to yourself. In that sense, while almost everyone could relate to the bravery and sacrifice in The Hunger Games, Divergent is targeted at a slightly younger age group.<br/><br/>All in all, this was an entertaining film but don't try to read too much into the story. Staying quite true to the novel (although not as closely as The Hunger Games), the film in my opinion even improves on some aspects of the book. For example the final confrontation between Tris and Jeanine (Kate Winslet) flowed more smoothly than the scenes described in the novel.<br/><br/>Shailene Woodley brought an added dimension of vulnerability in Tris, and there is just something fascinating about her that really makes you pay attention when she's on the screen. And Kate Winslet was excellent as always in bringing cold and calculating Jeanine to life.<br/><br/>IMDb: 7.6/10<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes: 40% <br/><br/>(From projectreel: http://projectreel.wordpress.com)"

","I haven't read the book, so I didn't go into the movie hall with a lot of expectations (except the IMDb rating of 7.5). I don't see how that could have made a difference though. I'll try to summarize this movie in a sentence : ""Its a really low budget book adaptation which could only cater to children as its primary audience, and even they would change the channel if it were on TV"". The Premise I daresay was decent enough for an engaging Sci Fi movie, but this falls flat on its face so hard it broke its jaw and nose within the first 15 minutes. A good lead actress in a shoddy plot/screenplay, crawling along at a horrible pace with no direction whatsoever. Please avoid this movie, even when it ends up on Cable in a month or so. Im amazed so many people gave it a good rating. This saddens me, because I cannot trust IMDb ratings anymore after this movie."
"NicholasWSnyder","6","6","9","10 April 2014"," Imaginative, but misguided dystopian adaptation
","If you see this because of Shailene Woodley, you have chosen the wrong film. She's a better actor than this. You have to give her credit for stepping outside of her comfort zone, but she's not Jennifer Lawrence here. I believe she has the acting chops to get there, but this film might have been attempting too soon for her. <br/><br/>The movie tries to do a lot. Too much. An adaption of a huge dystopian world, a social commentary on class structures, a coming-of-age ""I'm different than most people but that's OK""-type story, and a boot-camp movie. There are some moments that are done very confidently and others that are not. The confident moments are the feel-good little victories, the action set pieces are excellent, the combat, the special FX, dystopian Chicago is very cool, and some of the acting is very good. Although I will say, the casting is better than the acting. The writing and acting are probably the least confident elements to this film<br/><br/>As with many sci-fi and fantasy movies, the directors often focus on the cool or epic before performance and character. Or there's just too many things to think about and too little time to shoot that you have no choice. Either way, these characters were not as deep as they could have been. But you want them to be and that's what was frustrating.<br/><br/>Divergent also suffers from the classic case of adapting but forgetting the essence of the book. It wasn't quite sure what it was, where it lies, who it is, why it exists. It feels like a producer's movie - let's buy the rights to a book, throw some up-and-coming stars on-board, and market it like the Hunger Games sorta, but not fully. But in the producer's book, it was a minor success, as it is making money. So success there. <br/><br/>At any rate, I love this genre and I love original stories and adaptations. I wanted this to be good, but it just doesn't go there. I'm glad it's doing OK because that means more original-ish content will continue to be made. <br/><br/>And to Shailene Woodley, props for trying something new. But for now, stick to the Fault in Our Stars."
"lee_eisenberg","2","7","11","24 July 2015"," You really want me to like this ""Hunger Games"" knockoff, don't you?
","Picture this: a post-apocalyptic closed society maintains a series of social strata, but then one young person doesn't conform. Sounds like ""The Hunger Games"", doesn't it? Well, ""Divergent"" also uses this story. I had never heard of this series before the first movie got released. Having seen the movie, I can only conclude that they simply used the idea behind ""The Hunger Games"" and added a bit of Harry Potter (the serum-induced psychological test to determine a person's faction reminded me of the Sorting Hat).<br/><br/>So, this franchise doesn't come across as anything original. I wish that someone would film Kim Stanley Robinson's ""Years of Rice and Salt""."

","I didn't expect much but this movie still managed to underwhelm me. It doesn't contain a single original idea... None at all. Totally boring, predictable, dumb, and even the basic premise of the story is unconvincing to start with. This system with the 5 castes would not ensure any greater stability for society than the system we currently have. Even on a theoretical level, it would solve no problems and there is no logic behind it. They want people to rigidly adhere to a one-dimensional category (I'm smart, I'm considerate, I'm fierce, I'm honest, etc.) and they even assign castes for them but then they allow people to choose? You can't have democracy and dictatorship at once, you can't raise sheep but also urge them to have self-determination. So even the basic concept of the story is flawed, and no matter how good your structure is, if it isn't built on a good solid foundation, the whole thing will crumble. Take a look at the society in Brave New World, now that's hard to challenge, it's actually a very solid system even if it repulses us as we read."
"afiffifa89","1","12","22","22 July 2014"," Rubbish, absolute rubbish
","I have no idea how any sensible person can call this a good movie. What they actually depicted in this movie was a society following a Military Code of Conduct. Funny part was nobody had any idea what a military code of conduct was. It could have been a great comedy. But they had to make one absolute rubbish action movie. <br/><br/>The whole concept of the depicted society is flawed. Our fear has nothing to do with our virtues. Testing someone's fear has nothing to do with what that person is capable of. People react differently in different kind of situations. Our motives drives us, not our fears.<br/><br/>When 'Tris' started training, at the first day the trainees started questioning their superiors. They were like kids thrown into a pit with guns. Their superiors were also ridiculous, as even though they were trying really hard to keep the kids in line, they had no idea how. They forgot the thousands years of military rules that were created to keep soldiers in line and they were never really marching other than when they all became cyborgs like thingy. They were running around like kids in a playground, just this time the kids had guns with them and the normal civilian people was completely okay with it. <br/><br/>Now let's come to 'Tris and her hypocrisy. First of all, she's the last person to b ever handling a gun. Simplest reason is she was supposed to b dead(like surely, as she was also running without cover and stuff a lot) three times in total in this movie. First, before killing her friend, who missed a shot at point blank range. second, when she was crying about her mother being dead. she dropped her gun, started crying and holding her mom and then asked the people who was shooting at them to stop. And those cyborg like humans were still holding their position and shooting at the wall, instead of making any attempt to go near them. I would expect cyborg humans(who are supposed to be fearless) to be a bit more daring if i might say so. And the third time, she got caught trying to free her boyfriend. They didn't had any use of her. And even if they did why not just shoot her. All those people were supposed to be goal oriented. Killing her with a simple bullet would've been it. But none of those people even tried to subdue her. So bravo for being the luckiest person on that whole place. About her hypocrisy, she was the one wasting time with her mother with lines like ""I killed him :'("". If she hadn't, her mother could have lived. Yet, after all she's the one who says to the other people that there's no time to waste. And then she had to get into the cool white room all alone, and had to try to do everything to get her boyfriend back again. Instead of just simply killing the people who were on their way towards a mass genocide. Which wasted more time? These are just some of of the major things i noticed. But there were many others too. So please broaden your mind and think how people can become so naive?"

","I do not understand how anyone would expect this movie to be identical to the book. There are things that they have to do differently in the movie for certain reasons. Have you ever actually watched a movie based on a book that did everything like the book said? Of course not! To take words and bring them to life for readers on the silver screen means that things will be changed or taken away from because you just cant film some things to the T. For the most part they stayed very true to the book, with the exception of a few parts. I don't see what the big deal is. I read the book over five times and I was very impressed with the movie. When I first heard that Shailene Woodley had the role of Tris, I was worried, but she did an amazing job and so did the rest of the cast. Veronica Roth seemed happy with the outcome and I think that's because she knew that they couldn't do everything exactly as she wrote it. Neil Burger did an amazing job directing because he made everything look real. It wasn't computerized or anything of that sort. I'm very proud of the cast and crew for creating a wonderful adaption of this book! Can't wait for Insurgent!"

","Divergent is a science fiction film in action, fantasy and adventure. The divergent was officially released on March 18, 2014 in Los Angeles. The film was directed by Neli Burger, Evan Daughterty, and Vanessa Taylor.
The divergent tells of the city of Chicago which was destroyed by war. To create peace, 5 factions formed according to personality. Abnegation that is unselfish and simple. Erudite is smart and prioritizes science. Good and peaceful Amity, Candor who prioritizes honesty, and Dauntless who is brave and free. Whereas Divergents are people who have more than one faction in their personality.
Children who are 16 years old must take a test to choose a faction. After the test, Tris has 3 results there are Abnegation, Dauntless, and Erudite. Tris must keep his identity as a Divergent. During the selection ceremony, Tris finally chose Dauntless. It turns out that only 10 people will be elected as official Dauntless members. Because of abstinence and intelligence, Tris managed to become a member of Dauntless.
But chaos occurs when Erudite controls Dauntless's brain to attack Abnegation. Tris who is not affected by serum pretends like the others. At that time, Tris knew that For was also a Divergent. Eventually an attack was carried out by Erudite against Abnegation. In addition, Divergent hunting is also underway. However, all can be thwarted by Tris, Four, Marcus, Caleb, and Peter. The five of them fled with the train go to beyond the wall.
This movie have an easy to understand path. In addition, the acting of the players successfully supports the story. Divergent films are in accordance with the character of teenagers who want to find their identity"
"roedyg","3","2","2","26 December 2016"," All the charm of an army training film
","Divergent is about a post-war sci-fi world where everyone is divided into one of five clans/casts called factions. They are called erudite, dauntless (athletic militaristic), abnegation (selfless service and government), amity (happy farmers) and candour. Each teen must choose a clan for life. For no apparent reason, the choice cannot be changed. Oddly, even the erudite faction has no educational or training requirements for admission. If the clan eventually rejects them after hazing, they became factionless, similar to homeless in our society.<br/><br/>Our heroine goes for a sort of career counselling where they pull out the stops on CGI. It is quite entertaining and mystifying.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, our heroine chooses the mindless, loutish, tattooed, militaristic, boorish dauntless faction who do nothing but jump on trains, climb buildings, fight and run in packs.<br/><br/>The world is a Republican wet dream where everyone is pitted against each other and the weakest are shamed, deprived and tormented.<br/><br/>After a promising start, the movie degenerates into a sort of boot camp army training film. BORING.<br/><br/>The whole premise of the movie that having more than one sort of skill is weird and dangerous makes no sense as does the rule you may never change factions.<br/><br/>This is a movie for teenagers who fantasise about joining a criminal gang."
"Thanos_Alfie","7","2","2","8 February 2016"," Some people are just different...
","""Divergent"" is the first Sci-Fi movie of this trilogy and in this movie we watch a world that is divided into factions and each person has to be a part of one. Unfortunately Tris cannot be a part to any of these factions because she is a divergent. Divergents are considered as the most important and dangerous people and have to be eliminated but why?<br/><br/>I liked this movie because it has a different kind of plot from other Sci-Fi movies and that's something that made this movie interesting at first. The direction which made by Neil Burger was very good with many good action scenes. Also the interpretation of Shailene Woodley who played as Tris was very good. An equally good interpretation made by Theo James who played as Four.<br/><br/>Finally I have to admit that I did not expect much from ""Divergent"" but it was a very nice surprise. This movie made a very good start for this trilogy and I hope to continue like this and even better."
"IrishFrog","7","2","2","22 January 2016"," Good enough adaptation of the book
","Now here's the thing: I've read the book, which means I started the movie knowing what to expect. So the cheesy plot, the seemingly nonexistent background, everything was already inherent to Divergent in my mind. To me, it was simply part of the concept that the movie would develop, so I didn't find it so horrible. In fact, I even thought it was a good adaptation of the book, but then that could have been because I read it over a year (or maybe even a couple of years) ago. I can't say it was objectively good, though.<br/><br/>The romance was awful, there seemed to be no chemistry between the characters in question, they definitely would have been better off as friends. Time seemed to be off too. I mean, I knew quite some time was supposed to have passed between (SPOILER)the choosing ceremony and the final confrontation(/SPOILER), but the director didn't seem to be able to convey the passage of time properly, so hadn't I read the book, I think I'd probably have a sense of timelessness and would see it all as a bunch of things that happened somewhere at some point with some unknown amount of time separating them. <br/><br/>Not only weren't characters really unique or remarkable, but also the film lacked emotion and thrill. Most scenes that could have been intense seemed to be left unexplored in detriment of more fight scenes and, seeing as I'm not really a fan of action (or romance, for that matter), I didn't care much about all that violence. <br/><br/>Despite all that, I did enjoy myself while watching it. I don't know why. Maybe seeing images I'd only had in my mind be put into something real and concrete made it special to me, maybe I already knew how bad it could be, so whatever good thing came of it was surprising enough... In the end, I'd say this is a movie for you to watch when you don't have much to do and you just want to relax."
"bryank-04844","2","2","2","17 August 2015"," guess 'Divergent' has nowhere to go but up.
","'Divergent',much like what it means to be a Divergent, never finds its pacing, story, or place in its 140 minute run-time, which is way to long in this case. The movie is unorganized, clunky, awkward, and cheesy. It never delivers a suspenseful atmosphere or on the gritty-mature nature of the story that it prides itself in having. Sure, it might have these aspects in the book version, but it is non-existent on film. I'm sure the word-of-mouth of this movie was not persuade movie-goers who are not familiar with the books to venture out and take a look, but those die-hard fans are sure to turn out in droves to see the hot male actors deliver their favorite lines.<br/><br/>Again, the story takes place sometime in the future in a war-torn Chicago, where the remaining survivors of whatever happened are put into different factions to live and contribute to society at the age of 16. Each faction does something different whether it be lead, help others, grow food, or provide security. Much like when you're a teenager, trying to fit in to a certain group or discovering your true identity, each 16 year old is given a sort of test with hallucinogenic drugs that will tell them which faction they will most likely be in, which our main star Beatrice or Tris for short (Shailene Woodley) is labeled as a Divergent, which is bad news for society, as she doesn't exactly fit in with any faction. This means she can think on her own and not follow orders. People are supposed to report Divergents so they can be killed, but on the big ceremony day, these teenagers choose which faction they join for the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>Only in this future, once you choose your faction, you can no longer see your family again if you choose a different faction from theirs and the one you grew up in. This isn't really explained in logical terms and doesn't make sense. Tris was born into the Abnegation faction, which is a peaceful and humanitarian group of people who lead the rest into a good future. But Tris seems to like the Dauntless faction, which provide security for people, and are loud, fun, and look like punk rockers. Hell, the way the even arrive looks fun as they jump off a moving train and and walk into the Choosing Ceremony like they were in some rock/rap music video, while the rest of the factions are in colored long robes, resembling a court judge.<br/><br/>Upsetting her parents (Ashley Judd and Tony Goldwyn), Tris chooses Dauntless while her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) chooses Erudite, the faction that is all business and led by Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet), who is quite good as a villain here. As soon as Tris joins her new faction, she and the rest of the recruits start training in the underground tunnels of a train line which is now home to the Dauntless. Since the Dauntless are the ""police"" of this new world, there is a lot of physical training to go through, which is led by Eric (Jai Courtney), a rough no-non- sense man who would kill his best friend in a blink of an eye. After the first hour of Tris going through physical exercises that would make a marine think twice and some full-contact fights with the other recruits, Tris realizes there is something much more sinister at work here than protecting the people.<br/><br/>One of the leaders of Dauntless is called Four (Theo James), and notices something different about Tris on how's she' not like the rest. Four administers a series of more hallucinogenic tests to look for her fears and to see how she deals with these situations. But her test results always prove that she is a Divergent, but of course Four and Tris are attracted to each other so nobody finds out. We come to find out half way through the film that the Erudite faction is planning a takeover Nazi- Germany style by drugging the Dauntless into soldiers and killing every man, woman, and child that belongs to the Abnegation faction. Now Four and Tris must make out and destroy the Erudite faction's plans before blood is shed, all while they are under everyone's radar.<br/><br/>This PG-13 movie never gets to gritty for people under thirteen, but it so desperately wants to be that. The interactions between the characters are clumsy and are not given enough time to feel any real emotion for when something drastic happens with the exception of Tris. There aren't really a whole lot of good fight scenes or big special effects either. This first installment in the 'Divergent' series seemed like one big 2.5 hour set-up for something bigger, that ultimately won't pay off. Woodley and Winslet are the best here as Winsley delivers her character with a vicious angle and Woodley gives a great and charming performance like she always does. A lot of people are saying that Theo James turns in a great performance here, but they are all wrong. His performance is one-note, boring, and has no energy. If this movie was James's demo reel, I would not cast him in anything in the future. Miles Teller, Jai Courtney, Mekhi Phifer, and Zoe Kravitz all turn up here as well, but aren't given a whole lot of screen time. But Teller as always is hilarious and great on-screen.<br/><br/>The filming isn't that great either and seems like a paint-by-the-numbers shooting script than anything that would force us to think or entertain. The score is uninspired even though Hans Zimmer was credited as an executive score producer, and it never adds to any emotion or suspense happening on-screen. I guess 'Divergent' has nowhere to go but up."

","""Divergent"" makes me feel like I have to take a step back and preface that all my opinions on the film are made under the basis that I am fully aware that I am not the intended audience for the film. I'm a 33 year old man who collects comic books, plays video games, and spends too much money on comic conventions every year—I'm not the person that the production had in mind for watching ""Divergent."" However, they didn't have me in mind for ""The Hunger Games"" and I came around to be a fan of that franchise—although, I admit I didn't care for the first film.<br/><br/>While the visuals are good and it really sells the dystopian future the film is set in, and the acting could have easily been a lot worse and, in reality, was pretty passable (although, you would think a film that has both Kate Winslet and Ashley Judd would have a little stronger performances), the film has just a way too predictable formula to really be anything but boring. I understand that this very specific subgenre that is the tween dystopia novel adaptations follow certain guidelines—all genres really do this—but ""Divergent"" felt like a ""fill in the blanks"" template for the tween dystopia film. The characters, the story, the unfolding origin of the backstory all play out exactly as you would predict it would as the opening credits begin. In fact, the film is so predictable that there is almost no need to watch it because, chances are, any prediction you make about it will come 100% true.<br/><br/>I was pretty critical of the first ""Hunger Games"" film but the sequel won me over; however, I don't really see this happening with ""Divergent"" because the cast doesn't have enough great players thrown in, and the story, overall, is pretty bland and flavorless. Still, I won't rule out this franchise might get better and more interesting. After all, the boring beginning and the whole establishing the universe is now over so, theoretically, things can go up from herebut things can also theoretically go down, as well."

","There's a lot to like and there's also a lot to shake your head with this film. For one, it shouldn't be over 2 hours. Its near 140 minutes but a good chunk is spent just watching the same training over and over again. Shailene Woodley was good in the movie, and I also found that I like her love interest Theo James. I thought his character was much more interesting than Peeta and Gail in the Hunger Games Movies. With that said, I know a lot of people really loved this movie, and I respect that. But I just wasn't thrilled with how it played out.<br/><br/>Before the negatives there are a few positives that made the film at least an enjoyable watch in theaters. I really thought all the actors fit their role, and I thought each character was written very well. Except for the parents but ill get to that later. Each of Tris' friends once she picks her group were fun. And even the twist with a few of the characters later were interesting and kept me guessing. Miles Teller was funny and delivered a few lines that I got a good chuckle out of. I think its funny how Woodley already has a film with Teller as her love interest and a movie with Caleb (Tris' Brother) as her love interest. The ending turned out to be better than the other 3/4 of the movie.<br/><br/>Now onto the negatives, some actors were completely underused in this movie. Kate Winslet (who I expected to have a menacing presence) may have had close to 15 lines in the entire film. Also the parents were given little screen time, and were then just killed off right after each other. The scene with the mom dying was a little emotional sure but I didn't feel connected to these characters due to the few lines and how they randomly show up. The dad's death was poorly handled as well. The music in this movie never seemed to fit. The score that you rarely here was decent (Hans Zimmer). But really all the songs used seemed out of place. I'm never a big fan of any songs that appear in films, much rather stick to the scores. A few scenes the CGI is unbelievably noticeable which shouldn't happen with a big budget film like this one. There were also several CHEESY parts, including a few romance scenes that made me cringe at how awkward they made us feel.<br/><br/>Not reading the book, I kinda felt like I was left with several unanswered questions, but perhaps the sequel will address them. I really hope Allegiant is better, and the change of director may help considering Catching Fire was substantially better than the original Hunger Games and they had a change of director. We shall see, but Overall it can be enjoyable with interesting characters and some cool ideas but disappointed with the final product. 6.7/10"

On a certain day each year, all youth that are 16 years old take test that determined which faction is the best fit. In the end, no matter what the result, one is free to choose whatever faction they wish to. However, if that faction is different from the one they were raised in, they must leave their families and everything else behind and fully commit to their new role in society.Tris (Shailene Woodley) is one of these 16 year olds to be divided. On testing day she shows equal aptitude for three separate factions, making her ""Divergent"". Confused, Tris is told to keep her results a secret and ends up choosing the Dauntless faction. As Tris deals with the grueling challenges of becoming Dauntless, she discovers that being divergent entails much more than she ever imagined.<br/><br/>I think fans of the book will be very pleased with the adaptation. I have not read the books so I made sure to bring a friend, who had, to the screening with me. According to her, the film does a great job at making the book an emotional and entertaining movie without sacrificing major plot points that would otherwise leave fans disappointed. The Tris and Four (Theo James) are well cast. There's nothing particularly outstanding but they are enjoyable to watch. According to my well-read friend, their romance was whittled down significantly for the film, which I think worked out for the better. I really enjoyed how their relationship developed. And while it is a major part, it didn't overshadow the story as a whole.<br/><br/>I was really impressed with the music. Being a dance music fan, I think the soundtrack is fun. But the musical score, composed by Junkie XL, is what stood out to me most. There are a handful of very emotional scenes and the music really drives it home.I am a little outside the target age range for this movie but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The obstacles that Tris encounters will translate to audiences of all ages. It's a great story with multiple scenes that led me to reflect on not only my own adolescence but also on my journey as an adult. Out of all young-adult-dystopian novels that have been made into movies, this one is definitely my fave.<br/><br/>http://redcarpetrefs.com/2014/03/divergent-review/"
"kuuk3","2","9","16","4 April 2014"," I walked out the cinema. Its that bad.
","I love films set in the future, but this film had nothing futuristic about it. It may have well have been set in 1940 as thats the level of technology you see in this world.<br/><br/>I have not read the book, but this film was boring. For over two hours your watching nameless kids go to school. But nothing happens! There are no student rivalries, no interesting characters that set them apart, no class clown. Every character was EXACTLY the same and none of them did anything unique or memorable.<br/><br/>If there was a villain, i didn't see him or her in the 100 minutes i watched it before walking out. It was just a bunch of kids attending class! Even the teachers were kids. Adults don't even exist in this world for longer than a few seconds every half hour.<br/><br/>No explanation was given about the war, the world, the wall. The class factions might have been benefited by a sixth faction called 'builders' that actually tried repairing all the buildings in that city. As it stood, there was no-one around to build or repair anything. <br/><br/>The whole mystery about 'divergent' was barely touched in the time I watched it, and I had given up waiting for answers when I walked out. <br/><br/>It lacked any likable and interesting characters, any resemblance of a plot other than completing high school, it lacked a villain or conflict of any kind. Story-telling 101 was ignored completely and the only thing that gave the rating an extra star was the cinematography and panoramic views of the destroyed city which impresses well for a few seconds, before being ruined by the characters getting in the way of the camera and blocking our view."
"carrotbastard","1","8","14","29 April 2014"," It's like watching ""The Hunger Games"" while being water-boarded
","Goodness gravy gracious, I don't even know where to begin berating this train wreck of a film. I suppose I'll begin by criticizing the fact that the characters had little to no development whatsoever. I mean, good lord, characters that were hastily introduced during the first few minutes of the film and scarcely mentioned amid the film were hurriedly brought back with the intention of implementing those typical Hollywood cliché ""PLEASE DON'T DIE ON ME, PLEASE!"" scenes. I'm not insinuating that there is anything awry about designing characters to simply exist and complete the fictitious paradigm, but rather that the writers should be privy of the fact that the audience could care less if they die later on. The acting was also astoundingly mediocre. Even during the resolution of the film's primary conflict, you can discern an incredibly cringe inducing, spurious inflection in the antagonist's voice as she frustratedly reacts to her defeat with irritable overused phrases such as ""NO, WHY YOU."" This film also resorts to ""shocking"" or ""plot twist"" scenes roughly every five minutes. I've no antipathy for those personally, though, after the first 20 minutes of consistent ""OH NO"" moments, the audience becomes far too exhausted to care anymore.<br/><br/>I direly wish these were all the caveats I had noticed while viewing this film, but, unfortunately, I could continue raving for an additional 5 unnecessarily long paragraphs if I direly wanted to. Alternatively, I'll conclude this review by sufficing to say that I would recommend this film to no one under any circumstances ever. It's nothing more than a try hard, egregious attempt at creating an edge-of-your-seat experience for the audience and is far more probable to leave them anticipating those enrapturing strings of text we call the credits."
"clement-959-542917","3","7","12","27 March 2014"," A fast-pace failure
","If it were not for the few action scenes and the obvious will for the unknown part of the cast to finally break trough in Hollywood, this rating would have easily been a 2.<br/><br/>Divergent has been the online hype for the past six months, and there is honestly nothing that stands up to whatever buzz it has created. It is a demoralizing vulgarization of master pieces like 'A Brave New World'. Except it has been very unfortunately mixed with 'Twilight', 'The Hunger Games', and that it now lies somewhere between bad and worst.<br/><br/>To think that experienced and successful actresses like Kate Winslet and Ashley Judd signed in to co-star with a whole bunch of TV stars - mostly big screen wannabees - on the basis of such a terrible scenario is pretty self-explanatory in itself: Divergent has only one objective, and that is to create a cash cow like the other recent teenage franchises.<br/><br/>It could be called sad, but in the end, there is nothing wrong with doing money. The only problem nowadays is that poor writers just loot their plots from inspiring master pieces from the past. With Divergent, Hollywood keeps on being Culture's Tomb Raider.<br/><br/>Actually, it is sad."
"Winchester_United","3","7","12","25 March 2014"," Poor adaptation trying to cater to kids instead of teens/adults
","I understand not keeping things 100% the same in book to film adaptations, especially if they're not integral parts to the plot or if they don't translate well to screen, but many of the things that were suspenseful in the book were completely removed or trimmed away to help get that pg 13 rating and while sometimes less can be more, it certainly wasn't in this case as much of the gravitas and suspense being removed and trimmed away as well, there was not even any lack of urgency until the film was partly in it's second half.<br/><br/>I also feel like somethings should have been explained better for those who hadn't read the books. For instance in the film and even the trailer we see the character Tori tell Beatrice that ""you're divergent, the test didn't work on you"" but in no point of the film do they really explain why the initial test didn't pan out, I mean we see how Beatrice manipulates the tests later on even in the trailer (""this isn't real""/breaks the glass) but we never get the reasoning why she tested for multiple factions thus being divergent"
"YJLcool","8","22","49","23 March 2014"," A surprisingly good YA sci-fi action drama thriller adaptation
","After the tremendous success of Twilight, Harry Potter and Hunger Games series, Hollywood film studios have made several attempts to repeat the success. But, many have failed to capture the hearts of fans and general audience alike. Now, here comes another young adult sci-fi action drama thriller series...The Divergent Trilogy. Will it succeed and remembered as one of the good young adult series? Time will tell.<br/><br/>Adapted from Veronica Roth's first book, it is a story about the conflict between individuality and social conformity...the dilemma of being different, not fitting in with the society and the fears that comes with it. It raises the question on why people in general, submit to social conformity (obedience and unwillingness to change), without any resistance. Is it really deeply rooted in our genes? Why individualists are mostly frown upon by society and feared by the authorities?<br/><br/>The film offers an interesting world with strong characters, an engaging plot enough to captivate the audience for its long running time (140 minutes). In a post-apocalyptic Chicago, the people are divided into a five-faction social system, enforced by the authorities to maintain peace and order after an unspecified catastrophic war, based on their primary distinct personalities: Abnegation (selfless), Amity (kindness), Candor (honesty), Erudite (intelligence) and Dauntless (courage). The film starts out with the lead female character questions her place in society, but later on, she starts to question the fundamentals of the society itself.<br/><br/>Much of the film's running time is dedicated to develop the characters enough for the audience to know them, by showing what they're going through and what they've become by the end of the film. The lead actors, Theo James and Shailene Woodley, delivered a solid performance in their respective roles and have a convincing on-screen chemistry between them. Kate Winslet, despite her short screen time (only about 20 minutes), manage to solidify her presence throughout the film, hinting that we'll be seeing her more in the next two films. Moreover, the ideas and concepts behind the psychology aptitude tests to determine which faction the characters belong or join are commendable as well, as they show the inner fears of the characters and why they possess the personalities mentioned in the film.<br/><br/>However, some parts of the film feels rushed, especially the third art of the film, due to its heavy world-building, plot and character development in the first and second act. The fans of the books might complain about the missing parts, but from a person who haven't read the books (me), it seems fine and acceptable to me. I believe the film gets the essence of its source material right, despite the complex nature of its source material.<br/><br/>Regardless of what the critics or fans said, the worlds and characters of Divergent and the Hunger Games are very different. Each stands on its own and shouldn't be compared with one another. The film has a good start. By the end of the film, I'm interested to see how things will be unfolded in the next sequel, Insurgent, which is releasing next year and how the story concludes in Allegiant, which will be released a year after Insurgent.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 <br/><br/>""Individualism promotes personal freedom and achievement. Individualist culture awards social status to personal accomplishments such as important discoveries, innovations or great artistic achievements. Unfortunately, this threatens to those in power, the survival of a population of conformists that specifically adhere to well-defined rules and principles. So, the ones who are capable of thinking differently than others are usually rejected or deemed as outcasts in society. This creates a constant, endless struggle between individuality and conformity throughout the history of mankind."""

","Obviously this movie received mixed reviews, because on this site it has a 7.6 and on rotten tomatoes a 40%. I liked reading Divergent, it is not as similar to the Hunger Games as you think it is, it's actually unique in it's own way. What ticked me off about this movie is that it was pretty different from the book, (enough to make me annoyed) and that the entire relatively new cast (besides Winslet) cannot act. Theo James is sexy and he knows it in the movie, and Shailene Woodley is just ugh I can't explain it but she cannot act! Why are they comparing her to the fabulously talented Jennifer Lawrence when she can't even hold a candle in the acting world? This movie messed up the story for me, did Veronica Roth even see the script?"

","In post-apocalyptic Chicago, the Sorting Hat puts Katniss Everdeen in Slytherin, not Griffindor.<br/><br/>This film, which appeared in the UK with no pre-publicity at all, no trailers, nothing, is apparently based on the first of a trilogy of Young Adult novels, which is curious for what is clearly - given cast and production values - a Major Motion Picture.<br/><br/>The good news is that it is quite nicely realised - a good budget, solid production values on screen (some nice eye candy), good and well-delivered action, a strong cast, and a pleasing central performance from Shailene Woodley as Katniss. Sorry, ""Triss"".<br/><br/>The bad news is that is so busy trying to emulate the Hunger Games and Harry Potter transposed into a cookie-cutter post-apocalyptic dystopian scenario that it often forgets to be its own thing. I know my synopsis above was somewhat sarcastic, but I honestly sat there thinking ""This bit's from Hunger Games. This bit's from Harry Potter. Oh, Hunger Games again."" This is a very derivative piece which hasn't worked hard enough to forge its own identity (or hide its sources, if the two are not the same). Which may explain the lack of publicity.<br/><br/>Oh, and the fictional status quo of the five factions-based society (this film's version of The Hunger Games' Panem) makes little sense when examined closely, and raises more questions than it answers. Someone didn't think things through.<br/><br/>So my verdict is that it is somewhat dumb, overfamiliar with its sources, but not unenjoyable."
"lopezmaggivonkarma","4","6","10","31 March 2014"," ""Divergent"" My modest review
","To write about the film ""Divergent"" is first necessary analyze the literary substance which it is based. Because, upon closer inspection, that's the main flaw of the film<br/><br/>To properly analyze the book, a lengthy prologue about the conduct of a dictatorial government and its implementation on the novel by Veronica Roth necessary. Just as there is a forensic awareness in the serial murderer (able to find excuses for their behavior), there is also a totalitarian awareness in many dictatorships: arise in times of great social disorganization, impose control over the people, atone and classified and exterminate the ""threats"", expand and seek to obtain a balance or a happy society, even if they must use the most violent and cruel methods to achieve that goal. Even the Nazis sought a world in peace and harmony, but for this task were insanely convinced the domination of the Lebensraum and the extermination of ""undesirables"", plus the loyalty of the people to the Nazi Party<br/><br/>Veronica Roth respects part of this common sense: the dictatorship of the novel comes at a time where wars almost destroyed the world, and this new totalitarian government seeks a peaceful state curtailing freedoms. But is Roth who also added a bunch of craps: this dictatorship imposes an impractical system of dividing society into groups of coexistence, where some people to meet majority must choose one of the groups to live forever in it and not to contact legally the other sectors, which means that many families would be torn apart by the division if their children chose a foreign group, triggering a social imbalance that is somewhat unfair in a totalitarian government that could well impose another system without disrupting society so drastically. In ""The Hunger Games"" there is the classical system of minorities with money vs enslaved and poor people, with dreams of belonging to the elite minority, which is a scheme that allows poors to be with their families until they are chosen randomly in combat (it is not very realistic, but certainly much more flexible). But this approach that Roth tre is surprisingly fla even for a real dictatorship. Furthermore, the system designs its logical failures: people living in their family's are to meet certain age and choose, which means that the sectors may suffer easily seepage of personalities from other groups just because a guy gets two personalities (the personality of the family and the new personality of the group); in fact in the film alludes to this point<br/><br/>But also Vernica Roth, either she lacks imagination or personal beliefs, embarks on theological estates where human ills are products of elementary, almost cultural and godlike factors that humans suffering. Thus, wars are caused by the qualities of ignorance, selfishness, etc., and the solution is to remove these qualities. It is an excessively naive view, today there are materials and advanced sciences like ponerology who developed the explanation of a dictatorial government as complex mechanisms where the executors suffer serious pathological deviations.<br/><br/>And if all this world sounds implausible, worst of all is the bizarre taste of the novelist to give substance to her name and universe. It's horrible: the groups were called ""Candor,"" ""Erudite"" ""Amity"" ""Abnegation"" and ""Dauntless"". Each of these factions meets the personality according to the title of the group, eg if you belong to ""Dauntless"" then you'll be a brave person for the rest of your life. It's so absurd and obviously the names of the groups, and the objectives of the factions also ridiculous<br/><br/>The film is directed by Neil Burger, who knows how to deliver some power but does not have many exceptional films (not even ""The Illusionist""). In ""Divergent"" applies enthusiasm enough to be entertaining, even if only dedicated to copy some tips from other directors, even if only dedicated to emulate the energy of the films ""The Hunger Games"" 1 & 2. Many scenes action / adventures are good but unconnected, with the only purpose of generating a little entertainment in a production that focuses on the main character training. There are awkward moments: the test sequence (the protagonist with the wolf) is really flat, instead of waking some lyricism. The Soundtrack is bizarre and out of context, Pop songs when the movie tries to sell this as ""Serious""<br/><br/>The protagonist decides to belong to ""Dauntless"" (because it is the most entertaining group to make a film, right?), And is warned about two special groups: the ""factionless"" where individuals who did not pass the test of their faction live in an area of ??decay; and the ""divergent"" group where they are people who do not fit the mold of legal groups and are quickly killed to prevent rebellions. In the ""factionless"" is absurd to think that people who have own culture fall into a state of total decay, simply for failing a test. And in the case of the ""divergent"" if you think about it deeply, has exactly the same characteristics of a ""factionless"". Why not classified in the same group?<br/><br/>This review continues on my personal Tumblr, which has no commercial purpose now<br/><br/>http://reviewsandthecity.tumblr.com/post/80744453615/divergent-film- review"

Though in reality I would have to say that when youth is in charge you usually wind up with a Lord of the Flys situation or 100 which I like so far.

"jeremyochsgonzales","5","9","17","16 April 2014"," Good Story with Bad Casting
","On Monday night I finally saw ""Divergent"". To write a review of this movie is kind of complicated. How can one separate the story from the performances? Well, I'll try.<br/><br/>I'll start with the positive. I like the story. The world that is created in ""Divergent"" is different enough from other dystopian stories to stand on its own. I think like all dystopian tales there is a certain amount of realism taken to the extreme in this story. In the world of ""Divergent"" people are divided into factions: Abnegation, for the selfless; Amity, for the peaceful; Candor, for the honest; Dauntless, for the brave; and Erudite, for the Intelligent. I found this interesting. At the end of the day isn't our society divided into various factions? Aren't the jobs we go to everyday kind of assigning us to one of these roles? <br/><br/>In the world of ""Divergent"" sixteen year olds take a test which is supposed to tell them what faction they belong in (in a way isn't this kind of like the sorting hat in Harry Potter?), but when it comes time to choose each person can choose what faction they want to spend the rest of their life in. Most children end up in the faction that they are born into. Once again isn't this like the world we live in. We go to school from ages 5 to 18 and that is supposed to tell us where we are supposed to go in life, we are given the choice to decide where we are going to spend our lives but at the end of the day don't most people end up following the path of their parents and their parents before them and their parents before them?<br/><br/>What is interesting in ""Divergent"" is that the main character Beatrice, later known as Tris, fails to fall into any faction based on her test, hence the name divergence. It seems that in the world of ""Divergent"" people who are individuals and don't fit into a box are a treat. Why does sound familiar? For all of our emphasis on individually doesn't our society today reward those who conform? Aren't people who look, act, dress and most of all think differently seen as a threat? Doesn't it freak the status quo out when people choose not to get married or have kids or work a nine to five job? <br/><br/>After Beatrice tests as Divergent she is forced to pick a faction without the guidance of the test. She picks Dauntless because she always looked up to them when she was growing up. As the story progresses we get to see her initiation into Dauntless. It is basically like basic training and if you don't make the cut you end up factionless. Once again there is a parallel to our world. Aren't the factionless supposed to be like our homeless? The story is kind of saying that if you don't follow what is expected of you will end up on the fringes of society; left without a home and an identity. What I can't decide is if the story is reinforcing this message or challenging it? <br/><br/>I liked seeing the challenges that Tris has to face to become a member of Dauntless. I was also left wondering what the challenges would be for the young men and women who ended up choosing a different faction. Sure it's thrilling to see the tests of the brave but I would also like to see the tests of the selfless, the peaceful, the honest and the intelligent.<br/><br/>The conflict of the story comes with a grab for power. In the world of ""Divergent"" Abnegation runs the government. However, there is talk of corruption among that faction and Erudite, the intelligent, looks to be making a move to take over the government with the help of a brainwashed Dauntless.<br/><br/>Again, I found the story interesting. However, I was left wondering if the story was anti-intellectual. After all it's the evil Erudite who make a play for power.<br/><br/>I found the ending of the movie to be a little sloppy but I have enough interest in seeing what will happen next that I'll see the sequel.<br/><br/>Now the not so good things...<br/><br/>Prior to this movie I had only Shailene Woodley in ""The Decedents"". While I didn't think that she gave a bad performance in that movie I couldn't understand why there was (forced) Oscar buzz around her. She didn't do anything special. I was even less impressed with her in this movie. I like that these YA franchises are giving young women the lead roles but you need a truly powerful and charismatic actress to carry a film like ""Divergent"" and Shailene Woodley is not it. She is a very plain looking actress, not ugly by any means but not beautiful, but she doesn't compensate for that plainness with any real charisma or acting talent. She was far too passive to play Tris.<br/><br/>Theo James so bland, devoid of talent, charisma and good looks that I was left wishing I had Liam Hemsworth on screen.<br/><br/>Speaking of Kate Winslet she is fine in her very small role. She doesn't over play it which is nice. I like placidity in which she plays the villain; it's a much more interesting route to take than scenery chewing.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie I pondered who would have been a best casting choice to play Tris. Late in the movie I realized the answer was in the movie itself. The perfect Tris would have been Ashley Judd twenty years ago. Judd's role is very small but she is given a couple moments where she shines and makes Woodley look small in her shadow."
"grahambthomson-761-860939","5","9","17","13 April 2014"," I believe this is just average
","Having saw the film yesterday, it not great, it is not good, it is average. Some will say it's better some will say it's worse. <br/><br/>The story is a little unbelievable but is packed full of action and drama. The problem is the action isn't great, and the drama isn't that exciting. Even the props had a feel of low budget or just not enough thought had gone into them. The actors were not great. The male lead was increasingly wooden and just seemed unable to dominate the screen the way his character should. The female lead was at times very good but she just didn't do enough for it to be better than that. Kate Winslet was good also but she was not involve nearly enough.<br/><br/>Even with some good performances the film seemed a bit dull and obvious. Divergent is an OK film it's just OK, and that is its biggest problem it is a very safe very middle of the road sci fi film."
"jshaw20","8","21","48","22 March 2014"," Divergent Tops The Hunger Games for Vicarious Thrills
","The question everyone who hasn't seen the film, Divergent, wants to know: is Shailene Woodley as effective as Jennifer Lawrence? The difference is in the character development and plot, something neither actress could do anything about.Woodley is as engaging as the rest of the cast that includes Theo James, Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Kate Winslet, Maggie Q and Ray Stevenson. Woodley, who looks like she could be Lawrence's sister, was seriously considered for The Hunger Games, and was expected to have the lead in Catching Fire, but Lawrence made it back. Catching Fire has a more decipherable plot than The Hunger Games. Woodley's ""Tris"" in Divergent is as wonderful as Lawrence's character, ""Katniss."" It's easy to love them both.<br/><br/>Divergent, a young adult book transferred to film, is as entertaining as any following the dystopian trend that includes The Hunger Games and its sequel, Catching Fire. For adults who enjoyed those films, then Divergent does it one better. Not that The Hunger Games was not a good film; it was done very well. However; the society and logic for the games don't work for all some of us reality-thinking adults.<br/><br/>If we were thinking on a broader scale, we might ask a lot of questions if we wanted to, but we don't. These films, including Divergent, based on young adult books, are voyeuristic in that they involve prying observation of ""our own children"" represented on screen. We want to see our children brave, heroic and caring. We'd like them to save the world we messed up. For grown-ups, Divergent and The Hunger Games are still vicarious thrills. We love watching the young win--even it is against others the same age. As long as those hurt or killed are deserving (meaning bad guys) or going to kill the good guys.<br/><br/>What makes Divergent different from the rest (and I don't pretend to know all the films made or being made in this vein today) is that the scene is on a larger scale and the young are entry-level to the scene. Their journey is just beginning. Grown-ups have already screwed things up by dividing society by its values. Evil has the usual melodramatic pervasiveness in these films; there is always a villain to make what seems to be a good plan (the world as it is presented to us) even better.<br/><br/>That said, Divergent is a decent science fiction film that teaches a lesson to society--or by direct consumption-- teenagers in the world. Teens have questions about who they are or who they should. They questions their actions and reactions constantly. Unlike utopias that portray a perfect world, dystopias portray a world in need. Teenagers, needy or not, can identify with a world in need. The audience or reader sees the distorted world vision, but the characters--the society does not. To be dramatic, most dystopian science fiction we see on film is usually so dark and so grim as to be unrealistic. Most of the world is destroyed by war either among themselves or by aliens.<br/><br/>Good science fiction tackles what we should or shouldn't do as a society when it comes to science or technology. And, especially for film, I think it helps to have a positive ending."

The movie relies heavily on the long interrogatory with excessive use of machines, and abstract images on the dreams performed by Tris , as it turns out to be tiring, confusing and a little bit boring. It is followed by Insurgent 2015 by Rober Schewenke in which Tris approaches the residents of Amity led by Octavia Spencer and meet the factionless and Four's, Theo James, mother : Naomi Watts. And finally, the conclusion and unexpected denouement : Allegiant. Stars Shailene Woodley who gives nice acting as the valiant teen who is really haunted by her past, as well as she must confront her inner demons. She is well accompanied by a good support cast to be with her in the three entries, such as : Ray Stevenson, Ansel Elgort, Miles Teller, Zoe Kravitz, Jay Courtney, Mekhi Phifer, Maggie Q, Ben Lloyd Hughes, and Kate Winslet.<br/><br/>The picture has a colorful and brilliant cinematography by Alwin Kuchler. And a thrilling and rousing musixal score by Junkie XL. The flick was well directed by Neil Burger, though it results to be overlong and a little bit tiring. However, Neil did not make the second outing, as he couldn't due to scheduling conflicts with postproduction in this Divergent 2014. Burger is a good professional director who has got some successes as cinema as TV. As he has directed notorious films as The illusionist, Limitless, Interview with an assassin, The upside. And TV series and episodes as Billion, Books, the jury TV, The asset TV, among others. Rating : 6, decent Science Fiction movie that will appeal to teenagers. Well worth watching."

","To start off this review let me clarify that I have read the books, and read them not long before seeing the movie, so they were very fresh in my mind. There were issues I had with the book, and although I liked the books overall, there were many things that I didn't like about them.<br/><br/>This movie I think is an excellent version, as many of the aspects that I found annoying or didn't like from the book are not included, or at least not focused on. To me this made the story that much better.<br/><br/>The actors in the movie did a very good job, I found that both leads (Shailene Woodley as Beatrice Prior and Theo James as Four/Tobias) did excellent jobs in their roles. I was initially very hesitant, and didn't want to like them as they were not at all how I pictured the characters, but I am a complete convert. In fact, Theo James did his role so well that I honestly cannot picture that character in any other way except the way he portrayed it. Many of the supporting characters were superb in their small roles as well, Ashley Judd, Kate Winslet, Maggie Q, Jai Courtney, Zoe Kravitz, and Tony Goldwyn, all stood out to me as being excellent in their roles. Some of the other actors I found a bit weak in their parts, but I also realize that might have been because they were not given enough screen time to actually build the nuances of their characters to portray them well.<br/><br/>The cinematography and editing I thought was also very well done. I really liked the costume and set designs for this movie, and how well they reflected the factions. From the clothing to their homes, it was all very well thought out on how such a civilization would actually love.<br/><br/>The script was also excellent. At no point did I want to role my eyes because it was too silly (which happens a lot with these YA books turned into movies), and it managed to keep you interested in what each character was saying.<br/><br/>The story adaptation, again, was also very well done. I cannot think of any part they left out that I felt was absolutely necessary to include, they did very minor story changes, but I also realize that is because to include them would have meant they left an open ended story for viewers who hadn't read the books (which would be very annoying).<br/><br/>Overall, I think this is an excellent movie, and I would highly advise anyone who has read the books to go see it, and if you drag your friends who haven't read the books they will enjoy it as well."

","I read the books and Veronica Roth is a versatile author. So let's talk about the movie... Of course not all the contents in a book can be displayed in a movie but still it was well-interpreted according to me and I really loved the movie. Shailene Woodley and Theo James were great as Tris and Four. They played their characters up to the level. Theo James was perfect as Four. He is such a good actor and I just loved his acting in Divergent. There could not be a better actor to play the role of Four. Theo was amazing and perfect just as in the book. Certain people will not like the movie or compare it to the Hunger games but truly speaking though it's a dsytopian movie as the Hunger games, Divergent has a different storyline and is simply awesome to watch. They took some difficult scenarios from the books which were very well shown in the movie.I would highly recommend people to watch Divergent. I can't wait to watch the sequel. Amazing movie."

"eddie052010","5","8","15","15 April 2014"," Not very divergent, ironically.
","Over the past few years, the young adult novel adaptation has become a popular as shown with the box office success of franchises like Harry Potter, Twilight and The Hunger Games. However, despite the million dollar success of the aforementioned franchises, other attempts to create big franchises based on young adult novels, more often than not fall flat on their faces. This is due to either the fact that they aren't unique enough to stand out (and therefore doesn't get the box office popularity it needs to start a franchise) or are flat out rubbish. This is more of the former. While there is some bright sparks that suggest this franchise has more to offer in future installments, the first part is far too safe, predictable and formulaic to justify it's stance as a film that will lead on to a more interesting franchise.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is that Beatrice Prior is living in a future-set dystopian Chicago, which is divided into five factions which are based on the various personalities of the people who live there. These are Abnegation (selfless), Amity (peaceful), Candor (truthful), Erudite (intelligent) and Dauntless (brave). Beatrice Prior, however, is a divergent, a group who are hunted down by the government in order to maintain the peace. In order to hide this, she joins Dauntless, a more militant faction under strict rule. Will she be able to cope by belonging to a single group or will she reveal her divergence.<br/><br/>The plot is one of the film's more obvious flaws, seeing as it steals many of its major plot threads from another source. The faction system brings to mind The Hunger Games, but while watching the film you'll start to notice that the film seems to owe more to Philip K. Dick, with much of technology used in the film and the way that the mind is a running theme, seems to have come out from one of his stories. This isn't a huge gripe, seeing as how it is slightly more subtle about it's theft than other franchise starters (Constantine and The Hunger games for instance), but for a film called Divergent, it doesn't seem to be unique enough to truly stand out in order to interest audiences not familiar with the source material.<br/><br/>That highlights the major flaw with this movie as a whole: it's far too bland and safe. It's a setup movie at it's worst, something that gladly sets up (some of) the world and characters but is lacking in confidence to truly spread it's wings and soar. The world isn't shown in high detail, the villains here are clearly pawns for a bigger power and on top of this, throughout the majority of the running time, nothing hugely important seems to happen. Sure we find out that the girl here is a divergent and a few major events in her life happen here and there, but for the most part, the movie consists of training segments and montages. Not very exciting stuff is it?<br/><br/>It definitely isn't exciting, considering when the action consists of shaky cam, fast editing and close-ups, that ruin the action than make it more intense. It isn't just during the action though, as there are many parts which use gimmicky camera tricks in order to make the movie cooler than it actually is. Casein point, there is a dream section where the camera circles the characters, which could potentially make you feel nauseous.<br/><br/>However, there are some good things, that gives this franchise some hope of improving. The acting for the most part is good, even if the main lead is bland, and Kate Winslet is wasted as the villain. The world definitely looks interesting, and the money ($85 million) is clearly on the screen. On top of this, excluding action and certain scenes, the direction is good, and proves that he is great at dramatic set pieces. Despite all of this, the film is clearly lacking in many areas to justify itself as the next big sci-fi franchise.<br/><br/>Overall, despite a few high points here and there, the film lacks any punch. Even though things could improve in future entries, the film itself isn't divergent enough (pardon the pun) to stand out and have any staying power as a result."
"shengda_pu","4","8","15","8 April 2014"," Good book made into bad movie
","I know it is a successful book. Lots of books are made into movies and TV shows, many of them had pretty bad reviews, so I prepared myself before watching this movie. However,I still got surprised. 7.6 is way too high for this movie. The Hunger Games is only 7.3 and I believe most people who watched both films would not say that this movie is better. However,it's understandable that this movie is over-rated because many raters are simply fans of the book and they think such a good book can never be made into a bad movie. Well, never underestimate the power of movie makers. Host is one of the recent examples(good book, bad film). I have not read the book and this movie certainly killed my will to do so. Too many good books are made into terrible movies, the Film makers have to try harder to present books on the big screen. Not like this, Not like this"
"sdr2017","6","3","4","11 May 2014"," Disappointing
","Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of the Divergent Series. I am currently reading Insurgent. I was excited when Divergent became a movie. Since the book was amazing I had high expectations. Sadly my expectations were not met. They had skipped many important plot points throughout the film. A few examples are why Tobias is called Four, the back story of Tobias (which was only briefly mentioned in his fear landscape), when Tris is caught by Eric after going to the Erudite compound, Peter feeling up and degrading Tris's body when they try to push her off into the chasm, for capture the flag they originally use paint balls, Christina grabs the flag, Tobias originally is the only person in the control room and he was the one to shut it down, and many more. The ending left out a great deal of conversation between Caleb and Tobias. Peter and Molly are made to look less violent and extreme in the movie. There were not many fight scenes which was disappointing. They also did not add a lot of scenes where Tobias and Tris start being close. The movie made their romance so sudden. The book is definitely a 9.5/10 but the movie lacked and strayed from the book thus why I give it a 6/10."

I went in expecting to be kept on the edge of my seat with all the exciting things, but when the people started jumping off trains, i seriously wanted to start cracking up laughing. I lasted about 20 minutes into this, then couldn't handle it anymore. I've heard people compare it to hunger games - WRONG. I love hunger games, this was just terrible!

","Ho-hum!.... So, ask me if I was at all surprised (even slightly) when (guess what?)

No. I was not surprised. Not in the least.<br/><br/>If you ask me this utterly pretentious, $85 million production was just another version of ""The Host"", but, of course, this time it was all done on a much grander scale, with definite shades of ""Starship Troopers"" thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>At 2 hours and 20 minutes, Divergent really pushed the limits when it came to being tolerable entertainment. In general, I thought that most of the cookie-cutter characters in the story were just a bunch of shallow, two-faced, arrogant snots and I couldn't have given a sweet-damn whether they ever triumphed in their goody-goody, little mission, or not.<br/><br/>All-in-all - Divergent was nothing but superficial fluff marketed exclusively for a very gullible, non-thinking audience."
"trepessa","8","4","6","25 December 2014"," Young adults, developing love, disintegration of dystopian society
","When I sat down to watch this movie I wasn't sure at first if I would like it but I actually did. I'm not fond of dystopian civilization movies but this one was very good once there was momentum to the storyline. This is a trilogy so the first movie is setting it up for the other two movies or four if they divide the last book into two parts, which has become the standard for a series of books. People need to do a little research before going to see a movie like this. The book was published by Harper/Collins Children's Books, knowing that the novel is geared either for children or young adults. In this case, it was for young adults and that doesn't mean it is to attract fourteen year old teens. People keep bringing up Twilight and this isn't the same type of science fiction story at all. The other is more towards horror and this is not. Besides Twilight was wildly popular and with people of all ages. Those that didn't like the series are in the minority. My daughter was a manager at a movie theater when they were all released and they filled several at each opening and it wasn't all teens.<br/><br/>Divergent is a futuristic society that is after some cataclysm which can be natural or a war and in this case it was a war. People ended up divided by nature but some didn't fit into one category and this threatens this particular society. They kept the story in one city and how they resolved what happened to them and not all over the world. The cast was excellent and I saw no problem with the acting. There will be similarities with other stories of this type if they are based on a dystopian society. This one is nothing like the Hunger Games whatsoever. It follows its own storyline which is quite different but after a great cataclysm how the society was functioning. Don't go if you can't deal with the main actors being young. There were many adults in the movie with major parts and covered by very well known actors. This movie was about going through a test and getting placed in a segment of their society although you were free to choose regardless of the results of the test and once chosen that was it for life.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie and I'm a senior. I don't think there is any age preference to watching movies. The subject matter was very serious and very adult oriented. I await the next segment which if as good will have me watching until the last movie as I did Twilight and Harry Potter. This movie did very well at the box office and the reviews are mixed by professional critics. I am not paying much attention to reviews here who are not professional, because most of them are predictable because this side of science fiction is either you hate it or you love it generally speaking and I didn't love it but I thought it was a good movie and very creative. Even though I have seen dystopian movies in the past this one was inventive on many levels. If you know you don't like this type of movie don't do reviews and compare to every other movie with a young cast. The age of the cast isn't relevant it is the reason for them that is relevant, the place they fill in the society being represented. The movie shows how one got placed into the various societal groups when you reached the appropriate age and what they went through in a few of them by the choices they made. It was rigid and the movie showed how it was falling apart because there was no room for change and growth and rivalries began to form. It's violent like other movies of this type, so be prepared for a less than homey atmosphere in the future society created in this story."

"estupples","3","7","13","4 July 2014"," Disappointed
","After just finishing the book you can imagine my excitement when this movie was about to begin - lets just say my excitement was short lived. <br/><br/>There were so many disappointments in this movie that could have been avoided including but not limited to the following: The dauntless weren't nearly as intimidating as mentioned in the books and I noticed a severe lack of facial piercings which could have easily been added in. Al wasn't given enough recognition throughout the movie to lead to any emotional attachment and emotion directed at his death - where was the showing him crying himself to sleep and not wanting to win his fights? Actually, come to think of it we only saw Tris and Christina fight (and we didn't see the fight that pushed Tris up the rankings, either). Also related to the fight scene: Tris is supposed to be so battered she is unrecognisable. The movie makeup barely portrayed that well enough. A few marks on her face and nothing more. Tris and Tori's relationship wasn't developed enough. Tori was supposed to be her go-to for a lot of things but we barely saw her. Tris was supposed to get more tattoos - the abnegation and dauntless symbols. I thought this was an important part that should have been put in showing how she was divergent and struggling to conform to one faction. Casting of Four was terrible. What the hell were those bullet wound simulator things? They were supposed to be paintballs! You cannot sit there and tell me it was too expensive to bring some paintball guns in. THIS POINT KILLED ME: Why the hell was Ed not stabbed in the eye by Peter? - This was an important part of the story! It showed Peter as being a true threat rather than just some regular high-school douchebag type. When Tris was facing her fears in the simulator she was supposed to be afraid of intimacy NOT being raped - that was absolutely appalling to see that in there. When the dauntless were going to attack abnegation - how the hell were people who hadn't read the book supposed to know what was going on? They barely touched on anything relevant to that. Even I was slightly confused at what was supposed to be happening.<br/><br/>Enough ranting now - Overall the movie was a huge let down and I actually regret watching it. If you have just recently read the book prepare to be disappointed."

","The movie was so bad. It was a good concept from the beginning, so on its own it may have seemed great to those who haven't read the book. If you have read the book, however, you would have noticed that more things were left out than kept in, things happened at way different times than originally, important and thrilling scenes where twisted resulting in unimportant and boring parts, and many characters, thoughts, and important phrases were almost completely left out. This is the first movie that I have ever despised. However, whether you believe the movie is good or bad, and you haven't read the book, please read it for your own good. It is honestly one of the best I have read. Things you missed in the movie: The hardcore ship you will have for Christina and Will and, obviously Tris and Tobias, so many intimate moments, the fact that Four is not called Four by Tris once she knows his name, how Molly, Peter, and Drew are complete and utter butt holes and you will want them dead as much as Tris does, and many more that I can't list because of the word limit. Honestly, just read the book, or listen to it."
"vistheindian","6","7","13","6 April 2014"," young adult movie that doesn't 'diverge' from the genre norm
","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>With the popular demand for young adult novel adaptations, comes yet another movie called Divergent. Tris (Shailene Woodley) learns that she is a Divergent, a threat to a post-apocalyptic society as she doesn't fit in its system. Now she must try to survive the witch-hunt for all Divergents. This movie is as generic as it gets for this genre: love interest, protagonist is special but that's not a good thing, training montages, and so on. The only redeeming quality of this movie is Woodley's character Tris. Beyond that there is not much else you will care about.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>In a post-apocalyptic world, a society has been sustained in the ruins of Chicago. In this city the population is divided into five factions, where every citizen must fit into so they can fill a role of the society. The main protagonist Tris (Shailene Woodley), finds herself to be a Divergent, someone who doesn't fit in any faction and therefore a threat to the system. Tris along with her mentor, Four (Theo James), must now find a way to put an end to a plot to hunt down every Divergent.<br/><br/>Divergent is directed by Neil Burger, who has previously made The Illusionist, and Limitless, both movies which I quite enjoyed for doing something different. However, this movie fades into the noise of the young adult genre and does very little to differentiate itself from the generic clichés. As a result, this movie feels very lackluster and uninspired. The world created is intriguing at first, how the society is divided into factions to avoid conflict and war. Ironically this interesting idea also works against the whole movie, because all the characters are so cookie cutter and are exactly the same as everyone else in their faction. This may be intentionally done, but it leaves the audience with little care for anyone who is in peril on screen. The only characters that have any complexity is Tris and Four. So that's where I'll give some credit to the movie, the two central characters. Shailene Woodley is a great young actress in all the movies I've seen her in, and she is the best part of Divergent. She grows as a character and conveys her struggle between fitting in and being herself convincingly. Theo James, although not an incredible actor was at least layered and likable.<br/><br/>Movies are an experience, and my experience watching this movie showed several red flags in Divergent beyond the ones I already mentioned. There were moments in the movie that were meant to be taken seriously but come off so melodramatic and awkward that I, including the rest of the audience in the cinema burst into laughter at its unintentional ridiculousness. Also the movie spent too much time on the training aspect of the movie, to the point I partially forgot what the conflict of the movie was. It only got to the real meat of the plot at the last 30mins of a 2hr 20min movie! There is one line that is uttered about the world outside of the fenced off city of Chicago. At the end of the movie, some of my friends and I agreed that we found that one line to be more interesting than the rest of the movie. That is not what a movie is supposed to make the audience feel<br/><br/>All in all, this is not a movie that is a must see. Perhaps the fans of the novel it's based on will enjoy this movie more than I did. Still I would not recommend spending your money to watch it in the cinema. If anything just wait for the DVD/Blu-ray release. It's a watchable movie because of Woodley's performance, and I appreciate the effort but I can't say I enjoyed it."
"michellekiara2","9","18","42","22 March 2014"," Great Adaptation
","The books were amazing, so I was actually worried at first that the movie was going to be bad. But I wasn't disappointed after the movie. They did a great job at picking the cast. Theo James was good as Four, and Shailene Woodley was excellent as Tris. They really did well on the fear landscapes. I would have given it a ten, but there were some important things in the book they didn't include. Uriah and Edward were not there. I know they hired an actor for Edward, but his part was so small I didn't even realize he was there. Because of that, the butter knife scene was also not there. I get it that it would be too long if they included all the scenes, but these two things are soooo important to the fandom they shouldn't be cut."
"gumperman","7","27","68","25 March 2014"," Not Excellent, but Great!
","When first hearing of this film and seeing the first trailer, I didn't know what to think about it. It didn't excitement me much and all the way up to it's release, I didn't feel it had that same kind of vibe that 'The Hunger Games' had. A vibe that it was a must see film. Then I heard a sample track from the score, composed by Junkie XL. It was great, and it made me want to see the movie a little bit. Well that and I wanted to see if it was actually a great film, like The Hunger Games was. Plus I do like the main star, Shailene Woodley. Well, I just saw it today and here is what I think. The music is great, it has one of those themes that I can't get out of my head and a score I've been listening to since I left the theater. The film itself was a very interesting film, very different from what I understood from the trailer, but I'm not familiar with the story so that is probably the main reason. I really liked the futuristic, post-apocalyptic, dystopian feel that it had going on through it, but it also was kind of scary to think that human life could become that one day. The plot was easy enough to follow, but sometimes confusing. Though, if I had read the book, I'm sure I would understand it 100%. The elements I had trouble remembering were the names of all the factions that people were divided in, or chose to be in, and what those factions' meanings were. When they would show the symbols for each faction, it made sense to me, but the names itself I couldn't quite grasp. I'm sure a second viewing will clear that up, defiantly if that second viewing is on blu-ray and with the captions on. Anyway, other than that, It kept me quite intrigued in a pleasantly unexpected way and I really look forward to next year for the sequel, Insurgent, and the year after that for the concluding film, Allegiant."
"gndecastro","9","29","74","24 March 2014"," Worth seeing in UltraAVX!
","Awesome movie. The movie plays with the theme that society tries to force us into a specific box when we really wish we were free to do many different things with our lives. The story exaggerates this theme by reducing people to five different personality types. Once they reach adulthood, all people are forced to choose and live by one set of rules only. The main character, Tris, does not fit conveniently into any one type so she is considered dangerous because she cannot be controlled. Even though this is being compared to Hunger Games (young people in combat in a dystopian future), it is actually completely different. Only the setting is the same. There were a few minor details that could have been corrected. This is a must watch for any fans of Sci-Fi, action, or even if you just like to see a female in a lead role. Loved it. P.S. - If you have not yet seen the trailer, watch it after the movie. It revealed a bit too much."

The story line was like one written by an overenthusiastic 13 year old with aspirations to be a writer and a sycophantic audience pushing him/her along with mindless enthusiasm. However, it probably could serve as some entertainment to the under 12s, and that may well be the target audience so can't fault it in this sense."
"baberchik","3","6","11","27 June 2014"," Et tu, Divergent?
","From the first 5 mins of this soap... I mean ""action movie"" I just could not help but think about Hunger Games, and from then on the mind as if tricked by one of these ""now you breathe manually"" jokes kept looking for just those parallels. The nearly identical puppy love, dystopian society, excessive for-show violence and a pyrrhic happy end make this teenage girl-oriented flick a girl movie. I expect most of the high ratings come either from girls, or old lonely women, or men who got some great ... lip service... after bringing their GFs along to watch this as a reward afterwards. I usually like the general setting (i.e. dystopian, post-apocalypse) but there's just so much hello- kitty-glitter-spice a cook can put in a dish, and here he dumped the whole shaker in. Also plagued with a kind of soundtrack that would either be found on a teen girl's iPod or in a female oriented ""erotica"" movie. Did I say this movie is oriented on teen girls by the way? I can not stress this enough obviously. Even the rivalry depicted amongst the characters... even that is literally a direct copy/rip off from hunger games!<br/><br/>I really want 139 minutes of my life back, but I don't think Hollywood does refunds. So, to the concerned potential viewer out there, know this: I sacrificed part of my life on the altar of cinema viewership, quite selflessly I might add, so that you can avoid wasting your time on it. Stay away!"
"schmidteren","1","7","14","22 July 2014"," Too little substance
","Filled with plot holes, clichés everywhere, out of this world unnatural dialogue.<br/><br/>It probably would have worked fine for me if I was a teenager, and haven't seen as many movies as I have. The movie takes too many ""textbook"" ways, while also lacking a lot in character developments. If I could describe the world presented, it is very teenager like. You could say it reminds me of another movie not in my age group ""Twilight"".<br/><br/>I don't think there is more worth saying about this movie. As a very avid movie watcher, it's def not worth watching. But for pure spectacle, it is still suggested for non avid movie people, and the younger audiences.<br/><br/>Have a great day and thanks for reading."
"misha1998","5","7","14","11 April 2014"," A watchable film, but it drags and bogged down by YA clichés
","I will tell you something; I have not read the book, so therefore I cannot really compare much to the source material (my friends have stated that the source material is far better than the movie).<br/><br/>This movies starts bad with an unoriginal explanation of a Utopian scenario, which we have seen before in The Hunger Games and read before in The Giver. I mean, when can we have a YA movie without dystopia?!<br/><br/>After that we are given factions (which serves as a plot element) and then we find Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) as a stereotypical girl who has absolutely NO character (besides being obviously raised by her mother and father, LIKE EVERYONE ELSE) and then while she is in one of the factions (Dauntless) she starts to suspect from Four (Theo James) that some sort of coup'de etat was happening...I mean this is another case of ripping off Deus Ex! (the game)<br/><br/>Another thing I would like to criticize is the tendency that you have to put music with extremely annoying singing in the movie that has absolutely NO relevance to the plot. I mean, I think the songs that were put in the movie were supposed to make one of those ""intended audience members"" happy because the executives knew that this film was not well made and forced the editor to put in this absolutely unnecessary music!<br/><br/>Now, if you dare me to say something good about this, I shall in the following. <br/><br/>The fight scenes remind me lots of Fight Club, the romance is actually built up lots, and the whole cinematography reminded me of Terrence Malick. And I did like one scene after Prior is ambushed by some thugs and then when one of them apologizes, she not only declines but she actually tells them to never talk to her ever again. That moment, for me was a huge show stealer. Unfortunately, for me, I cannot really like this film and I do not recommend it, but the film cannot be bad when a scene like the one I just mentioned plays perfectly."
"peterp-450-298716","4","5","9","7 August 2014"," An adolescent story with a disappointing predictable plot
","˝The future belongs to those who know where they belong.˝ <br/><br/>˝Divergent¨.A movie everyone was eagerly looking forward to. A movie a lot of fuss was made about. A movie that was doomed to be a mega-success in the cinemas as ˝Guardians of the Galaxy˝. The only difference with the latter is that the film from Marvel really looks original and refreshing and also has an unique atmosphere. ˝Divergent ˝ is yet another adaptation of a youth book, written by the twenty-five-year-old Veronica Roth, of which one hopes it will make a heap of money just like ˝Twilight˝ and ˝The Hunger Games˝ did. And after wards the merchandising could exploit the youthful fans for years. Admittedly, I had a good feeling about this movie and was wondering how this film would turn out. That good feeling melted away like snow in the sun after roughly 45 minutes. I came to the conclusion that it was just another teen movie, with the same stale story lines and banal trivialities that would make an impression on a young naive public. In other words, again a fragile individual that eventually grows into a heroine and, surprisingly, saves society from being ruined. Sigh. That's indeed for once quite different and terribly innovative.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, the first 45 minutes were fascinating. An explanation about the current situation with magnificent images of the ruins of Chicago. I was just wondering why they didn't renovate the existing buildings, since they could construct those ultra modern glass and iron buildings. Or were these half-streaked tower blocks the shelter for those who didn't belong to any class? Whatever. The description of the various factions was pictured nicely. It even went into a socio-political direction at one moment. But soon I couldn't prevent seeing comparison points with the other movies of youth books.<br/><br/>However, I fear to say everything that's been said before and I don't think I will reveal any new original angles. Indeed, the system of factions reasonable compares to that in ˝The Hunger Games˝. Katniss became a symbol of liberation and hope in ˝The Hunger Games˝. I suppose that role will also be played by Beatrice (I could be hopelessly wrong since I've never read the books). The ceremony can be compared with that from Harry Potter. The only thing they do not need to do is to put that old talking hat on their head. Just as Melanie, a rebellious teenager, in ˝The Host˝, Beatrice gets hopelessly entangled in a puppy love affair, as expected. Nevertheless there is one positive point. It's by far better than ˝Beautiful Creatures˝ and way better than ˝The Mortar Instruments˝. And if you want to look at a futuristic film, where there is a distinction between certain classes and also has a struggle for freedom, then I suggest you watch ˝Snowpiercer˝. But then however, this movie lacks a bit of real romance and the aggressive and violent level is a bit higher. So it's not for the faint romantic souls.<br/><br/>The initial phase where Tris is heading out with the jeering mob of Dauntless, climbing and balancing on bridges while wandering through town and jumping on hurtling trains and after wards jumping back on flat roofs (yes just getting on and off a train at a platform is not challenging for these daredevils) is still enjoyable. Even the tests that they have to endure and the mutual competition that arises is still acceptable. But in the end I thought it was a barbaric and cruel faction that throw out newbies, who ultimately have chosen for them, because they didn't pass the tests. The moment a slight chemistry develops between Four and Tris, it goes downhill for me and it becomes a little too predictable. The ˝Beverly Hills 90210˝ level was reached without any problem with the glitzy, handsome protagonists and feel-good moments. It won't be long and the merchandising machine will be on track and we are bombarded with all sorts of trinkets and gadgets. The next years will once again be filled with Barbie-like stuff, TV programs, PC Games and fashion statements that are related to ˝Divergent¨.<br/><br/>Shailene Woodley is perfect for this role and exudes a charisma and fragility. Her ​​future as a teen idol is guaranteed. She will travel the trajectory as a rising star just like Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Watson did before her. We'll just wait and see if her future performances will be appreciated by moviegoers. Theo James has his looks and that will also guarantee a high melting level for all the the teenage girls looking at him and who will be floating home after wards. His toughness doesn't last long and before you know it he protects Tris as a real mother hen and winds up on the soggy and corny romantic path. Of all the companions of Tris the only one that I can remember is the role of Miles Teller as the terrible enervating Peter. When I look at his performance in ˝The Awkward Moment˝ I'm sure that the irritating quality is a personal trait. Kate Winslet managed again to come across as haughty and disdainful. For the rest it wasn't really an impressive role.<br/><br/>Ultimately ˝Divergent˝ is an adolescent story with a disappointing predictable plot. I suppose the sequel, like with ˝The Hunger Games˝, will be a middle film which will contribute even less. So I'm not going to bother to watch it. Despite the sometimes extremely professional elaborate action scenes, it all feels as fake as the applied tattoos.<br/><br/>More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be"
"mstantial","6","8","17","22 March 2014"," A disappointment
","I was hoping for something like The Hunger Games. However, the story just didn't draw me in and Woodley's acting doesn't compare to that of Jennifer Lawrence. Of course, I realize that is setting the bar really high. Maybe I expected too much.<br/><br/>The story seemed to leave a lot of loose ends. First, I couldn't 'buy' into the concrete living quarters. It was never believable or even understandable. <br/><br/>Second, empty trains seem to always be moving throughout the city, just ready for people to jump on. <br/><br/>Third, the actual daily living situation of the entire city was left unshown and unexplained. Did the kids go to school? Did anyone have a 'normal' job? Were there any shops? Who, or which faction, would perform which jobs? The setting was never complete enough to make any of it 'real.' Even fantasy needs some supporting structure.<br/><br/>Jai Courtney made his character really interesting. There was something repellent, attractive, and interesting about him all at the same time, which left me wishing we got to know his character better.<br/><br/>All in all, it may be worth your time and money if you have few options one evening. However, don't expect something on par with The Hunger Games."
"3xHCCH","7","12","29","20 March 2014"," Practically Perfect Interpretation of a Less Than Perfect Book
","Just finished reading the book ""Divergent"" before the movie opened today. It was a quick easy read. There was obvious inspiration from various other futuristic young adult books I have read, like ""The Giver"", ""Ender's Game"" and the ""Hunger Games"" books. Like the others, the treatment of the story was cold, But its descriptions of the initiation rites were very much more violent. <br/><br/>The setting is the walled city of Chicago after a great war. Their society is divided into five distinct Factions based on personality traits: Dauntless (brave), Amity (friendly), Candor (honest), Erudite (intelligent) and Abnegation (selfless). <br/><br/>At the age of 16, a child takes an examination to help him choose which one will be his faction for the rest of his life. He may follow the suggestion of the exam results, or he may decide on his own. Those who fail to be accepted into a faction becomes factionless, as they become hopelessly poor and destitute for life. <br/><br/>Our heroine Beatrice Prior has been born to the Abnegation faction with their grey clothes and disdain for any form of vanity. However, her examination results are revealed to be inconclusive, so she has to make her own decision. Meanwhile, an uprising is brewing in Erudite against the government run by Abnegation. <br/><br/>I had some problem with the book and the way they try to make the Factions distinct from each other, when it is easy to see that overlapping does happen. These traits simply cannot be mutually exclusive from each other. It is also disturbing the way the author describes the Dauntless. Does being brave mean jumping off running trains, having piercings and tattoos, beating each other up mercilessly, or even killing yourself? This may give immature readers the wrong ideas about courage. <br/><br/><ul><li>o - o - o -</li></ul><br/><br/>The film was a perfectly conceived interpretation of the book. In the first few scenes where they show the color-coded clothes distinguishing each faction was quite clear. How director Neil Burger showed us most of the memorable scenes in the book, like the choosing ceremony, the jumping on and off the trains, the fear landscapes of Tris and Four, and the invasion of Abnegation were all very well done.<br/><br/>There were some parts which were reinterpreted in the film. Most did not really affect the story-telling, like changing how Tris meets her Mom during Visiting Day, or glossing over a particularly violent episode where Peter stabs a fellow initiate in the eye. There was one big change towards the end about how a climactic surprise rescue transpired. I thought the version in the book was so much more better set-up and executed than the less-dramatic altered version we saw on screen.<br/><br/>As I suspected, the tall and beautiful Shailene Woodley is definitely not the small and mousy Tris we imagine while reading the book. However, I thought Shailene gave an excellent portrayal of Tris' character, how she developed from a shy dependent girl to a confident fearless warrior. For people who have not read the books, they will not be aware of any discrepancy at all. <br/><br/>Theo James had very good romantic chemistry with Shailene, so his Four never really felt like a threat to Tris, unlike the initial parts in the book. The director gave James a lot of lingering close-ups for the benefit of the teenage fan girls. <br/><br/>Ansel Elgort, who played Tommy Ross in ""Carrie"" recently, now plays Tris' brother Caleb. His Caleb is less dynamic than I imagined him in the book. Coincidentally, Elgort has an upcoming movie with Shailene Woodley later this year called ""The Fault in Our Stars"" where they play boyfriend-girlfriend.<br/><br/>More up and coming actors play other more minor characters. Zoe Kravitz, who was in ""After Earth"" last year, is not exactly how I envisioned Tris' best friend, but she won me over as the film went along. Miles Teller, who was recently in ""That Awkward Moment"", plays bad boy Peter, whose role in the film is much diminished compared to the book. Jai Courtney, who played Bruce Willis' son in ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" last year, brutally plays Tris' tormentor in the training camp. <br/><br/>Among the senior stars, Ashley Judd makes a nice comeback of sorts playing Tris' mother, who had major secrets of her own. Maggie Q played Tris' examiner and tattoo artist Tori with the requisite compassion. Kate Winslet plays the cool and calculating Erudite uprising leader Jeanine with icy perfection.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought this film was a practically perfect interpretation of a book that was less than perfect in itself. So, whatever things the film might show us which we might not like, like the slow pace of action progression, and the questionable motives of the characters, are actually because the book told it that way. Fans of the ""Divergent"" books will find this film version faithful. While it cannot compare to the high standard set by the Hunger Games film series in terms of cinematic quality and character casting, ""Divergent"" definitely has its own entertaining appeal going for it. 7/10."

"ashleighkabashleigh","10","6","12","9 October 2014"," Amazing
","So I watched this movie for what feels like the millionth time today. I love it so much! I have seen reviews talking about 'poor writing' 'poor directing' 'poor casting' and 'poor acting'. The people writing this review seriously need to get over themselves because they probably can't even act. I'd like to see them get handed the million-page script of Divergent and THEY can attempt to perform it even better. I highly doubt they will top the amazing acting done by Theo James and Shailene Woodley, in particular. Also, in saying that, I have seen another review stating that she couldn't tell Will, Al and Peter apart. Cleare;y, YOU weren't paying attention at the beginning of the movie, when they introduced themselves. They were sitting at the table, eating lunch (I assume) and they were arguing over their factions. Peter is played by Miles Teller, and again, it clearly states in the movie who he is. It is during the fight scene, the day after the knife scene, when Eric states: ""Peter and Tris in the ring"". (something along those lines) These people who are talking about poor directing etc need to pay more attention the movie, and I highly recommend READING THE BOOKS BEFORE YOU SEE THE MOVIE!! It will help you understand the movie if you don't normally PAY ATTENTION TO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's not rocket science people! In saying that, I read another review talking about "" Having destroyed civilization in a world war, the city survives. The survivors had enough materials to build a massive wall around the city, 300ft high, but can barely feed themselves. Now they have split into 5 factions (actually 6 because they throw a lot of people out and call them 'factionless') and this somehow magically creates peace"" It is a fiction movie okay?!?!! It's not real! So don't be so critical about it! Honestly some people need to go back to 5th Grade! IT. IS. NOT. REAL. And don't bother watching Twilight or Hunger Games, just because it's ""slightly better"". Go watch them because they are all (including Divergent) top quality movies and entertaining for millions of people. Divergent was a great movie, but some people really need to put some more thought into their reviews. Thanks to Shai and Theo for inspiring me to begin acting too."

","I thought it was a really good depiction of the book! The director left some things out, but it's to be expected since you can't possibly fit everything from a book into a one hour & thirty minute movie. However, the movie covered most of the important parts which is great to know. Some of the parts left out are also included the deleted scenes due to timing issues. There are some movies based on books that are absolutely terrible, but I thought that this wasn't the case in Divergent. This is one of my favorite movies currently. I'm still so happy it worked out in a good kind of way!<br/><br/>Overall, I LOVED it! Veronica Roth does too! I can see why now!"

","I truly love this series and I am not fond of all book to movie adaptation as they don't always stay true to the stories. Unlike many others this movie did a great job. In my opinion it was very true to the book minus a few small things like the existence of Uriah and the details of the character Edward. A few scenes happened in places other than where they where in the book. These things don't affect the overall portrayal of the story. Theo and Shaliene were amazing together and had great chemistry!! As a book fan I am very happy with this movie and praying the sequels will be adapted as well! For non-book readers I believe that the story was easy to follow and well explained."
"alexhs_45","1","4","7","18 April 2015"," Hollywood perfected the teenmoneymaking formula.
","To begin with, the movie was horrible as we all expected.The thing is, that horrible movie made some serious money and proved that there is no need for new ideas and good writing for a movie to achieve that kind of gross.<br/><br/>Why invest time and effort on a better movie when we can just modify our target audience expectations? That's why every now and then a new Mtv-like teen actor who's interviews are like audiobooks of what their managers has given them to read pops up into the movie business.<br/><br/>The formula is now known. A teen next door who is just so random and socially awkward and can't stand mainsteam fashions and activities is globally cherished as other teens crave for someone to relate to.<br/><br/>However, that's not a new thing. In fact it's the same thing that macho men and dynamic women represented in the 90s as well as the 80s. The thing is that those actors, because of their Hollywood persona, actually had a personality. Now teen actors have nothing that would differentiate them from one another except their face. They are just mirrors for teens to put themselves on as they have no characteristic that would not match with any of their own.<br/><br/>That's why we end with such talentless and without personality actors, and a script that supports such characters:<br/><br/>""A common teen like any other (THAT COULD BE YOU!) finds him/herself in a situation of him/her being different of their peers(OMG THAT'S LIKE TOTALLY HOW I FEEL!) and achieve greatness being a non conformist in a world full of conformists."" sounds familiar?<br/><br/>Please stop paying for such movies.

","I have read all of the books is what I would like to point out firstly so I AM a fan and I KNOW what it is supposed to be like. Honestly when I went into the movie I was not expecting it to be amazing or anything because I've been let down too many times by movie adaptations of books before but this honestly exceeded my expectations of how terrible it was going to be. Apart from the fact that they missed out and changed A LOT of the book, not to mention leaving out important characters, the acting was terrible and the settings and music were VERY, VERY typical Hollywood over dramatic rubbish. People would like to probably say that I did not enjoy it because of the fact that I have read the books and therefore expected too much from the movie but honestly if I had not read the books I would still have thought it was typical Hollywood garbage. It felt like I had been watching a parody for the actual movie and in some of the really 'serious' scenes I found myself laughing at how bad they were. I can honestly say that the only bits that people thought were funny actually came DIRECTLY FROM THE BOOK. Neil Burger, or whatever his name is, honestly really let down a really good and meaningful series and turned it into typical Hollywood garbage. I honestly don't understand how people thought it was good because I struggled to find anything good about it. Terrible green screening. WHAT DID THEY SPEND THEIR $80,000,000 BUDGET ON?! I hate to say it because I don't like to compare series to other series but they could have really learnt something from the Hunger Games film adaptations, sticking to the book is the best idea. All in all a MAJOR let down."
"donsour","5","4","7","24 March 2014"," Only for the Di-VIRGIN-t
","So, I am a HUGE fan of the @Divergant book series, with its stellar content & literary accomplishments in regards to plot, character development & story. However, after seeing the movie last night, It forces one to be cliché in stating that ""The book is better than the movie"".<br/><br/>I often refrain from making this statement, or even agreeing with this sentiment from others... but in the case of #DivergentTheMovie - not only did it disappoint by leaving out key plot points, but it dramatically fell short with regards to the character development as well as audience/character connection.<br/><br/>The relationships within the movie were rushed and glossed over... as it tried too hard to make us care about #Tris - but failed to encompass how her importance/personality was directly derived from her relations with everyone around her.<br/><br/>Now, typically this is the part where someone might interject that a book can always make more connections thru character backstory and/or descriptive text... and that if someone ""never read the books"" they would love the movie. However, as somewhat of a movie connoisseur - I have to genuinely say that this ""movie"" fell short for the Di-VIRGIN-t. - A prime example was the Al/Tris explosive relationship that felt bland and dry... regardless of the exceptional acting by @ShaileneWoodley. - Another key element that was left out in both plot & character development was the Christina/Will relationship... which ultimately made the audience feel NOTHING when it came time for Tris to deal with Will later on. (I mean we just don't connect to it.) - Finally, let's talk about the one relationship they did try to develop... between #Four and #Tris. This (unlike the book) was so void of innocence and sexual tension that it seemed forced and contrived for the simple sake of the audience.<br/><br/>Well. I will wrap up by saying that... of course, the movie is a ""must see"" - simply because if you read the books, you are already vested. But of course, if you didn't read the book... and are looking for something to fulfill the void of Dystopian movies... I must say that this film was good, but extremely rushed and missing some key elements to make it great. (Similar to how the movie version of #Beatrice #Prior's #AptitudeTest was incomplete, vacant and unfulfilling)"

"WheelzFourReelz","6","8","18","21 March 2014"," This movie is enjoyable, but the structure of its own plot prevents Divergent from a worthy watch.
","Divergent is based on the popular teen novel by Veronica Roth about a post-apocalyptic society where everyone is divided into factions based on what trait the have, be it bravery, kindness, selflessness, etc. I have read the book and I will be honest; I was not a huge fan of it. I thought it was good, but there was some things wrong with the story that I couldn't look past. But we aren't here to talk about that, are we? I wasn't originally wanting to see Divergent, but my mom wanted to, so I decided to watch it. After watching the movie, I can safely say that it's alright. I'm going to start this review with what I liked about the movie. First off, the acting. I thought everyone in this movie did a good job. Shailene Woodley did a good job as Tris, Kate Winslet did a good job as Jeanine, Theo James surprised me with his performance as Four. In my opinion, the person who stole the show was Jai Courtney as Eric. He did a fantastic job being a menace. I also thought the action was cool. It was fast paced, intense, and had guns. Lots and lots of guns. The only thing I didn't like about the action was that it took so long to get there. All the action-y stuff happened with about 20 minutes left in the movie. Not that it was a necessarily bad thing. Seeing all the initiates go through training was pretty cool. This movie, as well as the book, just has an interesting premise. An entire world that's divided into colonies defined by their attributes is just cool. It may be borrowing a little too much from The Hunger Games, but I don't mind. Now I must talk about what I didn't like. First is, actually, the romantic relationship between Tris and Four. I know! Criticize me all you want, but it's my opinion! I felt like their romantic relationship felt unnecessary and almost out of place. This was, in fact, one of my biggest complaints about the book. Look, I think romance in movies and books are just fine. In some cases, they're actually done very well. This one just didn't click with me. Another complaint was that this movie seriously lacked tension until the last 20 minutes or so. Characters get into the life threatening situations, but for most of the time, I didn't feel tense or worried at all. I will admit is that part of it is because I read the book, but that doesn't really matter. The movie is pretty predictable and you can expect what's going to happen next and how they will get out of the situation. You may feel tense in these moments, but I didn't have that feeling, which kind of bummed me out. While I didn't love the book, one of the things I enjoyed was that it had really tense moments. The movie seemed to butcher those moments, in my eyes. The movie's biggest problem is how it handles the source material. Don't get me wrong, it follows the book pretty well. It's how the movie uses the source material that is the fault. This movie zips by important plot points way too fast, leaving you with a ""wait, what?"" or a ""well that just happened"" mentality. It goes too fast for you to actually care about what's at stake. I may have a lot to criticize, but Divergent is still a decently enjoyable movie. It's worth a watch, but I wouldn't go full price. See if you can go on a matinée or rent the movie off of RedBox. It is not as good as the book, but the movie is good enough to get some enjoyment. And I hope Shailene Woodley goes far in her acting career. She is very good and I have a feeling you will be seeing more of her very soon."

","If you have read the series, you might understand the stories underlying this community mess, dividing it into five factions based on one different virtue. Of course a group of people living with only one virtue would cause chaos inside the one faction itself and affecting the society. But here, the other problem is, when your mind can't be fitted into any group, you'll be called divergent, and they'll hunt you down. That was what happened on Tris (Woodley).<br/><br/>About the plot itself was lack of surprise for me. All the flaws of the plot originally came from the book. All about this messy complicated world, was introduced at the first part of the movie. I think it was the hardest part for Burger to explain the audience about the world of Divergent. You'll find it confusing and somehow boring. I love how Burger dealt with this. The way he built up the character of Tris turned this movie into a beautiful journey if a young woman leaving her family and society. She must learn new way of life that opposite with her old ones. Abnegation was stiff and odd. And she had to choose which one of factions she wanna live in and how she managed herself to fit into the new one, how she managed herself to face the family she left. I think it's the beautiful from Divergent for me, Woodley could deliver the emotion. The flaws of the setting and plot can be covered by the way they building the character.<br/><br/>I think it's a good book adaptation movies. Some of adaptations ruined the original book. But Burger picked a good point of the book to develop it into a movie. Which he chose to build the journey of Tris. <br/><br/>Fans are worried about the age of Theo James, they are expecting 18 years old actor to get the role of Four. But i think James's maturity here helped much in developing the characteristic of Four. He could bring Four's trait exactly fit. Four looks mature and capable of handling things.<br/><br/>The romance wasn't too cheesy, not like the other teenage romance.<br/><br/>What Burger did, make this teen stories acceptable for adult audience. Even though, the plot and setting is kind of mess. But Burger and the team, so the actors, did, yeah, okay, in developing Divergent movie. For me it is a good book adaptation movie. I was surprise by the lead actress performance.<br/><br/>I recommend you to watch, until the studio gets enough profit and pick the sequels. Because this one isn't kind of standalone movie. The mystery of the factions hasn't solved in the end of the movie, and i love to watch the other journey of Tris and Four, and how that world recover."

"kluseba","5","6","13","25 April 2014"," A rip-off of a rip-off
","Dystopian teenie movies are all the rage these days. In my opinion, ""The Hunger Games"" and Company can't catch up with classics like ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Equilibrium"", ""Fahrenheit 451"", ""Rollerball"", ""Soylent Green"" and so on. ""The Hunger Games"" was already almost just a rip-off of the famous Japanese book and movie ""Battle Royale"". At least, ""The Hunger Games"" had a few great actors, stunning costumes and settings and loads of action. ""Divergent"" is now a rip-off of ""The Hunger Games"" series. My advice for you is to watch the originals instead of what Hollywood wants to be the next blockbusters.<br/><br/>So basically, this is a rip-off of a rip-off. But ""Divergent"" features less impressive actors and actresses that portray more or less convincing characters. I could not connect with any of them but maybe the target audience of teenage girls would see things differently. The costumes and settings are much duller than those in ""The Hunger Games"". The action scenes are a lot less urgent. Even the story is rather frustrating in here, feels rather random and is even a little bit hard to follow at some points. The movie's villain has not much charisma either.<br/><br/>The film wants to introduce the female main character Tris as somebody special. She passes a mental test that should indicate one of the five factions she would best fit with. People in dystopian Chicago are either brave, intelligent, peaceful, selfless or truthful in an isolated and precisely structured society after a great war that is not further explained. Tris doesn't fit to any of these factions in particular and is divergent. This is already rather strange. The so-called test lasted for maybe one minute and the main character acted in a completely normal way where I would have taken the same decisions if this test was for real. One doesn't really believe the movie that Tris is so different and special. She is an ordinary looking girl with ordinary skills who is about to go through an ordinary bad meets evil plot and to fall in love with an ordinary good-looking young man. The base of this story is already rather odd.<br/><br/>The entire story is not much better. The so-called divergents are considered being a danger for the elite and are chased down by governmental forces. Tris joins the brave faction and tries to hide her secret. One day, the intelligent faction tries to overthrow the leading selfless faction with the the help of the mentally manipulated brave faction. Tris and her boyfriend who turns out to be the son of the leader of the selfless faction (what a surprise) will obviously save the world in a few minutes.<br/><br/>Between the initial test and the final battle scenes, this movie is filled with endless mental and physical games and simulations that portray the main characters everyday life among the brave faction. The fighting scenes vary between being visually stunning and being ordinary. The supporting characters in the brave faction are superficial and don't add anything to the plot line. The failed assassination attempt of the main character feels completely random and out-of-place. Basically, the first and maybe the last thirty minutes of this movie are addicting while the rest tries to kick off some character development and dystopian world exploration that is mostly uninteresting because both characters and the dystopian world are rather ordinary. <br/><br/>This all sounds rather negative and it is. So you might ask why I still gave this movie half of the points. The reasons are simple. I'm a big fan of dystopian books and movies and even the worst examples still attract my attention. The special effects are well done and worth to be seen in the cinema. The capture-the-flag game at some point in the movie is my personal highlight set in an interesting atmosphere and location. As I said, the first thirty minutes of the movie are rather entertaining and promising. The final thirty minutes are filled with action and tension. Even though the outcome of the story is highly predictable, the last thirty minutes will get you on the edge of your seats. There are even a few emotional moments in there when some characters need to do some important sacrifices. Not everything is bad in here. Half of the movie is well done, the other half really ordinary.<br/><br/>In the end, it's up to you to decide whether you would like to watch the rip-off (""The Hunger Games"") of a rip-off (""Battle Royale""). If you liked the rip-off, you might also appreciate most parts of ""Divergent"". If you thought the rip-off was of an average quality or below, let me tell you that this movie here is clearly below the rip-off's quality. Don't waste your time on it then. As a fan of the genre, I had a little bit more than two and a half mostly entertaining hours. The movie was made to watch it in the cinemas because of its solid sound and visual effects. On the other side, I would certainly not watch it again and I wouldn't buy or rent this film either. If there was a sequel in a few years, I would probably feel like watching it for the sake of having already watched the first part but I would feel hesitating. Don't get yourself into the same situation. I would rather suggest you to avoid this movie and watch something more original which basically means that you should look for the original dystopian movies."

","Our teenage female heroine is Tris. Like most adolescents she needs to be part of a group, establishing at the same time that she is much superior to her peers.<br/><br/>In her society people are conveniently divided in 5 factions (actually, 6), according to virtues: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless and Erudite (plus the factionless, the pariah of the new society). At a certain age, teenagers must decide which faction to join, regardless of the faction of origin. They are previously tested to establish their main trait and make a better choice about the faction to choose.<br/><br/>Choices outside their birth faction are frowned upon, but still allow for the protection of belonging to faction. Not so easy for Tris. She is ""special"", therefore a threat to society because she thinks ""independently"" - whatever that means.<br/><br/>Those like her are called ""Divergent"" and are the object of a secret witch hunt. So Tris must succeed her initiation in the adult world, while hiding her true self. <br/><br/>It could have been a mildly interesting story, but there are too many problems, both with the plot and the filming. What of the factionless? Are they also divergent or just lazy misfits? Why nobody seems to care about this main issue of their society? Isn't the elimination of the ""divergents"" too radical a way to deal with an alleged problem?<br/><br/>Finally, instead of developing a comprehensive plot, half of this very long movie is devoted to Tris' initiation into the Dauntless faction. Scene after scene are about her tests and trials moving the plot nowhere, except for the introduction of a dumb love story.<br/><br/>Targeted to the same audience of The Hunger Game, this is yet another movie that made me check the time more than once. It drags along forever and the ending is so open and silly that one can hear it screaming out loud for a sequel."

","Last year, I was dragged to this movie by my family. When the trailers were starting I said to myself, ""maybe it's not gonna be that bad, maybe I might really like it."". Then the opening narration started, and I knew I was going to be tortured. What followed was a long, (or at least felt long) crap-fest that rips off who knows how many movies. Bad acting, bad plot, bad action, and just plain bad. So far this is the only time I've fallen asleep in a theater. A lot of people are saying Shaliene Woodley is a good actress but after seeing this, I'm never going to agree with them. For Hollywood cash grabs, this is definitely one of the worst. To quote Roger Ebert, ""This is not scraping the bottom of the barrel, nor it is not under the barrel, it isn't ever the barrel.

","This movie is awesome Chicago is such a gorgeous city, and to see it transformed into a futuristic wasteland was incredibly cool. It's a romantic, packed with action and somehow seems like it could be another conspiracy theory movie. You guys have to read the book by Veronica Roth and watch the movie too. You can feel the awesomeness!Hahaha. And for this first film at least, much of the fantastical elements feels as much like window dressing as the post-apocalyptic material in After Earth. Dramatically, Divergent wanders, but over rich philosophical soil. Ouh well, enough said just watch this movie. Watch Insurgent after that. I will give another review there."
"MartinHafer","5","3","5","7 February 2015"," Diverting... but it doesn't quite hit the mark and it's just too familiar.
","To me, 2014 seems to be the year of the shallow attempt to recapture the financial magic of ""The Hunger Games"". First you had ""Divergent"" and then you had ""Maze Runner""---and all three games are aimed at the same audience and are pretty much the same movie in so many ways. All are set in a manipulative futuristic dystopia and all are aimed at creating franchises that will bring in the audiences like lemmings--ready to toss wads of cash at the studios. Don't get me wrong--these aren't bad movies but they are clearly lacking in creativity because the plots are, beneath it all, EXACTLY the same. All feature a plucky nobody who ends up somehow being different--and able to destroy the evil system despite the odds. Whatever....all I know is that because they all follow this formula there really isn't a lot to distinguish them. I say just watch ""The Hunger Games"" films and be done with it.<br/><br/>So what do I like about this film? After all, it's not a bad movie and it's pretty well made. I think the look of this futuristic dystopian Chicago is pretty amazing. I loved seeing huge swaths of the city gone green as well as the drained Lake Michigan--not to mention all of the buildings in serious states of disrepair (though this former part may not be all that different from some parts of the city today). It looked great and gave you a wonderful futuristic look. Apart from this, the script was mildly diverting and it did hold my attention. The acting was generally good. On the negative side, too many times I felt as if I needed Cliff Notes from the book to understand exactly what was happening and several times there seemed to be logical jumps that could only be explained if you assume the characters were reading these as well. I was really annoyed late in the film where the heroine is out on her mission to stop the genocide--with dozens and dozens of killers chasing her. Again and again, she kept stopping...stopping to cry, stopping to catch her breath and just stopping for dramatic effect. Hello?! Folks are chasing after you with guns....KEEP MOVING!!!! Stop stopping!!! Yet, you can only assume she knew that she could save the day so there was no hurry! <br/><br/>My overall feeling about this one is that it's good that the film has come and gone from the theaters, as I'd never recommend you pay your $10 to go see this one. However, as a DVD rental, it's about right."

Don't care how it is explained in the book, but its not explained in the movie at all. <br/><br/>Very bad story, average acting, full of clichés, very slow.<br/><br/>Even if the books are not as bad as the movie, the adaptation totally failed.

Key elements to understanding the characters and the story are missing from the film. I don't know how anyone could understand the film without reading the book. Honestly a horrible film and the screenwriter should be embarrassed.<br/><br/>Since the film has lucked into earning a lot of money and therefore sequels, hopefully they will take this as an opportunity to bring in new screenwriters and editors.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money for sure.

"Prismark10","3","3","5","25 July 2014"," Testing times
","Twilight found a teen female audience. The Hunger Games found a teen female audience. They also sold a shed-load of books.<br/><br/>Now its the turn of Divergent but this film fails. Like The Hunger Games this is a future dystopian society but this one has ever running trains that never stop at train stations. It certainly gives the phrase 'a running jump' new meaning. Even a bit of Ender's Game is thrown in here.<br/><br/>In a Chicago which is now a massively walled city after a devastating war, society is divided into five factions: Abnegation the selfless, Amity the peaceful, Candor the honest, Dauntless the brave, and Erudite the intelligent. However there is sixth group that are the faction- less who are outside society and regarded as outcasts. No one seem to questions the role of these outsiders who are left destitute.<br/><br/>Members join a faction based on their choice but are given a suggestion by an aptitude test. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) has grown up in Abnegation, the faction that runs the government, yet has always been fascinated by Dauntless. Her father serves on the ruling council along with the head of Abnegation, Marcus Eaton (Ray Stevenson).<br/><br/>Each year when kids turn 16 they go through a serum based aptitude test that indicates the faction into which they would best fit. Beatrice test shows attributes of several factions meaning she is Divergent. She is told to keep this a secret as Divergents can think independently and the government therefore cannot control them. During her choosing ceremony she becomes a Dauntless.<br/><br/>So like The Hunger Games we are told that the ruling government has magically found peace after a devastating war and everyone in society is happy apart from the faction-less. We see people happily working the land, some helping each other and the protectors running and climbing things. It certainly looks like Prozac Nation.<br/><br/>Beatrice suddenly joins other Dauntless teenagers running and jumping in and out of trains and soon becomes a super soldier. Yet she does not realise that her training superiors are less comrade in arms and are actually horrid and mean, changing the rulebook. People who fail various stages of training become faction-less and this does not ring any alarm bells that society is not what its cracked up to be.<br/><br/>However there is plot afoot for Erudite leader (Kate Winslet, unrecognisable in a blonde wig) to get rid of other Divergents and take over the government by getting rid of Eaton.<br/><br/>Apart from a silly plot that is full of holes, the acting is rather weak, the characters have no charisma and the film is dull, looks cheap, overlong which makes it drag even more.<br/><br/>Twilight had a romantic sub plot that sucked viewers in as well as dealing with issues of teens in a new town. The Hunger Games had Jennifer Lawrence, a genuine star in the making as well as the survival concept. This film has very little to offer apart from mixed messages. You soon forget which group is who and of course any viewer will realise that humans simply cannot be compartmentalised so easily as they do in this film, we all have certain mixed attributes. Therefore we are all faction-less."

Thus, a new fan base was created.The only problems with this movie were the acting was a bit shaky at some points and it diverged from the books a lot too (see what I did there).

Of course they had to cut out a few minor scenes for the length but I have never been so proud and happy.

I rate Divergent slightly even below Mortal Instrument with the same weak characterization.<br/><br/>The movie cannot bring the audience to really enter the world, the ""worry"" that their children would choose other faction was not able to be built.

"caseymoviemania","4","4","8","29 March 2014"," The cast is the least worthwhile in this lacklustre and generic young-adult dystopian thriller.
","Riding on the phenomenally successful adaptations of the first two HUNGER GAMES movies, it's simply a matter of time before Veronica Roth's best-selling novel trilogy (Divergent, Insurgent and Allegiant) is finally riped for big screen adventure. Out of the gate this year is the highly-anticipated first movie in a trilogy, DIVERGENT, which already positioned as the next HUNGER GAMES.<br/><br/>WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?<br/><br/>Set in a dystopian Chicago where society is divided into five factions based on five different personalities: Erudite (smart), Candor (honest), Amity (peaceful), Dauntless (brave) and Abnegation (selfless). Those who doesn't fit to any of the five personalities are declared factionless and they are equivalent of homeless peoples.<br/><br/>However, Beatrice ""Tris"" Prior (Shailene Woodley), who belongs to an Abnegation family with parents Natalie (Ashley Judd) and Andrew (Tony Goldwyn) and brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort), discovers that she is a Divergent after being tested by a tester named Tori (Maggie Q). Apparently Divergent is classified as someone who fit into more than one personality, and could not be discovered by anyone or risk terrible consequences.<br/><br/>When the day has arrived for a new group of teens to choose their own factions, Beatrice picks Dauntless. After the choice has been made, she has to undergo an extensive training period to become a qualified brave warrior within given time period. If fail, she will be kicked out of the faction and becomes homeless. As the training takes place, she slowly becomes friends with one of her drill instructors named Four (Theo James) and eventually falls for each other. Then one day she learns about Erudite, led by Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet), is planning to overthrow Abnegation, the humble faction which currently rules the government.<br/><br/>THE GOOD STUFF<br/><br/>The cast here is overall solid, with Shailene Woodley being the particular standout. As Tris, she manages to handle her first leading role with her engaging and soulful performance. Equally good is Theo James, who brings an unexpected warmth beneath his cool-looking exterior. In fact, both he and Woodley display believable chemistry together as eventual lovers.<br/><br/>As for the supporting actors, Jai Courtney is perfectly typecast as the no-nonsense Dauntless leader Eric, while Zoe Kravitz is likable as Tris' closest friend, Christina. Maggie Q, who plays compassionate tester Tori, manages to make full use of her limited screen time to give a worthwhile performance. Last but not least is Kate Winslet, in her rare villainous role as the power-hungry Jeanine Matthews. Although her role doesn't flesh out well, she remains plausible enough to pull off her role with her steely-eyed expression.<br/><br/>MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)<br/><br/>The engaging knife-throwing scene (which is heavily promoted in the internet) where Tris is daring enough to step in front of the knife boards and tries her best not to flinch when Four starts throwing knives at her.<br/><br/>THE BAD STUFF<br/><br/>At 139 minutes, DIVERGENT suffers badly from glacial pacing while the story -- adapted by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor -- feels bland and noticeably lack of sheer urgency needed for this kind of dystopian-thriller genre. Then there's the drab vision of dystopian Chicago which feels like a cheap-looking, B-grade movie. Overall technical credits here are disappointingly mediocre, while all the action sequences here (from fistfights to extended shootouts during the climactic finale) falls flat on the surface. It doesn't help either when the action is mostly ruined by shaky camera-work.<br/><br/>To top that off, it's a surprise that Neil Burger's previous directing credits, such as the magic-themed period drama THE ILLUSIONIST (2006) and mystery thriller LIMITLESS (2011), who has a knack for showing versatility when tackling different genres, seems to be clueless directing DIVERGENT. I was shocked to see his direction here is terribly pedestrian and dare I say, lifeless as well.<br/><br/>FINAL WORDS<br/><br/>Overall, DIVERGENT is a waste of opportunity and a weak start to a potentially exciting new movie franchise. Hopefully, the subsequent two sequels (INSURGENT and ALLEGIANT) will show some improvements in the future."

","The United States of America is not what we once knew – the nation was split and the government was run out by factions – 5 to be exact: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless and Erudite. With everyone in these factions it was going to be a peaceful world until one day one girl, one test result can change the way our minds can change who we are – Divergent! One faction the Erudite comes in and destroys the peaceful nation by catapulting a ruthless attempt to rid the world of Divergents and the overrule the government so they can get their way with the leadership of one woman – Jeanine Matthews (played beautifully by Kate Winslet.) I don't want to spoil the rest of the movie for the people who have not seen the movie but I will say this – this movie was lacking in some places where things were left unsaid, action was left out and things were changed up a bit.<br/><br/>This movie was an awesome way of letting dive into a young writers mind of how she sees the world, Veronica Roth who at the time was 23 when she wrote this book. The book was action packed and so was the movie, matter of fact the movie was incredible. The cast ranging from Shailene Woodley to Theo James to the wonderful Ashley Judd and Zoe Kravitz (yes that is Lenny's daughter!) to the villainous Kate Winslet.<br/><br/>But the question remains is: Which faction will you choose? Let's hope Insurgent delivers."

","I watched this for about 30-40 minutes before being grasped by startling boredom and being forced to leave the theatre to watch something else. A lot of things about this movie made me unable to watch it any longer, mainly I just felt bored by the performances of the main characters. the main guy and girl I felt I had no interest to watch at all. When compared to other big movies at this time like smaug or Robocop, I found this does not even compare to those movies. This movie is about rebelling against a system put into place for whatever reason, but it sounds like an attempt to control and enforce subjugation, and a few people have the fore sight to attempt to break out, the idea itself is not too bad it's the way that the movie goes about to implement this idea, through dream scenarios where you attempt to react according to a dream, but give me a break. How can you actually believe your even in a dream in the first place? The movie wants you to attempt this is possible by injecting you with a needle, I just found that to be absolutely absurb and silly. This movie fails to teach anything it uses a lame character build up and pointless romance to enforce this and i'm not buying it. I recommend don't waste your time on this one , unless your really really bored and are easily impressed with lame fight sequences and a cheesy story that has no back story and no explanation to enforce how any of this could ever be feasible. bbbbooorinnnggg."
"Tweekums","8","2","3","10 July 2019"," A solid 'young adult' dystopia
","This, the first film of three, is set in a world one hundred years after a cataclysmic war. Chicago is effectively a city state and as far as anybody knows there is no civilisation beyond the city. Society is divided into five factions to which people join based on their character type. These are Abnegation, the selfless who are also the governors; Amity, the kind who farm; Erudite, the intelligent; Dauntless, the brave who form the police/army; and Candor, the honest who serve justice. At sixteen people are tested to see which faction best suits them before making the choice as to which they join. Beatrice ""Tris"" Prior, the daughter of Abnegation parents, is one such youngster but her tests are inconclusive... she is 'Divergent'; one with strengths in multiple areas. She is cautioned that she must hide this as Divergents are considered dangerous. The next day she joins Dauntless and begins her training; if she does badly she risks failure and being declared factionless but if she does too well she could be identified as Divergent and killed... if that weren't enough she learns that the leadership of Erudite is planning to overthrow Abnegation.<br/><br/>From the moment the world is described it is clear that the viewer will need to be able to suspend their disbelief... the idea that almost everybody will fit into one of the five described factions and Divergents will be rare seems unlikely. However if you can accept that the film is rather fun. The story may not provide many surprises but there are plenty of exciting moments as Tris and her fellow Dauntless recruits undergo initiations and training. There is also frequently a sense of real danger. Tris; as played by Shailene Woodley, who impressed in the role, is a fine protagonist and other key characters are solid too. The film has high production values with a realistic look and impressive effects. Some have compared this to films like 'The Hunger Games' but while there are some similarities I didn't really think about them at the time. Overall I thought this was as solid addition to the young adult dystopia genre... you certainly don't have to be a teenage girl to enjoy it. I'll certainly be watching the other films in the series."

No combat roles like infantry, medical, support etc. No clear hierarchy like sergeant or captain. No radio???<br/><br/>Erudites - Why didn't they used the serum on the Abnegation people? If the Erudite ones are so smart why did the only way they could think in gaining power was with the most primitive way, violent revolution? Didn't they know about propaganda, social engineering, media control or any modern form of coup?<br/><br/>Factionless - Looks like the only ones that are actually free.<br/><br/>Amity - Not portrayed in this movie.<br/><br/>Candor - Don't appear in this movie too.<br/><br/>General Comments - Mediocre acting and poor writing.

"Coventry","5","2","3","14 January 2019"," In the faction there's too much friction
","Okay, apparently the post 2010-world likes dystopian Sci-Fi/Fantasy fables made for, and preferably starring, teenage girls. I realize I'm just an old whiner, but these nowadays dystopian stories are soft and weak compared to the terrific and similarly themed films of the 70s, like ""Soylent Green"" or ""Z.P.G"". What was the typical and almost even logical thing to do for Hollywood producers upon noticing the tremendous success of the adaptation of Suzanne Collins' ""The Hunger Games""? Find more reminiscent novels to turn into massively hyped and over-funded film franchises, of course! Neil Burger (""The Illusionist"", ""Limitless"") chose for the books written by the young author Veronica Roth. The main idea behind ""Divergent"" certainly isn't too bad. In the soulless Chicago of the near future, society is divided into five different factions that each have their own color of clothing to illustrate what type of people they are, like grey for abnegation or blue for erudite. Children are born in the factions of their parents and can remain there for the rest of their lives, or they can choose to move to one of the four other factions at the age of sixteen. There exist psychological tests to help you decide which faction suits you the best, because once you made the choice it's forbidden to change again. When the seemingly ordinary teen Beatrice takes the test, however, the outcome is ""divergent"" and this should be kept secret as divergent people are considered uncontrollable, rebellious and a menace to this formula of a peacefully structured society. Beatrice makes the instinctive but illogical choice to join the Dauntless faction, where she must battle daily to become accepted, becomes infatuated by the hunky but mysterious Four and stumbles upon a conspiracy to re-arrange the factions that looks an awful lot like genocide. As said, ""Divergent"" certainly isn't bad and even qualifies as decent entertainment on a Friday night with a bucket of popcorn and a medium-sized beer, but the script is so frustratingly unsurprising and predictable! The supposedly clever plot twists, like the dark secrets of Four or the mysterious background of Tris' mother Nathalie, are so abundantly obvious that you honestly begin to question the level of intellect of the target audience. There isn't a single thing happening in ""Divergent"" that you can't see coming from three railways stations away and, astonishingly enough, Neil Burger doesn't do anything to put his mark on the film. The action footage is very tame, clearly because the producers wanted to maintain the PG-13 rating no matter what, and the use of special effects or futuristic gimmicks is kept to a minimum, which makes you wonder on what they spent the massive $80 million budget. Perhaps on Kate Winslet's erudite haircut?"

","I decided since this was my mother's 75th birthday to check out the first of the 'Divergent' series, since I love Kate Winslet and Ashley Judd, and Neil Burger's earlier 'Limitless' was intriguing and decent for recent sci-fi.

It's a half hour too long, given epic treatment when it deserves far less, and the dialogue's terrible, as if a high school student had written it. I'll pass on any sequels.

","DIVERGENT is another in a long line of recent Hollywood 'young adult' movies, inevitably based on long-running book series and designed to cash in on the same market as the TWILIGHT saga or the HARRY POTTER franchise. This one's almost exactly the same as THE HUNGER GAMES, featuring a dystopian future world (is there any other type?) split into five different factions. Teenagers must choose a faction in which to live for the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>Yes, it's exactly like somebody watched or read the first Harry Potter film/novel, decided that the whole sorting hat thing was a cool motif and that they could write a whole book series with it applied to real life. Unfortunately, that opening plot point is the only thing this film has going for it, as the rest of it is mere set-up. We watch characters interacting, getting to know one another, and training - lots and lots of TRAINING - for over two hours before an action narrative sort of hits in the last half hour.<br/><br/>The lack of incident and completely predictability of what's taking place on screen - we've been through all this training stuff before in the first two HUNGER GAMES movies and it was boring then - make DIVERGENT a real chore to sit through. I don't know why these films have to have such lengthy running times and so much exposition when all of the stuff we see could have been depicted in a mere half an hour with a handful of pithy moments instead of endless self-indulgence and stretched-out moments. CGI training sequences are not something I enjoy watching.<br/><br/>What I did like about DIVERGENT is that it has decent characterisation for once, much better than in the Jennifer Lawrence franchise. Shailene Woodley is a decent young actress and completely sympathetic in the lead role, and newcomer Theo James makes an impact as her mentor. The supporting cast features the impressive likes of Jai Courtney, Ray Stevenson, and Tony Goldwyn, alongside more minor bits for Kate Winslet and Maggie Q, and overall the calibre of the acting is strong. It's just a shame that there's no story to go with the characters; I can accept and enjoy well-plotted movies without characterisation, but a film with good characters and no plot is doomed from the outset. We'll see where the sequels go with this..."

But, allowing for some plot holes and similar, I wish the setting had been more interesting and understandable. Maybe this will be more in focus in the later movies?

I was wrong. The main thing this movie suffers from is too much exposition. Which may make for a clearer and more enjoyable sequel does not make for a good first movie. A lot of the time I had to stifle my groans when yet another ambiguous monologue began to expand upon in a sequel "" Our founders built a wall after the big war..."" sort of thing. This movie did not bring anything new to the table and instead tried to bring concepts and ideas from older, better movies to a younger audience in the hopes they could attempt to pass it off as original work. Then of course there are the performances. While I don't dispute Shailene Woodley as a competent actress she really didn't shine for me in Divergent. Playing the same unrealistically brave and contemplative teenager who will save the world with special abilities we've seen countless times before. Kate Winslet was somewhat decent, but with such mind numbing material to work with she too did not particularly shine for me.

","I used to be an avid movie watcher not too long ago. All sorts of movies: action, comedies, dramas, thrillers; you name it, I left no genre stone unturned. Unfortunately, it got to the point where every new movie I watched felt like a rehash of something I had seen before. I have been on a movie hiatus for about 4 years since then. I have still watched movies in this span of time but not as many as I used to. I do not observe them as carefully as I used to and don't consequently write reviews about them either. However, something about this movie awakened the critical beast within me. I have not seen such a plot less movie pretending to be deep in a long time and I need to write about it to feel like I didn't waste 2 hours of my life on nothing.<br/><br/>What is this movie about, you may wonder? In a dystopian future, human beings are split into 5 factions. I don't remember the names of these factions and I won't bother to look them up. But basically, you have labourers, farmers, scientists, charity workers and the army. The charity workers also happen to be politicians and the scientists are jealous and want to be the politicians so they hatch an evil scheme to take over. Also, there are people who don't fit into factions and they are called 'divergent' (and are presumably talented at everything the other factions excel at), aka our main character Tris. The authorities don't like divergent very much because umm they couldn't think of a faction name for them I guess? Actually, the movie logic is that they can't be controlled. But why not? Just make a different faction for them and now you have them in line right? Oh well, let's just ignore that and take a leap of faith. The basic plot isn't anything I haven't seen before, and I've been out of touch with movies for the last few years. A lone teen/young adult in a dystopian rebelling against the really bad system that rejects them. Several movies have attempted this before, including Equilibrium, The Hunger Games etc. Does this movie do anything well enough for me to forget about the aforementioned fact? No, not really. The acting is bad, the music is annoying and the characters are terribly written.<br/><br/>The acting is incredibly hammy. Sometimes the actors tend to overact while at other instances, they can't conjure up simple emotions. It gives the movie world a very dead feel to it. For example, a scene that is supposed to be rather dramatic towards the end of the movie has our main character bawling her eyes out like a maniac, while a similar 'tragedy' occurs a few minutes later and she doesn't bat an eye. The villain played by Kate Winslet is also emotionally dead and shows no acting range at all. Perhaps it's because English isn't my native language but I had a very difficult time making out the dialogue at times. The actors' speech felt very mumbled and incoherent.<br/><br/>The music is very off balanced. Much of the time it overtakes the dialogue. Additionally, a lot of it isn't original music composed for the movie but popular radio songs instead which I always find a cop out when it comes to movie soundtracks. One of the scenes has knives being thrown around Tris by her instructor. It's supposed to be very intense and the music makes sure it tells us that by being very obnoxiously loud every time the instructor throws the knife. Similarly other scenes, particularly action scenes, have a very terrible use of music that distracts from the movie.<br/><br/>The characters. Where do I even start? The main character, Tris, has to be one of the blandest characters since Bella from Twilight to be ever put on screen. She has absolutely no personality. Yes, she's 'Divergent', but what else? What does she like to eat, does she like animals, does she have any hobbies, does she like to screw around with her friends? The filmmakers made sure they don't address these questions at all, so we're left with nothing but a blank slate of a character. The other characters aren't any better in terms of development. The romance subplot is so forced, its borderline laughable. 'Hey, I touched you tattoo, let's have PG-13 intercourse now!' is the gist of the romance. The villain (Winslet) is pretty boring as well. 'I don't like human nature very much as it leads to violence so I'll use violence to destroy human nature' is her philosophy. None of the characters are interesting or have any sort of development throughout the story. The romantic interest is just a pretty face, the bad guy goons are well goons, and the main character's friends are just present as decoration pieces.<br/><br/>Even after ignoring the unoriginal and silly plot, the movie doesn't offer anything that will make me want to look at it in a positive light. Weak characters, horrid music placement and cheesy acting clutter the movie throughout. How this had enough of a following to warrant a TV show, I will never know."

It looked good, something like Hunger Games, but I didn't have a strong desire to see it. Maybe because I read the Hunger Games books first and not this one, but it still interested me. I have to say, the previews did not successfully ""preview"" what the movie was actually about.<br/><br/>What happened to the whole divergent thing? It was touched on briefly during the main character's test (lord, I already forgot her name) and it was made a big deal of by the lady giving her test, and it was mentioned maybe three more times here and there, but this was not about a girl being divergent and at risk from her society because she was, like the previews made it sound. The previews made it seem that she was divergent, but not welcome in her society, and therefore had to learn to survive with others like her. The movie was nothing like this. For a movie that was categorized in the same genre as Hunger Games (teen survival) it definitely fell short.<br/><br/>I have a feeling this series is going to turn into a franchise that could have been told in one book/movie.

I mean, what is the target group here? 13 years old teenagers? Furthermore, the whole film has absolutely no sense. The main problem of the character is that she is not clearly oriented into a faction because she is intelligent, brave, has compassion and she's kind. What a nonsense. <br/><br/>Further more into this, the acting is just terrible, like if someone would pick a random person and ask him/her to say these lines. Only exception is the death scene with the mother of the heroine where the acting is bad/mediocre. All the rest is not even acting. No dialogs, no strong scenes, not even one monologue, nothing. <br/><br/>2 stars only for the fact that this was not shot in a camcorder, and for casting Winslet (what was she thinking...)"

What bothered me most was how poorly they explained the sci-fi elements. Just picture this, a guy goes up to you and tells you he will inject you with a substance that will cause hallucinations. BUT if you somehow find out that its not real, then you are a Divergent. The guy just bloody told you its a hallucination. What an effective method. And if the serum didn't work on Divergent, how was it working at the end of the movie? We are never told. But it seems nowadays, science fiction adaptations don't need to make sense. Just throw some action at the audience to make them forget the numerous plot holes. That being said, the acting was solid and the cinematography as well.

","Here are the pivotal problems from my memory after barely watching it once (while playing on my phone): (warning some of these are spoilers)<br/><br/>1) When Tris gets the flag it was because the guard was not guarding the only grate leading up to that position. Not science but retarded none the less. Further how the hell did that guard use all her bullets when Tris was the 1st person up the tower? Whatever.<br/><br/>2) Three men couldn't push a 100lb girl over a ledge. Whatever. When she is rescued by her boytoy, he didn't bother removing their masks to see who they are when he had all day to do it while they were down.<br/><br/>3) Brains can be wiped and reprogrammed with chemicals. No that's not how brain physiology works. If you wipe completely then you would be a vegetable because the only way to do so is to destroy pathways that form action, intent and memory. You cannot wipe a mind by chemical means without wiping it entirely. It might be doable with nano machines but this particular future does not even have guided weapons. Nano tech is beyond their ability. Hell their scientists are actually emotional pansy politicians. Retarded.<br/><br/>4) Apparently ""divergence"" is the only way one can be a threat to society. Yea right. Apparently with all the collective knowledge of the science group, this is the conclusion they came up. They actually believe that the most deviant of society are the ones with the greatest intelligence and potential not those with low self esteem, low intelligence, and shallow personalities. But that is too much for them to figure out I guess. Some scientists they are... and you expect them to have nanotech? Its like expect al kaida to invent the 1st sentient AI lol.<br/><br/>5) The ending was not as dramatic as the movie made it out to be. Finding a vial on the floor with an applicator is not quick thinking, its obvious and embarrassing (that she and her boy toy didn't figure it out sooner).<br/><br/>6) The romance innuendo was unbelievable. Its worse than a Mexican soap. There was no reason whatsoever for that guy to be so overwhelmingly interested in her and willing to risk everything for her. Its like a bad high school drama.<br/><br/>7) Actions scenes were worse than comedy action scenes. Bullets seem to go around the main character like a cartoon. Also no one seems to remember how to shoot when engages against her. Also she miraculously becomes an expert shot after being the worst shot during training. They should have just given her throwing knives and have her fly across roof tops like kung fu movies.<br/><br/>Retarded movie for low IQ teens."

","I had some hope for this movie until perhaps 20 minutes in. While I wouldn't disregard the possibilities inherent in even a fairly derivative rendering of the post-apocalyptic World Order made tolerable by an instituting of castes -- based upon an amalgam of Platonic categories and the societal reductionism of a Brave New World ethos -- I was quickly dismayed, even put off, by the conventionalist attitudes and cultural inhibitions of the characters as such. One is supposedly to be disturbed, perhaps traumatized, by the expectation that defecation is to be consummated in an open bay of toilets; the ""mess hall"" scene that follows, while suggestive only of the utilitarian efficiency of an industrial, prison-like dining facility, is rendered trivial and basely comic by a dual commentary upon the ingesting of ""hamburger"", followed by an absurd and pseudo-intellectual analysis of the food in question. Never having suffered the indignities of Boot Camp in any branch of the military; terrified of exposing their bowel movements to one another in a jail cell; reviled at the prospect of eating lousy fast food -- the privileged participants in this plastic vision of a possible future fail at the outset with their pedestrian and Bourgeois lack of vital capacity or open-mindedness."

The writing was poor, inconsistent and very basic it could not compete with other action superhero's movies released in the last couple of years. <br/><br/>I gave a 6 because i find the directing and the cast were good, they made the movie stand out.

"The-Sarkologist","6","2","3","12 April 2014"," Not a bad movie, but the plot didn't seem to work that well
","I'm not really sure about this movie because it seemed to be a little rushed, especially at the end. In fact it seemed to be one of those movies where a young person joins the army, spends three quarters of the movie doing basic training, and then the last quarter of the movie going out and saving the world – the only difference is that this movie is set far in the future after a major war where society has split into five interdependent clans that are each based upon a virtue (bravery, honesty, compassion, etc) and that once one joins a clan (based on a ceremony at the age of 16) then one cannot step out of the clan into another clan. The people are also tested to see which clan they best suit, however during that testing it can come out that one does not necessarily fit into a single clan, making them divergent.<br/><br/>To be honest with you I could not really see how the idea of the divergent being dangerous was and why they needed to kill them. In fact the whole concept didn't really work all that well for me. It wasn't a bad movie, if in a way you don't mind a bit of action, but on the whole it didn't seem to make all that much sense, with the whole section involving the training and then the attempted coup at the end. This further added problems to the whole concept, namely that if the system had been set up to prevent conflict in the future, then why was it that, all of a sudden, a conflict arose in the form of an attempted coup. It seemed that, on the basis of the plot of the movie, that the whole system has essentially failed.<br/><br/>There is also some Christian themes in the movie, which have come about from the author's statements that she is a Christian, and when one looks at it one can see right-wing Christian ideas coming out of this book. Basically it represents the ongoing conflict between the extreme church (as represented by Abnegation) and the extreme scientific community (as represented by Erudite) however, it also comes down in how you perceive the nature of the story, because Abnegation can also represent that aspect of society that supports the planned, egalitarian society, while the Erudite supports a free-market, might means right, form of society, and we see these aspects within the warrior caste, where those that don't make the grade are cast out and become factionless, and then the apparent coup against the ruling faction on the grounds that they horde the food, and hand it out to those who do not work for it."
"lasttimeisaw","6","2","3","1 April 2014"," THE HUNGER GAMES 2.0 is born
","Following suit of TWILIGHT SAGA and THE HUNGER GAMES, another young adult franchise embarks on its lucrative conquest, DIVERGENT, shares the same dystopia milieu in the future as THE HUNGER GAMES and a teenage female protagonist, Tris (Woodley), who fights to be fit in a world divided by five factions according to five virtues (erudite, dauntless, amity, abnegation and candour), but she is born to be a maverick who defies categorisation and is so-called a divergent. She joins the Dauntless and meets the mysterious Four (James), the trainer of the initiates, together their romance is budding through the training programs; then they discover Erudite leader Jeanne (Winslet) is scheming to annihilate and usurp the Abnegation faction (which is the present authority and where Tris' parents belong) to be the ruling class, meanwhile Dauntless members are hypnotised as the killing machine, only the divergent are immune to it. So by the end of the first chapter of the trilogy, they temporarily sabotage Jeanne's plan, which persists in eradicating the weakness aka. human nature out of human beings, but as cheesy as it sounds, actually love cannot be eradicated. <br/><br/>Visual effects are mediocre at its best, the paralleled shift between the virtual and real world is less glamorous but pertinent to the engaging buildup of Tris' character, the mid-way rope- sliding in the night is a catharsis to feel thrilled and emboldened. The white-knuckle, adrenaline-driven, money-spending high point was never set alight, the entire procedure to scotch the scheme looks jejune, the last ditch to turn Jeanne into doing Tris' bidding is a knockout, but before that, the whole plan is a disorganised hash, the puny suspense agglomerated through the acting-like-robots gimmick never pay off, not to mention a hasty design to kill off Tris' parents, who else is psyched and wants to watch Ashley Judd kick more asses? <br/><br/>On the philosophical ground, a future nation originated by Veronica Roth actually makes more sense than say, THE HUNGER GAMES (2012, 7/10), a virtue-divided society could be an ideal notion if only multiple options are applied. Our current spirit is that we should never be classified as any types, multifariousness is the keynote, so the vehement repercussions of its novel sources are totally justifiable. <br/><br/>Shailene Woodley is the key to the success of the franchise, a timid next-door-girl as the first impression, but she has a dogged willpower, dare to chase her dream and bear a heroine's affinity, it is her star-making turn after her breakthrough in THE DESCENDANTS (2011, 8/10). Theo James, memorably remembered in his one-episode only guest appearance in the British sensational hit DOWNTON ABBEY (the unfortunate Mr. Pamuk), is a new rising star, DIVERGENT is his well-suited springboard, it is never too late to be a hot teen throb. Winslet, for the first time as a villainess in a studio project, similar to Jodi Foster in ELYSIUM (2013, 7/10), harbouring a high-flown goal but has little to offer except her evil mindset.<br/><br/>I think I will be looking forward to the chapter two because I am hooked to see what will happen in the following step, which I have no clue since I prefer movie to book as a media to chiefly dispense my energy with, at any rate, THE HUNGER GAMES 2.0 is officially on and a young heart dies hard."

The story takes time to find its feet, and while the action sequences was great, the vast number of characters kind of put things in the mix for this decent young adult novel adaptation.<br/><br/>The world felt a bit weird and extreme at first, and it takes time before we can finally believe and be immersed in the world. Meanwhile, story-wise was great in the bigger picture, but the first half of the film was all about Dauntless and so it flows in a very narrow scope. Afterwards, the bigger picture is revealed, when we finally realize the significance of ""Divergent"" characters, and the scale of the conflict. That's when the story kind of takes a hard turn and get going for a full blast finale.<br/><br/>The vast number of characters makes it hard to follow most of the supporting characters, making things a little confusing, all the while making us less caring for them. Yet, this also means that we can kind of like the main protagonists. With all the different kind of characters, those we want to hate, those we don't care for, leaving us with the main protagonists to like and root for. This is perhaps the reason why we can care for them emotionally, despite the less emotional nature of the unfolding plot. The first half of the film has no drama for us to feel, while in the second, there was too much of drama where we end up getting lost emotionally (in the end, all I care about is the two main protagonists).<br/><br/>The visuals were great, and so were the action sequences, supported by a decent soundtrack with some very likable themes as well. The villain of the film was interesting on its own & fresh for a new franchise like this, and the acting by Kate Winslet was also brilliant, but to be frank, they will need a more threatening & challenging villain if they are to up the stakes for the sequels (truthfully, it is well decided in the novels already, but given that I don't read them, I cross my fingers that the next villain will prove more challenging). The twist towards the end is interesting, and quite a nice touch as well. Meanwhile, the ending felt much too abrupt and unfinished, and it just begs of a sequel to come fast.<br/><br/>VERDICT:<br/><br/>Good: Great visuals & action, Decent soundtrack, Unique setting, Vast array of characters (mixed)<br/><br/>Bad: Takes time to find its feet, Abrupt ending<br/><br/>SCORE: 7.0<br/><br/>(blockbusted9.blogspot.com)"

This just popped on my ""Recommended"" list and I gave it a chance.<br/><br/>The characters are fleshed-out and the cast does a stellar job of portraying them. Although it felt like Caleb's character was severely underused. It's a shame in that department, really. Al is another character that doesn't match up with the plot and feels underused. It almost felt like there are missing scenes that have been cut that could've developed Al's character in the movie that would finally line up with the movie's plot. And one last thing that I'd like to just lay out there is that Andrew Prior's fate seemed extremely forced and for the sake of plot convenience. Like Tris didn't even bat an eye to what happened. It's as if she's in a sim, not the others. Again, felt like missing scenes, & felt like the director was in a hurry to finish the film.<br/><br/>It's a very satisfying sci-fi action movie. The plot is linear, but very enjoyable and relatable. It sets up a sci-fi franchise tactfully, and maintains it's tight action plot up until the end. One of the major reasons of what makes this movie good is it's high octane plot.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is just awesome at the beginning but after the movie crossed it's intermission it felt ""kinda"" forced.

","While The Hunger Games really cornered the market in the ""young adult dystopian future"" category, many authors jumped on the bandwagon to cash in on this phenomenon. I'll admit that many of these series that got movie adaptations I had never heard of before and likely will not see/read. The Divergent series, though did stand out as the top of ""the rest"".<br/><br/>It can be difficult to create a dystopian world, especially one that's at least somewhat set in our current one. The CGI-modified Chicago looks pretty good for a city that's been through what it has, but where the computer imagery really comes to shine is in the dream sequences. I would have liked them to be a little more obvious so the audience isn't always guessing if it's a dream or not, but that's part of the charm, I suppose. Having since read the book this was based on, I do have to say that the director made some good decisions on what areas to cut in order to keep the intent of the book, but at a pace that works better for a film. In fact, the dream sequences were even more difficult to pin down in the book than they were in the movie, so the film did a good job with that.<br/><br/>However, this film still struggles with the ""teenage angst"" that many YA adaptations have. Of course, because of this and the aforementioned CGI, this film does get the feeling like it's a mashup of The Hunger Games and Avatar: The Last Airbender. That being said, the plot and societal structure felt thoroughly thought out and it truly helped distinguish between character archetypes when they are connected to specific colors.<br/><br/>Surprisingly well-developed plot and characters with a good visual feel, I give Divergent 4.0 stars out of 5."

Divergent has a much better and more intriguing setting than the Hunger Games, and from the beginning of the movie, I was drawn into the world of the factions and how to co-depend on one another. Whilst with the Hunger Games, I was desperate for ANY source of interest in the setting.
Each actor gives this performance their best, and though I'm not a huge fan of Tris as a character, Shailene Woodley makes me root for her and gives a strong performance. Jai Courtney also gives an amazing performance as Eric and makes him much more intimidating than in the books.
Obviously, the plot is slightly overdone with the ""two teens who are special live in a post-apocalyptic world"". But Divergent offers an interesting setting with interesting characters. It's not the best movie, but I certainly enjoyed it more than the hopeless and depressing Hunger Games. I watched this with my family, who all said they thoroughly enjoyed it, and I would recommend it to anyone who asks."

","This wasn't too bad a movie. Let's see if you find yourself drawing comparisons to The Hunger Games. A dystopian future (how many of those have we seen?) set in Chicago, where life is divided into 5 sanctions, and Tris's ""test"" in inconclusive and she winds up choosing the ""dauntless"" sanction and surviving a rather brutal militaristic set of tests to get in. It turns out her mother went thru the same thing.<br/><br/>The movie features decent action scenes and good performances as well as some good scenes where they try to ""scare"" the people trying to get into dauntless. I like the latter scenes. This is basically a movie about fitting in. Based on the other reviews, you will either love it or hate it. The cast worked well together.<br/><br/>** 1/2 out of ****"

The characters DO NOT fit their descriptions. Will, peter, and al all look the same which is extremely confusing.

"mgruebel","6","1","1","13 October 2015"," You will grow up and your parents will die eventually
","The film is not at all bad, if one takes it on its own terms: a fairytale disguised as young adult movie. It has all the ingredients: a surreal environment, moralism, odd characters (puss-in-boots, seven dwarfs anyone?). The message is the same dark message found in many fairy tales: You will grow up, the world is bad, and your parents will die.<br/><br/>Shailene Woodley as ""Tris"" has to grow up fast when Kate Winslet, leader of the brainiacs in a quintipartite society that lives in the fenced-in ruins of Chicago after WW III, decides it's time for the smart guys to take over. Tris joins the ""Dauntless,"" the solider-faction that keeps the peace among brains, public servants, growers, and truth speakers (meet the press of the future?), not counting the homeless. As a ""Divergent"" who embodies elements of all five factions, Tris confronts the master plan, and in the process, she must face her worst fears, find love, and see her parents die as she loses the innocence of her childhood. In this fairy tale, Tris and her Divergent boyfriend are thus the only full humans, or real people. The viewer will identify more with some factions than with others, but of course we are all divergent, and so it is easy to identify with Tris.<br/><br/>There are problems that keep this well-intentioned film from reaching higher. For one thing, the dystopia is so sad (like a particularly grim Brothers Grimm tale), that I would have rooted for the brains, had their plan not included killing a fifth of the population. That plan is not very brainy. Why not just inflict the mind-control potion on the public servants directly, instead of on the soldiers? No killing needed, more population to do the bidding of the brains. If I were a scientist, that's how I would have arranged things...but wait - I am a scientist!<br/><br/>In a fairy tale, we must not dig too deep for logic. Instead, there is a well-paced story with sympathetic lead characters, villains who are bad but convinced of their own goodness (almost always true of real political villains), and the moral pontificating is fairly minimalistic. I found it quite watchable for 2 hours and 17 minutes, although it would have been better with about 25 minutes cut out. That's true for many overly long action movies nowadays - few can hold to the line like Besson's ""Taken"", a 90 minute fairy tale of princess in distress rescued by the king that's a good notch above this film because it is concise.<br/><br/>Decently executed view-once coming-of-age story, like Hunger Games or Mazerunner."

","This film is the same old played out, clichéd, macho man is tough on girl then helps girl then falls in love with girl with an extra side of smart mouthed bullying jerk bullying said girl film. Along with the played out story line and plot this film was filled with mediocre acting and tired character lines. After seeing this film I can now legitimately compare it to ""The Hunger Games"", since everyone else does. There really is no comparison. ""The Hunger Games"" is better. ""Divergent"" is really more like a knock off, I'm not trying to be cruel but that's kind of what it is, of course with some differences. In this film society is broken down into the brave, the peaceful, the intelligent, the selfless, and the honest, but a divergent is someone who's mind is versatile and can carry themselves in any lethal situation. The average person has at least two or more of these traits at the same time so I think almost everyone in that society would be a divergent. Because this film is almost like the ""The Hunger Games"" some people who enjoyed ""The Hunger Games"" will probably enjoy this one but in my opinion ""The Hunger Games"" is better."

","Watching this movie was like watching ""Twilight"" (except nowhere near as bad), ""The Hunger Games"" (Because of government Totalitarian, ""Harry Potter"" because of the class system and factions, and a bit of ""Inception. Overall this is another teenage romance movie that totally has that written by the mind of a teenage girl that fantasize a lot all over it. But this one is impressive for something that has been written by a girl in her early 20's. I could tell how this story emulates from other stories, but it has enough creativity to make it it's own. Although the ""Inception"" like device that works like something along the lines of the Scarecrow fear gas concept can be a little too much. Even if it plays a big role in the story. So what this movie is, is a sci-fi dystopia romance flick about couple of teens standing up and rebelling against a over controlling government. So yeah, the premise has been done before. Especially in certain animes. This movie is directed pretty well and the cinematography is decent for a movie such as this. But I actually liked the message behind this movie, which revolves around choosing your own path and not be fearful of what others think of you. That your life is your own and others should not play a part in controlling or manipulating you. Overall, this movie was alright.

","I was very disappointed in this movie. I read the book before watching it and I was very surprised with the inaccuracy of the plot. Many key details were left out and were changed beyond recognition. Many scenes angered me with the complete and utter disregard for the book. I was appalled. Some key details like Edward being stabbed in the eye, the relationship between Tris and Four (Tobias) came out of no where as in the book it had been developed from the first look between the two. Edward leaving Dauntless is a key in Insurgent and there was no development of that character. Tris's mother visiting her on visiting day, Tris and Tobias climbing to the top and having their moment, Christina getting the flag instead of Tris, paint balls instead of darts, Jeanine showing up where she is not supposed to be. This movie would have been much better if they would have followed the book. I was very disappointed this movie. I gave it two stars instead of one because it did follow some of the plot, loosely. This movie was a good movie, but I would have liked the details of the book to follow the details in the movie."

","Well, yea, this movie was Divergent all right. Diverged right off the rails from the book in a matter of seconds. If you read the book, and you liked the book, then don't watch this movie. It sucks! Bad acting. Bad story (cause they didn't follow the book). Bad choice of who to play the characters. I feel sorry for Kate Winslet, who played Jeanine. This is such a drop from Titanic or Finding Neverland.<br/><br/>I did like the actor choice OF Kate and Jai, as Eric. They were good. Theo was just all wrong for the part of Four. And Four is the reason I enjoyed the books so much. In the book he was a bad-ass, but a softie. I just did not feel that at all in the movie. It was hard to pick out who was who in the movie too. And I mean like Peter, Will, and Al. They just did not have developed characters in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie totally skipped over the fact that an initiate died jumping from the train to the roof. It didn't even go near Peter stabbing the one kid in the eye. It didn't develop Al well enough to know why he was part of the attack on Tris, or even why she was being attacked in the first place.<br/><br/>For God's sake Four wasn't even the one running the attack simulation in the movie.<br/><br/>The fighting part for stage one was a joke. And there was no relationship building between Four and Tris. Four's fear landscape I thought was a mess. He didn't even say ""Can you figure out why they call me Four, and what my name is"". I thought that was an important part of the book.<br/><br/>There is no way that I'm going to watch Insurgent after that. And I'm going to have to re-read Divergent to get the movie out of my head.<br/><br/>There is only one other book-to-movie movie that is worse off than this one, and that is Eragon. How this movie is getting a 6.8 rating on IMDb I'll never know. Most of those 273,000 people must not have read the book."
"SupremeBlue","1","1","1","1 May 2015"," Where do I even start...
","This movie was so horrible that I made an account to write a review for it. I haven't read the books and I after seeing this movie I'm sure I never will. The acting is bad. The story is bad. This movie is bad.<br/><br/>It's a story about a girl who's 'Divergent'. She's supposed to be so special because she has more than just one quality... WHAT EVEN??? This is about 99% of all the people in the entire world what is so special about this? What makes her so dangerous? That she can think like a normal human being? WOW yeah that's dangerous yep totally she can...think. Whew.<br/><br/>This movie is so predictable. The time I wasted watching this movie because a friend recommended it I can never get back. <br/><br/>From the moment the 'cool-mysterious-I'm good at everything-hot-bad guy, but wait! He has a soft side!!"" is introduced I knew where this was going. Of course he falls in love with the significantly younger looking special snowflake heroine who went from one of the worst in the group to one of the best in a time span of what seemed a week at best. Why does he fall in love with her? Who knows? Who cares? He's hot that's all that matters. Why does she fall in love with him? I bet it was that one line ""What makes you think you can talk to me?"". Yeah that must be it, he really got her with that one... What???? <br/><br/>Really this is what pisses me off. This movie suffers from ""Damsel in distress needs bad-guy-with-soft-side"" Syndrome. They have literally NO reason to fall in love. After the scene where she touched his tattoo and they suddenly start tongue wrestling I had to take a break. <br/><br/>The scene where he lets her into his mind and all he seems to be able to do is make a sarcastic joke is just so bad. Aren't these supposed to be your deepest and worst fears? Yeah mhm, you got that across, yep. Really nothing in this movie is believable. <br/><br/>She kills Will, one of her friends and all she says is 'I killed him. I killed him."" If this was supposed to be an emotional moment I must have missed it because I started laughing. Why would I care that he's dead? I know nothing about him.<br/><br/>The scene in which the boyfriend is taken by the bad guys was just ridiculous. Why take him with you? Don't they kill special snowfla- I mean Divergents? And then when she's finally at the place where they keep him they just stand around them with their weapons while her boyfriend magically snaps out of it. Why they didn't shoot the two Divergents while they were on the ground? Who knows? Who cares? Pointless puppy love is in the air. Oh and don't forget that scene where Tris' mother dies and she screams ""Staaahp"". Predictable death was predictable.<br/><br/>There's so many things not answered in this movie. Why does that train go so slow that you can run beside it? Why is that train even there at all? Who was the little girl in Tris' mind when she first did the test to find out which faction she'd belong in? What is the difference between Will, Al and Peter? I don't even know anymore. <br/><br/>None of the characters matter. I forgot all the names besides Four, Tris and Christina because none of the characters are memorable. <br/><br/>It's obvious this move was aimed at girls from age 10 to 18. Really, I fall into that category and I find it despicable that this is what they feed us. This is what movies have come to. Please do not waste your time watching this movie."
"briandb-45541","4","1","1","5 April 2015"," Felt rushed, no backbone
","Unlike the book, the movie jumps straight in, head first into concrete. Anyone who has ever read the book would know that there is at least 15 (38 minutes of reading, but who wants to watch a 12 hour movie?) minutes missing from the intro. It goes right to the aptitude test. If I had not read the book, I would have been thoroughly confused. There are huge gaps in each scene as well. Not enough foundation building between scenes, fast forwarding through important details required to understand the actual story. <br/><br/>Much of the back-story isn't revealed until the second and third titles, but if they had done it right, this would have hardly mattered, but as rushed as this film was, there isn't enough to leave the watcher satisfied. They would have been better off making a two part movie to Divergent as they are to Allegiant.<br/><br/>Aside from this, there are also several parts from the book they have altered that should not have been, such as the way Tori acted when finding out Tris was divergent, and same goes for the response when Eric was down talking Four during the attack simulation, right when Tris shot Eric. Here it shows Four knocking down Max but in the book, Max was not present in this scene, an unknown female that was with Eric whom Four shot in the leg (Max was in the book just not part of that scene). The changes are small compared to what they have done to Insurgent, and overall wouldn't, or rather, shouldn't have changed the outcome of the overall story of the Divergent trilogy, but nonetheless noticeable changes.<br/><br/>Of all this, I felt like the movie was incomplete and not really worth the money."

","I have incredibly low expectations when it comes to young adult movies, and yet, I'm still disappointed. Many of you claimed that it is really similar to the hunger games. Well... yes and no. Divergent is stupider.<br/><br/>First of all : the credits are still rolling and I don't know why there was a war and why dividing people into five district... I mean factions is gonna help maintaining peace. This is BS. No explanations, nothing. And we meet our lead character Kat... I mean Tris (notice how Katniss and Tris sound similar) played by Shailene Woodley. And for me, this is the first mistake they made in this movie. Woodley... I just don't like her. Her voice, her face, everything.<br/><br/>But the crap really hits the fan when you learn that not only is she divergent but that this is something rare... How ? I mean, have you ever been 16 and not knowing what you wanted to be when you grow up or is everybody in this lousy version of Chicago conditioned or something ? I call BS on this part. Being divergent is not something rare especially at the age the characters are. It's not, and this is why the movie makes little sense.<br/><br/>2nd problem : the factions. How does it maintain peace to restraint people to one single way of living for the rest of their lives ? And what about the faction-less (or homeless. It's literally the same thing) people ? They don't care about their fate ? They don't want abundant food and a home ? I mean, they can build a giant wall but can't feed the poor ? How perfect is that ?<br/><br/>3rd problem : choosing a faction is nonsense. They don't even get to ""try"" them. If factions really have to fit who they are, they should be able to walk in their shoes for at least 48h each. Instead, they are giving a false choice : either you stay home safe or you explore the unknown with the risk of being kicked out. Concretely : it would not maintain peace IRL.<br/><br/>Final major problem : The chemistry between Tris and Four is fake. In one of the early scenes of the movie, Four gives her the most beautiful, powerful middle finger ever : ""What makes you think you can talk to me ?"" And she doesn't seem to remember it afterwards, and worst of all, they don't share that much special moments in the movie. Their love seems forced by the circumstances.<br/><br/>So, the plot is nonsense, the character development is poor, and so is the acting. I haven't talked about the action sequences at all, but trust me, it's not worth mentioning. Finally, the climax is... unexpectedly bad and makes little sense. I'm trying to keep the review spoiler-free so go watch it for yourself and you'll know what I'm talking about."
"alukhar","6","1","1","23 February 2015"," A Review of the Script of Divergent
","Imagine living in a futuristic society where all life is divided into five factions based on virtues, and everyone must fit into exactly one of these five factions or their lives are at stake. This scenario presents exactly the basis for the movie Divergent, a film version of author Veronica Roth's novel. The film follows an adolescent girl named Tris Prior on her adventure of growth and survival in a dystopian society. Each year there is a ""Choosing Ceremony"" in which all children who have turned sixteen must choose which faction they will spend the rest of their lives in. In an extremely difficult decision, Tris finds herself in the faction she will call home, fighting for a place to become an officially initiated member. When Tris finds out that she is what the leaders of society call ""Divergent,"" it is evident that she cannot be controlled or fit into just one faction. This discovery means that Tris must fight for her life as the leaders of society hunt down and attempt to kill all Divergents, who threaten the faction system. While the story line of the novel written by Roth proves brilliantly entertaining and catches the attention of readers, the movie script seems to lack the zeal with which the story was originally written. The script for the movie Divergent destroys the entertaining, suspenseful, and emotionally endearing story line originally created by Veronica Roth in her novel. <br/><br/>Divergent's movie script fails to develop important emotional aspects of the story that are crucial to very plot and development it. The story is virtually all about identity and the development of one's self. And the people that appear in Tris's life play a huge role in her development and growth into adulthood. Unfortunately, the characters presented in the movie are incredibly underdeveloped and their impact on Tris's life is nearly impossible to fully see. As Christy Lemire said in her published review of Divergent on the Roger Ebert Memoriam Website, ""the supporting figures who had identifiable personalities in the book mostly blend into the background in the movie."" This tragedy can be very well seen through many characters, but most importantly through one specific antagonist to Tris. The character of Peter in the movie appears to be a background figure, one of Tris's competitors for a spot in her faction. He comes off as sarcastic, fairly mean, and sometimes even funny. However, in the original story presented through Roth's novel, Peter is evil. There is certainly no better word to describe him other than evil. As Tris's arch nemesis, he attacks her physically and verbally any chance he gets. Many mean remarks directed at Tris leave his mouth, but not one of them could be described as remotely funny. He even goes to the length of stabbing a fellow initiate in the eye with a butter knife during the night just to knock out his biggest competition. He touches Tris inappropriately before trying to kill her, which scars her permanently. Peter is portrayed as almost a completely different character in the movie compared to his true self in the book. This lack of development of his character along with others proves to take out a large emotional influence important to the story. The script lacks ways in which the truth behind many characters could come out, and this contributes to the detriment of emotional development in the story. <br/><br/>Not only does the script for Divergent contribute to the lack of character and emotional advancement, but it also contributes to the weakness in entertaining and attention-holding abilities of the movie. ABC News put out a review by David Blaustein claiming that ""Divergent is a mildly entertaining movie that only succeeds because of its talented cast."" First of all, most of the movie is consumed by long hours for Tris and the other initiates training and completing activities to earn their place in the faction. This training consumes over half the movie and easily loses the attention of the viewers. Secondly, due to the fact that characters are underdeveloped, relationships are also underdeveloped. The core relationship between Tris and her love interest, Four, develops through many encounters and complications in Roth's novel; however, in the movie it remains a surface level relationship that develops quickly. The lack of complexity to the relationship in the movie causes a lack of attachment from viewers to the movie. Like Blaustein stated, the movie only overcomes the lack of relationships and entertainment through the sheer talent of the actors. <br/><br/>Overall, Divergent succeeded in the movie business, making thousands of dollars in profit. However, the movie itself is ultimately a failure. It did not successfully portray the thought provoking, emotionally endearing, and attention- grabbing story originally written by Veronica Roth in her novel. Although the movie basically followed the plot of the story, it removed the important relationships and characters that were developed in the book and that were essential to the success of the story. The movie script dissected the brilliant novel written by Roth and took out parts that gave the story the emotional depth it needed to reach its full potential. As the most important thing that makes up a movie, the script of Divergent damages the movie itself and weakens the overall success of the film."
"hannahray123","2","1","1","15 February 2015"," can you say ""disappointing?""
","I am not very into the trilogy that this movie is based on, but I really liked the first book. I was quite excited to see it as a movie, entering the theater with high hopes. The clothing design was sexist. Seriously, it's the future, and women are still accustomed to body-revealing ""serious"" clothes; ranging from sexy skin-tight Erudite mini-skirts to Tris's sexy black tank top. The book was nothing like this; women wore pants.<br/><br/>Excuse me for being a feminist, but that was a small part of the movie that had bugged me. The acting was bland, the character designs were bland, and the whole movie was rushed. Each scene just... breezed by, like the whole movie was saying ""okay, okay, yeah, yeah, you saw this scene already, let's just get this story over and done with because, apparently, the writers just don't care about our personal entertainment.""<br/><br/>the length had made it seem like a kid's movie, along with the fact that even the romance scenes with Tris and Four were small and sped up, and the violence scenes! There was hardly any violence. For example at the scene where Tris was almost pushed over the chasm, there was literally a few pushing and shoving and then DONE. And where are the guns? The book had included real guns with bullets, but in the movie everyone was using these weird, ""futuristic"" guns that shot spike- like bullets and didn't even show blood... no one told me this was a freaking PG movie.<br/><br/>What a waste of money. The book had unforgettable characters, great dialogue, and creative, heart-shattering scenes. This movie felt more like a joke; I wouldn't be surprised to find out, one day, that this had actually been made as a parody of sci-fi/action/romance movies. It would have done better as a parody than as a movie."
"weejockxxx","2","1","1","11 February 2015"," Poor cousin
","This film could have been awesome if it wasn't so incomprehensibly silly. Obviously based on the Hunger Games (factions, teenagers fighting) this film takes all the good aspects of that film and copies them very badly. The heroine, Tris is totally unbelievable. Unlike Katniss I couldn't see her winning a game of tiddlywinks let alone a knife fight. The evil government is a one dimensional stereotype that seems to exist in all this type of film and the inevitable romance between her and Four(??) might as well have been announced in the opening, it was so obvious. I will admit that the book is a thousand times more interesting than this drivel and the main reason it fails is because unlike Maze Runner, which has solid characters, and Hunger games, which has the brilliant Jennifer Lawrence, Divergent is just a mass of clichés and bland performances. Do yourself a favour and give this a miss."
"brunettewarrior","Null","1","1","21 January 2015"," Thoroughly enjoyable
","I rate Divergent 9 out of 10 stars because I was fully engaged and entertained white watching the film.<br/><br/>Woodley's Tris is a sympathetic protagonist that allows the viewer to see the new world order through fresh eyes. She is instantly relatable. Teller's Peter is a likable antagonist that I would have liked to see in a different role, yet he performed well. Courtney's Eric is very hard to like, which I was a bit disappointed in. I think my impression going in was that he played a bigger part. James' Four is a difficult, guarded young man with a soft spot for divergent girls like Tris, or perhaps only Tris. (I've never read the book/s this is based off of). <br/><br/>As a sci-fi/fantasy genre story, I had no problem buying into the reality the film presented. As far as comparing it to other young adult popular fiction turned into films, I'd say it is more engaging and better acted than The Hunger Games. However, I'd say this isn't just for a set audience of teen girls or teens, but adults as well. It really poses a major question about society and how we lead our lives."

"utgard14","6","1","1","13 January 2015"," Not Bad of Its Type
","Another 'Young Adult' sci-fi action romance flick. As with all the others, let me state upfront I haven't read the books on which this is based, nor do I intend to. I don't have any knowledge of spoilers from the books. I'll just assume the movie follows them for the most part but changes some things here or there. That's usually the case. At any rate, without having read the books, I can say this movie is not as original as it seems to believe it is. It borrows liberally from several sources. Among them is Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World."" But most of it is just following the predictable YA formula. Young woman, pretty but not intimidatingly so, is the 'chosen one' to change the world or some such. Along the way she falls in love with a guy who's just too dreamy for words. It's funny how in these things the girl is always supposed to be something of a plain Jane but the guy has to be a heartthrob. I'm sure someone has written about the hypocrisy of that since men are always criticized for being shallow and thinking about looks first with regards to women...but I digress.<br/><br/>The cast does well, with Shailene Woodley (one of Hollywood's much-hyped rising stars of late) doing a fine job. Theo James only has to look handsome so it's to his credit he can actually act. Kate Winslet plays the obligatory corrupt government leader villain. I assume she was paid well. Ashley Judd and eyebrowless Tony Goldwyn play Woodley's parents. Thankless roles for both, really. The performance I enjoyed the most was Zoë Kravitz as Woodley's friend. Sadly, she largely disappears in the second half of the movie. Anyway, there no impressive action sequences or special effects to speak of. It's not that what's there is bad, just that nothing stood out to me. After the movie was over, I didn't say ""Wow remember that scene"" or anything like that. Still, I don't regret watching it and I will likely watch the inevitable sequels. As far as these types of movies go, it was decent."

","OK, this film is based on Young Adult fiction. When I was a young adult and reading books that meant no sex, single plot lines, no swearing, and the complexities of daily living are ignored. It didn't mean that there was no plot and completely unbelievable situations.<br/><br/>I tried, I really tried with this film, but after 30 minutes I gave up. If this is the sort of stuff young adults are reading now and this is what's considered good stuff, then let's destroy all books published in the last 20 years and start all over again.<br/><br/>We're meant top believe that every teenager in Chicago, which has been shut off from the rest of the world, when they reach a certain age, has to choose their future career based on a drug-fuelled dream and that, once that career has been chosen, then they can never change that career. And there are only 5 careers open to them. Really? Really?!? Really! And this choice is to be made by these teenagers at a ceremony where they share blades, cut themselves on their palms and drop blood into a bowl. Really? Really! And if they want to join Dauntless - the soldiers and police - they need to have no brains, be all brawn, follow orders mindlessly, and be as reckless as possible. Really? Really! First act of the new Dauntless recruits? Jump on the non-stopping overhead trains, and then jump off a few minutes later onto the roof of a building (again whilst the train is in motion). Proof, if proof were needed, that Dauntless is full of idiots with a lot more luck than judgement.<br/><br/>And that's just one of the 5 Factions.<br/><br/>Yes, young adult fiction is less complex that adult fiction, but that doesn't mean brainless, it means simpler.<br/><br/>I just couldn't switch off my higher brain functions watching this film and gave up before I felt my IQ start to ooze out of my nose, taking a permanent dive into single figures.<br/><br/>If you really, really don't think at all when you're watching films, then you might be able to get through this one unscathed.

","This is my first time writing a review but I thought people should be warned before wasting their time. First of all this is a hunger games cheap knock off with none of the aspects that made the hunger games work. The story line was beyond predictable, not once was I even questioning how this movie would end. The book might have been better but after watching this I will never attempt to read it. The acting was some of the worst I have ever seen. One thing that made the hunger games work was that the female lead could actually act, Jen has awards proving her talent. The female lead in this does not have the talent to present Jen an award. The countless pointless action scenes that didn't add anything to the weak plot made it even harder to watch. If you want a teen novel brought to screen right watch the hunger games or harry potter, if you want a teen novel that's predictable and badly acted watch twilight, if you want a reason to lose faith in the world at large watch this and wonder how it ever got more than 2 stars."
"koudiodr","6","1","1","5 January 2015"," High school dystopia
","I am a bit surprised that very few reviewers seem to have caught what this is really about. They seem to miss that the world depicted is a high school, seen from the perspective of a typical student. Nobody seems to work; everybody is learning. Teachers have complete authority, with the kids making limited and largely uninformed choices. Their prospects are largely ""becoming a successful member of society"" or ""failing and becoming a hobo"". Bullying and suicide are real issues.<br/><br/>In ""Divergent"", society is organized based on a faction system: factions stand for many things, including castes, professions, traits of character, rites of passage, dress codes... But most of all, they represent the cliques that form in high school: the cool kids (dauntless), the nerds (erudite), the hippies (amity). Due to this, the relevance of the factions for society is a bit bogus; for example, as many reviewers have noted, the Dauntless would make terrible cops or soldiers... But that is besides the point! The dauntless are merely the cool kids, complete with bullies, hot guys, hot girls, extreme sports, and excessive drama.<br/><br/>While belonging to these cliques, most real-world teenagers also feel that they are unique snowflakes. Pretty much every real person felt that way as a teenager; but teenagers are not yet aware of that. In the movie, the unique snowflakes are called ""divergents"": people who do not fully belong in any clique, who are a bit more than a stereotype. Obviously, the heroine and her boyfriend are ""divergents"", unlike ""99%"" of other characters, who are just sheep within their respective cliques.<br/><br/>All in all, this is merely a teenage fantasy. The heroin has doubts about who she is, where she belongs; she succeeds in becoming one of the cool kids; she finds a boyfriend; and at the same time, she retains her ""incredibly unique"" personality. And we confidently expect her to go on to become a successful revolutionary, changing the world for the better, and fulfilling the entire fantasy, acquiring fame and social status in the process.<br/><br/>It is easy to see why this was successful with its target audience. Watch it if you want a high school flick set in the future, with some added fist- and gun-fights; don't watch it if you want serious sci-fi. To enjoy it at all, you have to see this movie for what it really is. As a 29 year old man, I found it amusing. I ended up caring for the characters despite their stereotypical personalities and had a good time. <br/><br/>6/10"
"ginaaguglia","2","1","1","26 December 2014"," So disappointed with the acting and the adaptation
","After reading this book and seeing the Descendants with Shailene staring opposite the very talented George Clooney, I was very excited to see this movie... and I was terribly disappointed by her performance and how poorly the book was adapted into a screen play and, thus, a feature film. <br/><br/>The acting was absolute rubbish, especially if you had read the book. Veronica Roth writes a brilliant young adult story about a dystopia society split into factions to keep the order of the world after ""the war"" and how a young girl, through wit, blood, tears, and strength, realizes she does not fit into the labels society has structured for her, leaving her divergent. <br/><br/>The story is told first person from Tris, this young girl, so there is so much feeling and emotion surging through this character as she makes crucial decisions, chooses who to trust, learns when to use her brains verses muscles, and falls in love. NONE of this was apparent by watching this movie. Shailene's face is as emotionless and uninterested as my grandmother listening to me talk about new apps on my phone. <br/><br/>In addition to her flat and downright bland acting, she also fails to show any real sign of romantic interest in the man she supposedly falls deeply in love with based on their special connection of both being divergent. The book goes into such beautiful detail of how their relationship slowly builds, transitions through her training, and is supported and strengthened by adventure, angst, loss, and triumph, but the movie leaves you feeling like they barely know each other or even care to. <br/><br/>I can't just blame Shailene for this pathetic attempt at a love connection because Theo doesn't do any better to show that he is both a strong, bad ass dauntless superstar and a pensive, thoughtful, affectionate partner (swoon) like the book so perfectly creates. I fell in love with Four right along with Tris, but Theo doesn't even gloss over the intricate person that is the character Four. <br/><br/>Like I said, I was so disappointed. I stayed up until 3am to finish this book because I was so enthralled with its adventure, excitement, and strength. I thought so fondly of it after I finished that I basked in the glow of the characters' intense human connection and the journey that lay ahead for them, but, consequently, I would pay someone $100 to give me this 1 hour and 45 minutes of my life back. I would still be longing for a man like Four and motivated by the beautiful and eloquent strength of Tris if this movie could be wiped from my memory."

","First off, this is the first movie I felt strongly about enough to review. I cannot get behind the overall rating of this film. There's not much to say really, other than this was a complete waste of time. The movie trailer was completely misleading. Either this was the worst adaptation of book ever done, or the novel is terrible as well. Am I missing something here? How can they rip off every teen/girl power movie and have the storyline be so choppy? Apparently, there's sequels. How? It goes from Tris selecting a faction to training to a war with no development. The cast's chemistry is non existent. It's hard for me to blame the actors however, with this storyline and direction. With a budget like they had, I can't understand how this was such a huge disappointment. Bottom line, weak story, weak development, and unable to follow. The best way watch this movie is right before the power goes out."

However, this movie lacked everything. Dull protagonists, typical villains, unbelievable setting and just an awful story line. <br/><br/>Tris is Divergent, which makes her the main character of this movie. Being Divergent meant that you are an individual less susceptible to societal influences. Yet when the Dauntless people got brainwashed and started marching into town, some other Divergent just got popped right in the head because he was wandering around like an idiot. So much for Divergents being important. <br/><br/>And seriously, Tris developed no real skill. She didn't even complete the whole training! What was it like three weeks? That's like kiddy boot camp. For kids. All of a sudden she's supposed to be some badass even though she had no developing back story to explain any skills that she may have had.<br/><br/>Lastly, they saved the town..why are they still running away?

","Neil Burger's Divergent is a bad film version of Veronica Roth's 2011 best-selling book of the same name set in a futuristic world in which there are factions that are based on somebody's virtue. It stars Shailene Woodley (who was brilliant in The Descendants (2011), but flopped in this movie) as Tris a girl who gets tested for some unknown reason and learns that she is ""Divergent"" and can't fit in, and ends up going to some training and also ends up falling in love with her instructor (played by Theo James in a very nauseating performance) whose name is hilariously the number Four and also meets another instructor named Eric (played by Jai Courtney whose performance reminds me of the way that Alfred Molina portrayed Johann Tetzel in Luther (2003). Then after that Tris finds out all of this information from her mother (played by Ashley Judd) and the culprit for the attempted Divergent destruction is a woman named Jeanine (played by Kate Winslet). There was a lot of other things that I didn't like about this film besides it's storyline but the acting, cinematography, directing, and especially the action sequences in which the action scenes were shot way too quickly, though i only liked two things in this movie which were the casting, and the stunt-work to the film.The one thing I don't get when it comes to watching it is when people like this film for no apparent reason at all but by just saying it's ""great"" though I had many reasons to criticize it, I do think that this movie is nothing compared to sci-fi classics like Inception (2010), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Planet of the Apes (1968), E.T. (1982), Minority Report (2002), or even Jurassic Park (1993) or The Matrix (1999).

To be honest, I rather enjoyed the movie until all the corny lovey-dovey scenes between Tris and Four; the movie minus the Tris and Four ""romantic"" parts would've raised the movie's stock in my book. Another thing that would've helped was to revise the completely lame ending, which doesn't quite make sense, is totally anti-climactic and is obviously screaming out: ""SEQUEL!"". Lastly,I was hoping there'd be some explanation as to why they had to live within the boundaries of the city, apart from Tris narrating at the beginning that there was a ""war"" - which I don't fully believe, so I hoped there'd be a twist ending, but it never came.

","So, it seems these days that the word 'dystopia' has come to mean 'any old nonsense society we can think of regardless of how impractical or unbelievable it is.' Snowpiercer, The Hunger Games, Total Recall (the remake) and so on, all share this common belief that any crazy society makes a viable setting just so long as you can gloss over the many, many cracks that even a moment's examination will discover.<br/><br/>Divergent is just a variation of The Hunger Games, when it boils down to it, with teens being forced to do dumb things for the sake of the society. There are five factions, but the only one that would probably be of any interest to, you know, an actual teenager, is the slightly demented Dauntless clan. They run, they leap, they do dumb things, and all just because they can. They are essentially painted as the 'fun' faction and it is hard to imagine, given their rivals, that any teen would pick anything else at choosing time.<br/><br/>Hmmm. Let's see... Farmer, Doctor, Lawyer, or Dogsbody. Or I could be a leaping, fun-getting Dauntless! Such a choice...<br/><br/>There is also the nonsensical 'test' that all teens must take, but the results of which are generally pointless, since the teen can pick any faction at the time of choosing. Yet everyone gets all worked up about the test anyway, like it actual has a point.<br/><br/>All of the usual teen concerns are on offer here, but it is hard to take any of it even remotely seriously. It's just so ham-fisted in its delivery of all these teen issues that it invites derision for the most part.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, all is fair, though no one shines. Almost all of the population appear to be teens, though, with a handful of adults around to spoil the fun and almost no small children at all, which seemed odd.<br/><br/>The main heroine goes through the motions of trying to fit in and failing, all the while falling hopelessly in love with her much older instructor. One begins to wonder if the writer had a crush on one of her teachers that went unfulfilled in her youth.<br/><br/>All in all, an overlong exercise in endurance with a daft societal premise that just plain sets itself up for ridicule.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Too long, Too derivative.

So if you're a pessimist, read those reviews. Divergent is actually a decent film.<br/><br/>Yes, I have been annoyed by the fact that some scenes are different from the book.

Why not let Tris' mother rescue her from one of her worst fears? -END OF SPOILER)<br/><br/>But next to these 'poor' choices in scenario, Divergent is a pretty good film. Lets not let our judgement be clouded to think the acting is so bad, when just a great story has been screwed over. The acting has certainly not been bad and the 'lack of chemistry' between the main characters can easily be explained by their personalities (which have just nob been translated well to the big screen). <br/><br/>Really, I tried to also add a paragraph to this review about how it's not these young actor's faults that directors have messed up a good story (but then again, they were also not good enough to improve things very much).<br/><br/>Lets give Divergent the benefit of the doubt.

","With the flood of teen lit-inspired movies on the scene today, it can be all-too easy to unfairly shuffle them all under the same leaky roof. Often, that short-sells the more gleaming examples of the genre. Not so with Divergent, a ruthlessly narrow little bit of phony escapism that confirms every ugly stereotype. Dim and wooden, it's a thoroughly hand-holding bit of tack that can't seem to get over how breathlessly important it thinks it is. The generic core storyline has nothing to offer, over-familiar and rich with the scent of manufactured drama. Its cast, thin and transparent as they come, spends most of the bloated runtime reveling in their own majesty at the expense of actual character development. Not that the actors seem capable of exploring any such depth, were they given the material to work with. Shailene Woodley and Theo James, beautiful people without so much as a single spark between them, seem to have been chosen exclusively for their pouty appearances on the promotional materials. Likewise, an awkwardly mismatched sparkle-pop soundtrack stands at odds with the bleak, dystopian tones that the plot stretches for. At least the visual effects are well done, for what that's worth. It's a real waste of time and effort, an insulting vehicle to cash-in on the latest craze and promote a few of the parent company's tunes while they're at it. I wish I could get my two hours back."
"PlugInYourBrain","5","1","1","4 August 2014"," I liked the trains. I hope in the sequel we get to see one stop at a station.
","Divergent is a pretty movie. The CGI of post-apocalyptic Chicago is very nice, but the plot has too many holes which keep breaking the suspension of disbelief. The underlying premise had potential but is not explored. Instead we spend most of the movie being bored in The Pit and screaming ""You Idiot!"" at the film's heroine.<br/><br/>First, lets get the comparison to Hunger Games out of the way: Yes. Divergent is a rip-off of Hunger Games, but Hunger Games is itself a rip-off of Battle Royale. At least Hunger Games is entertaining. Divergent is kind of dull.<br/><br/>Divergent is YA fiction. I'm not it's target audience. Perhaps that is why Shailene Woodley's Tris doesn't do it for me. I don't identify with her character, and she does so many stupid things I can't root for her either. I know she can act, but her performance here is flat. <br/><br/>Tris is a whiny teen. Worse, a whiny teen who kept on doing stupid things. When a terrified Tori (Maggie Q) tells her to shut up about being divergent, she doesn't take the hint. When Kate Winslet's Jeanine told her she knew her tests results, instead of bluffing she blurts out 'You know I'm divergent? Wow! I am so dead!' (Not her exact words, but close...) And when she fights, she doesn't fight back and gets K.O.ed. <br/><br/>The movie is filled with moments like this which had me screaming ""You idiot!"" <br/><br/>The faction system is criticized as unworkable but that's okay because it's a valid premise that hundred year-old oligarchs dreamed up a political system that doesn't work and it takes a while for that to be recognized. But its problems are immediately obvious to the viewer. <br/><br/>Any system which divides people into factions, each with different privileges, is bound to cause envy. There's open tension between the groups. We see a Candor (lawyer) openly accusing Abnegation (cleric politician) of stealing. Erudite's (intelligstia's) campaign to overthrow Abnegation is well known. If it's a perfect society, why do they need Dauntless (paramilitary) to keep the peace or candor (lawyers) to resolve disputes? And what about the large numbers of factionless living like the homeless, instead of moving into the many abandoned buildings around the city? And any American who sees that only one faction has the right to bears arms will raise an eyebrow. And who does the cleaning and chauffeuring?<br/><br/>These problems supposedly are in the source material, but the movies writers should have patched those up.<br/><br/>Too much of the movie is spent in ""The Pit"" of the Dauntless faction. When we first saw Dauntless they looked like an interesting crowd: happy paramilitaries who jump, leap and somersault and are generally in a good mood. If utopia must have a police force, these would be a good choice. But once we get inside, they're just another soulless army.<br/><br/>Now if Dauntless had been the jumping, leaping, somersaulting Stomp-boys we saw at the beginning, Tris' journey could have made an interesting story.<br/><br/>In boot camp there are five guys who looked so similar I couldn't tell them apart.<br/><br/>The on-screen action is poorly directed. Teenage girls might not pick this up, but the teenage boys raised on first-person shooter games forced to watch this movie with them will: Gun battles consist of standing in the open and shooting. No teamwork or cover. Tris' Mom comes to get her alone: rookie mistake. And when her Dad attacks some bad guys instead of using cover, he walks to them shooting and gets shot himself. That's not a noble death. When you're only five and they're hundreds, fighting by attrition is stupid. And even though her Mom is supposedly a crack ex-Dauntless soldier, she also fights and dies stupid. When Tris flees, she hides with her back to a glass door facing the street. Imagine every gamer in the audience by reflex hitting the imaginary fire button on their cinema seat...<br/><br/>Particularly grating is one action scene where a drugged fellow recruit stumbles towards her shooting... Tris keeps calling for him to stop, and he keeps shooting... and missing at point blank. Eventually she shoots him. But really, she should be dead. This is really bad direction from Neil Burger who bought us the fantastic ""Limitless."" (What happened, man?) <br/><br/>Most grating of all are the end scenes. While the Dauntless prepare to execute the Abnegation faction Holocaust-style, Tris keeps looking around like a wide-eyed idiot. And then having beaten the Erudites, instead of pushing the advantage, she turns tail and runs. When Jeanine wakes up she'll finish what she started. And if the Dauntless infantry would now refuse that order, why leave now and give the Dauntless leadership the opportunity to reassert control?<br/><br/>It was the biggest of all the plot holes, and it's these which killed this movie.<br/><br/>I liked Theo James as Four, but Shailene Woodley just wasn't right for the role. The film's production poster, emphasizing her butt, is unintentionally comical.<br/><br/>The plot holes could have been fixed, if the movie producers had been brave enough to ""diverge"" from the book. But for unfathomable reasons the book series is popular. Why mess with a working formula? They made a dumb movie from a dumb book. Sequels are assured. They will make a lot of money out of this. The studios got their wish. The fans got their wish. And the rest of us will watch it anyway, just to see how it ends.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is VH1 weak. Hans Zimmer is ""Executive Composer,"" whatever that means.<br/><br/>The romance is cheesy and not convincing.<br/><br/>The real crime here is with a better director, better screen writers and better casting, this could have been a classic."

","Divergent is a science-fiction dystopian action film and the first in a ""trilogy"" series of 4 movies. I seriously don't understand why the 3rd story has to be made as Part 1 and 2. This knocking off of the final adventure of Harry Potter by The Hunger Games and now this is a lame attempt to stretch a story to make money. <br/><br/>Anyways, on to the movie. Spoilers alert! <br/><br/>In the distant or not-so-distant future (I couldn't understand from the movie the year it was set) in Chicago, society has been divided into 5 factions depending on a person's particular trait -Selfless, Peaceful, Honest, Brave, and intelligent. At the age of 16, a youth undergoes a test to determine if s/he would continue in their born-into faction or are they better suited to another. Also, a person can choose another faction s/he deems themselves to be more aligned to.<br/><br/>The protagonist of this movie marvel is Beatrice (Shailene Woodley) a selfless tribe member, who discovers that she has multiple traits and therefore a ""Divergent"". She however chooses to join the ""brave"" ones. The movie then moves to testing her mental and physical character for her tribe and how she climbs up the ladder.<br/><br/>In a later mental simulation game, her divergent abilities are discovered by one of the training leaders named Four (yeah, four) but he has the hots for her and advises he to think like their tribe members. Ah, almost forgot Beatrice is now Tris. <br/><br/>Then you have the usual ""one group is trying to take over the other"" and only someone who has just been trained can save the day. A lot of confusion and mayhem follows and after 48 hours I don't really remember what happened except that I woke up.<br/><br/>Theo James as 'Four' is so wooden, Kate Winslet should have used him in Titanic to rescue Jack and Rose from the icy waters. Ashley Judd, Ray Stevenson, Tony Goldwyn, Kate Winslet, Jai Courtney and Maggie Q add to a nice cast, but they hardly have any major impact with the viewer. My guess is Judd and Goldwyn (likable actors) were present so that their deaths could mean something to the viewer as we clearly know they will die and don't care one way or the other.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie looked very muddled to me and I wonder if the sequel, Insurgent, will be any better as they are trying to release the movie in a year's time without having a proper script and director ready. As of writing this review, the sequel doesn't even have a Wikipedia page. So go figure.<br/><br/>My rating for this movie is 5 on 10 It was nice to see Ashley Judd on the big screen, even though very fleetingly."

","Another movie in the genre of Young Adult Fiction. I haven't read a book, because to be honest, most of these books are written around the same idea: rebellion of the youth coming of age against some form of totalitarian society (read: society of the adults). It is clear why these ideas are so appealing to the teenagers, it is in their nature to be rebellious. We also have obligatory love story, and that's it. Divergent did not blow me away with it's story, but it's far away from awful. The premise is interesting. In some unspecified future we see residents of post-apocalyptic Chicago living within five categories (factions) of people (Abnegation the selfless, Amity the peaceful, Candor the honest, Dauntless the brave, and Erudite the intelligent), according to their character traits. But there are also the Divergent, people without faction, who live outside of society like Untouchlable caste in India. Each 16-year-old person must choose his/her faction and remain there for the rest of life. Our heroine chooses military faction (because they are soooo cool - and irritating) and we see her complete her combat training only to face great conspiracy between leaders of Dauntless and Erudite to seize the power for themselves. She manages to foil this plot and escapes with her friends. What happens now, we will see in an obligatory sequels. My main criticism is the portrayal of the Dauntless faction-army and police force of the city. They are shown as crazy, brave, tattooed, sexy youth and no wonder that they are so appealing to our heroine and young audience. They always run, jump, do dangerous stuff and so on. But even though one of the faction commanders says they train soldiers and not rebels, I wonder. They learn how to fight, of course, and most of the time they look like a bunch of brigands. They repeat the mantra faction before blood"", and not once in the movie I see their loyalty to the society they are bound to protect (against what, remains to be seen). Honestly, they look as coup d'état-in-waiting, but whatever. All in all, not great, not bad."
"Zulfmanauthor","6","1","1","3 August 2014"," A poor man's 'Hunger Games'
","I have not read the novel but as a movie, this was disappointing. Many people watch movies just because they have been adapted from great books but I don't believe a film should rely on a great novel. This movie is poorly executed and could have been so much better. There are striking similarities to 'The Hunger Games' but there is no comparison to how well 'The Hunger Games' has been made and the exceptional performance of 'Jennifer Lawrence'. In contrast 'Divergent', which also featured a futuristic society governed by a strict regime with numerous divisions, is not convincing and none of the characters are strong enough for the viewer to care about them. The movie seems to end up becoming a teenage romance tale and the climax is confusing and dull. Even the main theme of being a 'Divergent' is not explored or really explained, maybe this has been reserved for a sequel. However based on this movie, I definitely won't bother with any follow up movies."
"isabelle-frater","4","1","1","3 August 2014"," Like a mash of a lot of other books
","I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch this movie. The book is on my ""never read"" list, mostly because I heard it has a lot of romance in it with insta-love, which I can't abide. I was afraid that the movie would be like that as well. However, I have had a movie change my mind about reading the book, twice actually. Therefore, I decided to give this one a shot.<br/><br/>I've heard the story compared to The Hunger Games more times than I can remember. Funny thing was that it reminded me of a whole lot of other dystopian novels, and even some non-dystopian ones, but not The Hunger Games. The factions remind me more of the houses in Harry Potter. Especially because the houses seemed to stay with them even after they left them. The difference is that Hufflepuff is divided up into three aspects of the Hufflepuff mentality, which in a way doesn't make sense, but it does if you think in the terms of jobs. The only people we're missing are the Slytherins. The problem with factions and houses is that no one fits only into one category. You may be more like one, you may want to be more like one, but no one can be defined by just one trait. Houses have been criticized because of this, but people eventually leave school, though the house they were in remain as a part of their identity. Factions you can't leave, therefore they are worse.<br/><br/>The world building really doesn't make sense in some ways. I'm not sure if it's better explained in the books, but there are definite holes. So my questions within the first 10 minutes of the movie were:<br/><br/><ul><li>What is the wall for? - What is the rest of the world like, and why isn't anyone trying to find out? - Why are there still so many houses with holes in them? Shouldn't they have been repaired by now or torn down? - How long ago was this war thing, and what are the general facts about it? - What are the Gryffindors, sorry, Dauntless protecting people from? It feels more like they're trying to control the people who like to climb on walls for no apparent reason, and don't know that there are mountains in the world. - Later, one thing that I didn't get in the last 40 minutes of the movie was Tris' mother. Was it better explained in the books? The movie made no sense.</li></ul><br/><br/>The beginning was actually quite good. While the world wasn't established well, the personality and life of Tris was. Then it got boring really fast. The whole training, the drug induced illusions reminded me of Ender's Game. I was equally bored there as well. Good thing that this time I had cooking lunch to occupy the 90% of my mind the movie wasn't engaging. Things only started to pick up an hour and a half into the movie. Some aspects also reminded me of 1984. While the threat from outside wasn't specific, it's not unlike the war in 1984, which I always thought didn't actually exist. Also the whole drug thing, that I won't spoil further.<br/><br/>The ending itself was kind of anti-climatic and annoying. I am half tempted to pick up the second book just to see where they go from here, but I was so bored for most of the movie, the jury is still out on that.<br/><br/>I almost forgot to write about the actors and the characters. That in itself speaks volumes. While Tris was well established, I didn't find her someone I could cheer on. I'm not sure if it was the actress, or just the character. Shailene Woodley I've never seen in a movie before, therefore I would not be able to judge her acting. However, as Tris she just didn't feel much engaged in the whole story. It felt more like she was stumbling from one event to the other. Her smiles felt lukewarm. Kind of like Kristen Stewart, which is not a good thing. However, it could just have been a bad director, or the story itself. I would need to see her in other things as well to see if I like her as an actress. Theo James is hot for sure. If he was my instructor I would have wanted to get into his pants too. But love? I didn't feel the love connection between the characters. I generally don't like mushy romance, but a bit of building up would have been nice. The character of Four didn't feel well-rounded either. He was more like the convenient guy that can be the love interest.<br/><br/>Are the books coming off my ""never read"" list? Not sure at this point. I may find my curious nature not being able to let go of wanting to know how this thing ends. This is partly why I tend to go for finished series. I hate waiting. The movie itself gets two stars for interesting beginning, boring long middle, kind of picking up ending."

","Shailene Woodley is one of the worst actresses alive today. Almost personally made the movie barely watchable. Another Pocahontas story, with mediocre effects, boring plot, zero humor, and amazingly sucking cast. Every human is a divergent but ! Shailene Woodley is a divergent who can't act. The idea of factions is good but the movie managed to ruin it by the lack of depth that is being sacrificed to make room for Shailene Woodley's magic acting. Almost every moment in the movie is predictable, every emotion visible. The graphics used as effects are from some cheap flicks and actually make it annoying to watch the scenes where Shailene Woodley doesn't have to act. The good part/parts: occasional suspense. Descent music."

","Divergent. I have read the series already and I should say, this movie is one of those that actually exceeded my expectation.

I just had a bit of a different take on Four and Eric but other than that, this is a great movie for the novel. I cannot wait for Insurgent.<br/><br/>It could have gotten a higher rating from me if the story on the movie was more ""following the book"". Also, what I noticed on the story in the movie is that a lot of things, important things, are shortened and were not given enough attention.

I know things have to be changed in order for the movie to be not too lengthy that is understandable.<br/><br/>Lastly, Kate Winslet is AWESOME!

","Honestly, I did not have high hopes for this movie,however, the reviews persuaded me to watch it and I am so glad I did! I will admit it was similar to the Hunger Games in the respect of it being based in a unconventional and nonsensical realm of some sort, however, it was an extremely gripping and a very original storyline, definitely not another cliché movie that's similar to a thousand others. This movie is great for all audiences as it boasts a combination of action, drama, and romance all combined together.

"sandyrfarmer","9","14","44","22 March 2014"," Best Book to Movie Adapation in a while
","*Spoilers for people who haven't read the books.* You guys...Divergent has easily been the best book to movie adaptation that I've seen in a really, really long time. Let me just put that out there immediately.<br/><br/>The actors: Shailene Woodley (Tris), Theo James (Four), Kate Winslet (Jeanine), Ashley Judd (Natalie, aka Tris's mom), Jai Courtney (Eric), Zoe Kravitz (Christina), Maggie Q (Tori), and Tony Goldwyn (Andrew, aka Tris's dad) all did magnificent jobs. I felt like Shailene and Theo especially were perfect for these roles. They were both how I pictured Tris and Four while I was reading Divergent, and they never once acted out of character. Truthfully, that's hard to find. I loved the chemistry that Shailene and Theo had while Theo also maintained Four's standoffish feel through the beginning of the movie. They're relationship felt legit. Shailene's best acting scene was when Tris lost her mother during the Dauntless attack on Abnegation. I teared up during that scene because her grief felt so real. You guys know I'm not a crier, so that's a small victory in and of itself.<br/><br/>As always there are differences between any book and movie made based upon a book. The biggest differences that I noticed involved the widespread knowledge that Divergents exist at all. In the book, the only people who seem to know about Divergents are those who are Divergent themselves, ones who have family members who are (or were) Divergents, and Jeanine. It was slightly confusing to me as a viewer why Tris didn't know any details about what being Divergent meant when the knowledge that Divergents exist at all was fairly widespread. I feel like the movie makers made this decision in order to help along the viewers who may not have read the books.<br/><br/>I was almost sad to see how little screen time Al was given. I don't know that we'd even been told his name when the major events involving him took place. I figure his scenes were probably cut for budget and timing purposes, but I was sad that we didn't see move of him and his struggle to become Dauntless. Four tells us that he was failing, but even if they'd simply told us his name and flashed to his ranking on the scoreboard we could have figured that out. Similarly, Molly is shown and there are a couple of scenes with her, but I don't think we were ever told her name in the movie.<br/><br/>Probably for me, the most deviations revolve around Jeanine. She was a lot more present than I remember her being in Divergent, but I'm assuming that's because you don't hire an actress like Kate Winslet and not give her any screen time. PLUS I imagine the bigger reason being that because Jeanine's so present in Insurgent, she needed to be firmly established as ""public enemy number 1."" Another addition the movie makers made but that I actually think made more sense involved the mirrors in Tris's simulations. It seemed to me like Tris being able to look at her own reflection for any length of time is what usually woke her up to the fact that the simulations weren't real. And I liked how the movie makers pulled that in from the first scene of the book and made Tris's relationship with her own reflection have a deeper meaning and purpose.<br/><br/>However many deviations there were between the book and this movie, I wasn't upset with any of them. Everything felt so much better with Divergent than with the other book the movie adaptations I've seen recently. The actors. The locations. The special effects. The smart decisions on what should be changed and what should remain the same. The marketing strategy. The overall feel of the movie. They just did so much right with this adaptation, and I can't thank the director and producers enough for doing a worthy job of this book.<br/><br/>I wanted to spend some time addressing other specific scenes that I enjoyed so much, but when I started naming them in my head I felt like I was essentially naming all the scenes. HA! This is definitely one that I'll pay to see in the theater twice, and I can't wait to see them make Insurgent since there's not a doubt in my mind that they will. Divergent gets 9/10 Stars from me. Have you seen it? What did you think? Let me know!"

This movie deals with a lot of world building, but it kept my attention and did so in a way that fascinated me once more with this unique dystopia.<br/><br/>Tris is a wonderful lead, played by Shailene Woodley to perfection.

"shawneofthedead","6","11","33","19 March 2014"," Watchable if odd and slightly confusing for newbies. For fans, it's a good adaptation of a problematic novel - so good that it suffers from many of the book's flaws.
","When beloved books make their way to the silver screen, the resulting movies are usually met with much frustration and rending of clothes from amongst the literary faithful. A character is changed beyond recognition; a crucial plot-point excised; an important theme lost in the murk and swell of a film. Oddly, Divergent isn't actually a bad adaptation. In fact, Neil Burger's film is as good a version of Veronica Roth's wildly patchy source novel as you're likely to get. Whether that makes for a good movie - especially for people who've never read the book - is another matter entirely.<br/><br/>Divergent begins in a post-apocalyptic Chicago divided into five factions, each valuing one virtue - Dauntless (courage), Erudite (wisdom), Candour (honesty), Amity (kindness), and Abnegation (self-sacrifice) - above all others. It's an odd system, perhaps, but one that is apparently necessary to keep chaos at bay. Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) has been raised in Abnegation but, try as she might, she cannot completely subsume her self or her desires. Indeed, the aptitude test that everyone must take at the age of sixteen suggests that Tris doesn't belong in just one category: she is Divergent, equally at home in three factions.<br/><br/>Come the day of the Choosing Ceremony, she decides to forsake her family to become Dauntless: a decision that plunges her into a nightmare initiation process in which the weakest are summarily kicked out of the faction. As Tris navigates the politics and perils of her chosen world, trying all the while to hide the fact that she's Divergent, she encounters her fair share of allies - Christina (Zoe Kravitz), Will (Ben Lloyd-Hughes) and possibly her charmingly broody instructor Four (Theo James) - and enemies, including the brutal Eric (Jai Courtney) and vicious Peter (Miles Teller).<br/><br/>Anyone unfamiliar with Roth's book might find themselves trying to puzzle through this seemingly shapeless mess of a plot. It ebbs and flows in odd directions, dancing around Tris' desire to be true to herself, before it gets a little lost in the dystopian clutches of Jeanine Matthews (a gleefully icy, evil Kate Winslet), an Erudite leader hellbent on bringing down the entire Abnegation faction. Along the way, Tris literally battles her fears under the influence of a simulation serum, toughens up physically, strikes up a sexy chemistry with Four and frets over her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort). Within the confines of this universe, it makes an odd kind of narrative sense, but the logic of it all never really bleeds through.<br/><br/>Here's the thing, though: this strange, frequently illogical plotting is very much a defining characteristic of Roth's novel - and, in fact, becomes more of a problem as the trilogy progresses. (Anyone who's read Allegiant, the controversial final novel in the series, will know just how difficult it will be to adapt.) The emotional and logical flaws present in Divergent the film, then, are - for the most part - already inherent in the book. Why does Jeanine, supposedly one of the smartest people in the community, plot and plan the way she does? How does the entire society function in this utterly dysfunctional way? Technically, Burger can't really be faulted for failing to develop a coherence and logic that was never there in the first place.<br/><br/>In fact, Burger actually substantially improves upon the novel in several ways - he keeps the film mostly free of Tris' inner voice, which becomes increasingly moony and silly as her crush on Four grows by the day. Burger plays up a zip-line sequence that highlights the joyful recklessness of the Dauntless, as Tris soars freely through the midnight air. He also handles the problem of Tris' fear landscape very well: instead of simply willing herself out of the influence of the serum (as the Divergent can do), she must figure out how to face each of her fears in a non-Divergent way. These scenes are shot with quick, simple visual flair, dispensing with some of the novel's trickier convolutions.<br/><br/>Of course, Divergent isn't a perfect adaptation either. To Roth's credit, there are some truly dark, painful moments in the novel which transcend its loopy narrative. It's no surprise, and yet it's a little disappointing, that these bits simply vanish from the film, no doubt in the interests of securing a PG-13 rating. As a result, Peter is a far less repulsive antagonist than he is on paper. For instance, he doesn't brutally (and casually) maul a fellow initiate who's doing better than him in the rankings - an incident that's crucial in the development of his character in the subsequent novels.<br/><br/>The young cast works hard and quite well together. Woodley makes for an intriguing screen presence, effectively playing both the steel and softness of Tris' choices. James, heretofore best known for dying in Lady Mary's bed in Downton Abbey, acquits himself reasonably well - he's not as leaden as some of the trailers have suggested, and he forges a believable chemistry with Woodley. Of the supporting players, Teller is the standout, so good in his easy malevolence that he actually makes the thought of Allegiant as a movie quite appealing.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, Divergent is likely to divide audiences. Fans of Roth's books should be, on the whole, pleased. This is a frequently very good, intelligent adaptation of a rather problematic novel. Everyone else, however, might be less enamoured of the final product: a film that, just like the book on which it is based, boasts a compelling story and some great ideas, but is also messily executed, overly complicated and a tad nonsensical."

Peter Stabbing Edward in the eye with a butter knife or Christina not being on the ledge long enough, I could deal with because I realize that this is aimed at a younger audience and we can't sit watching someone hang for ten minutes from a ledge if we don't want to sit in the theater for 5 hours. However, my one complaint would be that Tris and Tobias were a bit awkward on screen together they always seemed so sure of themselves within the relationship and they meshed perfectly, but in the movie it just seems awkward and like they are trying too hard to be together."

","I found this movie Excellent!! At times I was confused but then I figured it out in the end. Although it contains violent actions I didn't find it that horrifying. I love how there seems to have time for romance when their world is being slaughtered, and how unpredictable the characters are, e.g. You would think a good guy (Four) wouldn't be controlled or nice but he can and he is not a Mr. Nice guy at all (UNTIL THE END).... etc. This movie is very confusing to understand but if you pause it and rethink what the character just said (the parts where you didn't get) (because I did that) you'll understand more clearer. The first time my nephews watched this they wanted to watch something else because at one point the characters are here then they go somewhere else but who can blame them they're only 10 and 8 and they weren't even allowed to watch this SO.... Im in trouble ~ <br/><br/>v THIS WILL BE MY OPINION ALOUD. I cannot wait until the next one comes out.... This is MY FAVOURITE MOVIE THIS YEAR!! DIVERGENT!! <3"

","What did you expect? The Godfather? Granted I don't think its perfect but reading all these 1/10 negative reviews made me up my rating. You're a bunch of Erudites! Seriously, though, you can't watch Frozen and expect it to have Quentin Tarantino quality. Its like humor, not everyone has the same taste. Satire might not be your crucifix, that doesn't make a joke ""low quality"". The plot is pretty solid if you ask me, a post-apocalyptic society where the survivors developed a communistic system to avoid future chaos considering human nature drove the past civilization to destruction. Divergents have multiple aptitudes making them a threat to linear society. l admit I have above average intelligence, but even my 12 year old cousin understood the premise. The casting was splendid, Oscar nominee Shailene Woodley especially the scene where shes crying (no spoiler here) and Theo James' character develops well and opens up progressively and we were all genuinely terrified of Jai ""Eric""'s ruthlessness. Also Kate Winslet played a fine bitchy dame. The dialogue was believable and appropriate for the story (they were teens and this isn't a witty comedy). Overall, the story was thought-provoking. To those missing the bigger picture, there's actually a connection between this universe and ours. Our society also categorizes people either by race, religion, politics, culture, education, sexuality, school cliques (in a small range), etc. There's always expectations in each group, a social code that must be followed. I actually enjoy the way Divergent depicts authority in such a menacing way, showing how ridiculous these bigots can be. Why are there laws against gay marriage or against innocent children who were forced into the US and can't get an education/driver's license/job when they're adults? Ignorance, that's why. I hope this movie inspired its targeted young audience to rebel and fight for what is right in their judgment."

This movie creates an impression of something put together ""just in time"" before a deadline, like someone crammed the novel overnight, and then tried to slap something together to pass for a screen version.

","There are so many things fundamentally wrong with these movies/books. First off, the living conditions on the outside of this massive fence they built look much more pleasant than whats on the inside. Then, they only create 2 factions that anyone would want to be in, Dauntless and Erudite. Who would want to be always truthful, or give stuff up, or be a farmer when you can be a completely awesome police officer or be really smart. When they choose their factions, they all cut themselves with the SAME knife. If that doesn't spread disease, what does? Also, this entire series of movies could probably be solved by just making DIVERGENT its own faction. How does Abnegation keep its power? wouldn't it just give it away? This could be applied to the entire movie. Why is it that Dauntless, when it finds out about Erudite plotting to overthrow the government, they don't say, ""Shouldn't we do something? aren't we the POLICE?"" This movie is just so bad on so many levels. I would highly recommend this to anybody who doesn't get the concept of plot at all, and those to slow to understand what happens in a movie."

","I'm a fan of near-future films set in dystopian worlds, but this 'Hunger Games' rip-off never tries to reach beyond its obvious 16-24-year old demographic. Young adults are assigned to clan-like groups based on their personality type. Those who do not fit any profile, Divergents, are seen as a threat. This flimsy premise is the basis for an incoherent narrative that neither entertains not provokes thought. The sole purpose seems to be to show the young, fit cast running, jumping, climbing, punching, kicking ass and wielding big guns. Kate Winslet mugs it up and it would not be a surprise if she winked directly at camera. I wasn't expecting it to be 'Gattaca', but the fact that it is this flat and predictable is disappointing."
"facorread","1","3","6","26 August 2014"," Faction systems should not be on film
","A faction system makes this film look like an role-playing game. People in it are one-dimensional, boring, and all undeveloped. The film focuses on Dauntless faction, whose members are presumably the only ones in the society who are capable to handle weapons, engage in combat, jump, board moving trains, and do other irrelevant stunts. Dramatic music is the cue to the viewer that this faction is the cool posse to aspire to, and the other factions don't matter.<br/><br/>In this scenario, the title ""Divergent"" leaves no space to spoilers: Girl doesn't know what faction to choose, but obviously she will not choose the same faction as her parents. Her aptitude tests are inconclusive, she applies to Cool Faction Dauntless, she competes for a position in it, and guess what? she earns a position. You know that even before she makes her first appearance on screen. Here is the big non-spoiler: after a while, the ""Divergence"" causes something that shakes the foundation of society and the very factions system.<br/><br/>What is this film trying to achieve? It's not a visual experience, not a dramatic experience, not a political statement, not a comedy, not a sports film, not a sci-fi film, not a film for young adults, and definitely not an action film. Some people could be easily fooled by this film trying to be all of that, but the end result is a predictable, boring film, devoid of any credibility or chemistry.<br/><br/>The film tries to explore personal identity through a system of factions. Nice try. It ends up conveying the message that if you like sports and combat, then you should not go to university, because they are mutually exclusive. If you are generous and caring for people, then you are a coward and cannot be part of the armed forces because these are mutually exclusive. Even if that was true in real life, the film is also an indication that factions do not need each other to survive. These premises are so stupid that producers are tacitly shamed into leaving the faction system unused and irrelevant.<br/><br/>The film also tries to explore the value of choices, but guess what: the central character makes random choices without any motivation and without assuming any consequence of her actions. It's apparent that the premise ""Faction before blood"" isn't part of the culture in the film, to the point that people wimps for their families after they chose to leave them out of free will.<br/><br/>The most dangerous message in this film is: individualism is a threat to peace."

This movie is the production of a marriage between Harry Potter and The Hunger Games where the mother (The Hunger Game) drank too much alcohol, smoked too much cigarettes and used every possible drugs during its pregnancy, and guess what, the child comes out completely deformed, mentally deranged, horrible to look at, and unbearable to watch.

If you see it as just a movie I guess that Neil Burger did a pretty decent job. But I have read the book and i barely made it trough the whole movie. First of all they totally messed up the storyline. It's like letting a toddler copy a Picasso, if you look closely you can see the original in there somewhere. And second of all they didn't manage to get even half of the brutality and intensity from the book in to the movie, the fight scenes are a joke, not to talk about the casting. I guess some of the actors where pretty good but none of them where right for their rolls. And what about the plot twist? They completely messed that up, revealing what was going to happen way before it did. I know that transferring a book in to a movie is hard but come on, rewriting scenes like this should be a crime. In conclusion Neil Burger completely and totally raped a fine piece of literature.

Don't get me wrong I'm not a massive fan of the hunger games films but at least there was some originality, great casting and performances.<br/><br/>So our heroine (aka Katniss lite) finds she is a divergent ie she can do more that one thing - and the overwhelming feeling is one of 'so what'. These two words echoed inside my head for the entire remainder of the film.<br/><br/>And that's it folks. Our heroine's struggle is one big 'so what'. Her training 'so what'. Her escape 'so what', the revelations 'so what', the tattoos 'so what', the fight back 'so what' etc etc. All the way to the end when it just becomes one big 'so what'. <br/><br/>So what was the point. As an auteurs vision it is non existent. You could hot swap a whole host of middle of the road jobbing Hollywood directors and the end result would be this. This is not an auteurs film. Watch a Michael Mann, Scorsese or Christopher Nolan film and you know you are watching a singular directors vision. Whilst even their films may have their flaws they are compelling narratives delivered with visual and artistic flair.<br/><br/>So if it's not that then what is it.<br/><br/>It is a commercial venture designed to separate the viewing public from their money. It's a cynical exploitation of the hunger games films. That fact that is not very good and is an insult to the intelligence of anyone with even moderate intelligence is irrelevant ultimately. <br/><br/>It's a money grabbing turd. Exactly the kind of film Hollywood wants.

"klynken","4","3","6","24 July 2014"," The Twilight Games
","I would give this a 1/10, but that's just as ridiculous as giving movies like this a 10/10. First off dear friends, the new phenomenon, young adult action'ish films, can actually be done. well, even. this was not. I could not, if it cost me my life, sit through the last two twilight films, but the first twilight movie, i actually enjoyed. And what about The Hunger Games? i mean, that's actually a really good movie, and i can't wait for the next one (R.I.P. Philip Seymour Hoffman).<br/><br/>By looking at all of these user reviews, you should by now have come to conclusion that if you are a teenage girl, you CAN actually love this movie. But if you're like me, you yelled at your TV screen out of sheer frustration. you now, like watching a train wreck. <br/><br/>You know what i love? Movies that respect the viewers intelligence. I mean, its just lazy writing to me, that Shailene Woodley has to explain everything we're about to see, in the opening of the film. And after explaining this perfect system, this perfect world which is created after world war 3 happened (apparently), we as viewers immediately start putting up red flags. The amount of flaws in this ""perfect"" system, is just staggering. Also, where is the faction for Miscellaneous? You know, the tattoo artist's (who also has side jobs, working for the government, doing test's), the servants, postmen etc.<br/><br/>Anyway, i pretty much just liked Shailene in this, she did okay with the trash she had to work with, though i think action movies just doesn't suit her. yet. She's just not bad-ass enough. The scene where the mother dies (i said spoiler alert!) actually worked for me, its cliché and the ""shootout"" was so amateurishly done i don't even know where to start, but Tris'(Shailene Woodley) reaction, was just spot on in my opinion. It's just to bad she completely ruins it a few minutes later when her dad dies, and her reaction is supposed to be the cliché-full ""You killed a male character that means a lot to me, now i'm as angry as can get!"" and instead we see a kind of ""my dad just died, meh, who cares""-reaction. The climatic scene where Tris points the gun to her own head and says, calmly, ""its okay, i love you"" was actually very good. i loved the fact that we didn't get the big ""I LOVE YOU"", cue the emotional score with all the violins etc. instead it was subtle and very well done. this is again ruined with the scene where Shailene fights Kate Winslet. i mean.. just.. delete that from the movie.. please..<br/><br/>Now! SFX! am i the only who think this movie looked outdated, graphically? Holy jebus it looked bad. also, makeup department - what went wrong in the ""kiss scene""? Shailene looks like a prostitute who just got hold of a truckload of makeup, in a city where nobody has makeup (!?) The set's also look like crap. the futuristic feel completely falls through, and ends up looking like they ran out of budget and time. <br/><br/>And please don't hire Zoë Kravitz again. come on! <br/><br/>Just... re-watch the hunger games.. Divergence copies it so obviously and horribly, just watch the real thing. <br/><br/>I'm still looking forward to seeing Shailene Woodley again in future films, but this Divergence franchise MUST die... just, lay down and die. <br/><br/>Too bad the desired audience for this was teenage girls, it had a lot of potential. I love sci-fi, post apocalyptic, i love Shailene Woodley, i loved Limitless, i love Junkie XL and Hans Zimmer. This movie needs a remake in 15 years, with a much much much darker and gritty feel."
"TheMarwood","4","3","6","23 July 2014"," YA Dystopia
","This boneheaded blunt force allegorical tale about a teen with the ability to think with free will, which is dangerous in this dystopian society, is too derivative to swallow. Divergent is tailor made for the least discerning teen viewer, who likes their characters a bit less than one dimensional and their romances telegraphed with all the artistry of a daytime soap. The attempt to class up these proceedings with what amounts to an extended cameo by Kate Winslet backfires with her villainous role, that even she can't transcend with this cornball material. <br/><br/>Shailene Woodley barely registers as a presence, has no charisma and can't carry this film. She brings nothing to her role and you have to demolish suspension of disbelief to accept her as a young woman who can handle herself in action. <br/><br/>The effects are adequate, with the exception of a zip line sequence through some run down skyscrapers, that serves no narrative purpose but to show off some effects they didn't have the money to do correctly. <br/><br/>Running at about two hours and twenty minutes, Divergent begins with our main character having to make the most important decision of her life by choosing her faction - but there's no suspense or compelling material watching an undeveloped character go through this. The narrative then becomes an endless series of training sequences, before rushing into a last act that feels like an entire sequel condensed into a climax. <br/><br/>With so little substance, it's going to be an insurmountable task to make this a running series of films that won't be instantly crushed under the weight of its own flimsy premise."
"leather-turtle","6","3","6","16 April 2014"," ""Divergent"": Conformist, Mainstream, Mediocre
","I was willing to take a risk on watching this movie late at night because it sounded like something bold and daring and I trusted Kate Winslet's name on the credits.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet's character is actually in charge of the conformist government and her acting skills seemed entirely negated in this role, like she plays a zombie for the entire film, and there's nothing interesting about the character she plays.<br/><br/>I've never seen Twilight or any movie in the series, but this movie got me in the mood to give them a shot. I think they'd be an improvement.<br/><br/>What starts off as a bright and hopeful movie with the central character, Beatrice Prior (Tris in the cast listing), giving an attractive assessment of the factions, especially Dauntless, turns into something dark and... stupid. She enters Dauntless and finds that it's run by jerks. We get the predictable scenes and scenarios of her almost getting kicked out of Dauntless to become factionless but she barely makes it in. She befriends one of the jerks who helps her and with whom she's destined to fall in love, just as in every other mainstream, teenage romance.<br/><br/>One of the parts that made me groan was when Beatrice Prior climbed the ferris wheel to get a better view of their opponents and her romantic interest and co-leader of the group, ""Four"", didn't want to follow her any higher BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID OF HEIGHTS. He even said, ""We all have our weakness."" This, to me, was an overt attempt to appeal to every cowardly teenager who is also afraid of heights and a clear declaration of how spineless ""Divergent"" as a movie really is. There was a lot of this kind of follow-through.<br/><br/>Beatrice Prior, in being ""Divergent"", is actually a pretty normal teenage girl/woman who doesn't so much fit into a category as wants to fulfill her potential. Everyone else pretty much chooses conformity. It's as if being ""Divergent"" reaches a ceiling of conformity in this movie and everyone's lives become predictable.<br/><br/>I sincerely DO NOT recommend this movie unless you're in the mood to shove plastic brain pulp into your head. It sucked. I'm giving it 6 stars because it has Hollywood production quality, and I like to reserve much lower ratings for movies that don't even try to live up to mainstream expectations.<br/><br/>Besides: This movie doesn't suck in any exceptional way other than calling itself ""Divergent"" when it's one of the most conformist, mainstream, and mediocre movies I've ever seen. It deserves a mediocre rating....<br/><br/>It makes me a bit sad that this movie is classified as Sci-Fi... and Action to a lesser degree. At least when Twilight is called Fantasy, one may readily add ""delusional teenage"", which seems possibly more appropriate here when the same kind of movie is titled ""Divergent"". I don't think many Sci-Fi or Action movie fans will enjoy this movie. It looks like quality, but it's really schlock.<br/><br/>The least disappointing parts of this movie involved the excellent acting of Ashley Judd and Tony Goldwyn, who play Beatrice Prior's parents. They play the roles so well, convincingly, and genuinely, that I could forget for that time that the rest of the movie lacked any depth, meaning, or sincerity. For their screen time, I didn't feel I had to hold a great big load of crap at the back of my mouth to entertain the premise of the movie while all meaning of that premise was repeatedly violated by flat, spineless characters. Judd and Goldwyn deserve significant praise for pulling that off, and fortunately their characters were both killed during the movie so they probably won't have to endure any sequels to come :-)<br/><br/>This is another movie suitable for the decadent, self-deceived, spoiled teenagers who have yet to actually deal with reality on their own and discover the real consequences of being ""Divergent"", but good and bad."

","So I went into the movie excited. I had only finished the book 2 weeks prior so I knew I would be biased and therefore I over-looked the movie's portrayal of the book in order to critic the cinematography. However, I wasn't pleased. I was happy as a clam just to be there and enjoyed myself, but the movie wasn't great. The acting seldom felt genuine, the scenes were extremely choppy, they left no room for any character development and barely felt any room for plot development and included the silliest, cliché parts but not the would-be significant plot-defining parts of the book. The thing I am most disappointed with though is Trice. When I read the book, Shalene (sp?) was exactly who I pictured, but once I got into the theatre, I was sorely disappointed in what I saw.<br/><br/>But I will admit, the action was great and the choppiness was good in the sense that it kept the adrenaline going throughout the movie. The settings and costumes were spectacular and they did do an honest job of trying to put as much of the book into a 2 hour film as was physically possible....?"
"ralphellis1979","3","3","6","1 April 2014"," Good Marketing - Moderately Interesting Plot
","The makers of Divergent looked at Twilight and Hunger Games and said ""How can I make a boat load of money?"" First you start with a boring, unremarkable, uninteresting teenage girl who ends up with a hunky boyfriend (Twilight) and have her Save The World (Hunger Games). This allows all of the other boring, unremarkable teenage girls to identify with the movie because they know that they too could save the world and have a hunky boyfriend if only they could stop Tweeting, watching 9 hours of MTV a day and eating fast food. Give credit where credit is due. The producers understand their market as much as the makers of John Wayne westerns and Oprah Winfrey TV shows. From a SciFi perspective, the organization of the society is a interesting plaything. You have to wonder though how the current government leaders of the society, the Abnegation faction, are so poorly connected to the mechanisms of power that their only option is to run when the Erudite faction tries to take over. The whole movie is designed to produce two more sequels so the cash cow can be milked. All in all, Divergent is a predictable, moderately interesting SciFi flick that will appeal to the main body of movie goers who are teenagers."

After waiting the ten minutes I walk into the theater and notice an older man dead asleep in the back row. This was that warning from God that you know this film was going to be just downright bad.<br/><br/>The story is yet another dystopian future film aimed towards the younger audiences who just really want to see this films for the young guys or the young girls. Frankly it seems like we get stories like this every year now. Back in the 70s and 80s we got amazing dystopian future films like Rollerball, Running Man, and Death Race 2000. As you may already know the stories are far better in those films than in this film being discussed here. In Divergent we get a lousy script tossed at the wall as the filmmakers hoped something would stick. Well when this slop was tossed onto the big screen nothing really stuck at all. Even the acting is completely forgettable minus an actor or two like Shailene Woodley and Kate Winslet. Mostly everyone else is phoning it in big time.<br/><br/>Junkie XL, whatever kind of name that is, did the music score for this film. And yet again it was more slop thrown at a wall hoping it would stick. It doesn't stick of course. We are subjected to trendy new age music that the younger generation might like instead of a Hans Zimmer type score, the executive producer of the score for this film. Zimmer is a huge name in musical scores and the creators of this likely wanted some name power. And Zimmer is a guy who rarely turns down checks.<br/><br/>Overall if you are in the category that this film is targeted towards, for example young teenage girls, then you will likely eat this film up. To the rest of us its slop on a movie screen. I'm all for dystopian future films being made, however I'm not interested in the ones that are only made to ride the success of a film that is nearly the same exact thing. This film is a big time pass, and frankly it is not even worth a rental."

"vampirebitesme16","10","17","61","22 March 2014"," A Quality Adaptation
","First and foremost I am a reviewer writing after seeing Divergent, a movie which I was looking forward to from the novel's release. I am usually wary about books being adapted into films mostly because-as anyone is-the last thing I want to see is my favorite novel get butchered. This was not the case. Divergent was a beautiful movie. If you have no idea what the movie is about and are just a big movie buff, I encourage you to watch it! Neil Burger is an excellent director and all the aerial views are just breath taking. The acting is incredible! Shailene woodley adds a new perspective to Tris' characterization. She is a strong female heroine who kicks serious butt, but on top of it all she is flawed. While many veterans to the novel do not feel Woodley accurately portrays Tris' small stature and young aesthetics, I was actually okay with this. Shailene allowed Tris to be 'weak' and underestimated. Her acting gave Veronica Roth's character justice. Theo James is exactly what I imagined for Four. Slightly aloof, and yet passionate at the same time. The film did not disappoint, in its inclusion of important events. It was paced perfectly, and didn't feel rushed like other adaptations have. Divergent is a stand alone movie that I'd recommend whether you've read the book or not. Do not mistake it for one of those teeny bopper YA adaptations that focuses on the cheesy love stories and triangles. Tris and Four compliment each other and while the relationship and dynamic will make teenage girls squeal, this movie is really an action thriller. There's no buffoon parents. (In fact Mrs. Prior kicks serious buttocks herself). This movie is raw and really top notch. There's a strong message not only on individuality but on family, friendship, and being the person you are. This movie should not be compared to Twilight, or The Hunger Games. Divergent is a category of its own."
"Hellmant","10","16","57","24 March 2014"," The guys cast here are actually able to hold their own with the awesome female cast!
","'DIVERGENT': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Big budget adaptation of the popular youth book about a future world where society is divided into different factions based on people's beliefs and ethics. The hero of the story is a young woman who doesn't fit into any category, so she's labeled a 'divergent', which makes her a threat to government and the accepted conformist way of life. It stars Shailene Woodley as the divergent heroine and co-stars Theo James, Kate Winslet, Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Miles Teller, Zoë Kravitz, Tony Goldwyn and Maggie Q. It was directed by Neil Burger and written by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor (based on the book by Veronica Roth). I enjoyed it quite a bit and found it to be one of the better youth book film adaptations ever made.<br/><br/>The story is set sometime in the future, after a war which divides the remaining civilization into five different factions (that are supposed to represent a person's skills and virtues). There's amity (which are the people who are the most peaceful), abnegation (made up of the selfless), candor (the most honest), erudite (the most intelligent) and dauntless (the world's most brave and fearless). There comes a time when teenagers must make a choice to either stay in the faction they were raised in or pick another. First they take a test which tells them which faction they belong in. Beatrice Prior, who later goes by Tris (Woodley), fails the test and is known by what society calls 'divergent' (due to the fact that she doesn't belong in any faction). Divergent people are seen as a threat to society, since they don't conform, and are killed because of it. Tris joins dauntless and must survive a rigorous testing process, in order to be accepted there, while also keeping her divergent status a secret. At the same time she learns there's a plot by one faction to overthrow another.<br/><br/>I really like the setup to this sci-fi tale; it's interesting, complex and very entertaining at the same time. Burger (who won't return for the two planned sequels) and the screenwriters did a great job of bringing this world to life on screen. It's intense and very emotional at times. One of my favorite parts of the film is the performances; I think Woodley is an amazing talent to watch out for and is very impressive as the lead here. Usually the male actors suck in these youth book adaptation flicks but the guys cast in this are actually able to hold their own with the awesome female cast. I thought James looked horrible in the previews but he's not bad in his role at all. I also think Jai Courtney is always interesting to watch and it's funny to see Miles Teller as Woodley's bitter rival (after last seeing those two as lovers in 'THE SPECTACULAR NOW', which was one of the best movies of last year). Winslet, Judd, Q and especially Woodley are all of course outstanding in the female roles and I thought the whole film was just really well put together. I especially liked the main message of the movie; that it's good to be different and an independent thinker (even if you're seen as a threat to the conformist way of life) because being unique is definitely something to look up to. It's great that 'THE HUNGER GAMES' has raised the bar so high for movies like this because now we get much better quality films because of it!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UY2UtXfI_w"

","My 11-year-old daughter had read the book Divergent and so of course dragged me off to see the movie opening weekend. We both absolutely loved the movie. The movie Divergent is action-packed with very likable characters. I found the movie kept my attention from beginning to end, with some light moments, a bit of romance, and lots of excitement throughout. I'm a big Hunger Games fan and thought Divergent was every bit as good, and in some ways better.<br/><br/>Based on our advice, my wife and 9-year old son went to see Divergent this weekend and both loved the movie equally as much. We can't wait for the sequel next year."
"muhammadalinajfi","10","13","46","19 March 2014"," An Excellent Movie for an Excellent Book
","In my opinion, Divergent was fantastic and a must see-movie. Divergent is the most pure and honest movie based on a book I have ever seen. It does not remove almost any important scenes from the book and yet it still stitches the whole thing together to fit perfectly, and beautifully. It does this so well, that companions who haven't read the book still understand everything. It also made my friends want to read it; and though some of them did not want to start from the first book since they saw the movie, they started from the second and have not encountered parts which they did not understand. This is because the movie is so well made that they did not leave out anything in production, like most big production companies do. Divergent has action, adventure, romance, comedy, mystery, etc. It is the perfect movie to me. The actors are fantastic, and Shailene Woodley and Theo James rock the roles of Tris and Four in perfect unison. Divergent brings fans wildest imaginations to life, and flies the words of the book of it's pages."
"ppattie","8","10","34","20 March 2014"," Great start
","Divergent is the great start of this trilogy. The movie contains many details from the book but not at all. It need to contains some more details such as the train. I think Theo James needs to work more on some acting. I like the organization on film. There is not too much romantic path and not too much action. It is great for people who don't like much bloody actions. Many people compare this with The Hunger Games.But this movie is different.I am the one who read the book before and I think the movie make my imagination real.The movies make me excited even I has known the end. I wish this trilogy will be success.This is good for anyone to see. I can't wait for the Insurgent."
"paigesdiscourse2003","10","15","57","24 March 2014"," Loved It!
","Divergent is thought provoking, psychological and an intense movie. I love the marketing behind the movie, where one can take a quiz to see which faction he or she would most likely represent. (It will be interesting to see if fans of divergent will model their primary faction by wearing similar colors and by purchasing and wearing the medallion that symbolizes their chosen virtue). It's amazing to me that those who elected to rate Divergent, compare it to ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Twilight"" trilogies. <br/><br/>I understand and get it... for this appears what human nature does... Yet, I believe it would be wise to rate ""Divergent"" independently of it's own cast, plot, content and adaptation. What is the point of comparing similar movies? To rip it to shreds? To manipulate or sway the readers opinion to your own? <br/><br/>Just as it isn't really fare to compare a new relationship to a previous one because each person IS Different, and it doesn't give the new person (movie) the chance to hold its own. I don 't believe it's wise to do this when critiquing ""Divergent."" (It doesn't have to be so black and white and or, all or nothing).<br/><br/>Lastly, I think it's interesting that as I write out my review, as I read and analyze other peoples opinions, I believe we are getting a small glimpse to who they are, what they believe and which faction he or she may value most."
"monalisacomputers","10","13","49","20 March 2014"," What can I say? Just go see it!
","For those who might have missed the IMDb disclaimer...Spoiler Alert!<br/><br/>I personally loved the Divergent Trilogy and this movie. This movie was engaging and managed to hold my interest straight through until the end, even preventing me from using the restroom because I couldn't stop watching.<br/><br/>Most of the reviews that say it is slow are from people who expect the entire 487 page book to be completely encompassed in a 2 hour movie. They have to leave out some parts, both to save time and to maintain a PG-13 rating as certain segments of the book would be considered gratuitous violence (can anyone say ""Whoa, a butter knife?""). Anyone who has read the books will know that the original did not contain a huge amount of action and half of what it did have would be too graphic for most children and teenagers to view occur on film. They kept quite a bit of it but toned it down some.<br/><br/>Almost all of the major plot points, rivalries, training, Dauntless antics, humor, romance and emotions are portrayed excellently. My eyes even got a bit moist at two points near the end due to Shailene Woodley's excellent portrayal of the emotions she experienced from a few particular deaths. I wanted to reach through the screen and knock out Kate Winslet at one point.<br/><br/>This movie stands on its own feet quite well and yet leaves plenty of room for the sequel. I personally can't wait for the next one because I know how awesome it'll be when we reach the book that actually has lots of action which can be easily included.<br/><br/>I always find it interesting that good reviews get voted way down and bad reviews often have near perfect ""helpful"" votes. If you like the books then ignore the reviews, even this one, and just go see the movie for yourself. Enjoy!"
"katyalet0309","10","14","54","22 March 2014"," It more depends on the viewer's opinion.
","Well I'm not going to stay here and list all the good and bad things about the movie. Sure, it wasn't as good as the book but you can't compare the two.<br/><br/>People usually complain how the movie is different from the book. How some scenes were cut short or not in the movie at all. However you must keep in mind that a book gives you an insight into the character. Into their thoughts, reasons, and knowledge. A book may contain countless pages of explanations. A movie, whereas, has to format the book into a two hour clip. Try and imitate the person's thoughts through expressions and actions. A two hour movie won't be able to include all the scenes from the book. The movie was actually pretty good and did include most of the important scenes for a 500 page book. <br/><br/>Another complaint is that the characters in the movie don't ""fit the standards."" Well, I'm pretty sure that everybody who has read the book have imagined the character differently. However the producers can't pick the perfect actors that will be able to fit everybody's expectations. They pick the characters they think fit best and if the author agrees then why are you complaining? The author definitely knows how their character should look like.<br/><br/>So, after saying all that, I personally think that the movie was great and that you should go and watch it before judging it based on the critical reviews of those who can't accept the fact that the movie couldn't fully match the book. As you watch it, keep in mind that even though the movie might not be up to your standards, it could have been a lot worse."
"zardoz-13","9","11","40","24 March 2014"," An Immaculate Cinematic Adaptation
","The immaculate cinematic adaptation of Veronica Roth's futuristic bestseller ""Divergent,"" set in a post-apocalyptic Chicago, is neither as gripping nor as gritty as its literary counterpart. I read the first installment of Ms. Roth's trilogy two weeks ago, and adventurous but formulaic best describes its narrative. Interestingly, Summit Entertainment is the same Hollywood studio that regaled us with the ""Twilight"" franchise as well as the ""The Hunger Games"" movies. Based on the $56-million ""Divergent"" coined over its first weekend, Summit has launched its third lucrative franchise. By its second week of release, ""Divergent"" should recoup the remainder of its $85 million production costs before the ""Captain America"" sequel stomps it into obscurity at the box office. Comparably, ""Divergent"" lacks the taboo romance of ""Twilight"" and the pugnacious pluck of ""The Hunger Games."" Happily, it surpasses its closest competitors—the colorless ""Vampire Academy"" and ""Twilight"" novelist Stephanie Meyer's other dead-on-arrival tale ""The Host"" that toplined a similarly feisty female. Chiefly, ""Divergent"" differs because its' government lacks the Draconian nature of its counterpart in ""The Hunger Games."" The fascist government that keeps its boot wedged firmly against the collective neck of Katniss Everdeen, her friends and family in ""The Hunger Games"" is conspicuously absent in ""Divergent."" Our heroine, Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley of ""The Descendants"") isn't like Katniss, and she doesn't define herself with an iconic choice of weapons so much as a lifestyle pursuit. Ultimately, like ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Star Wars,"" Beatrice finds herself cornered in a flawed society that treacherous evildoers want to sabotage through any means at hand. Consequently, ""Divergent"" doesn't have the built-in, ticking time bomb conflict that ""The Hunger Games"" has with a rebellion. Indeed, this predicament isn't far ahead, but at least not in this origins opus. ""Divergent"" incredibly surprising, but its 140 running time won't wear you out.<br/><br/>""Limitless"" director Neil Burger and ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" writer Evan Daugherty and ""Game of Thrones"" scribe Vanessa Taylor depict a dystopian society that has split itself into factions to prevent any one fraction from gaining the upper hand. Indeed, the unrest that lurks ominously in ""Divergent"" grows out of a conspiracy between wicked members of two fractions. The message, I suppose, is old people aren't entirely trustworthy. Meanwhile, ""Divergent"" opens with a gathering where teenagers can declare the fraction of their choice. At age sixteen, male and females assemble for The Choosing Ceremony. Basically, after a war that ended 100 years ago, the survivors divided themselves into a handful of groups: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless, and Erudite. Each group is based on a personality virtue. Abnegation consists of selfless people who place the needs of others before their own. They feed the poor wretches who are not members of a fraction. Amity represents the peaceful people. Candor is made up of those who exalt honesty and truth. Erudite worships intelligence and sagacity. Not surprisingly, Dauntless embraces bravery and reckless impetuosity. Our wallflower protagonist Beatrice hails from a selfless Abnegation family. Abnegates dress in gray and are contemptuously denigrated as 'stiffs.' Andrew (Tony Goldwyn of ""Ghost"") and Natalie (Ashley Judd of ""Kiss the Girls"") are Beatrice's parents. Caleb (Ansel Elgort of ""Carrie"") is Beatrice's brother. Before The Choosing Ceremony, each teen submits to an aptitude test. The results indicate the suitable fraction for them to join. Dauntless member Tori (Maggie Q of the TV series ""Nikita"") exams Beatrice. The rules dictate the test administrator must belong to a different fraction from the one the tested teen comes from. Something goes wrong with Beatrice's test. ""You're different. You don't fit into a category,"" Tori confides in her. "" They can't control you. They call it Divergent. You can't let them find out about you."" Testing divergent is the worst thing that can happen to a teen in this society. No fraction will accept them if the divergent test results are made known. A sympathetic Tori warns Beatrice to conceal her status from everybody, including her parents. Nevertheless, this impediment doesn't stop Beatrice from surprising her mother and father. She joins the Dauntless. She struggles to keep up with these adrenaline junkies. They love to scale the elevate railway platforms and scramble aboard trains as the trains are breezing out of the station. Getting off these trains proves to be even more challenging! The Dauntless expects them to leap off the trains and land on nearby rooftops. Eventually, Beatrice renames herself Tris and braves perils galore during her initiation ritual, including a homicide attempt on her life. Gradually, she evolves from a lowly worm to a self-propelled butterfly with a kick. Along the way, she attracts the eye of one of her superiors, Four (Theo James of ""Underworld: Awakening""), and an amorous relationship develops between the two.<br/><br/>Anybody who has read Roth's novel shouldn't be surprised by the textual omissions Burger and his scenarists have deleted some of the more violent scenes. The use of chemicals to test Dauntless faction members, especially with regard to their fears, resembles the missions in ""The Matrix."" Like ""The Matrix,"" ""Divergent"" wrestles with the theme of conformity. Our tenacious heroine learns how to handle herself during boot camp combat. As the finale appears on her horizon, Tris knows more about those she loved that she didn't know. She finds more strength in herself than she thought impossible, too. She enters the Dauntless world as an expendable but emerges triumphant. The scene on the Ferris wheel is cool. Casting is letter perfect. Actress Shailene Woodley was born to play Beatrice. She looks comfortable in the role. Although co-star Theo James appears a little too old as her boyfriend Four, the two generate chemistry and that makes us care about them. ""Titanic's"" Kate Winslet plays the chief villain, and Jai Courtney of ""Live Free: is appropriately sinister as Eric, who ranks above Four in the Dauntless hierarchy. Nothing about ""Divergent"" is remotely offensive, but its strong cast maintains our attention as does its futuristic designs."

It didn't hurt that the one they had playing Four was without a doubt, hot... and even the other instructor that was a butthead was kinda cute.

I love my movies, and have watched more than probably any one person should, so I will count this among one of my favorites... and that is saying a lot.

The music choice is what really got to me emotionally, it matched the film perfectly.

But boy was I wrong - I'm so glad i decided to watch this movie in cinemas for it is now my favourite movie! Some people didn't like the actors, but from the perspective of a person who hasn't read the books, Shailene Woodley and Theo James were too perfect, the chemistry was there and the relationship development was sweet and not too fast.

","Go see Divergent. See it if you have read the book or if you haven't. But especially if you've read the book. As a fan of the book I really loved it, and the friends I saw it with who hadn't read it also enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I really feel that the Neil Burger directed film did Veronica Roth's book justice. It just felt authentic in bringing that story world to life, from actually being shot in Chicago, to many of the actors doing their own stunts, to the fact that it was perfectly cast. The changes they did make from the source material only improved upon some quibbles I had with Roth's characterization and plotting as a first time author, and made sense cinematically. Fans can also rest easy, because Roth was a producer, so she had a big hand in shaping this film. <br/><br/>Shailene Woodley was a great Tris. She is a great actress capable of conveying a wide range of emotions, and she totally embodies the toughness but relatability that is Tris. As a heroine, I found that she's a very good feminist role model for girls. She holds her own the way a male lead in an action movie is expected to, and she defies gender stereotypes. Theo James is Four. He exudes masculinity, mystery, and fierceness. He and Shailene played opposite each other very well, and their chemistry was palpable. <br/><br/>So if you're a fan of The Hunger Games, action movies, or the Divergent book series, definitely go to see Divergent in theaters. It's an action packed thrill ride filled with great performances!"

","I had heard nothing about this movie before I began to watch it. After seeing the first 10 minutes, I can confidently say that I could predict the mind numbing 6 plus hours remaining in the trilogy. There are so many things wrong with this (recurring) movie adapted from the same model based on books with the same recurring story (characters, themes, etc.).<br/><br/>This laughable new genre of Teen Trilogies are todays version of the Mad-Libs books from my grade school days... except they are unable to turn the page to another storyline, are restricted to the same repetitive word bank and only able to exhibit originality through the cool first names assigned to the leading female protagonist.<br/><br/>The next Trilogy should be centered on a young author who discovers that all books are now only written by huge corporations aimed at maximizing profits (through follow up movies, documentaries, theme parks and related products) and how he/she plans on burning the whole boring system to the ground."

","What a lame premise of a movie. So many plot holes. It's painful to watch the amazing Kate Winslett playing such a shallow character. Same with Miles Teller, although when this was filmed, people didn't know about him. Ashley Judd at least has a little bit to work with, but it's not much.<br/><br/>Shailene Woodley does a pretty good job with her character, and I'm convinced she's on her way to a great career. Theo James also does a good job, although he's not given much to work with. <br/><br/>The main problem with the movie is its premise and story. It leaves too many things unreasonably unexplained, so you never really buy into the story. For such a hard-to-buy premise, it's even more important. They really should have established the world they were playing in better at the very beginning of the movie. For instance, Why the wall? Why would the evil faction hate the good faction? Mankind can be summed into 5 roles in society? Really?

","Expecting action and sci-fi? So was I. What do you get? The story of a young girl who faces challenges and tough decisions as she is coming of age. That about sums up the movie; and of course the run of the mill cheesy romance.<br/><br/>'Divergent' are set in a future society where mankind has survived some cataclysm, and are now living in a fenced city, with the people divided into factions which serves a societal function. It has the setting to explore multiple themes of human interaction, survival and philosophical questions.<br/><br/>Sounds cool? So, are there any themes explored? No. Are the factions explored? No. Are the mechanisms of society put to a test? No. Are the so-called 'dystopia' theme of the movie explored? No. How about an intricate plot and interesting characters? No. So what exactly do we have here? My opinion on movies is, no, you don't have to explore any philosophical issue, make social commentary or develop profound characters or story. Just make it fun, exciting and action packed etc.<br/><br/>'Divergent' delivers nothing but boring teenage drama, about some bland girl facing challenges of life and growing up in this future society. That is all. The only 'message' 'Divergent' promotes is that, it is OK to be yourself and stand out and don't let the grown ups stop you, and conforming to society is not so bad that either. Us young new hipster teens just need to remake society in our image and all the problems goes away.<br/><br/>The acting is unconvincing to just plain out of touch with the scenes. In my opinion, this is also a really horrible teenage romance drama, if that was all they were gunning for. Spanning 2 hours and 15min...Will be a waste of time."

Books like that tend to struggle to adapt well and Divergent is no different. The director tried to make changes to the story in order to try and make it work but I honestly think it was futile. It's just not a good story for a 2-hour interpretation. Even at that, I would rather have seen the story stay true and struggle to adapt than change and struggle. All in all, it was set up to fail from the beginning.

","Ever since I saw him in a UK television drama entitled ""Bedlam"" (2011) I thought that Theo James (""Number Four"") was a man to watch. He was certainly the hook that got me to start watching these adaptations of Veronica Roth's futuristic novels. Well, beauty can only take you so far; the rest has to be down to acting; dialogue etc. and this falls pretty flat on all counts. The premiss is unique - society is divided into five factions based on a perception of virtue. At 16, teenagers have to decide which they have and then they spend their lives living up to the ideals - involving strenuous mental and physical trials. ""Tris Prior"" (Shailene Woodley"") is an exception, however - she doesn't fit into any one category - and so the system has no idea how to cope with this renegade. When she reveals her confused status to James - her trainer - we embark on a tale of cat and mouse as she and a rag-bag gang of misfits set out to save a world that deems them all as a serious threat. It certainly looks good - budget clearly was not an huge issue, and it is broadly faithful to the book but therein lies the problem - it is a preposterous proposition from the outset - it has not even the weakest of anchors from the society we know today (i.e. how the hell could we ever have gotten ourselves into this kind of dystopian mess in the first place?). When romance begins to rear it's head too, then I started to forget how sexy Theo actually is and wonder what else I could watch... There are clearly some parallels with ""The Hunger Games"" series, but this one definitely comes off a very poor second."

","Divergent Review<br/><br/>In the exciting dystopian sci-fi film Divergent, discovering who you are is much easier than it seems. Taking place in the very run-down city of Chicago, everyone is born into one of the five factions, Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless or Erudite. The different factions are divided by different traits and characteristics of the people, such as the selflessness of abnegation, the honesty of Candor, etc. This is all supposedly to create peace, putting people who are similar together and having them work together to create a successful society. When people come of age, they will get one chance to choose which faction they want to be a part of forever. They have a test to help people find where they will best fit in, however they are free to choose whichever faction they want. Tris, however, finds that fitting in may not be as easy for her as it seems.<br/><br/>The setting for this film is very unique and fitting as a post-apocalyptic appearance, and the costumes and outfits are very basic and color-schemed, which is what divides the factions from each other and gives people their identity in a way. There is very little individuality in the factions- each person's role is simply to help the faction and society as a whole. The entire post-apocalyptic dystopian future setting seems to be a somewhat unsuccessful attempt at copying what the Hunger Games did, but with much more training and practicing than action-filled scenes. Tris' duty of climbing up the ranks is a much bigger focus of the film than all of the life-threatening political corruption throughout the film.<br/><br/>The overall acting and emotions of the actors is very good, but at times it can seem off and not fitting to the scene, which sort of ruins the way the scene is most likely supposed to make viewers feel. In some intense fights or in the sad scenes, Tris seems almost emotionless. However, this could also be due to the fact that dauntless have to be fearless and not show emotion, being willing to do things they do not want to for the good of the faction. This shows how she is changing from the shy girl to one of the strongest and bravest characters in the film.<br/><br/>The script is very easy to follow for as young as young teenagers, making it a great film for most ages. It is put together well and not scattered everywhere, and there is a plot line that you can very easily follow along with and see why certain scenes end up being important later on. Although as stated previously, it seems like just another dystopian future film similar to hunger games, with two main characters who work together to overthrow the unfair and corruptly-ruled system. It starts off slow and then gets very intense towards the end, while lacking the many other action scenes that are scattered throughout Hunger Games which helped make it such a success. The audio and music throughout the film is surprisingly impressive, although mainly just in the few action scenes throughout the movie. There are only one or two true thrilling action scenes before the end of the movie, which seems to be where they crammed in all of the action. However, the music in those final scenes, such as intensifying music to foreshadow an upcoming fight, was very fitting and perfect for putting the viewers in the mood for some long-awaited action.
The cuts between different viewpoints are very good, not switching too fast but also not lingering in one place for too long and making it boring. It has very good editing from scene to scene and makes very smooth transitions, making it pleasant to watch compared to movies with annoying cuts every few seconds. Although there are some scenes where the camera switches angles a bit too often, throughout the film it is consistently good.<br/><br/>Overall I rate this film 7/10, because although it was a good movie, I felt as if there was so much more that they could have done to improve it such as adding more action instead of having training for 80% of the movie. The plot line was interesting and easy to follow, but if you are watching it just for intense action, this movie may not be for you. Nonetheless, it is still a very good film and was fun and enjoyable to watch."

","This review will discuss the entire trilogy. Obviously this series rides on the success of The Hunger Games. The budget was doubled for Divergent once THG made so much money. Unfortunately this series lacks in the qualities the made THG so great first and foremost the main character. Katniss is a born - if not reluctant- leader where Tris, our Divergent heroine is more milquetoast. Just like The Maze Runner, the first movie in the series is the best and the last, kinda sucks. Practically the whole thing is shot in front of a green screen and for this era, the CGI is pretty basic. I like a Dystopian YA stuff and really wanted to like this series but it's never more than ok. In THG you cannot help but cheer for Katniss, really feel her pain but with Tris is like whatev.

","Divergent is a science fiction film in action, fantasy and adventure. The divergent was officially released on March 18, 2014 in Los Angeles. The film was directed by Neil Burger, Evan Daugherty, and Vanessa Taylor.
The divergent tells of the city of Chicago which was destroyed by war. To create peace, 5 factions formed according to personality. Abnegation that is unselfish and simple. Erudite is smart and prioritizes science. Good and peaceful Amity, Candor who prioritizes honesty, and Dauntless who is brave and free. Whereas Divergent are people who have more than one faction in their personality.
Children who are 16 years old must take a test to choose a faction. After the test, Tris has 3 results there are Abnegation, Dauntless, and Erudite. Tris must keep his identity as a Divergent. During the selection ceremony, Tris finally chose Dauntless. It turns out that only 10 people will be elected as official Dauntless members. Because of abstinence and intelligence, Tris managed to become a member of Dauntless.
But chaos occurs when Erudite controls Dauntless's brain to attack Abnegation. Tris who is not affected by serum pretends like the others. At that time, Tris knew that For was also a Divergent. Eventually an attack was carried out by Erudite against Abnegation. In addition, Divergent hunting is also underway. However, all can be thwarted by Tris, Four, Marcus, Caleb, and Peter. The five of them fled with the train go to beyond the wall.
This movie have an easy to understand path. In addition, the acting of the players successfully supports the story. Divergent films are in accordance with the character of teenagers who want to find their identity."

","DIVERGENT (2014) In the future humanity is separated into five groups called factions. In this world civilization is based on these factions represented by the human virtues: Abnegation the selfless, Dauntless the courageous, Erudite the intellectual, Candor the truthful, and Amity the passive. When a member of this civilization becomes a teenager they are administered an invasive test to tell them what category they fit into. After the test the individual may choose his or her path, even if it is not the virtue the test revealed them to be in. The main character Tris, (AKA Stiff) played by Shailene Woodley, is revealed to be a divergent which means she does not fit in just one of these faction category, she is a combination of all of them, this is a threat to the order of civilization. Tris chooses to become Dauntless where she meets her soon to be boyfriend Four, played by Theo James. Together they embark on the impossible journey of overthrowing the government, and disengaging the devious leadership that controls the world they live in. The music in the movie is clear, especially in the powerful scenes during the beginning of the film when the Dauntless characters are introduced. The sounds of their actions are heightened with every move as they run through the crowed and scale a very high wall to jump aboard an extremely fast moving train headed to the Dauntless training facility. The audience can feel the sound effects giving them the sensation of being right there with the characters as they perform these daunting task. They give the viewer an emotional connection with the characters bringing a sense of reality to the film. Visual elements are eye candy for the viewer. There are masses of natural light used throughout the movie making it more realistic for the audience whom may be sitting in a dark theater, or a night viewing at home. This natural tone allows us to see things more clear giving the spectators a concise feel for what the characters are engaging in during the outdoor scenes. White light is used in the final scene where Tris and Four combat the enemy in the control room at the Dauntless training facility to reset the computerized mind controlling serum given to all the Dauntless characters. This is an effective way to show the audience how bright colors in a white light setting can enhance the viewer's visual perception of the environment.

"rommyles","6","0","0","1 May 2016"," my thoughts on divergent
","In the movie ""Divergent,"" the author writes about five factions, which represent how ""you"" think the world ended. They are Amity, Erudite, Dauntless, Candor, and Abnegation. The people in Amity believed the world ended because of violence; therefore they are the peaceful ones. The Erudite believe it ended because people weren't intelligent enough, they are considered the smart ones. Dauntless believe that it ended because we were not tough enough, they are the ones that are fearless and believe that violence can solve many problems. Candor believe in honesty and they think the world ended because of lying. Finally, Abnegation believes in selflessness, and therefore they are the charity workers and the selfless ones.<br/><br/>Violence is a key topic, there are two sides that will be present: people who think it is necessary to keep peace those who believe violence is not the answer. Author Steven Pinker shares his thoughts in his book called ""The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence has declined."" He discusses five different kinds of violent motives, including pure predation or exploitation, drive for dominance, revenge and sadism. He also writes about the parts of human nature that pull away from violence, such as empathy, self-control, a sense of fairness, reason, and rationality. For me, I believe that most problems can be solved without involving any sort of violent act. There are chances to be peaceful in certain situations because you never know the whole story behind everything and sometimes they can be taken out of context. In ""Divergent"", Amity is not as prominent, but they believe in peace and kindness. They believe that violence is never the answer and if you are not abiding to their rules, then you are not welcome to be associated with them. They abide by these rules and those who are not willing to cooperate will not be ostracized from those termed 'peacemakers.' <br/><br/>Intelligence is key in any certain situation, whether it be problem solving or it be a simple issue. Knowing more than your opponent can increase chances in victory. The Pinker article describes several types of intelligence: verbal-propositional, perceptual-organizational, speededness, and memory-retrieval. For example, why do people spend money to learn more about a chosen field? Knowing more about your surroundings greatly increases your chances of moving up in socio-economic status. One would not want a surgeon who failed to put hours in. Intelligence is an important quality and it is better to know more than to know nothing. For me, I aspire to complete an undergraduate education and do what is necessary to increase my knowledge in many different aspects of life. This includes being able to solve complicated situations that would be heretofore impossible if not for the ability to think about all of the possible solutions to the problem at hand. In Divergent, the main character's brother transferred from his home faction to Erudite.The main goal of this faction was to use their brains to develop a serum for injecting into everyone to determine if divergent. Those not 'controlled' were the ones that would be eliminated because they are a threat to the society. They are able to choose which one they wanted to be, instead of choosing one like the rest of everyone.<br/><br/>Fearless is not a characteristic to come easy. A person must let go of what makes one scared; moreover, believe in what one can do and let action take place. Fear makes a person weak. In order to be strong, let go of what is holding him back. Pinker states that there are six crucial lessons to help someone live fearless and free. First, fear is a feeling, not a fact. Second, state that your mafia mind is a bully. Third, states to be here now. Fourth, is about meditation. The fifth lesson is about exercising gratitude in motion. The sixth lesson states to get a check up from the neck up. These six lessons involve mental mind and how fear plays a role in how the mind can trick a person into thinking fearful, when in fact it is just the brain attempting to make one afraid. Dauntless is the main faction depicted in the movie as the protagonist, Tris transfers to this faction leaving family behind. She finds out later that she is divergent, meaning she does not belong in just one faction; she could belong in three of them. Throughout the process Tris' training, she becomes more and more fearless and she learns that her home faction may not have been who she is destined to become. She learns that her home faction may not have been where she is destined to become. Tris feels like she made the right decision by leaving her original faction and joining the new family. Ever since little, she would try to follow the fearless leaders of the community but could never go through with it as that was not what her faction was about. <br/><br/>It is possible that being honest can do more damage than not telling the truth. According to Pinker there are ten reasons why one should always tell the truth. The first one is trust, in order to be successful in life. A person must have a reputation of honesty. The second one is good health. People who tell the truth are healthier, they have less concern, less stress and feel better about them."

","I like the movie. More or less. Beautiful cinematography, rather good tempo. Good-looking actors. Of course, there definitely are gaps in the plot, and dialogues could be better...<br/><br/>My main discourage for the film was the casting. As I've said, good faces, some of them are new. That's good. But acting is not good. I almost can hear the director's headache of dealing with that human material. In some point of viewing the film I've been thinking of Theo James as good actor, but to be honest, he is good only with the tremendous efforts of the director and editors and being on the background of worse actors. Much worse. The biggest disappointment is the main character played by Shailene Woodley.<br/><br/>I get the idea of casting young actors. And I understand that it's hard to find good ones. But she even is not as good-looking as Theo James! Why was she chosen?<br/><br/>Concerning the plot. It has weak points. (Not too many as The Matrix, of course.) The romantic line is too obvious and too disappointing for me. She is just in the age of majority and he is her tutor with notable experience. But I can tolerate all of these. More dislikes I have about the idea of future series of films in advance of doing the first one. Money above all?<br/><br/>But, as I stated, not too bad."
"Screen_Blitz","7","0","0","23 July 2015"," Not as good as The Hunger Games, but very compelling
","In this dystopian thriller, based on the novel series by Veronica Roth, Shailene Woodley plays Tris, a 16-year old girl living in a futuristic city divided by factions based on virtues. These factions include Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless, and Erudite. Everyone (when they reach the age of 16) is assigned to take a psychological test that determines what faction they should join, and in the end, they are allowed to choose the faction of their choice. Tris takes the test and gets the rarest result--Divergent, which means she would not fit any particular faction. When she chooses Dauntless, she and the faction leader Four (played by Theo James) discover the plot to assassinate all who are Divergent as they seen as a threat to social order; and decide they must fight back.<br/><br/>To be clear, I never actually read the novel. Upon watching this, however, I found it very similar to the Hunger Games series. They both take place in a dystopian society that is divided up into factions (or districts), except there is no teenagers fighting to the death in a large arena in this one. While this wasn't as exciting and enthralling as the Hunger Games, it was very compelling and interesting to watch. The characters were great, I love how Shailene Woodley played Tris. It was a very interesting role her, especially since her role in the ABC family series ""Secret Life of An American Teenager"". Theo James was.........I guess okay as Four. I don't know if he was the best, but he didn't do too bad. The plot was pretty good, although it did drag a little bit in some spots. There were several scene where I started to lose interest, but when it reached it's climax, it got exciting. I enjoyed the climax towards the end, especially with Kate Winslet playing Jeanine, who is behind the whole to plot to take out the Divergents.<br/><br/>Divergent is a pretty decent movie, although it might have been better if I read the novel series before hand. Yes, the film has its flaws but its intriguing to watch and if you a big fan of the novel series, you'll just might enjoy it."

"slappyrox","5","0","0","28 June 2015"," A carbon copy that occasionally pleases.
","It seems as though the standard for Hollywood today is to throw money at any film adaptation of a popular young adult novel that might make a profit. Most of these films center around an innocent lead character born into a supernatural or futuristic world who is forced to overcome many obstacles, almost always finding love along the way. The craze started with the Harry Potter franchise, which was later succeeded by box office hits such as Twilight, The Hunger Games and their countless sequels. But now that the romantic spark of Bella and Edward has died down and the next visit to Panem isn't due until late 2014, teenage audiences have been left searching for another young adult movie train to hop onto (members of Dauntless should be informed that this pun was intended). Lucky for them, the search is over with Divergent, a film in which the performances and premise are almost too good for the reputation its arrogant critics are bound to give it.<br/><br/>In Divergent, Tris is played by the immensely talented Shailene Woodley (she starred in the young adult adaptation of The Spectacular Now and audiences can watch her again later this year on the big screen in yet another young adult adaptation, The Fault in Our Stars). Tris lives in a world where everyone is separated into groups, or factions, and she has finally gotten to the age where she must wear the Sorting Hat and find out whether she belongs to Gryffindor... correction: Tris must consume a serum that will recommend to her which of the five factions she should join: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Erudite, or Dauntless. When her results come up as unclear, she discovers that she is a Divergent and is considered a threat to the society of future dystopian Chicago. Instead of listening to her results, Tris joins Dauntless and begins jumping off of buildings for fun. This is where she meets a well-built and tough man, Four (I Am Number Four, anyone?), who also enjoys jumping off of buildings for fun. He cuts her ear with a knife in one of their early encounters, which would obviously lead to Tris falling head over heels for him. When the two realize that their feelings are shared, they team up to fight against the leader of Erudite, played by Kate Winslet, and stop her from killing everyone in Tris' original faction, Abnegation.<br/><br/>There were two groups of people, or factions, in the crowd when Divergent was screening in the theater: there were the audience members who truly wanted to analyze the film and see what all the craze was about, and then there were the teenage girls that giggled and cheered when they looked up from their cell phones to see Theo James take his shirt off. People who are part of the latter group will love the parts of this movie they look up to see regardless. But if audiences really want to see a quality film, they still may find some aspects to enjoy here. For example, the performances from an A-list cast are outstanding. Shailene Woodley and Theo James gave their all to their performances both through physical training and emotional line-delivery. Kate Winslet portrayed a villain whose path no one would like to cross. Even though the performances were exceptional, the characters did not seem as well developed as they could've been. This should be an easy fix though considering the next two sequels already have release dates. <br/><br/>Neil Burger's direction of the action sequences is very well executed. He avoids jerking the camera around aimlessly as so many current directors do to make choreography easier and instead allows the audience to see what they want to see. The adapted screenplay by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor is nothing special, but it did the job of compressing the 496 page book into a 150 minute runtime. Though some of the testing sequences were poorly done due to an overuse of cheesy special effects, they are easy to overlook seeing as they only take up a good five or so minutes of the final runtime. <br/><br/>Divergent is not a perfect film, but it leaves ample room for questions to be answered and characters to be developed further in future entries, and it undoubtedly lives up to its name when being compared to other films of the genre. For those who just cannot wait until next March to see the sequel, a trailer for The Maze Runner, the newest young adult adaptation, was conveniently played before every Divergent screening. Be prepared to push through heaping crowds of adolescents to purchase tickets."

","Divergent opens up the series to a fantastic chapter packed with some actions and exceptionally solid performances from Shailene Woodley and the rest of the cast. But amidst all of my positive reviews, Divergent seems to not fit in the YA crowd mainly to the comparison with The Hunger Games and its futuristic style similar to The Hunger Games. Also, I personally think that Divergent lacked some action even though it had action, there wasn't enough to amuse the audiences. The interest is what makes the viewers really want to watch a film. And the themes are, again, similar to The Hunger Games and can sometimes make no sense with its plot. Divergent opens its planned trilogy to a great, but disappointingly fashion."

","I really didn't expect much from this movie. However, I was surprised to find that it was actually enjoyable.<br/><br/>I have a love-hate relationship with the divided factions idea. As cool as it was, it wasn't done very well. Everyone wore the same clothes, or was at least color-coded, which looked very goofy and unrealistic. Although it is the future, so who knows how people will dress then. However, the factions idea, although not particularly original, was cool and each faction was realistically divided nonetheless. <br/><br/>The acting was okay. Shailene Woodley (Tris) didn't do a particularly good job, but it was good enough. Theo James (Four) did better, but his character felt somewhat flat. I'm not sure if that was his acting or just the character himself. <br/><br/>The characters weren't super well-developed, but somehow I actually cared about the five main ones by the end. Some of the expendables that died didn't affect me, but major character deaths and challenges were somewhat sad, but not sad enough to strike up any tears or serious emotion. The relationship between Tris and Four felt very forced and it was awkward to watch them later on in the movie. It felt like it came out of nowhere, considering the age difference. Thankfully, these exchanges very rarely happened. <br/><br/>Divergent was enjoyable, and set itself up for a better trilogy than movies like the Hunger Games did, only this movie received more hate for some reason (Divergent is better than Hunger Games). With decent acting, good characters, an interesting story, and a good ending, I'm certainly going to see Insurgent. Having not read the book, I probably didn't notice certain flaws that others did, but as a movie I enjoyed it. Overall, Divergent is worth-watching, but its far from amazing. If your looking for something entertaining to watch, then look no further than Divergent."

","Divergent (2014): Dir: Neil Burger / Cast: Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Ashley Judd, Kate Winslet, Miles Teller: Basically a Hunger Games knock off about individuality. Apparently in the future society is divided into five factions consisting of selfless, peaceful, intelligent, truthful, and brave. This involves adolescent folks more or less separated from their families under some control crap depending upon which faction is sought upon. Shailene Woodley and her brother are set for this. He chooses intelligence while she chooses brave. They go through tests that involves taking a serum. Woodley learns that she is Divergent, which means she has characteristics of several or all of the above. This renders her a threat and therefore must conceal her test knowledge. In her faction she is put through several daring or brutal tests that she mostly fails but because she is Divergent her level of bravery excels past fear. While the premise is nothing to write home about, the structure is surprisingly detailed with a third act that opens for a sequel yet still promises hope against those using this training to form a brainwashed army. Woodley as Tris is the one strong complex casting as she perfects the underdog to beat the system. Theo James as trainee Four is more or less a one dimensional romantic fling. Miles Teller plays the moron bully recruit whom viewers are awaiting his backlash. Ashley Judd as Woodley's mother reminds us that she was once an A-lister, and Kate Winslet also fails to excel in a limited role as villainess. While it is hardly Hunger Games, it still presents an entertaining xerox. Score: 6 ½ / 10"

I wish Hollywood had some creativity left in it and could come up with the occasional movie that actually has a positive spin instead of a negative one.

Honestly, if I had just witnessed both of my parents dying, you better be damn sure the person who was responsible got theirs. Tris could have killed her and then in the second installment there was a new person who was set out to destroy divergents, fueled by revenge or something or just even sticking to the original reason of feeling threatened by them.

"filmfanperspective","4","0","0","5 May 2015"," Ironically, nothing 'divergent' about the film (**)
","If you find yourself lost in the apparent endless sea of similarly themed young adult novels & movies these days, please allow me to join you in your malaise. Sifting through the titles can easily become annoying, as it is chock-full of semi-colons and non-sensical word pairings (i.e. ""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones""- huh?). Imagine my relief when I first learned that ""Divergent"", based on the first in a trilogy of novels, only had one word to remember for each book. How refreshing! <br/><br/>Combined with the dual casting of young Shailene Woodley (brilliant in ""The Descendants"" but restricted here) and Kate Winslet (trying her best to keep a straight face), I allowed a modicum of hope to creep in my head for this project. Perhaps this would be the one young adult adaptation up to the task of legitimizing the genre, thus allowing discerning audiences to take it seriously. Try as it may, ""Divergent"" struggles mightily to make logical sense, drags on for an eternity, and leaves us scratching our heads in befuddlement. Ironically, this offers very little in the way of deviation, or divergence, if you will, from its' genre predecessors.<br/><br/>Please allow me to illustrate, for it is the crux of the film's failure. Strong, free-spirited heroine that can't be held back by the constricts of society? Check. Token description of a brutal, world-changing 'war' with no resonance or background? Check. Dystopian future with a factionalized society convinced to the point of law that human nature is the enemy? Check. Mysterious absence of babies or seniors? Check. Initially misunderstood, controversial hunk turned sensitive, wounded lover? Check. Hushed references to life beyond a 'wall' that is never explored, much to our bewilderment? Check. Young people required to perform adult actions without the film lending the gravity that those moments require? Check. <br/><br/>There are more, but I'll spare the reader additional sarcasm. What I mean to point out is the film's sincere lack of any fresh ideas or believability, despite its' protestations that the ideas it presents are clearly a big deal. How can we take the 'test' seriously when we aren't given the slightest dose of scientific reasoning behind it? Shoot, even if it's an awful ""Jurassic Park"" half-hearted version of an explanation, at least give us something. For that matter, how can the 'test' be so important in determining where one belongs, yet the individual still has the ability to choose their destiny? Is the plot telling us that free will is an illusion? Does the plot know what it's telling us? How can we buy that heroine Tris (Woodley) is able to wake from an unconscious stupor to catch up with a speeding train thirty minutes after Four (James) tells us she has ""no muscles""? <br/><br/>It would be preferable to take the film on its' own merits, and not allow silly things like logic, science, or cynicism to cloud my judgment. After all, it does appear that films like this are critic-proof; they simply need to satisfy fans of the source material, quality be damned. For fairness purposes, please consider that I gave the film a shot to impress. In fact, one particular scene struck my fancy, nudging me in the direction of satisfaction. On the eve of ""Choosing Day"", the Prior family (Tris, her twin brother Caleb (Elgort), and her parents) shares a few quiet, tender, tense moments as Ellie Goulding's entrancing ""Hanging On"" plays into the next scene. In this, I sensed the filmmakers deciding to elevate the source material and create a more human film. <br/><br/>Alas, 'tis but a fleeting moment, for the film nosedives into the typical immediately afterward. Tris goes against the grain and chooses ""Dauntless"", quite possibly the most awkward-sounding, goofy name for a faction ever created. We're treated to scene after scene after scene of training, training, training, with nothing particularly cool, noteworthy, or original to speak of. All the while, this Chicago- based society (where is the rest of the world???) is trying to eliminate 'divergent' minds. Conveniently (lazily), divergent Tris is tested by the one government-sanctioned tester that's sympathetic, or we wouldn't have a movie, I suppose. Think about this, though- murdering someone who doesn't conform is a cold, ruthless, interesting, albeit unoriginal science-fiction premise. This isn't the type of film that wants to understand or explore those big ideas, unfortunately. <br/><br/>In the time that has passed since viewing ""Divergent"", I've actually grown more weary and less accepting of the film. Maybe I'm just tired of the genre's attention. Perhaps I'm raw that the far superior weekend release (""Muppets Most Wanted"") will garner less box office and less audience affection. The likely truth is that I've grown more weary of 'products' marketed as films, especially in this particular genre. When there's nothing new to take from the experience, and I feel like I'm simply contributing to the greenlight of a sequel, it's an empty feeling. Whether it's Gryffindor, District 12, or 'Dauntless', it's all starting to run together for me. <br/><br/>""Divergent"", like others before it, and presumably more to follow, simply offers a structured way to package an entire entertainment experience in a consumable bundle, masquerading as a moving parable for our time. In the end, I feel less like having just seen a film, and more like I just got swindled by a used car salesman. It's confusing, illogical, lacking in chemistry, and just doesn't mean anything. Presumably, those familiar with the novels but somehow not bewildered by this film will inform me that I shall 'understand' by the end. Frankly, I can't imagine caring less what happens to these characters. Give me the story of those living outside the wall, or the likely interesting and complicated series of events that lead up to the film, and I might just be on board. This? There's nothing remotely 'divergent' about it."

"suite92","4","0","0","12 February 2015"," Teen's coming of age in a factionalized future dystopia.
","The film is set in the remains of Chicago in a post-apocalyptic dystopian city state. Society is segmented into five factions (dauntless, abnegation, erudite, candor, amity) plus the Factionless. Those in the factions are privileged, while the Factionless are impoverished. The abnegation faction controls government. The film, in short, involves the attempted mutiny of dauntless and erudite to replace abnegation as the rulers.<br/><br/>Young people in this society are faced with a choice in their late teens: to choose a faction. Each teen is given a test to help determine the faction, but the teen's choice is the determining factor, not the test.<br/><br/>Tris (well, Beatrice), daughter of Natalie and Eric, sister of Caleb, gets an inconclusive test. Tori, who administered the test, advises her to just leave and say the test was flawed. Tris does this. On the day of choosing, she chooses dauntless over her family's faction, abnegation.<br/><br/>The story follows Tris' acclimatisation into dauntless and her involvement with the unspoken motives of dauntless and erudite against abnegation. The other central theme is her flawed test. What really happened there?<br/><br/>This is the first installment of a trilogy, and some of the first moves of dauntless plus erudite against abnegation are detailed.<br/><br/>-----Scores------ <br/><br/>Cinematography: 8/10 Reasonable skill was shown.<br/><br/>Sound: 6/10 I could make out the words that the actors spoke. The background music was between insipid and irritating.<br/><br/>Acting: 3/10 I liked the performances of Ashley Judd, Kate Winslett, and Theo James. The rest of the cast was well worth forgetting.<br/><br/>Screenplay: 0/10 Boring, not involving, not believable.<br/><br/>-----Conclusions----- <br/><br/>This is another exercise set in a dystopia that is simply not possible...so who cares? There was nothing to balance that: nothing and no one to bring identification, or empathy, or involvement. This film is in the YA female demographic. One line summary: Teen's coming of age in a factionalized future dystopia. Two stars of five. Recommendation: fine if you are in the demographic."

","Being in a futuristic eutopic society is not all it's cracked up to be. Throughout film, there have been plenty of movies that take place in the future where Earth has become a robotic like eutopic society. People must follow certain guidelines to maintain stable tranquility. Of course, because the main inhabitance are human, one individual is bound to think differently from the rest, thus making them different and a possible ""threat"" to everyone else. It's one of those self-discovery stories where the main protagonist must figure out for himself or herself where they belong among everyone else. This is what happens to a young girl named Beatrice.<br/><br/>To know one's place in the world she lives in, citizens take a mental aptitude test which then they have the choice themselves to follow through on their test result or choose their own. Among these groups to choose, there's Factionless (poor), Abnegation (the givers), Candor (truthful), Amity (friendly), Dauntless (fearless), Erudite (the brains). Tris, as Beatrice will call herself later, chooses Dauntless not only because it fit her better than Abnegation of which she originated, but also because she discovered she was Divergent through the mental test. According to the world she lives in, Divergent individuals are being hunted due to how unpredictable they are. It is at this point Tris must learn how to keep herself under the radar.<br/><br/>This story is very character based. Audiences are introduced to a slew new people along the way and surprisingly it's easy to follow. Plus, the actors play their roles with the right amount of charm to feel a connection to each of them, including the not so nice ones. Shailene Woodley as Tris is likable and is able to show genuine emotion when the time came. Tris also meets one of the leaders named Four (Theo James) who looks like a cross between Billy Zane and James Franco. He also gives his character the correct amount of enthusiasm to be interested in understanding more. The rest of the Dauntless crew that Tris gets to know is played by Ben Lloyd-Hughes, Christian Madsen and Zoë Kravitz, all of which give enjoyable human performances. Possibly one of the most likable jerks in this story however was Jai Courtney as Eric. His duo deadpan and mean spirited attitude make him one to be reckoned with and probably Courtney's best role thus far.<br/><br/>We also cannot forget the supporting characters played by the underrated Ray Stevenson, Tony Goldwyn, Mekhi Phifer and Kate Winslet. All of which have very minor roles but important ones nonetheless. What is really apparent about this character driven story was Neil Burger's direction of which the kinds of choices he had this character's make and the writing provided by Evan Daugherty (Snow White and the Huntsman (2012) & Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014)) and Vanessa Taylor (Hope Springs (2012)). The development was one of its strongest points. The cinematography by Alwin H. Küchler (DP of R.I.P.D. (2013)) looked decent as well. He was able to show the contrast between what people normally see on the surface and the underground operations people don't know about. Even with a minimal amount of special effects they too were integrated well into the movie. No complaints there.<br/><br/>Though even with all these good points, the film still suffers from other issues. For one, there are loopholes in its story. If this particular society is so rigid and perfectly made so there are no problems, why is it that there are still problems? How is it that if one character can change factions, the upper authorities won't know? This movie's running time was very close to two and a half hours, I'm sure they could have fit a quick explanation in somewhere. Then there was the music composed by Junkie XL. It certainly was a tolerable score with its hybrid mix of electronic and orchestra but there wasn't much to remember it by nor were there any themes for the franchise or characters themselves. It was effective in its scenes but still disappointing. Lastly, the action was a bit bland. It's obvious that it wasn't a full out action movie but audiences might expect more than a few fight sequences, a ""captured the flag"" like scene and a some other shootings. Perhaps it'll escalate? We will see. It certainly isn't a waste of a movie but it did need improvement on all other aspects besides its characters.<br/><br/>This movie is like the reversal of other fantasy films. It has a big cast with competent actors and writing that develops its characters effectively. With this, its supporting elements don't seem as exciting with average music and somewhat uninspired action scenes."

","One of the biggest problems this movie has is its star, Shailene Woodley, is not leading lady material. There is nothing about her or her acting that stands out and takes command of the movie. All the actors were more on the boring side, mainly due to the fact the movie is at such a slow pace. More needed to happen for an adventure sci-fi movie. Another thing was the movie never explained why the Erudite thought they should control everyone and why the other 4 factions wouldn't gang up on them and stop them. Also what is going on outside the city walls. I wonder if any of the sequels go there? <br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: It's an OK teen movie, better than the Twlight films, but nothing great."

Pretty bad is not liking it ten minutes into the film but still watching until the ending reveals itself finally...<br/><br/>A lot better than many on themes in SF this like.

","Yes, the concept of this film appears dumb. In a post-apoplectic future, a walled-off Chicago is divided into five societies, called factions, that must live and work together. But one faction decides it wants to take over, forcing the lead character to become a rebel. If you interpret the 'factions' as tribes, and put them in an isolated area, the concept rings a little more true. And it is, after all, a science fiction story.<br/><br/>Sadly, after two hours of fairly entertaining plot development, the movie melts down in a desperate attempt to set up a sequel. Apparently they want to duplicate the success of the Hunger Games, but Hunger Games had a logical ending. In this film, the good guys capture the enemy command center, stop a massacre, and then inexplicably run away. They don't explain to their faction how they've been manipulated, they don't kill off the bad guy leader even though she has just murdered hundreds of innocent people, and they take no steps to prevent the massacre from happening again. It makes no possible sense, other than the writers/producers wanted 'two young lovers on the run' for the next movie. Gosh, we've never seen that plot before.<br/><br/>This film has good acting, good sets, and good costumes. It has an Ender's Game theme, which should appeal to teenage audiences, but be prepared for the cheesy conclusion."

","Overall, good flick. I think what I was most disappointed in was when Tris put the gun to her head and Four all of the sudden was ""cured"" from the toxin in him. Jeanine told Tris that Four's memory had been wiped clean but some how it all comes back to him when he faces one of his greatest fears? At first I thought the love story between Tris and Four was based off of nothing and no high ranking officer would give what he did for a cadet but in the end it all makes sense. One other side note was when Jeanine was stabbed in the hand but was able to keep using it, nothing major but it did bug me. I also wished they would have played out the conflict between Four and Eric a little more, they could have gone quite a few ways with this but they didn't. There was some obvious tension between the two but all we could tell as viewers was at one point Four had beat Eric in something.I would have also liked to see the conflict between Tris and Peter better resolved better, whether that would have been a more dramatic fight or something else. I think they did a good job with the moral battle that Tris fought when her friend was shooting at her after the Dauntless students had been injected."

","It was boring, I was yawing the whole time,too many details, although that's not necessarily bad, it took too long to get to the only interesting part of the movie, which were the last 30 to 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Haven't read the books but too me the romance was pretty obvious. They could have done better with it, but it is still a better love story than Twilight, although anything now days it's a better love story than Twilight.<br/><br/>The only reason I would watch it again is because Theo James and Jai Courtney are very pleasing to the eye or because you're stock in- house on a rainy day and there's nothing else on TV or whatever is on TV is not worth watching.<br/><br/>OK, This I'm writing a month or so, don't really remember, after seeing the movie a second, a third and a fourth time and after my first review which is above this <br/><br/>Going through it, is not that bad, sure the book, which I finally got, is way better then again don't know the first movie that's better than the book it came from.<br/><br/>There are a few scenes I like better in the movie than in the book, <br/><br/>the first one being, Eric, in the book he behaves almost normal, in the movie I like how his cockiness shows more, his evil side is more obvious and he's vicious.<br/><br/>The scene between four and Tris, when they first entered the cafeteria, his attitude of ""Are you kidding me......"", it makes more, I don't know, romantic or passionate, the way he passes being ""the Approachable bed of nails"" to ""I'm still working on kind"" and the kiss that follows, so powerful, like a passion he had to turn off.<br/><br/>The war games part, like it better in the movie. <br/><br/>Now what I like most of the book,<br/><br/>The attack on her, is way more aggressive, Al's death.<br/><br/>Her encounter with her brother and Jeannine <br/><br/>and of course how their relationship is, how caring he is, how he gives away little details that he might be in to her, being jealous at some point, flirtatious, and how she reacts to that.<br/><br/>Sure they can't completely follow the book, so there's a balance. <br/><br/>in conclusion, the movie is not that bad.<br/><br/>oh, and I maintain, Theo James and Jai Courtney are still hot."
"yepimrobbie","6","0","0","15 December 2014"," It was poor.
","My review may have a spoiler, although I have no intentions for that to occur, read at your own risk I suppose. I'm a big fan of sci-fi films and from the trailer and the hype, the film was set out to be something incredibly cool nonetheless, but in practice, it really didn't pan out upon watching it, my main concern was the emotional moments, they were rushed and happened to soon between one another we wasn't given enough time to connect with the main character, it was too sudden and it had no emotional effect. The concept was a good idea, but the acting was especially poor when they were pretending to be vacant, it didn't look good. Basic acting like the moment she woke up, the person she wakes up to immediately walks in as if he knows she will wake up, and she sits up- right immediately, who even does that, come on... I'm disappointed overall without a doubt I expected more but alike the existing ratings it isn't getting a good score from me."

","Well, as many people probably may have already said, ""Divergent"" utilizes some elements from other recent films. The biggest example of this is the world's division by factions based on virtues, which surely reminded me of the classic ""Harry Potter"" thing. However, the movie as a whole, has a different take on the subject; the main purpose of the story, in my opinion, is to show that if you are far better in doing some stuff than ordinary people, you WILL be hunted. About the romance created in this film, in the beginning it feels a little forced, but as we get to know the couple better, especially Four, the romance gets better and better. This couple faces a lot of problems, and fortunately, it doesn't look like a modern Romeo & Juliet syndrome-- FINALLY! On the other hand, ""Divergent"" isn't much better than average movies due to its regular cast, which doesn't look that convincing, with exception of Shailene Woodley, who brings life to her character. The ending, although a little tragic, brings a nice feeling of love and peace, and it's always good to see people getting together after a storm of problems. All in all, it's a good picture to be seen!"

","Divergent is a dystopian sci fi film about a futuristic world.If you have seen Hunger games then you may note many similarities between them.But it is not as sharp as The hunger games.Story was good but was wasted.It explores the theme of authority,genus and exploring ourself.It indirectly also hints us about a catastrophic future where everything has been destroyed due to war.Our own world is going on the very same way so we should now stop fighting against each other and should work for peace.Still you love fighting then fight against terrorism to bring peace all over the globe. Many friends suggested me this movie by saying that it is completely different.I would like to inform them that its not new as many movies had been made before on the very same idea.The start of the film was slow and boring.The middle of the film was also slow but it was average.In the climax the movie picked its speed but the climax was too convlucted and unimaginative.The ending was left open for its sequel.If you are going to make a trilogy then you have to make the 1st movie a solid one so that the audience may become interested in but the movie was average at its best.The movie deals with a good topic but doesn't explore it in a very nice way.First half of the movie was too prosaic.Visuals were good and acting was average.It was so pleasant to watch Kate Winslet in such a role.She was simply awesome.If you are a kid of 15 then you might like it and if you are a fan of Battle royale and Hunger games then you might leave it.If you could indure its first half then you may watch it.

","Warning spoiler Warning spoiler Warning spoiler.<br/><br/>End of spoiler warnings.<br/><br/>The positive. We humans are freaking morons who make decisions based on emotions. This movie is the same. It caught and kept my attention even when I was making sarcastic comments at the plot holes. It is a viable path that society could take and in some ways already does. I like the action, the zip line someone reviewing bitched about, fit perfectly as a way to celebrate, let loose and as per the faction ideation, take risks, accept a challenge and get a rush.<br/><br/>The negative. First one is minor but irked me, I'm female. According to studies men won't notice this so this is for any person that cares to care about details. A woman who cannot look into a mirror for more than a few seconds would not be able to apply the eyeliner, mascara and lipstick that the lead wears at the beginning. Also, neither would her mother. That suspended my suspended disbelief upfront. Was this the vanity and contract of the lead, or the stupidity of the director??? Second objection, women are not that stupid. You look at a screen and see hundreds or thousands of people you want to rescue about to die and go untie your boyfriend, really?? It doesn't fit the character who left her family to pursue what she needed. She has ethics and she's smart. That move was the writer catering to the chick flick crowd. Pitiful. Third, dude evolved and grew up. His abusive father wants a ride, kick him in the head. The third one is subjective, it could be he was being the better man. But I have an abusive family that just got away with legally killing our mother, so not too sympathetic to abusers right now. I'll work on being a better person when I get over wishing someone would right that particular and prevalent wrong. But it won't happen for the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>If they had left the lead looking plain, as her supposed starting position dictated and, if they had added a minute of her finding the bf BEFORE seeing all the people about to die, I'd have given this an 8 or maybe higher. The urgency was already there and the diversion stopped me cold.<br/><br/>Despite that, the movie is engaging. The settings were interesting and the acting was good. The action and dialog were balanced for the most part and so it should appeal to those who want to have their minds engaged as well as those looking for diversion. The ending sets this up for a few different potential sequels that I can think of. It's good enough that I'd watch them."

What if you unraveled a secret plan that was created to destroy people just like you? This is exactly what Tris must go throughout the film Divergent. In a world where people are divided into factions based on human virtues, Tris Prior is forewarned she is Divergent and will never fit into any one of these factions. When she discovers a conspiracy by a faction leader to destroy all Divergents, Tris must learn to trust a complicated character, Four, and together they must stop this faction leader from destroying the Divergents before it's too late.<br/><br/>Walking into my town's local movie theater to watch Divergent, I didn't know what to expect. Not having read the book, I was a little bit skeptical going in. Many people raved about the book, but watching the previews on television, I wasn't very impressed. I thought it was going to be one of those film adaptations that people generally weren't really satisfied with like Twilight. I was wrong. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the film. Maybe not having the book to compare it to helped with my enjoyment, but coming from my perspective, it was better than I expected it to be. The advancement of the film's plot may have started out a little slow and was a bit confusing for those of us who have not read the book, but by the end, I fortunately understood what was happening and where they were going from there.<br/><br/>I was impressed with how the actors and actresses developed their characters throughout the film. They showed us, the audience, who these characters were and were able to portray their personalities while the plot of the film developed further. Going along with that, the plot took a little bit to get going and capture my interest. The entire time while watching the film, I was wondering when the 'divergent' part was going to come in, and it didn't truly show itself until close to the end. Having the book and film called Divergent, I was hoping for a little more insight into what being divergent meant.<br/><br/>I've always been a big supporter of music in films and its importance and Divergent didn't let me down. I thought the music choices for this film were spot on. Each song supported the scene it was matched with perfectly. The music kept the general feel of the film moving forward despite the slow moving plot. It was a more modern type of film, so the use of ""new"" sounding music made the film more believable.<br/><br/>Overall, I was pretty satisfied with the film. Of course there are things that I disliked about it, but that goes for anything. I was certainly pleased with the final product created by the collaboration of director Neil Burger, author Veronica Roth and screenplay writer Evan Daugherty. I am looking forward to see what the next two movies have to offer."

","It's a commendable effort, but the overall product is a bit unsatisfying. It's like Hunger Games' training plus Inception's dream share plus Facing one's fears; add a little romance and mystery to it, you have 'Divergent'. Actors like Kate Winslet and Ashley Judd are not utilized at all. Despite being over two hours long, it didn't explore any character or faction properly. And it had one of the most predictable plots ever. The other futuristic movie released this year with the theme of maintaining peace, 'The Giver', was just ninety minutes long but had better performances and was a bit different than the usual.<br/><br/>Divergent is actually the first part in its book trilogy, but compared to other young-adult futuristic trilogies like 'The Hunger Games' and 'The Maze Runner', this didn't have much going for it, and even if the remaining two books get adapted, I'm not that interested to follow them."

","I was really excited when Divergent finally turned into a movie. I've read the books and just loved it. To me it's a little like The Hunger Games where you have that insecure girl, who doesn't know where she belongs. She always protects the ones she loves and turns out to be a heroine with the love of her life by her side. In my opinion that's not necessarily a bad thing. I think having a girl heroin is a change from all the typical heroes, which are mainly guys. But the movie was not as good as I thought it would be. For one it seemed a little rushed to me and wasn't as good as the book. The reason why is because very good and important parts were just simply left out. I know the movie is already long as it is but I'd rather watch a movie that's a little longer than a movie, which is missing a lot of details. The money was worth it but it could have been better."

Although the book is great, you get a full information about background, why Tris chose what she chose. There are important friendships and characters that were totally ignored by movie creators. I wonder how they will solve this problem in future parts, I suspect that some people will just show up out of a blue, no one will know how they were connected. The biggest mistake was to ignore character of Peter, he is a Draco Malfoy of this trilogy and he is important although a villain. Hunger Games already proved that you can stick to the book and make a good, reasonably long movie. With those creators all we get is a sequence of unconnected scenes. Such shame."

Of course there's a lot of folks out there who are casteless, didn't make the grade in any caste and now are something along the lines of the Hindu untouchable. But the rarest of all are those people whose intelligence quotient is so high they can test into any category. They are called Divergent and the established order fears them because they can move chameleon like into any faction.<br/><br/>Shailene Woodley is such a Divergent, but she's taught to mask it well. To the surprise of many she chooses Dauntless and goes into basic training for Dauntless far more rigorous for this Spartan group than the others. Woodley also discovers a plot to turn this warrior society into some kind of Fascistic tool and this is where the action truly starts.<br/><br/>An interesting idea if not entirely carried out successfully testing for whatever virtues one possesses for your role in society. The great unwashed out there who don't fit in are accounted for. What seems to be missing here is an account for those bad character flaws just where do they go. I suspect they are the villains of the piece but a society as advanced as should test out those people as well.<br/><br/>Woodley makes a nice and earnest lead supported by fellow Dauntless member Theo James a young man who sees what Dauntless is being subverted into.

","Plot development was a little slow to begin with and characters developed predictably. Some reviewers remarked it was a similar film to Hunger Games, as I have not seen that film I cannot comment on the plot line. Possibly it is because the central characters are young and attractive. Possibly some other reason.<br/><br/>However, if you suspend disbelief and run with the story it turns into a pretty entertaining one. Girl moves out from a loving home into the dangerous world, changes, finds love, overcomes her fears and faces the future with a new perspective.<br/><br/>Too many reviewers focus on things not explained in the film; why are the faction-less marginalised when the city is run by selfless rulers?, what is the specific threat outside the walls?, why couldn't the intelligence faction foresee that there might be a threat to the order emanating from themselves?, etc. This doesn't matter. Take the story on it's own merits and judge accordingly. Yes they could have gone in many directions with the plot but the central theme of one faction trying to overthrow the established order (intelligence abusing strength) was the one they ran with and in that they handled it well.<br/><br/>I'm sure it would appeal to teenage girls but that is no bad thing. I am a middle-aged man and I was entertained.<br/><br/>It is not even close to the best film I have ever seen but I have watched a whole lot worse. Better than average."

","As with many SciFi flicks this day and age, there are many things that the movie does right and other portions that pander to the mass demographic. That said, there is a certain alluring concept. <br/><br/>Sure, the plot is rather weak and predictable. The characters, other than the lead roles, are bland and uninteresting. The acting is decent at best, but I didn't expect Oscar roles in this movie. <br/><br/>What I liked though, and I believe like-minded people would agree, is the setting and concept of society that is shown in the movie. Without including any spoilers, the synopsis says that people are split into factions based on virtues, and that is the underlying concept that plays a big role in the movie. You are constantly reminded of the social structure, some faction more attractive than others, and how it finally merges with the plot.<br/><br/>There are many scenes in the movie that are really, very enjoyable. It's mostly because of special effects and whatnot, but it works. <br/><br/>Other noteworthy segments, I felt, was the strong lead female roles. It's clear to me that other than the main male lead, all other lead roles are strong female characters, which is a refreshing spin on things. Granted, there are many similarities with Hunger Games, too many in fact, but hey, I still enjoyed it, and I'm sure fans of Hunger Games will surely like this."

","Some girl in a dystopian future decides to buck the system when she discovers she's *vaguely* special and, in doing so, finds love while helping to bring down the corrupt regime of the time. Sound familiar? It is. Whoever wrote 'Divergent' obviously has read The Hunger Games and changed a few things here and there.<br/><br/>But is it any good? The answer to that question really does depend on whether you liked The Hunger Games or not. If you did, you'll love this. If you didn't, this one isn't for you. It basically follows all the same rules. Instead of kids fighting it out for food, ala Hunger Games, you have kids who are split into five (supposedly radically) different factions after they complete a test in their early adolescent years. This *slightly trippy* test determines which faction they're destined to be part of for the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>Of course if they don't agree with the test results they don't have to be part of that faction (I didn't get that bit). Then they all sit around in a big room and pick up a handful of rocks which tells them which faction they're going to be in (completely negating the test they took only days earlier). There are various factions which they could be in, all of which have names like the 'houses' in the Harry Potter films. However, about the only faction you'll remember is 'Dauntless' which is made up of some of the most annoying people you'll ever meet. They're supposed to be 'protecting' society, yet all they do is run around the streets making whooping and cheering noises while generally getting in everyone's way and practically knocking over old ladies. Our heroine (not Kaniss, but someone just like her) is conscripted into this band of nutters. However, she isn't destined to be a simple 'Dauntless' lass, she has traits from ALL the different factions, thus making her a 'Divergent'. And, apparently, being a Divergent means you need to be hunted down until you die.<br/><br/>But, help is on hand for our Katniss-clone, in the form of a blatantly older hunky guy who'll have a love/hate relationship with her until he eventually decides he loves her.<br/><br/>Yes, it has a budget, so the scenery is nicely futuristic and the actors play their parts well. They're either hunky and good. Hunky and evil, or hunky and annoying.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how well this film will be received by cynical older males such as myself. However, I really don't think I'm its target audience. It's aimed at kids and, I'm reliable informed, the kids loved it.<br/><br/>Does anyone else hear the words 'Hunger Games-sequel/franchise?' (Sorry, I meant DIVERGENT sequel/franchise!)"
"sarachann10","6","0","0","6 September 2014"," Completely disappointing for a huge fan of the book.
","First off, let me just say that I'm not sure if what I'm about to write are spoilers but I marked it as such just in case so read at your own risk. *Note: I'm 99% sure I didn't include spoilers, but still read at your own risk.*<br/><br/>Alright, so when I saw this movie poster I really wanted to see it because it looked like sci-fi and I thoroughly enjoy sci-fis. But then I found out it was a book first so, I wanted to read the book before watching the movie. I believe that the book is always better than the movie. Sometimes the book and the movie are equally great. Unfortunately, this movie was not good.<br/><br/>I never saw the trailer for this movie so, I decided to watch it before watching the movie just as a refresher. After watching the trailer, I could tell right away that the book would be 100x better. Usually trailers are already not as good as the actually movie, but somehow I could tell that the movie Divergent would not be as great as the book. <br/><br/>The actress from My Secret Life as an American Teenager (who plays the teen mom) totally catches you off guard if you were a huge fan of the show. If you've seen enough episodes you will know that the character (played by Shailene Woodley) is kind of whiny and pretty selfish. You're kind of stuck between being highly annoyed with her and feeling sorry for her and kind of liking her. So when I saw that she was playing Tris (in Divergent) it made me skeptical. But then I remembered the strong qualities of the teen mom character and thought maybe it won't be so bad.<br/><br/>Well it wasn't so bad, Shailene Woodley played a pretty convincing Tris in Divergent even her crying scenes. I think those were the best because she's such a good crier. What I didn't like was that they cut out a lot of important parts and they switched the story around; some things happened before or after they were supposed to happen. A lot of the character development and friendship developments were cut out, and those were two of the most important things. How are you supposed to know what happened or why it happened if you have no sense of who the characters are? I was pretty much convinced by the end of the movie that the reason there's no character development is because they did have a lot of things to include, and already it took 2+ hours to get them in; so, if they added more then the movie would be longer. <br/><br/>To be honest I wouldn't have minded a longer movie. It might as well have been longer because it felt so short. I don't know if it's because I read the book before so I knew every single detail that was missed and everything that was changed, but I felt lost. I felt really disappointed that there were little to none important scenes. People who never read the book are left with a lot of questions and many are left disliking it altogether. <br/><br/>I encourage you to read the book before watching the movie. Not just because it is so much better than the movie, but because you won't feel lost and you will know how the story goes.<br/><br/>The only reason I rated this movie so high is because even though they changed the ending, I still enjoyed how they changed it. Also, I really liked the setting of the Divergent headquarters, the train, the technology used and some of the faction uniforms."

","I watched the commercials for the film adaptation of Divergent and I decided that I might see it at some point.

I was very sad when I realized that Uriah was not in the film at all since he is one of my favorite characters from the entire series and he seemed likable to me. Also, I knew that several scenes that involved Edward from the book was missing. He wasn't in it at all. I remember the brutal scene from the book where Peter stabs Edward in the eye and Tris has to clean up the blood pool in the room later that evening. In addition, he shows up again in the second book as a factionless on the train to Amity due to failing the tests and leaving Dauntless. <br/><br/><ul><li>The pace</li></ul><br/><br/>I felt mixed about it. It was alright in some places, but rushed in other scenes. Some of the moments from the book were very brief in the film and glanced over quickly such as Al's suicide. That scene was very crucial for Tris in the book, but it wasn't strong enough in the film.<br/><br/>The things I did like:<br/><br/><ul><li>Shailene Woodley as Tris. </li></ul><br/><br/>She's a good actress and I pictured Tris to be like her in the novel.<br/><br/><ul><li>The set design</li></ul><br/><br/>Chicago looked cool, especially the Dauntless compound.

"ancoraa","5","0","0","22 August 2014"," Entertaining but Bland
","Though I read the book, it's been a while since then, so I can't say how well they followed it and reflected its tone. However, I do remember my reaction: that it was nothing special, which is how I'd describe this movie.<br/><br/>I was somewhat drawn into the story and was rooting for Tris the whole time; however, it wasn't because I liked her, it's simply because I wanted the protagonists to win. She's not the most grating heroine in today's media, there are better characters out there, but there are also much worse. I do remember that in the book, there are other divergents besides her and Four, so I had trouble seeing what was so special about them. <br/><br/>Something that really annoyed me was the contrived science behind things. How are people able to see into each other's minds? How could both Tris and Four enter the latter's fears together? Even the mind-controlling felt forced. Even if it's supposed to be science-fiction, it didn't feel plausible to me.<br/><br/>Something else that was off-putting to me was Theo James portraying Four. There wasn't really anything wrong with his acting, but he looked much too old for the role, and made his and Tris' romance feel a little creepy. A younger actor who looks closer to the character's age would have been much better. As for the romance, it didn't feel that real to me; I couldn't sense much chemistry between the two characters. It came across as forced, and I couldn't tell why Four was so attracted to Tris in the first place.<br/><br/>Another issue I had was with the whole setup with the factions. It felt contrived and unrealistic. Everyone is more than simply honest, brave, or selfless, you would think being divergent is at least a common occurrence. <br/><br/>Honestly, this isn't any different from the rest of the suddenly popular genre of YA dystopia stories. No new ground is tread and it's very predictable.<br/><br/>Overall, you could watch worse films, but you could definitely watch better. I felt an influence from the Hunger Games on the book, though I do not believe it's a ripoff (it manages to be unique and be its own story...kind of). This influence seemed to translate to the movie, as well, and I think they creators were trying to make them have a similar feel. It's a very contrived, predictable movie that at least manages to be entertaining for your first watch, but I don't see a reason to see it a second time."
"cici1159","6","0","0","22 August 2014"," Narrow screenplay leaves many confused.
","I had high expectations for this movie until I actually watched it. We are introduced to a world divided up into factions, each giving life and meaning to those who choose to be there. I had not read the book when I first saw the movie (my mistake) and found that I was completely lost through out the entire first 10 minutes of the film. The screenplay offers little to know back story and is extremely confusing to those who have never laid eyes upon Veronica Roth's series. I had to pause the movie and look up the basis of the plot before I could continue. Shailene, Theo, and Miles are all reputable actors however, once again (yes, I'm tired of saying it too) the screenplay was downright terrible and offered them little to nothing to work with. The director seemed to not grasp this and should've made changes while choosing which scenes to keep and which to cut, which was also another disappointment. We all know that you cannot condense EVERYTHING in a 300+ page novel into two hours, but they cut out some VERY pivotal scenes that could've provided a better opportunity for character development that seemed lacking. Theo being a fantastic actor seemed limited and a little two brooding or in the shadows than Four actually was in the novel. Even Miles! was outcast by some heavy-handed story telling. I am hopeful that Neil Burger will take this opportunity to up his future products, though I am glad Insurgent and Allegiant will have different directors."

","This movie is a good concept but it is as frustrating as somebody playing ""is"" on a triple word square in scrabble. what a waste! it is a movie made from a popular book. Like the hunger games, it is teenage angst where life is impossibly hard to be a teenager. Unlike the hunger games it isn't realistic. The basic premise of the story is stupid but the symbolism is still there. In the future everybody belongs to 1 of 5 specialized government groups to perform each activity of society. Normally children join the clan of their parents but at 18 they are free to choose any clan they want. Excellent symbolism of a large meeting hall and each kid called to the front and cuts their hand and drips blood into a pot signifying their choice. They are never allowed to change their choice thereafter. Great imagery to real life choices of college and career faced to young kids, but the movie just gets stupid after that. One clan wants to eliminate the other clan and brain washes all of the protectors into fighting their battle but the ""divergent"" people (not clearly dis-positioned to a specific clan as indicated by the ""test"") are not brain-washable. So she recognizes the plot and stops the take over. The significance of being ""divergent"" parallels nothing in real life and the clan vs clan battle is a weakly veiled liberal attack on the Military being nothing more than brain washed bullies being used as pawns by the politicians. So GREAT potential of struggles of growing up with major life choices but lost in poor story, bad author..try harder, it was right in front of you and you got lazy!!!!"

Following that, you have a Harry Potter sorting hat style scene and then the rest of the film follows the Twilight/Underworld/Hunger Games plot of a young couple against the system. Throw in some unresolved parenting/sibling issues, some Inception style CGI, Kate Winslet walking around like Jodie Foster in Elysium, and Maggie Q as, well, she's in the film, and it's easy to see who the target audience are; it's a teen flick. <br/><br/>Demonstrating the fact, casting Ben Lloyd-Hughes and Christian Madsen and dressing them in identical clothes, could have been a statement on the state of society and how people may look a like, but can act differently. Yet sadly the acting and camera work made it too hard to tell who had done what! <br/><br/>The film is based on a series of books, but compared to the first Hunger Games film, it doesn't seem fleshed out enough to continue the story on."

Tris was a very intriguing character, in the novels at least. In the movie I thought she was okay, her actress was mediocre at best. Ansgel Elsgort who played Caleb I found annoying at times. The age difference between Tris and Four (Tobias) was weird. 16 and 24 (movie) vs 16 and 18 (book). Overall it wasn't bad like most films the book was better.

","Divergent: differing from each other or from a standard.<br/><br/>That is the main theme of the movie. In this future dystopian Chicago, over 100 years after the great war destroyed most of the world, the city is partly in ruins and has a great protective fence/wall around it. Society is divided into 5 factions, according to the person's characteristic strengths. A few don't fall into any category and become factionless, essentially homeless. But ""divergent"" people occasionally are born, they don't have one strength but several and are looked upon with great suspicion and distrust.<br/><br/>Shailene Woodley is really good as Tris (short for Beatrice) who, along with her brother, are entering young adulthood and along with scores of others are being tested. But her tests are inconclusive, because she is a divergent. But she must not reveal that, otherwise there is a good chance she will be killed by the authorities.<br/><br/>Tris chooses the Dauntless faction, they are brave, nothing scares them, they shy away from no conflict and their job is to keep Chicago safe. Much of the movie deals with the rigorous training for several weeks, during which Tris exhibits some problem-solving skills that makes other suspicious of her.<br/><br/>Theo James is one of the instructors, called Four, for his four fears, and he and Tris become attracted to each other. Ashley Judd is good as her mother Natalie, who it seems also is a divergent, only revealed to her daughter near the end.<br/><br/>My wife and I watched it, she had read the book maybe 18 months earlier, we both enjoyed it. <br/><br/>June 2015 edit: We just watched it again after 10 months and enjoyed it even more this time, knowing the basic story.

They were able to avoid the effects of a serum because both of them are divergents. In the fighting both her mom and dad died, but she and Four survived and squashed the rebellion.

I really, really enjoyed the movie and decided to look up some more information when I got home. I found out there is a book trilogy of which this film is based off and as I love reading books I decided to start reading the trilogy.<br/><br/>When I started reading the book I found some big differences in the character development in the movie in comparison with the book. The Dauntless hide-out is also completely different in the book and a lot of details are changed throughout the movie, which makes the movie go from one thing to another in a second. That was also the moment I realized that not everything in the movie was displayed in the good smoothness the books describe it.

Even if you get pass over that, the development is the typical teenager put in the typical challenges (training, bullies, self-improvement, lover boy, parent problems...), in the typical oppressor society, which could be fine if better thought. On top of that, the music tries so blatantly to catch teenagers to buy the soundtrack that made me roll my eyes. Absolutely nothing new regarding story and script. If you're interested in seeing some action movie for the while, it's OK until the last 30/40 minutes, that gets so obvious and predictable that is hardly watchable. If that half hour wasn't that bad, I would have liked it a bit more, but it really feels rushed up, even if the movie lasts two hours twenty minutes, looks like a loot happens in the end, when not much in the beginning took too long to develop.

"pangefous52","6","0","0","11 August 2014"," Not at all expected
","First, I will agree with some of the previous reviews that claimed the movie offered no new premise that hasn't been explored in recent ""tween"" movies. I have a teenage daughter, and have been forced through such movies as Twilight, The Mortal Instruments, The Hunger Games, etc. I expected Divergent to be cut from the same cloth. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. In the beginning, I thought the main actor (played by Shailene Woodley) was going to be of the same laconic and expressionless school of acting as Kristen Stewart. Her initial naivety was a little hard to swallow, and I was almost sure her her entire personality throughout the movie would be lukewarm. By the end of the film, I felt as though she turned the performance around, and I genuinely felt myself pulling for her. One of the main differences between this movie and some of those I've listed, is the genuine lack of palpable danger. There was a darkness to this movie that didn't rely on the supernatural to hammer the point home. The dystopian future realized in this movie was much more believable than the one found in The Hunger Games (in my honest opinion). This is one of the better movies I've seen in this genre, and one I would not mind following to its completion. I'm looking forward to the sequels, and will definitely be going to theater to see this with my wife and daughter."

The acting of the lead characters is also as dire as the kids acting in Harry Potter, and Kate Winslett just goes through the motions to earn a pay check.<br/><br/>The film ends in an equivocal way with one of those annoying voice overs that is supposed to make you leave the cinema thinking you have just watched something deep and meaningful.

No respect.<br/><br/>Some people just like to complain about something and for some reason those are the people that most frequent these reviews. Read up on the premise for the movie, and if you like how it looks, then watch it, because that's exactly what you are gonna get. Nothing more, nothing less. And any questions leftover might be answered in the sequel. But some reviewers are to inpatient for that, evidently..."

","This is a watchable film if you are not expecting something deeper from an action movie. First of all designs of kind this post apocalyptic future is beautifully made. Plot has no surprises, pretty straight forward and you can easily predict what is going to happen next. Shailene Woodley is superb for the main character and Kate Winslett is great as ever. Acting of the rest is above average. For me this was an OK movie with a few wrongs. <br/><br/>Now I'd like to write about the things that didn't work for me: - Miles Teller's character seemed like that was added in the very last stages of the production. There is no depth to this person, as the film moves on he gets the very confusing, unnecessary. Feels like they'd decided to include this actor in no matter how, and probably they had decided to divide another character in two and open some space for this new invented character. Awkward. Also his acting has problems. Such as, every time he is on the screen it feels like he is reading lines from his previous films. Totally out of sense. - It was very nice to see Ashley Judd after so many years but this was a very small part also. - Jumping off the trains seems fun at the beginning but gets old pretty fast. - And also, why in earth jumping off a building where there is a hole in the ground should be scary for a girl who had just jumped off a train only couple of minutes ago? - And why would two take the same test secretly knowing all is recorded? What kind of secret is that?"

","I didn't read the books so I can't judge how close they stayed to the original material. However, as you usually recognize short comings in movies that work with an adopted screenplay - this is not one of them. The movie feels cohesive and the leaps it has to make to get everything into a 2 hour flick are well executed, with seamless transitions throughout the story. But the story feels extremely derivative and offers nothing new or thought provoking, which could be due to the shallow incorporation of the whole back-story. It's hard to imagine the circumstances that lead to such a society depicted in the movie and so the parallels to our own society or which path could lead to such a society are missing (not very well explained). Also the whole time, while watching, I kept running thru a list of other movies this one ""knocked off"". In the end, it's a Hunger Games meets Equilibrium with nuances of Ultraviolet and Aeon Flux - and considering the novel was published only 3 years ago, I reckon that the whole trilogy is not very original. The acting is pretty decent but the chemistry between the leads is lacking - James appears to be a good actor but should have never been cast alongside Woodley who is really good in that role - though, both put together is just awkward to watch and it's easier to find a better Four than Tris. <br/><br/>Bottom line, don't expect much and watch it purely to pass 2 hours of your time - then this one isn't a bad choice."

","The Bad: <br/><br/>The title of the movie reviewed 95% of the movie, really weren't any moment of suspense of intrigue. Movie plot flow along like accountant's ledger book. There were some good idea along the way but none ventured to any degree (ability to watch other's dream? outside the wall? That freaking awesome looking wall itself!?) . Movie doesn't setup a believable premise of why decision was made on fraction social structure, what's the benefit  etc. Would've been a different movie entirely if we are currently living in that kind of society, and looking back at ourselves, but this is too simple of concept to be entertaining. Movie introduced an element which it did not fully exploit, or exploit at all. What's outside the wall? Why they put the wall up in the first place. Kate Winslet character was negligible, it could've been a computer doing all of it and it wouldn't have made any difference!<br/><br/>The Good: Acting was good, I wasn't sure about how the Shailene Woodley and Theo James would do in their role, but surprisingly good. It's like putting to super models in a movie and hope they can get their line right, but turned out to be what could be career breakout performance. Especially from Woodley, very memorable. (Although to the end, if felt like her character did a 180 degree turn into heartless bitch, watching her father died like that) Production Value was good, production design, color, music, sounds work well and add to the movie instead of taking it away. Chicago setting wasn't the best, since I am from Indiana, and I know what's outside of that wall – Gary. <br/><br/>Summary I can't say I liked because the plot was just so bad that it's sad. Idea is soooooo generic and not well setup up at all. Without a believable premise, everything else was like a long Music Video. Acting was surprisingly good, Woodley is both beautiful and inspirational in most part of the movie, and James was plain but enough for this movie. <br/><br/>I think is 6 out of 10 is pretty good for what this movie is, if someone else played the part of Triss, I might've given it a 2 or 3."

But then it may be only the first chapter.<br/><br/>Very little is related about the other groups and how they exist.<br/><br/>Shailene Woodley is a good actress. But this flick wasn't demanding of her dramatic talents.

","I read and enjoyed the book- it made sense. I enjoyed the movie until the aptitude test when Tris endures only dog. How could Tori possibly conclude on just the one scenario that Tris would have aptitude for 3 factions- when in the book she has 3 scenarios and a clear explanation afterwards. I thought ""Oh boy,"" let out a big sigh and turned my brain off for the rest of the movie. If you don't explain to the viewer what is going on, how can they possibly be expected to enjoy it? Are they supposed to just accept your lack of explanation? No, they're going to sit there, lost, wondering what the hell is going on.<br/><br/>The following is a broken rant regarding multiple things that lacked explanations and therefore significance.<br/><br/>Edward, where are you- you're the #1 initiate and we don't ever see you except for like 5 seconds. We need you to make us care about the rank system, for more than just Tris, for everyone.<br/><br/>No setup to the whole zipline scene, or bare minimum an explanation of why it was significant? Why does Peter play a dim witted bully instead of the menacing sociopath? -If he actually stabbed Edward in the eye, I'd start to believe in the movie again.<br/><br/>Why is there no emphasis on the unbearably terrible lifestyle of being factionless- its never touched on, so to us viewers, why would being factionless be so bad? I cant be afraid of something you never explain! Care to elaborate on how only Four seemed to know that the Erudite were at Dauntless HQ ""every morning?"" AND NO OTHER DAUNTLESS EVER NOTICED? Okay, thats enough, I am sorry, but this movie just isn't any good. It wants to be interesting but doesn't explain anything to you, so you cant enjoy it. You watch and expect things to swoop in and surprise you, but they don't. You expect to see a plot twist, but you don't. You want to believe in the characters, but you're never given enough information on any of them, so you don't.<br/><br/>Lastly, Kate Winslet is dreadful in this movie- she is nowhere near not likable enough, cold enough, merciless enough. She is just sort of abrasive, in an emotionless sort of way, like your friend who just shrugs their shoulders when you ask them if we split the bill.

The music is very catchy. The soundtracks used in the movie are very well picked and put in the right moments of the movie. Definitely didn't waste my time from watching it.

","They lost out HUGE on this one. I haven't read any of the books, note do I intend to after watching this movie. Although most of the scenes are quite good, they failed to complete the movie and give it the proper depth. Smaller scenes should have been included, in which they explain the current situation in Chicago. How are the factions working together? How did they came to be? Why is every faction acting for itself? All this is basic information which could have proved very helpful to get a feeling of the actual development in politics and society. Obviously there is some sort of media. Who is in charge of the media? What role did it play in all this? How is it being used to influence people to tolerate this slaughter? Then there are these mind tests. What role do they play exactly? How does every faction member benefit from them after he/ she has already chosen his specific faction? Is their only use to detect divergents? Since when have divergents been a problem to all the factions? Obviously divergents have been executed for years, but the plan of the Erudite could not have spread through all the factions before Matthews, causing a general tolerance in most faction in killing off divegents. Could it? If so, wouldn't all the factions be corrupt and therefore know that something is up? Why else would all the factions have persecuted divergents? In the end, when all the Dauntless are confused about what happened, why didn't Tris and Four tell other Dauntless to follow them? Obviously the confused ones would want some answers. Tris and Four would have had an audience and could have explained what happened. They would have an army of awoken Dauntless who would want to make good or at least call the people who abused them to justice. This is how the first part could have ended, in order to build up for a second part in which the ""rebels"" would get control over the system and start to rebuild in a less dystopic way. After all, it is well made and well played film, but unfortunately it failed to give the audience the proper back story and to include a few details here and there, which would have completed the movie. Very unfortunate."

"estebangonzalez10","6","0","0","17 May 2014"," Formulaic despite it's message of not conforming
","""I don't want to be just one thing. I can't be. I want to be brave, and I want to be selfless, intelligent, and honest and kind. Well, I'm still working on kind.""<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying that I had no prior knowledge of Veronica Roth's novel which this film is based on so I can't make any claims on how faithful the adaptation is. Although I will say that 5 minutes into the film I kind of got a feeling that this futuristic dystopian story had some similarities to The Hunger Games which made me wonder if Divergent was not yet another one of Suzanne Collins' novel adaptations. The main reasons why this film was among my most anticipated films for 2014 were director Neil Burger, for his unique work in Limitless and The Illusionist, and Shailene Woodley who has been terrific in just about every film I've seen her in. So I was greatly disappointed when I discovered that Divergent, which had a heavy message aimed towards young adolescents about not being labeled or categorized and discovering who you really were by following your own path in life, was being a bit hypocritical in its approach considering it can easily be categorized as yet another generic and formulaic teen romantic adventure film full of clichés. This was far from Burger's previous films which I found unique, perhaps due to their indie approach. However having said all this, I still found Divergent entertaining enough to mildly recommend it thanks in most part to the Shailene Woodley's lead performance. I'm not Divergent's target audience, but I think adolescents and young teenagers will love this film and their expectation will be fulfilled. They are the only reason why the planned sequels will get to be made, but the truth of the matter is that this is a much lesser film than The Hunger Games and will easily be forgotten in time.<br/><br/>Vanessa Taylor and Evan Daugherty adapted the screenplay from Roth's novel setting the story in a futuristic dystopian Chicago where people live confined inside wired walls. They are also divided into five factions based on their virtues. Their is Abnegation who represent the selfless, Dauntless the brave, Erudite the intelligent, Candor the honest, and Amity the peaceful. The Abnegation faction are the ones in charge of governing the city considering they are selfless and always put others first. They are merciful people. Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) and her brother, Caleb (Ansel Elgort) have been raised by their parents, Andrew (Tony Goldwyn) and Natalie (Ashely Judd), in this faction, but when they turn 16 they are free to choose the faction they feel they belong with. Before they decide they must take a test which basically tells them what faction they really belong to, but they are free to decide on their own. Everyone always fits into one faction, but if you make a wrong choice you could end up factionless (homeless). When Tris takes the test she discovers she's one of the few people who is divergent (meaning she has basically all the virtues from every faction), but she must keep it to herself because these people don't fit in to this dystopian society where being different is viewed as something dangerous. When the day comes for Tris and Caleb to make their decision she ends up choosing Dauntless, who are basically in charge of the security and enforcing order in the city. Knowing that faction comes before family she must bid them farewell, and her training with Dauntless begins. At first she doesn't fit in due to the extreme physical and intense psychological tests that their instructors, Four (Theo James) and Eric (Jai Courtney), make them go through. If she doesn't pass the initiation program she will be sent with the factionless, but at the same time if they discover she is divergent, she could be killed so the adventure begins (and of course the romance as well).<br/><br/>I enjoyed the performance from the young actors in this film and I think Woodley had great chemistry with James. A lot of people had issues with his performance, but I thought he was very believable and pulled it off well. The cast elevate this film and make the film's extended running time worth the while. There are some beautiful scenes that work really well in Divergent, I loved the cinematography and the dream sequences were probably the highlight of the film. There was also a scene where Tris went down a canopy line through the destroyed buildings that looked pretty cool. The story is formulaic and has its flaws. It felt melodramatic towards the end and tries too hard to leave audiences hooked for the sequel. The first part of the film suffers for taking to long to set things up and introducing each character, but once we are with Tris in Dauntless as she goes through the initiation process the film picks up. The film also fails to engage the audience as to why the divergent are so dangerous to their society, but it all seems to rely on the message the film is trying to give to young teenagers. It is a metaphor playing on the fear of adolescents of finding their place in society and discovering who they really are. It wasn't the film I was hoping for, but I am feeling merciful today so I will give it a passing grade."

","The Plot: Divergent is a movie set up in the futuristic dystopian Chicago where the society is divided into five factions: Abnegation (selfless), Amity (peaceful), Candor (truthful), Erudite (intelligent) and Dauntless (brave), based on their personalities / virtues. Teens are put under the aptitude tests for this classification. Those, who don't fall into any of these categories or display the characteristics for more than one, are known as Divergents.<br/><br/>Beatrice 'Tris' Prior (Shailene Woodley) along with other 16-years olds is also put under serum-based aptitude test. She has grown up in Abnegation (selfless faction) though she is fascinated by Dauntless. But to her dismay, she learns that she is a divergent since she does not fit into any of the factions. Tori (Maggie Q who took Tris' test) asks her to keep the result as a secret and even manipulates her results. Tori tells Tris that since divergents can think independently and the government cannot control their thinking, they are considered threats to the social order.<br/><br/>The next day at the choosing ceremony, Beatrice's brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) chooses Erudite (intelligent), while Beatrice chooses Dauntless (brave) in spite of knowing her reality that she fell under the category of divergent. <br/><br/>The movie further projects the journey of Tris as part of the dauntless. Eric (Jai Courtney), a brutal young leader of dauntless put them through various tough tests viz. jumping from a train running at full speed, taking a leap from the top of a tall building into a big pit etc. Tris finds an ally in Four (Theo James - an instructor) who provides her a semi-bulwark against tough Eric.<br/><br/>What happens next ? Does Tris blend in with the Dauntless? Does she face challenges like a Dauntless? What was the intention behind training Dauntless? What Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet – Erudite Leader) is upto ? Does Tris pass the final simulation test for a dauntless ? Does her being divergent ever reveal ? Is the sorting of factions just a social practice or there is more to it ? Is there any factional conflicts? Watch the movie to seek answers to these questions.<br/><br/>Director and Screenplay:<br/><br/>Director Neil Burger's work is good, but somewhere as the movie progresses, it just becomes rote, pointless. Since I have not read the book Divergent by Veronica Roth, I can't comment upon how close this movie is to its source material. The screenplay by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor fails to convince us that why being a divergent is dangerous. Though Jeanine gives a speech, where she literally says that nonconformity is a threat to peace and that people who are different are bad. But what exactly in divergent makes them dangerous or threats to this world's system? Never explained with conviction.<br/><br/>I wish, the romantic bond between Tris and Four could have been given a bit more of screen time. It was too bland. <br/><br/>Cast and their Performance: The cast is good. Shailene Woodley has tried to carry the role of Tris on her shoulders pretty well. The complexities are portrayed well. Theo James as Four is composed. But Kate Winslet as Jeanine is wasted. Jai Courtney as Eric is good. Rest of the cast has justified the script.<br/><br/>Moments to watch out for: Tris' (Shailene Woodley) journey to blend with the Dauntless. <br/><br/>Thumbs up: Watch this movie if you enjoy the genre of fiction, adventure and action (though hard core action is missing).<br/><br/>Thumbs down: Not very engaging movie It will keep one wondering, why such a hue and cry for being a divergent.<br/><br/>One-Liner: Divergent it is not so 'divergent' !!!"

What I mean by that is the fact that things just happen for some simple reason, which has a bigger picture, but we never get to experience that! They don't explain things good enough! They explain the training well, too well!!! Because one and a half hour of the movie is training and romance. That is pretty much it! I didn't get the point of the movie at all! The movie had a description, and that is pretty much the point. Everything that happens is so slow, but the ending which we were waiting for is super fast. We should have gotten some political discussion or something to understand why everything is happening. We get some facts at the beginning, but no government development or anything to make you root for the good guys, and some simple things to make you dislike the enemy, but that is not enough man.<br/><br/>The story is very good I guess, but the movie doesn't get that much points for it.

","I voted Neutral, because their were surprising twists in the movie. One big issue I have with many movies today is the typical ending which screams sequel. The main character had the perfect opportunity to end this tyranny by killing the mass murderer in charge of this operation, but instead she let the mass murderer live... which screams sequel. In reality... reality... human nature will dictate ending her life. Movies like these tell some sort of truth in today's world. Politicians do control the military like pawns. Recently, I was surprised by my fellow ignorant Americans who strongly opposed fighting alongside with the al-CIA-das... only to get into the business of another countries business...

Also when Tris was almost thrown of the chasm by Al and Peter they didn't really acknowledge that peter was actually there, only the book readers would know.

"mm-39","7","4","12","28 March 2014"," Entertaining movie
","Divergent is an entertaining movie for the following reasons: Divergent is well directed and acted. The director and actors create a balanced mix of drama and mystery. The science fiction story about sectors in society and group order to create peace is watchable. Divergent's sets, back grounds and supporting actors create a good back ground environment. There is a teenage female lead telling the story. The Young female lead who is attracted to the kind but strong male. A potential romance? The film is geared for the Young Female Twilight or Hunger Games audiences. If you can stomach the genre Divergent is not a bad movie. Seven out of ten."

","Personally, I enjoyed every minute of Divergent, although I went to see it thinking it's just another boring and predictable story with some hero guy and/or girl who kills everything around. Turned out it wasn't like that. Many around me compared it to the Hunger Games and I suppose that in some ways it resembles it, but personally I think Divergent is so much better. I honestly don't care that much about small movie mistakes, such as the wound at her ear or stuff like that. It's not those details that give the quality of a movie. The acting does and I was very pleased with the acting. It suited the subject and the atmosphere the movie tried to create. So I'm looking forward for the sequels. My only hope is that the sequels won't be boring or exaggerated, like man sequels are. This is why sequels usually suck compared to the first movie. All-in-all, this movie has a 10 from me because it exceeded my expectations."

","First, I have watched almost all the movies of 2014 till now, and I want to say a word (only counting the ones before ""Divergent""): This is the best movie of the year till now, I haven't seen something like that movie before ! I saw some of the reviews, and I wasn't knowing that there's a book for the story !! but as they say, the movie is better, so I think I would like to see more of this, in new scenes and events, maybe new version. This movie is outstanding, I liked it and I've been interested from the beginning of the story to the end. It really deserves 10 stars, but maybe because I didn't read the book, I could not understand why Tris and Four had to run at the end with all others, after everything they done to save the city !!"
"evanlyn","8","3","8","6 April 2014"," Divergent (2014): Original, but not a true adaptation
","Divergent is about Tris Prior, a teenage girl portrayed by Shailene Woodley, who lives in a futuristic dystopia that has been divided into five groups. These so-called factions are based on five values, such as bravery and selflessness, and are supposed to maintain peace in the society. Teenagers have to decide in which faction they belong and Tris is struggling with this decision. This struggle is later explained as divergence and happens to be a threat to the peaceful system of five factions – and so they have to be removed. Fortunately, Tris chose the warrior-faction Dauntless and so she has learned a few tips and tricks to fight those who hunt divergents. During her initiating-process, Tris meets Four, a mysterious Dauntless-leader who also seems to know about divergence and helps her hiding it from those who want to eliminate them.<br/><br/>Shailene Woodley really captivates Tris's personality and she is inspirational. She portrays the lead character as a not-so typical heroine of the story. Woodley's Tris is relatable and she struggles with problems that teenagers today also struggle with. For example, they struggle with questions such as: Who am I? Where do I belong? What do other people think of me? In Divergent, Tris tries to find answers to these very realistic questions in a fictional world. This means that Divergent is both entertaining and it sets a example for teenagers who struggle with the same things as Tris.<br/><br/>Also, Theo James' Four is very surprising. He too, portrays the male lead as the not-so typical male lead. Four has a solid character and James is not afraid to show the guy's flaws and difficulties. I find this so refreshing in comparison to other teenage movies that have perfect and very much unrealistic male leads (Edward, you still there?).<br/><br/>Divergent is really consistent in its suspense. Although I have read the book and I knew what was going to happen, I still sat on the edge of my chair. For example, when Eric hangs Christina over the chasm because she gave up in a fight, the suspense was really killing me. What I also liked about Divergent, is the soundtrack and again, it is really different from other adaptations, because it is not cheesy and it is not based on semi-popular R&B-kind of songs. The soundtrack is well composed and really fits the atmosphere and the setting of the film.<br/><br/>Unlike many, many other young adult adaptations, the romance in Divergent is mature and realistic. It is not mature in the way that Tris and Four have a lot of sexual scenes (one kissing scene and a lot of lingering stares, actually) but their relationship is mature, because it is based on mutual respect and trust – like relationships should be.<br/><br/>Then, what did I not like about Divergent? Call me a nitpicker, but think that adaptations should stay as true as possible to the book and although Divergent succeeded in this more than expected, I was kind of annoyed by the way the Abnegation were portrayed. They are supposed to be selfless and vanity is absolutely not done, so can someone please explain to me why Tris and her mother wear that much make-up?!<br/><br/>I also think that Four's divergence should have been explained better, because it was not explained in the film, at all. I am a big fan of the book and I am pretty sure that Four was divergent, but after seeing the film, I am not sure anymore. Okay, Four does not respond to the simulation serums at the end of the film, like a divergent should, and he explains how Tris can hide her divergence, but Tris and Four never really talk about the fact that they are both divergent and this really got me confused. I can imagine that someone who has not read the book, could be very confused about this.<br/><br/>Divergent's biggest disappointment is Peter: he is pure evil in the book, but in the film, he just seems like this scary bully that pulls a big mouth when he thinks he is being ignored. I was so disappointed in Peter's storyline, because the film has this amazing actor, Miles Teller, who could have portrayed Peter so much better. For example, in the book, Peter stabs a fellow-initiate in the eye with a butter knife because he was ranked above him. This really shows how far Peter would go to defend his ranking and that Tris really has to watch her back. Unfortunately, this whole butter-knife-plot-line is not in the film and so Peter is nothing more then your neighbor- bully and that is such a shame, because Teller could made Peter so much more.<br/><br/>Divergent is original the ever-flourishing pool of young adult adaptations and sets itself apart, because of two incredibly strong leading actors, a relatable story and mature and realistic romance. It is, however, not a true adaptation, in my opinion. Little details make or break a story and in the case of Divergent, the filmmakers could have paid a bit more attention to the details and important plot-lines."

","Unfortunately this film fell well flat of any expectation I had, and hopefully at least moderately entertained the avid fans of the novel and series. The movie has been hyped, given a moderate budget, IMAX primed, and well-cast by some known names (Judd, Woodley) who have delivered some fine performances in the past. This however was not enough to save some lame writing, and uninspiring directing. I unfortunately have not read any of the novels, and this movie didn't exactly make me want to go diving into this world anytime soon. I can only expect that most readers of the books will not be pleasantly surprised with how this adaptation turned out. It didn't seem to possess the realism and grit that ""The Hunger Games"" possessed, and even a similar movie in the genre ""Ender's Game"" was crafted better in most ways. This is another film in which the length can't really be complained about, however, I was wanting to physically check out of the movie for the last 45 minutes, and probably mentally checked out before that. Most of the action/fight scenes, and scenes with guns seemed about as realistic as some episodes of ""Star Trek"" in the 70's..seriously! It was pretty bad. The plot believability, and character development also was pretty horrific. Woodley did an alright job I guess, considering she had to work with what she was given, but all in all, if you don't HAVE to watch this movie, I would personally recommend DIVERGING completely and watching something else. Here's hoping this mediocre crapfest of movies ends soon, and either ""Noah"" or ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"" are well done in the next few weeks."

","I really expected this to be another crappy book-to-movie film, as I'm used to at this point. After reading the Divergent series a couple times and obsessing until the movie out, of course I went the night of the premiere, a little leery because I didn't want to get my hopes up. There were, of course, not ALL of the major character developments in the film or perfect events to keep everything rated PG-13, however all of the most important parts of the book were in the movie. The acting was actually surprisingly good (I'm looking at terrible b-2-ms, Twilight, Hunger Games, Eragon etc etc) and the casting was perfect, save for scrawny Peter? But other than that, the amount of racial and gender diversity was refreshing, the costumes unique and somehow modern and futuristic, and the movie ended on slightly less of a cliffhanger than the book.<br/><br/>And you wanna know why?<br/><br/>Because the AUTHOR helped PRODUCE IT.<br/><br/>10/10, Recommending to everybody I know and looking forward to buying the film on Blu-Ray.<br/><br/>Oh, also, even if you haven't read the book (took a friend who hadn't) it was still bad ass.

","With the exception of using Shallene Woodley as Tris, it was very close to the book. I thought Tris should have been shorter, kind of like the actress Rooney Mara and with blonde hair. The special effects were fantastic, but I expected them to be. Kate Winslet was a wicked Jeanine. I was wondering where the movie was going to stop and was pleased with the stopping point. I would have enjoyed the movie even if I had not read the book.<br/><br/>The movie actually shows you more of the city that the story takes place in then the first book alluded to. I highly recommend this movie. It is a good one to see if you enjoyed The Hunger Games series. Plus having a woman displayed as strong, brave, bold, yet definitely has a tender side was well played by Woodley. I saw her in Descendants and she has a long career in the movies. Kudos to the producers, directors and all that participated in the making of the movie for this selection."

","I really enjoyed this one. I heard a lot of negative things about the novels and about the film itself. From what I had seen, it was one of those films that I didn't mind if I didn't get to see it right away. But my sister asked me to go see it so I did. Surprisingly I really liked this one. Coming from someone who didn't read the book and wasn't really wanting the see the movie, it's really not as bad as people say. I managed to sit through it for two hours and enjoy the whole thing. I also don't like how people bash things and fans of things just because they didn't like it and with people nowadays that's exactly what I've seen from reactions to this series. To the point where people were calling people that liked it ""stupid"", really let's grow up now. As for the film it's not a bad story, I actually enjoyed the plot and they seemed to explain the story well for a novel-to-film translation. They characters weren't nearly as poorly conceived as I thought they would be and the acting was actually good. The cinematography was great as well. The ending was OK, but it didn't feel as though it left any room for a sequel, at least I couldn't tell that there would be another just by the ending to the film itself. I'm actually hoping that this series gets the other two translated onto the big screen as well. I think I might be a fan of these now."

","Unlike the first Hunger Games this one managed to make me get emotionally involved . My major complain is that the other initiates are just invisible , no time was spent to develop those characters and their relationship with Tris. If the other books are made into movies this will be a problem because some of those people have important roles to play . <br/><br/>I sow other people complain that there is no sense of urgency and that may make the movie a bore . I think that this is caused by the fact that they wanted to get a good rating so there is a lot less death, violence and injury in the movie then in the book . In the book kids fall jumping from the train and a boy is mutilated to get him out of the competition.<br/><br/>I agree they could have done a better job showing the pressure the character has to endure but it wasn't boring.

","I have read both the Hunger Games and Divergent trilogy books and by far, the Divergent, Insurgent and Allegiant have a much more strong and in depth storyline! The Hunger Games books in my opinion are quite childish and unrealistic and ave no depth or history what so ever. But the Divergent trilogy is so well thought out and actually has a well thought out storyline to fit into three books. <br/><br/>I thought the acting was absolutely outstanding and Shailene Woodley was absolutely captiving! Never for a moment was I not on the edge of my seat with intensity and curiosity. There is never a dull moment (unlike in the hunger games) or an urealistic or unbelievable event like in the Hunger Games. Jennifer Lawrence doesn't understand her character and hardly shows any emotion and you never know what she is thinking. But Shailene Woodley acts with her eyes and you always know what she is thinking. But with the Hunger Games there is an uncertain plot line and you never know who you want to win but in Divergent you know exactly who you want to win (in general, with all the dilemmas that occur)"

","This is that one-shot deal I can handle – but if studio management decree that hawking a butt-load of sequels is the way to go, I am not spending any more money on Tris and Four. Besides, I am already hooked on Katniss. To use an old phrase, 'If you snooze, you lose.' And if there are future cinematographic plans for this couple, try something new and turn it into a TV show. I am sure, for kids, this story is fun and excitingand what child does not need another superhero? Of course, always ready to step-up, I want to help and make things better. So, what was missing in this battle of hopelessness against, 'The Man', 'The Collective', 'Lord Business'or whatever it was? Maybe a catchy tune? How about,'Everything is Awesome' – oops – already used in a similar flick. And that would also mean plastic Batman is out too? How about a unique plot? Really - why? This plot needs to be copied a thousand more times, just so we can say there is an even two-thousand similar movies wandering around. Oh and the main character is a girl - who is snatched away from her family - and thrown into an insurmountable situationand this time she doesn't even have her bow and arrow? How crappy is that? Oh booger – I did it again, I mixed Tris up with Katniss. And while I am on this soapboxdid 'Divergent Girl' have a cape on, I wasn't looking? You would have expected it since she's got them powerful, mysterious and fantastic abilities. You know what they are. Yes, they are called Divergence so you best remember that! Knowing that, she should have had a cape – and maybe a giant 'D' splashed across her chest (I know, I am going for realism herejust go with it.) OK – OK, I am being way too hard on this movie it was actually fun and pretty enjoyable. Once again – I did not read the book, so casting did a fantastic job, the storyline was accurate (I guess) and the acting was superb (maybe?). I sat through the entire movie without nodding off (I consider that an honest assessment of the entertainment value of a movie). Bottom linegood movie, and I was entertained."
"BrentHankins","7","6","23","20 March 2014"," An enjoyable franchise beginning that Woodley carries admirably.
","Big budget adaptations of popular young adult novels have become the latest trend in Hollywood, with each major studio hoping to create the next Twilight or Hunger Games phenomenon. While many of these quick cash-in attempts have resulted in embarrassingly low box office returns, Summit Entertainment's Divergent, based on the bestselling novel by Veronica Roth, could very well be the proverbial ""next big thing.""<br/><br/>In the future, society has been divided into five factions, each with a defining personality trait and a specific social role to fulfill. At the age of sixteen, each member submits to an aptitude test designed to guide them into choosing a permanent faction, but Tris (Shailene Woodley) is shocked to learn that she is ""divergent,"" showing equal aptitude for more than one faction. Not only is Divergence rare, but many consider it to be a dangerous condition that could threaten the delicate societal balance, and Divergents are routinely met with ""accidents"" that leave them in a body bag.<br/><br/>In order to distance herself from her family members and keep them from discovering her secret, Tris elects to join the Dauntless faction, an elite group of warriors tasked with defending the city. But Dauntless training is more than she bargained for, with a hostile fellow recruit (Miles Teller) garnering an obscene amount of pleasure from pummeling her in the combat ring while faction leader Eric (Jai Courtney) nods his approval. She finds comfort and solace in Four (Theo James), who seems to understand much more about her than she chooses to reveal, and who might be her only hope for salvation.<br/><br/>Divergent spends a hefty amount of time building its world and establishing its characters, and despite stilted dialogue that finds itself in dire need of a punch-up, the relationships still feel genuine and relatable. Woodley and James have palpable chemistry, while Teller and Courtney play their villainous roles with gleeful abandon. Kate Winslet also has an enjoyable turn as a sinister government official whose interactions with Woodley are chill-inducing - expect her to play a major role in the eventual sequel.<br/><br/>Divergent is at its best when the action finally gets rolling, which admittedly takes awhile due to the colossal amount of exposition required. Woodley never quite looks comfortable throwing punches and wielding weaponry, but her talent and charisma do a nice job of balancing the scales, and she carries the film admirably. By the time the credits roll, audiences should be entranced by Tris and eager to follow her along to the next step of her adventure.<br/><br/>-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com"

One faction the Erudite comes in and destroys the peaceful nation by catapulting a ruthless attempt to rid the world of Divergents and the overrule the government so they can get their way with the leadership of one woman – Jeanine Matthews (played beautifully by Kate Winslet.) I don't want to spoil the rest of the movie for the people who have not seen the movie but I will say this – this movie was lacking in some places where things were left unsaid, action was left out and things were changed up a bit.<br/><br/>This movie was an awesome way of letting dive into a young writers mind of how she sees the world, Veronica Roth who at the time was 23 when she wrote this book.

Clichéd young-adult movies? What do you call the Marvel movies then? I'm gonna review this for what I've seen. I'll be fair to judge this on its content, not on loyalty or formula.<br/><br/>In ""Divergent"", Tris grows up in a world where society is divided into five faction based on virtues. She discovers to be a Divergent, not fitting to only one faction. Her seemingly utopian world becomes a dystopian one. This film is very relatable to audiences ages 13-21. This is the stage where we wanna know where we belong and what we wanna do with our lives. The Faction System is a thought-provoking idea. What if you'll value faction over blood? Friends over family? I love the world-building invested on Abnegation (selfless), Dauntless (brave), and Erudite (smart). I love the action scenes. I'm impressed with Shailene Woodley and Theo James's athleticism to perform most of their stunts. I love how the plot runs.

I saw it at the cinemas and recently saw it again last night (after finally watching secret life of the American teenager and was surprised to see that the actress who pays Amy there is actually the same woman who plays Tris, so well done to her!)<br/><br/>The film/Book's idea of creating a sectioned off piece of America and dividing that piece into 5 sections is, I think, an awesome idea. Furthermore the idea that you and you alone decide which faction you belong to makes it even more awesome. (Personally I'd be a Candor, lol). <br/><br/>Shailene Woodley's portrayal of Tris is sublime, showing how a 16 year old can go from living a life of being self-less to a life of being absolutely fearless! Kate Winslet as the main Villain is also a good choice as she plays the role quite well.<br/><br/>Not to take away from the idea that you need to survive simulations in this world (again an awesome idea), in short I absolutely loved this film.<br/><br/>To the user that suggested this film shuns individuality I don't see how you get that as the film itself shows that Tris is doing everything to embrace her individuality by the end of the film and SPOILER** In the second film you actually find out how good it is that she is divergent.<br/><br/>Well done guys, awesome film.

"mah546","9","2","5","22 April 2014"," Divergent is awesome
","Divergent is a movie that's based off a book by Veronica Roth. It's about a world where everything is divided in 5 factions. Candor - the honest, Amity - the peaceful, Dauntless - the brave, Erudite - the smart, and Abnegation - the selfless. There is a girl, Tris (Beatrice) who finds out she's divergent. Divergent means they belong in more than one faction and are a threat to the faction system. She discovers a plan to destroy divergents and fights everyone with Four. <br/><br/>In Divergent, the main characters are Tris (Shailene Woodley), Four (Theo James), Eric (Jai Courtney), and Jeanine (Kate Winslet). This movie is an action movie, and it's a lot like Hunger Games and Catching Fire. Tris leaves her faction (Abnegation) and comes to Dauntless, trying to hide her divergence. She meets Four and with him, she finds out that Jeanine, the Erudite leader teamed up with the Dauntless leader (Eric) and they plot to destroy divergents. I really like this move because the plot is very interesting, it's a mix of harry potter and hunger games, and it has a lot of fighting which makes it very interesting. <br/><br/>I think divergent is a really good movie. Shailene Woodley acts exactly like the way Tris is supposed to be in the book. In most movies which are based off books, they cut out the main parts but with Divergent they kept the main parts."
"bell-benn","7","2","5","6 April 2014"," Agitprop or teen drama?
","Andrew O'Hehir writes in his Salon piece that ""The Hunger Games,"" and ""Divergent"" are propaganda. Then he says they are not propaganda in the usual sense of the word but rather propaganda in the service of ""individualism."" Individualism, according to O'Hehir, is the central idea behind consumer capitalism and is the bogey man we are all to fear. This is rubbish. I would suggest that going from a young woman's view of present day society as a glorified high school drama about not fitting as is the case with ""Divergent"" to political agitprop is a dangerous leap and a bit of a stretch. O'hehir goes on to say that we must accept the premise that all imagined worlds of the future must be about the present; a dubious conjecture at best. Where, he asks, are the fascist forces demanding conformity? Where is the segregation of society to be found? Where is the regimentation that we see depicted these movies? Is he serious? One just has to open one's eyes and look around to see plenty. Look at the paramilitary swat teams that have grown up in so many cities across America. Look at the spying on citizens that goes on by the NSA, Facebook, and Google. The pressure to conform has never been greater. Society is most certainly segmented into strata and classes. From the highest to the lowest, by race and by gender. And let's not forget about the struggles of the LBGT community. In the workplace, if you don't conform you are out. I would argue that the oppressive societies shown in the ""Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent"" are in fact allegorical to our present day times. They are cautionary tales as to what the future may hold. The central message presented by ""Divergent"" is to beware of labeling or ""pigeon holing"" people based on personality traits or some form of arbitrary and rigid caste system that offers no upward or lateral mobility.<br/><br/>The place where I would agree with O'Hehir is that ""Divergent,"" while entertaining, was unsophisticated and simplistic. But what do you expect? It was based on the first of a series of novels written by a young woman geared for a young adult audience. I was willing to suspend my disbelief for a well- intentioned, well made, good effort that had much to offer including a strong female lead that was empowering to her and presented a good role model for other girls to follow. This, I think, is a good trend. If you want to see real capitalist agitprop, check out Howard Roark's speech in The Fountain Head, a movie based on the Ayn Rand novel of the same name. In this speech you can catch a glimpse the ideology of the individual versus the collective that O'Hehir is so agitated about."
"kalybulosan","6","2","5","26 March 2014"," It was OK.
","I'm a fan of the series, and I must admit that I'm not that impress nor crazy over the outcome of the movie. I thought it was great how the movie tried to go by the book as much as possible, but I feel that it could've done WAY better. <br/><br/>The casting of the movie was a little disappointing. Based upon the trailer, I thought Shailene seemed to be a great suit for Tris but after seeing the movie, I just don't feel that she does a good job being a ""dauntless"". I just don't buy all the strength and toughness that she attempted to portray throughout her training. I also don't like the casting of the rest of her dauntless pals. I expected Miles Teller as Peter to be more despicable because in the book Peter was someone who I truly despised. <br/><br/>Other than that, I thought Ashley Judd and Kate Winslet were good for their part. I like seeing Kate Winslet as a villain for some reason. It's something different than what she normally does. Most importantly, I thought Theo James did a great job as Four. For me, his appearance and his acting was nearly close to how I envisioned Four while reading the books. Although Tris is the main character of the story, I feel that many of the audience will only stick around for Four as they continue on with the series.<br/><br/>Last but not least, although it is a small thing, I did not like the narration in the beginning of the movie. The way that they tried to explain the different factions was too boring and plain. Perhaps they could've done something else to not only explain this main part of the story but to lure in the audience as well. <br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 6 because it did follow the book. The action scenes were also quite enjoyable especially the ending."

","Divergent was out of this world. The movie was done perfectly. As someone who has read the books, the movie managed to capture all that was needed for the movie to be so extravagant but there was some minor things missing from the book but nothing that changed the story from the book to the movie. If you are a lover of action-packed movies then this is the one to see and what makes it better is knowing that Theo James did all they fighting scenes himself and no stunt double was needed. All I can say for this movie is that is was superb! Don't listen to the negative comments on here, this movie is a must see and perfect for lovers of The Hunger Games trilogy. It is probably the must see movie of 2014 and one of thee best movies of 2014."
"Amari-Sali","8","7","31","21 March 2014"," And so rises a new trilogy, but with this one we get a more fleshed out hero to root on.
","Trigger Warning(s): Violence against women & short scene showing attempted rape<br/><br/>Let me first state I did not read the books and what first drew me to this film was Zoe Kravitz being in it, but after seeing The Spectacular Now, having the reunited Shailene Woodley and Miles Teller in the film was quite the bonus. Add on Maggie Q, Mekhi Phifer, and Kate Winslet, you pretty much have one of the best casted YA book adaptations, which follow the a female lead.<br/><br/>Characters & Story<br/><br/>In an Oligarchy system, featuring limited social mobility, people are split between five factions, at least in the hub of Chicago. You are either a Erudite, the highly intelligent; Amity, the farmers; the Canter, the white collar justice system; the Dauntless, the soldiers and police; the Abnegation, the social workers and government; or you are the faction less. In their world there is no in-between. Faction over blood, so if you decide to change factions from your family, there is a likely chance you may never see them again, and with the system as it is, leaving your family is almost portrayed as dishonor and disloyalty. However, there are those who want to break this system.<br/><br/>Enter Beatrice (Shailene Woodley) who is our heroine. She is what is known as a Divergent, someone capable of fluidity between the characteristics of all the major factions, which is a problem for Ms. Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet). You see, Ms. Matthews, being the head of the Erudite clan, seemingly wants to seize power for just being part of the technological movement isn't enough. She believes the Erudite should run the government, so she decides to do two things: 1. Discredit the Abnegation faction by going after their leader and mounting support, and 2. Using the Dauntless, with their leader Max's (Mekhi Phifer) help, to commit genocide.<br/><br/>All this leads Tris, Beatrice's new name after joining the Dauntless, on a journey which has her be tested in physical confrontation, mental abilities, and being left with very few things to fight for, but for what is left she seems willing to give her life for.<br/><br/>Praise<br/><br/>Now, I don't mean to put down other YA adaption headed by women, but to me Tris was the first one which seemed human and real. Catniss seems so devoid and drained of emotion that it is like she is a robot whose AI hasn't been updated to emulate human emotions; and though I loved Beautiful Creatures, the heroine for that film seemed more so like she was made to fit some type of standard for the respectable woman. <br/><br/>With Divergent though, Tris to me was a human character. She was written with flaws, fears, strengths and just enough of an awkwardness so that she doesn't become something worth rolling your eyes at. And I think the credit must go to Woodley. Though The Secret Life of the American Teenager made me write off any talent she could have had, her film choices have really allowed her to blossom. She has the capability of playing someone who is vulnerable, and seemingly meek on the outside, yet can have this fierce passion which even if she gets her ass whooped, there is still a fire which makes you want to root for her. Also, I must note that for a movie a little over two hours, I never felt like I was bored. Woodley's co-stars, and the Divergent universe is so interesting to the point the missing details bother you enough to want to pick up the book. And perhaps that is the biggest praise you can ever give in this day and age.<br/><br/>Criticism<br/><br/>However, and mind you some of this criticism is due to not reading the book, I do wonder why despite all the technological advances, even with the apocalypse, there are no telephones? I ask this because each faction is somewhat secluded, and I could not understand how these people cut themselves off from their families? I mean, young adult rebellion from what you grew up in makes sense, but to seemingly do it forever? I don't get it.<br/><br/>But, perhaps my biggest issue is that it Divergent follows a lot of the usual standards for Young Adult adaptation to screen. And I won't spoil too much of it, but as you watch nothing really does feel like you can't guess the next move. I mean, as Tris goes through her trials you do wonder where her journey could go, but after a certain point you can see things are set in stone. However, perhaps my biggest issue is the fact they pair Tris with a love interest, and though said love interest doesn't have someone to compete with, at the same time I would love for a movie like this with a Hayao Miyazaki type way of showing friendship between the sexes, instead of always having it go toward a relationship being endgame.<br/><br/>Overall: Worth Seeing<br/><br/>To me, this is better than The Hunger Games and so much easier to get into. Woodley seems very in her element, and between the action, the friendships, and the threat of domination, it is very satisfying. And though I doubt I will read the books, I will likely spoil everything for myself by checking the Wikipedia entry. So, with that said, go see it!"
"sflombardo65","10","8","37","22 March 2014"," Loved It!
","It's been a rough year for YA film adaptations. Some have disappointed, others just flopped due to too narrow of an audience. Fortunately, for fans of the Divergent series, this doesn't disappoint and has the potential to be a blockbuster action film whether you've read the books or not.<br/><br/>There is much to say about this movie and tough to do so without going all fan-girl while doing so. I loved the book series and couldn't have been more pleased when I found out a movie adaptation was on the way. The casting was just about perfect, especially when you look at the two leads, Shaliene Woodley and Theo James. Their chemistry is off the charts, starting from their relationship as instructor/trainee and beyond. Woodley, who is everywhere these days, captures the character of Tris as I imagined her, taking her from the supposedly meek Abnegation daughter and growing into the strong leader of Dauntless. That she does so seamlessly is a testament to her acting. James, as Dauntless leader Four, takes the character beyond my expectations. He's sexy as hell in a quiet, sensitive, tortured way. Physically, he outshines everyone on screen, doing all of his own stunts and fighting which allows the character to jump off the screen. The rest of the casting was fine, Jai Courtney is intensely scary as Eric, Zoe Kravitz does a nice job as Christina. I love Miles Teller, and he does a decent job as Peter, Tris's nemesis, but he's the last person I'd expect in this role. Bottom line is that most of the secondary characters really take a backseat to the mains. At 2 1/2 hours, I'd say there just wasn't a way to tell the story and develop every character without compromising the movie.<br/><br/>The movie itself is exciting, hitting all the important parts of the book. It's a tough job to sell a story that has a huge amount of background detail (what are the factions, how did Chicago end up as it is, why the animosity between factions, etc.). And, it's a fine line to walk when half your audience knows all of this and the other half sees the screen as a clean slate. Personally, I think the screenwriters hit the mark almost perfectly and what isn't developed in Divergent will be better explained in Insurgent.<br/><br/>The action sequences are fantastic and believable, from the first jump off the train to the iconic zip line ride through Chicago. <br/><br/>Whether you've read the book or not, this is a movie for everyone. If you like a story of finding out who you are and where you belong, regardless of how difficult the path is, Divergent hits the mark, regardless of your age. I've no doubt I'll see this again!"

","Going to Divergent for some light diversion, I quickly realized: ""This no mere 'Hunger Games' copy cat! Let's face it, the premise of HG was ridiculous. The acting was wonderful and Jennifer Lawrence is a great actress. But the premise of Divergent is so much more probable (not just because I wrote a novel about 10 years ago with some similarities). Of course I had the same criticism. No one is just one aspect. But, for the age of adolescence, cliques are a painful reality; categories are everywhere: Nerd, Mean Girls, Grunge, Band Fags, Jocks, etc. <br/><br/>But the acting is wonderful. The pieces in the mix, although familiar, fall together seamlessly. The dramatic suspense is at times very evocative. The timing and the choreography are fine tuned. The tension between actors is palpable.<br/><br/>I entered a skeptic but left a convert. However, I remain skeptical about a sequel. This is best on its own."
"luciddreamer_1","10","4","15","30 March 2014"," Never a dull moment. Great casting!
","Just returned from seeing Divergent. I have seen this movie FOUR times now in a week. Love this movie! I am not in the age range of teen to twenties that they did the movie for. Sadly for me I'm well beyond those days, but LOVED the movie any way. Took some of my friends in their 30s and they loved it too. The theater has been so quiet during the movie. Everyone is so into the movie. This is the quietest I have heard a theater in years. I have not read the books yet but had an interest from the trailers and finding Theo James in the movie. The cast selection is wonderful. The cast all seem to have a chemistry together and were placed in the perfect roles for them to play. I very much enjoyed the story and am planning to read the first 2 books soon. This breaks my rule of reading the book before the movie but something Theo James said has my interest really peaked to read the second book too. Theo James blew me away in this movie. He has inspired me through his portrayal of Four to want to try to live life more and to attack my goal of losing weight again even though I had given up on myself. The movie is action packed! Never a dull moment. Keeps you on your toes wondering what will happen next. I find in most movies in the last 5 years or so that my mind wanders and I get bored during some point in the movie. This is not the case with Divergent. Two thumbs up and a YEEEHAW (I'm from Texas) from me. Can hardly wait for the second movie and for the Blu Ray so I can continue watching. If I had to compare to another movie of course Hunger Games comes to mind. I enjoyed those movies very much as well, but would choose Divergent over Hunger Games. It was just so tightly put together and ended in a fashion where it could be a stand alone movie and didn't leave you hanging like that's it!?! Thank you all and best wishes to the Cast and Crew!!! I read there was a lot of pressure to make this movie great. Mission accomplished!!! But, I imagine the pressure will be just as bad or worse to make sure the second movie is just as strong and solid. All my best to you!!! I have faith it will also be a grand slam! :)"
"falynsoul","7","4","15","22 March 2014"," Decent, for what its worth... ignore the haters.
","I think this franchise would be better served by being treated to a full budget HBO production 10-13 episode run. The world the books create is highly detailed, gritty, and chock full of emotional depth and events that are just not possible to represent well in a 2-3 hour film.<br/><br/>That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the film for what it did offer. The mental pictures I developed through reading the books were eerily similar to the ones in the movie. I tend to favor a movie's art style and atmosphere over acting/character development so I may be biased here. The post-apoc world was tastefully done, and didn't go overboard with blue glowing screens and lighting. The overall color tone is well balanced and natural, something that cannot be said for a lot of films that tend to feature over-saturated skies and light sources.<br/><br/>Acting seemed solid to me. I tend to miss certain cues from the book, so if a character was acting differently than in the book, I probably didn't notice. The movie won't shock you or make you cry, but it did make me feel exhilarated at certain points. It was nice to not have unnecessary sex scenes for once. I'm not against sex in film at all, don't get me wrong. I just think the romance was done tastefully done.<br/><br/>Overall, a solid release. (no pun intended)"
"hugorocksmy","7","4","15","21 March 2014"," Good Start for a Franchise
","Even though this movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It was a good start for the franchise. One of the best things about the movie was Shailene Woodley performance, she was excellent as Tris, and you could feel her every emotion in her face but mainly in her big beautiful eyes. And although it wasn't as very well showcased in the beginning, you could see it flowing out of her in the final third act. Moreover, the story felt kind of bland at times and as if it never reached its high point, which sincerely kind of came in the end multiple times, which led the ending to miss great opportunities to end ambiguously exciting. Therefore, it had an interesting premise, that can eventually become more interesting as the movies progress, but meanwhile this movie covered what probably any other franchise would've done in one. This never felt as good as Twilight or even The Hunger Games, and it might need to work more with its characters, because I found it hard to relate to any of them, but it isn't that far behind of any of the previous movies."
"pinkpopchick-976-478797","10","3","10","16 April 2014"," Brought back my interest in Action/Adventure films
","This film is absolutely incredible! I can't believe the effect it's had on me. Honestly, I can't remember the last time I came out of the cinema and actually discussed my excitement for the forthcoming sequels! Ordinarily, I loathe action type films because the story is so predictable and they all have the typical conventions the action genre is famous for: violence, lavish sets, a love interest etc.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. Divergent has all of those things, but thankfully they're included in such a tasteful and meaningful way, so that it really draws you into the plot and makes you believe that in fact you are almost there. The acting is also extremely believable and Kate Winslet, Theo James and Shailene Woodley do an excellent job at convincing you that this dystopian adventure could be a very real possibility in the future, especially as you can draw connections between each type of faction in the film to the supposedly non-existent ones that are present in our current society. Scary...<br/><br/>Furthermore, all of these great assets were boosted further by the cleverly configured graphics that again helped you envisage what Chicago could look like in a post - apocalyptic world. I also thought it was a good call not to use 3D because often the essence of the story is lost to fancy yet unnecessary CGI techniques, but that wasn't the case this time at all and it was a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>Truly, I would recommend this film to anyone because I think it has something for everyone be it drama, romance or action. Plus, the storyline leaves you on the edge of your seat and how many films achieve that?. It's a really good watch. Superb even! Can't wait for the sequel Insurgent!"
"jjli14","6","3","10","30 March 2014"," Better than the book!
","Let me explain. I watched this movie somewhat grudgingly. A YA novel adaptation set in a dystopian future with a highly structured society that the protagonist somehow does not fit into. She does her best to survive and meets a handsome guy in the process. Sounds like a plot that's been done and overdone in countless books targeted at teens. And it is. There are clichés throughout the movie but I still loved it.<br/><br/>I'm not saying you are going to be completely blown away by the originality of the plot. I'm just saying that this formula works, as proved by the book's success, and the movie executes it well with a stellar cast and beautiful effects.<br/><br/>Beatrice/Tris feels realistic and her reactions in the situations presented to her are believable. Four fills the role of mysterious male lead perfectly with aptly timed tidbits about his thoughts or past. For me, this was not well done in the book and I will be sticking to the movies only.<br/><br/>Overall, a good movie for anyone as long as you don't mind being able to guess some parts before they happen."
"agblum","8","6","27","21 March 2014"," Solid, Though not Great.
","Divergent is a solid film. For those who read the book like me, it generally remains faithful and captures the spirit of the book well. Shailene Woodley shows great acting chops in the lead role. It's not a perfect film. Sometimes you wanted to see a bit more of the political backdrop going on while the main character is going through her personal journey. Unlike the Hunger Games Films (Of which I love those books - haven't read the 2nd and 3rd Divergent Books yet) thus far, with similar themes - the Movie doesn't peek into scenes beyond the Protagonist's prospective to add depth. But overall the film keeps you interested. 3 1/4 out of 4 Stars."

Here is why:<br/><br/>It has an brilliant and breathtaking storyline packed with romance, violence and some pretty mind bending scenes.<br/><br/>It is centred around a girl who must chose a faction to live in as after a great war, a city is divided into factions (Kind of like The Hunger Games) and when their time comes they are tested to see what faction to join. She joins a faction of elite sort of peacekeepers but soon realises that it has now become a fight for survival.<br/><br/>It had some of the most tense scenes I have seen in a long time and at times I cheered for certain parts of the movie.<br/><br/>However; this is more of a teen movie, so adults may be a little disappointed with this movie.

Having not read the book, it was made perfectly so that I could still understand the storyline and what was going on. I intend on reading the book now.

"chase-mallia","10","8","42","22 March 2014"," Surprisingly Good
","The fandoms of the Hunger Games and Twilight can cover their ears a bit for this one. I am not a fan of either. Both films failed to lure me in to the realities of the story- lines. The acting in the Twilight Series seemed to never take the plot seriously. In many ways, that was a good thing. And as good as Jennifer Lawrence was, her performance was not enough to make up for the predictability of the plot. Battle Royale with a bow and arrow just hasn't done it for me, although I expect the revolutionary tones of MockingJay to be better.<br/><br/>With all of that said, I was not expecting to enjoy Divergent. Surprisingly, I not only liked the film, but thought it was excellent. My low expectations for the film were overcome by the absolutely superb performances of lead actress Shailene Woodley and actor Theo James. Their chemistry on the set is compelling. Woodley brings a vulnerability to her character that the Hunger Games sorely lacks. She seems confused. She seems scared. She seems to be befuddled by the predicament she finds herself in. This is an absolutely dynamic performance and together, the two of them carry the plot. I honestly forgot how silly the whole faction concept was because I was so engrossed in the performances delivered by the two of them.<br/><br/>TWO THUMBS UP. You do not have to be a 15 year old female to approach the performances here. Be dauntless. Go see it."

","The Review: Normally I avoid reviewing movies due to the fact I suck at it, and I tend to give away spoilers. For DIVERGENT I'm going to try and give a quick review on what I loved, and not going to go scene by scene like people would normally do. <br/><br/>There is only one word that describes the whole movie for me, and that is-EPIC! Best movie of 2014 so far. I want to go see it again, and again. You could tell the director and actors put a lot of effort into the movie, and it paid off wonderfully. <br/><br/>I thought since Summit Entertainment was doing the production then it would suck and regrettably stupid just like TWILIGHT but surprisingly they did an amazing job with the movie. There was a lot of action, a cheesy romantic scene, and a few kisses here and there but overall the action-pack made up for it. <br/><br/>Characters- The actors true to their word, stuck to the book characters as much as any person could, and as much as I wished it could have I really wanted Tris to be attacked just like in the books but it turned out a bit differently as I thought it would be.<br/><br/>Now everyone's question was it like the book? When a book turns into a movie, they can't stick chapter by chapter to the book, sorry, I know it's horrible but it's the truth, it stuck maybe 20% of the book, but you couldn't really tell that it was skimmed over, it was that good.<br/><br/>Music-The soundtrack is amazing, and I haven't stopped listening to it since I bought it. One of my favorite songs on the track is Ellie Goulding's song Beating Heart.<br/><br/>Overall DIVERGENT is a movie that is action packed, suspenseful, and a pinch of romance movie that is a 2014 Best movie so far this year.

","10 out of 10 stars because it was a great movie.<br/><br/>Why I love Divergent because its great and its a great story because it teaches you to be different is OK and you have people there for you and you are strong no matter what your size is and how to be kind,brave,honesty,smart,selfless.<br/><br/>I loved how the actors and actresses were perfect for their part. I loved how they kept the same parts from the book and didn't change their order. I loved how dramatic it was and how much action there was.<br/><br/>The only thing I didn't like was that they cut out some parts.<br/><br/>This is a great movie because of the action. the people who are in this movie are Tris (Shailene Woodley) Four/ Tobias (Theo James) Eric (Jai Courtney) Tori (Maggie Q) Jeanine (Kate Winslet) are the main people we are going to be talking about.People who would like this are people who like Twilight , The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and action movies with like a little romance to it.The good thing is about not having all the parts from the book is that they can make the plot better and spend more time and money on that rather than the other parts in the book. <br/><br/>The plot is that Tris and Four (Tobias) are Divergent so Eric injected a serum in both of them but it didn't work on them because they were Divergent they were trying to blend in they were going to war against Abnegation The Faction they were from and since it didn't work on them Eric tried to kill Four but he didn't know he was Divergent but Triss shot Eric in the ankle so then they figured out that they were Divergent and caught them and brought them to Jeanine. She want to kill all the Divergent but she made a serum and it only worked on Four and because she wanted to kill Tris but she didn't get killed because her mom saved her and she also saved Four.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is great you should watch it<br/><br/>I still think it is 10 out of 10."
"olakaminski","10","3","11","19 April 2014"," Fantastic Movie
","This movie is absolutely fantastic. Shailene is phenomenal as the lead role Tris. She embodied the character perfectly and made me tear up on several occasions. Although this movie is relatively long, it didn't seem like it. Each scene was important in the story and action packed. Kate Winslet was able to evoke a very intelligent character in the way she portrayed a person who, although we think is evil, really believes in what she's doing. The only negative critique I would have on this movie is that, having never read the books, the other characters were not developed as much and it was hard knowing who was who. This isn't a girl falls in love with boy kind of movie, it is strong and brave and never ceased in action."
"ametropoulos","10","3","11","19 April 2014"," Go See It!
","The dystopia genre seems to be taking the box office by storm. It started with Hunger Games, followed up with Ender's Game, and now Divergent is the newest addition. I myself am a fan of this trend. Something about a prospect future excites me, especially if the Hollywood portrayal is done well! I read Divergent and fell in love, it was only natural that I go and see it the night it came out. Shailene Woodley and Theo James do a wonderful job of capturing the characters they play. Although I would have picked some different people for some of the roles each part was played with excellence! <br/><br/>The movie follows a girl, Beatrice Prior played by Woodley, as she attends the of age activities in the city she lives. The first is a personality test, kind of, immediately something is off and the plot thickens. The term Divergent is very hush, hush and not welcomed in the society. At the next coming of age activity Beatrice, must choose the faction she'll belong to. Each of the five fractions values a different virtue. It's at the age of 16 that you must decide what you value most and move into that faction. Beatrice chooses the Dauntless as her new faction with the virtue bravery as the key to her new faction. Thus beginning an age of the new Beatrice hereby named Tris. Tris is entered into a whole new world of the competitive initiation included in her choice.= of Dauntless. In the end Tris being 'Divergent', hence the book/movie name, helps save her life and somewhat the life of others.<br/><br/>I would have liked to see some of the supporting actors differently as well as some of the styling done in the movie. I am very much a purest when it comes to my book turn movie. I'd like everything to be as I see it and there were some parts that just didn't fulfill for me. The casting director did well with the cast mixing well know actors, Maggie Q and Kate Winslet, with some lesser known actors, Ansel Elgort. The only problem acting wise that I had was with the casting of Ansel Elgort, in the movie Caleb, I thought he was a bit stiff in his character and could have embodied him a little better. The other problem I had with the movie was the slight artistic license they took with the movie. I thought that some small details needed to be kept in order to show the grit in the movie. Tori's hair and her personality, her back story, all become important later in the series and weren't addressed in this movie. I hope they will be in the future.<br/><br/>As an original fan of the book, this movie did not disappoint! I'm waiting for the day it's released on DVD so that I can watch it every day without the cost of the movie theater."

As soon as the film ended i wanted to watch it again and again So i decided to go out and buy all of the three of the books which were equally as amazing!<br/><br/>Shailene Woodley and Theo James have got great chemistry and we can see that they share this chemistry on and off screen, you can also tell that they are both talented actors and have had years of experience in the film industry. I cant wait to watch all of the Divergent trilogy because if they are as amazing as Divergent is i will be hooked, well i am hooked.

It did follow the book (the movie was a bit long.) and I think most of the parts were there and there are some changes but you'll barely notice it (It didn't bothered me that much). I think it's faithful on the book. (OMG. Theo James is so HOT!). It is definitely a MUST WATCH movie. I am having a movie hangover and fan- girling on FOUR. hahaha!<br/><br/>Best part of the movie: The zip-line. It's the most beautiful scene ever. I can't help being emotional, I fought back my tears. (Deep inside. gosh. IT FEELS) The background song made it more POWERFUL. ""I Need You Now"" by M83, listen to this song. Remembering Allegiant. :( <br/><br/>Veronica Roth has a cameo. It's up to you to find her (I found her in one scene). <br/><br/>A little flaw..<br/><br/>Peter. I find him more sarcastic in the book than in the movie but Miles Teller did a great job. :) <br/><br/>The casting however was still.... awkward. if you know what I mean. ;)<br/><br/>Kudos to the Divergent casts, the director and of course, Veronica Roth!

","Divergent... This is an amazing book, and also an amazing Movie! I absolutely loved it! Yes,they did in fact miss some parts from the book, but all in all I think that the director (Neil Burger) and the screenwriters (Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor)did an amazing job with the adaption of the book as a movie. They have also done an amazing job with the casting and I now cannot see anyone else but them (Shai Woodley, Theo James, Ansel Eglort, etc.) to be Tris and etc. And the best part about the movie is that it is exactly how I imagined it in my head when I read the books. I cannot wait for Insurgent, or Allegiant (god save us for Allegiant!) and I surely cannot wait to see Shai and Theo on screen again together."
"falkadhimi","10","2","6","14 March 2015"," ""Divergent"" is all about identity—about searching your soul and determining who you are and how you fit in as you emerge from adolescence to adulthood.
","Smart, tough and a little bit cool, this is an intriguing opening. The blend of action, romance and political plotting is handled with smooth efficiency, leaving us breathlessly awaiting the next chapter. Yes, kids should embrace individuality, and yes, they should think for themselves. It is simply an action-packed romantic fantasy with an earnest message that ... encourages trusting oneself over a corrupt system, and values nonconformity. It may be because I like Shailene Woodley but I enjoyed Divergent much more than The Hunger Games films, to which it is superior. I thought the acting, the direction, and structure of the screenplay were all solid. Yes, there is a pattern to it which is recognizable and arguably derivative, but I was not able to predict what was going to happen or to whom. And I was emotionally moved, which always scores big points for me."
"iamsecond16","8","2","6","5 April 2014"," only three complaints
","The movie is a great action movie. It stays fairly true to the book and the characters were almost exactly how i imagined them when i read the book.<br/><br/>My first complaint is that Edward isn't mentioned in the movie, but he is the reason we know that Peter will do whatever it takes to be first. In the book, when the stage one rankings are final, Edward is first and Peter is second, which prompts Peter to stab Edward in the eye with a butter knife and essentially make Edward factionless. That scene in the book is what tells us the most about Peter's character. I didn't quite understand Peter in the movie other than that he is arrogant and strong. There isn't anything that suggests his evil side.<br/><br/>My second complaint is that the movie did a poor job of showing Tris and Al's relationship. The movie just shows Al helping try to kill Tris and then killing himself when she wouldn't forgive him, but they never hint at why. It isn't a big deal, but i just thought it was important enough to mention.<br/><br/>My third complaint is the reason that Al tried to kill Tris. Peter briefly mentions Tris's rise in the ranks, but the rankings board being shown would have made that scene easier to understand.<br/><br/>Other than those three things(that are more of me being picky than any real flaw), i would recommend Divergent to anyone."
"Ansabo-827-195595","9","2","6","5 April 2014"," Nice Blend of Action and Thought-Provoking Flick
","Depending on your sensibility this review might contain a small scene spoiler and a plot-summary spoiler.<br/><br/>This is a top-notch flick you won't want to miss if you like action, a little romance, and something to talk over with your friends. Set in a post-apocalyptic Chicago, Tris (Shailene Woodley) and Four (Theo James)must find a way to survive in a dog-eat-dog world. Along the way the sparks of respect and affection begin to fly. The ruling regime of the time has decided to eliminate war and impose a social order by dividing people into five classes based on genetic and learned tendencies: dauntless, candor, erudite, amity and abnegation. As one comes of age, one takes a standardized test to learn where one belongs. You can follow the test results, or over-ride them with your own choice, but once you make your choice, you're stuck with living the rest of your life with the group you've chosen, even if that means leaving your family.<br/><br/>The familiar human mess drives the action with one ruling group trying to control all others, and there is the usual fear of rulers striving to eliminate people who think for themselves--so-called divergents--who use more than one approach to thinking and problem-solving. Some of the types get more explication, particularly the dauntless--thrill-seeking hyperactivity types--who have lots of courage and are groomed to be soldiers or police. Their first appearance gleefully jumping off a moving train and tumbling down an embankment is worth the price of admission alone. That scene cinematically captures in a few seconds the dauntless spirit in yourself and your friends who have a big dose of it.<br/><br/>Woodley and James are sympathetic characters you can't help but love, the action is top-notch, and you're left afterwards with the puzzle of asking yourself how do the five tendencies rank in me? Am I a dauntless first and then an erudite or amity? Candor or abnegation? That's what makes the movie especially fun--you can rank yourself, your spouse, your date and/or your friends and compare notes. You can play around with your own character analysis or with your friends' over a drink or pizza when it's over. Don't miss it and have fun talking it up after!"

There's no better way to put it, I simply enjoyed the movie, and it definitely did justice to the book.<br/><br/>I know a lot of people have unrealistic expectation when it comes to book adaptations, but this movie definitely hit the spot for me.

"fciocca","4","1","2","15 September 2019"," Just another action movie for teenager
","This review will contain many spoilers regarding the story.<br/><br/>Divergent is a movie with good premises, but since the beginning you already know that you are not going to watch an original movie. In fact for the whole duration I had a sense of Deja-vu: set in a dystopian future, after the ending of ""The War"" (?), the Chicago population is divided into 5 different factions. Everyone need to be fitted in one of these categories or you will end up as a homeless and factionless individual rejected by everyone. In order to decide which section you belong, you need to perform a test that tells which is the best faction for you, but during the ceremony day you get to decide which is the best option for you. Our main character is Tris, that during the test seems to belong to more factions. These people are called Divergents and cannot be controlled. They are considered really dangerous from the society and as soon as they detect one, they simply kill them.<br/><br/>So, another movie that tells that nobody belongs to a fitted category, that anyone should think with their own brain, and should have their own idea. Nothing original, but premises remains okay. The main issue of this movie is the lenght: almost 2 hours and a half. The first hour is focused on Tris, that after choosing the Dauntless faction, basically the group dedicated to protect the population, tries to integrate herself inside the faction in the best way possible, even if she is clearly not fitted, a thing that insted of being slow cooked, could have been resolved with a short montage, or, if the director felt the need to elaborate on, in a 20 minutes sequence, saving the viewer from the boredom. Finally the story begins and everything is so predictable, including the love story with his trainer, that is in the air since the first moment they met. The main villain is an erudite that want to genocide an entire faction that manage the city, so she, with her faction can finally take over the government. In my opinion she is not very credible as a villain and in the end was also pretty easy to defeat.<br/><br/>The acting is very flat, Shailene Woodley has the same expression for the whole movie, you cannot tell the diffference between happiness and sadness on her face and when she acts, she use always the same way of speaking. Theo James is the same. I wonder who did the casting and how they could pick so poor actors, especially if we are talking about the main ones.<br/><br/>I will try to watch the complete trilogy, before saying that the entire saga is completely unworth to be watched, but this movie is in fact very predictable: it uses a narrative scheme very well known and that you see a lot nowadays. It is a brainless Hollywood movie made for early teenagers (like 14/15 years old, maximum), if, of course, they manage to go through the entire movie.<br/><br/>I gave 4 stars out if 10 because CGI is on point and I really liked this distopian world. Also allucinations inducted by a special serum, are well studied."
"markbarner","6","1","2","10 April 2019"," Idiotic movie mistakes!
","I liked the movie when I first saw it and I have been too kind in my rating when seeing it the second time. Stuff like the needle I her neck that clearly is a fake and he wiggles it around making the scenes unrealistic and kind of stupid. The main characters when she is clearly lying it is show too obvious to us the viewer making it hilariously stupid. At one point she is attacked and almost thrown off an edge and is saved by our second character who beats them up and lets them get away without revealing who they are by removing the face masks. Soo lame and stupid. He is pretending to come to see if she is okay but he can clearly see that from far away. Just makes it teenage lame and not worthy in the movie. There are many nice scenes but all in all it's way too much a teenage movie from my perspective now 5 years later. The ""romantic"" scenes are laughable and feel awkward. After my critique I would like to say that there are scenes worth watching and the cencept of the story makes it interesting.<br/><br/>When they get captured for being divergent. They don't shoot the bad guys but just tries to run away from 2 guys who have guns!! Haha. I thought their characters where meant to be smart.
This happens right after they pass the test where one test is to shoot someone you love! And now they can't shoot 2 bad guys when they know that if they are found out they will be killed! Wtf!?! That is just bad writing and irrational.<br/><br/>When her mom saves her from being shot then she wastes the time by stopping and talking to her instead of acting fast as she was trained to do!<br/><br/>Later her dad takes her gun and just walks into the billets when he ignorantly following her and is later surprised he died. Makes no sense to put her through this when she just lost her mom and again we know her dad is not a great shot.<br/><br/>Later she fights Four - her love as they wiped his mind. The bad guys could just shoot her on the spot but they just wait it out like a weird no nonsens ""lets put the main character in an easy escape able situation""!<br/><br/>When they gets the system shot down the villain woman in the movie just gets knocked down instead of killing her!?! Why? They already killed others and now they have a chance to end the madness but instead they just let her go. I am so tired of stupid scenes like this. It reminds me of why others make spoofs of bad movies like this movie as it's just filled with irrational and idiotic behavior from the heroes of the entire movie - just unbelievable and stupid!! Pissed me off that a director has all the money to make a great movie. Even in edit and post production the movie could be cut differently to make it more believable but no..."

","Divergent is a bland experience and they do not do anything new with the story they are telling.<br/><br/>ORIGINALITY
This movie has a lack of originality.
Cause 80% of the movie is just Beatrice trying to not be under the line and we see her trying to succeed, that is her desire through out the movie.
They didn't use their time to try something new with the story to improve the experience.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS
They didn't try to develop the side characters they choose their time to only focus on Beatrice, It's fine to let the side characters have little screen time but the movie would have been better if they made the side characters have a good amount of screen time and they manage to develop the characters.
Beatrice is this bland character who has no personality whatsoever.
For me it felt like that sometimes she was a bit shy and when the plot needed her to not be shy then she wasn't, when it came to her it felt like her personality was unclear and lacking.
And during the end of the her growing as a character was almost non existent.
She began as a trash fighter and then turned into a decent fighter that's the only growth you will get from her and we never get to see how she develops and becomes a decent fighter cause when she trained hard she was still trash at fighting and then magically she could fight decently cause it was convenient for the plot.
Beatrice is there for plot convenience.
Four is bland as hell.
I'll give them some props for managing to make him grow as a character that's the only good thing about him and that growth felt rushed and poorly executed.
He has more personality than Beatrice and we could clearly see those personality traits.
Four might be bland but he is still better than Beatrice.<br/><br/>VILLAIN
The villain was bad she had a lack of screen time and if she had more screen time she would be a decent villain.
I understand her motive that they kill the Divergents cause they are scared of the unknown but i think it could have been developed more.<br/><br/>VERDICT
This movie is an unoriginal wasted potential that people should not watch."
"Naulinauli","1","1","2","19 September 2018"," The much less accomplished sibling of THG
","Having just finished all three books in the Divergent series I thought they were perhaps a little too detailed, too long. Not amongst the best books I've read. But having pressed play to see this movie I realise there were worse options.<br/><br/>I'm wondering most of all how true Roth really was to her original story when she agreed on changing so much of it for this.
It's as if she ripped her books apart and someone picked up pieces and glued them randomly together and said ""let's make a film!"".<br/><br/>It's as if a high school group of amateurs decided to reenact it and film it and somehow Hollywood bought it? Lacking everything from context, a fitting soundtrack, well done VFX, good actors (not even Winslet made me happy and definitely did not fit this role), the list goes on and on. But most important of all: so much has been cut off from the original that it lacks all kinds of depth that movies as well as books need to make it something great and make you FEEL it. Divergent the movie was nothing but a falling piece of crap that landed flat and never stood a chance with this rewritten script. This is the unwanted child of Twilight, as well as the less accomplished sibling of The Hunger Games. <br/><br/>I dare you to read at least the first book, and tell me I'm wrong in that this should've never been made. Why was it ever?"

Major complaint is the trying to get the teen audience. If they had ignored this and taken a let's just do a cool movie I think it would have been a lot better. No harm in having an underlying romance (matrix) but it's just to in your face and distracts from what could have been a much more gritty movie. Sunday afternoon with pizza and a hangover movie"
"jmartinvos","9","1","2","17 December 2017"," Truely stunning and immersive story
","I just made an imdb account because the bad reviews here broke my heart and I felt like adding a positive voice, although I really understand some of critics. Firstly I have to say that, even though I watched it on a laptop's screen, I was deeply immerged in this movie, forgetting everything around me, something which nowadays rarely happens to me. The movie started very strong and the hallucination scene was absurdly interesting and exciting. The concept of the five factions was executed well without feeling childish. Although the world felt a bit unrealistic theoretically, which didn't matter in this case because it served the story very well. You could really see that it is also a wink to our own reality. I really liked the design choices of fashion,architecture and weapons. But the whole story felt a bit rushed though and this movie would lent itself perfectly for a serie which would give it more time to unfold its beauty. (edit: I see it's a trilogy, perfect)
I think this movie is just perfect for anyone who loves psychologicy, mature sci-fi worlds and can just even relate a bit to one of the two main characters. In a world full of bland unoriginal fantasy movies filled with bad american jokes, this one really stands out for me as a special one. I just feel bad for the people that couldn't experience the empathy with the characters, as you have really missed something."

","The movie has entertainment value. It had a decent enough set of actors, and a storyline that though gives a hint of a gag reflex coming from time to tome - is okay, and goes down somewhat well. The audience (I am guessing) are teens, hence the obvious lack of plot complexity. Overall - the movie is okay. Nothing special but not too bad either.<br/><br/>However... here comes the fine print: Divergent, The Maze Runner, Hunger Games and probably a couple more franchise movies have all something in common - they have literally the same plot. I defecate you not - every one of them is about a teen or a group of teens living in quasi-post- apocalypse settings, in a society different from our own, where the same protagonists rebel against the established order in their own way and fight ""the evil old people in charge"" I DARE anyone to prove the opposite! And... of course since it's a teen movie... as already mentioned there is the ""youthful rebellion"", there is the cliché Hollywood character building that takes almost half the movie and.. oh, of course: the slight sexual tension between the characters.<br/><br/>I feel as if I have been robbed those hours watching these movies, and now I engage in even more waste of time by writing a review. Could just as well be doing reviews of toilet paper."
"CinematicInceptions","6","1","2","9 July 2017"," Average
","This does not, in my opinion, qualify as a true dystopian movie/book. At it's core, it's a teen novel that rides the coattails of the Hunger Games, though in fairness, it is original enough not to be called a copy. But the focus is much more on the teen novel aspects of it with the young characters and the romantic storyline with Tris and Four. The dystopian aspects that the movie is named for is pretty shallow. A major point of dystopian fiction is to examine how the actions we are taking right now could affect the future if they are unchecked. Nothing of that nature is present in the regime of government regulated stereotyping. There are no points made or debates raised concerning what it means to be Divergent. Additionally, the strictness of conformity that was expected from the people was not made clear, which I disliked, but I guess that shows how important it is to the story.<br/><br/>A major place where it lacked was its weak protagonist. Tris and Four are Divergents, and yet they have very little personality. Tris didn't feel like someone who is different. Honestly, she comes off as one of the most normal and colorless characters I've ever seen. She definitely has the least personality out of any of the other characters she interacts with. She has nothing driving her, and while that may be understandable for someone in her position, that's not the kind of person I'm going to root for. Now, part of that is probably because this was first a book, and that means that Tris' personality could be revealed to readers through her own thoughts instead of ""character moments"". I haven't read the book, but I've read Hunger Games, and I there were a couple of moments and shots that felt like they were trying to translate some of Tris' little interior monologues visually. It didn't help that Shaline Woodly gave a stiff performance that was comprised in large part of her gaping into the camera every few minutes. The other characters had some more personality and a couple had evident beliefs or motivations, but none of them were believable. <br/><br/>Now, I don't want to slam on the movie too hard, because it held my attention the whole time and was adequately entertaining, which counts for something. There were enough interesting and active scenes to keep me interested, and there was some good technical work done on it. The action was fine, but there was a problem with people handling injuries a little too well. Tris gets shot in the leg and then is walking on it just fine a few minutes later, and Jeanine seems largely unaffected by the knife that goes *through her hand*. Probably the most striking thing about the movie was the sound mixing. I don't know why that stood out to me, but there was a lot of intensity created by the blending of the score and the other sounds of the movie. <br/><br/>However insignificant that may be, it speaks to how unremarkable the rest of the movie was. There was nothing special about the characters, plot, or the world that was created. Yeah, it looked nice, but that doesn't really make up for the fact that it was essentially a pretty bland movie. It was like somebody made an amazingly well-cooked loaf of Wonder bread; as good as it is, it's still Wonder bread so there's only so good it can be. So I won't recommend this one way or the other. If you liked Hunger Games, yeah, you'll like this, but I think this is a couple steps down from that. But don't feel like you're missing out if you haven't seen it. Overall Rating: 7.2/10"

"dromasca","5","1","2","7 April 2017"," 'Divergent' is missing some divergence
","Based on a trilogy of books written by Veronica Roth, Divergent brought to screen by Neil Burger begins as many other similar dystopian films years after the civilization as we know was destroyed by war. One of the surviving pockets is the city of Chicago. In the retro-futuristic ruins that we know from many other films the local community survives by having itself divided into five strict casts, with well defined social roles - agricultural production, justice, social assistance, policing and defense. One has to chose once base on some kind of a hipno-test that detects his abilities and recommends the future path. There is no return. Outfits are thrown out of the system in kind of a homeless world. Those who do not fit into the patterns are feared, and eliminated when identified. They are the Divergents.<br/><br/>The film is the story of one of them - a teenage girl who chooses to train to become part of the more exciting military-policing cast - or maybe two if we add her trainer who has one secret in his pocket - as they fight the system, try to adapt, but do not find their way of integrating, so they revolt. The premises are almost as strict as the social rules of the world that is being described in the film, and it would have taken quite a lot of talent and character building in order to overcome a simplistic approach. Unfortunately this is not the case, and the film hesitates between a future vision which is not original enough and a teenage fighting adversity story which is not complex or interesting enough.<br/><br/>Director Neil Burger of The Illusionist fame quite disappoints here. I should say that he disappoints again, as after that 2006 movie he never got back to the level of story and characters building that he reached there. He never succeeds to exceed the clichés of the The Hunger Games genre. No, this is not supposed to be a compliment. Divergent is too much resembling many other films of its genre, the young Shailene Woodley and Theo James act well but they are no Jennifer Lawrence and the presence of Kate Winslet in a well built supporting role is not enough to save this film from a very average grade. Divergent is missing some more divergence."
"zkonedog","4","1","2","28 February 2017"," Doesn't Rise Above Contemporaries (From An Adult Perspective)
","Whenever most books or films are made for the young adult audience, there are certain ""benchmarks"" that need to be hit in order to appeal to the target audience (e.g. attractive actors, romance, angst, simple concepts). While those benchmarks make those works extraordinarily popular for that target audience, they also limit the book or film's appeal to a broader population. That is why, at least for me (28-year old male), ""Divergent"" was just an ""okay"" movie.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Divergent"" tells the story of Tris (Shailene Woodley), a teenage girl living in a future society where each person must choose from a prescribed list of professions upon a certain date. There is an aptitude test that helps determine which profession one should tend towards. The trouble with Tris, however, is that her test comes up ""divergent"", meaning that her brain doesn't focus on just one of the areas. This is something that must be hidden, as it is looked down upon and may make her a danger to government officials like Jeanine (Kate Winslet). Choosing a profession that is somewhat surprising, Tris makes the transition to a soldier-type life, where she meets Four (Theo James), a superior who is tough on her but also shows an interest in her well-being.<br/><br/>I liked the framework upon which the plot of this movie is built (I've never read the book, so I really can't make comparisons). Every high school student has taken a ""which career should I choose?"" test, so the concept is very relate-able. The whole ""what to do next in life"" is something we can all relate to, young adults probably more than anyone.<br/><br/>The problem, though, is that ""Divergent"" tries to cram a lot of things into a relatively small (2 hours, 15 minutes) package. There's drama, action, romance, political intrigue, big ideas...a little too much to focus on making one or two areas really, really good. For example (minor spoiler ahead), there is one character death in the movie that is supposed to be a very sad, emotive moment. However, because the relationships hadn't been developed well enough up until that point, it just kind of falls flat.<br/><br/>Contemporary films like ""Hunger Games"" and ""The Giver"" (both films that I enjoyed) do a better job of ""camouflaging"" the young adult aspects (though not omitting them, obviously) in order to appeal to a broader audience. ""Giver"" pulls not punches that it is a concept-driven film first and foremost, while ""Hunger Games"" (like the book series) doesn't get into the real angst-y, drama stuff until later on in the series. Thus, I felt like ""Divergent"" takes the action of the Hunger Games and the concepts of The Giver and combines them to produce...an inferior product of that melding.<br/><br/>""Divergent"" isn't a bad movie but any stretch of the imagination. It has a decent plot, the action always moves forward, and drama is present. It just won't captivate audiences beyond its target range of teenagers."
"fraserwilcox","4","1","2","6 April 2016"," Forgettable, Clichéd and Bland
","Oh God, where to begin?<br/><br/>This is yet another one of those dull teen films that literally exists only because money-grabbing film-makers realised the books were kind of popular with the teenagers at the time, and, as a result, only teenage book-fans would ever claim that they actually enjoyed this tedious waste of everyone's time.<br/><br/>You can tell that the premise for this ""story"" came before anything else did; credit where it's due, the idea that society in the future is split into multiple different factions designed for a specific purpose to help the whole community is quite a convincing and interesting idea for a movie's setting (if only it's not one that's been used fifty f*cking times already).<br/><br/>So our main character is Tris, played (though I hate to say it) rather badly by Shaylene Woodley and she's a ""Divergent"". Her (awkward and forced) love interest is Four, played (also rather badly) by Theo James and he's also a Divergent... I think. I wasn't really paying attention. And our main villain is Jeanine, played by Kate Winslet and she might be a Divergent, who knows. Who cares. I certainly don't.<br/><br/>To put it as concisely and bluntly as possible, this film is BLAND. You'll come away from it having not given a single f*ck about any one of the characters because they're so boring and two-dimensional. I can't tell if that's down to poor acting or a poor script, but it's almost definitely both.<br/><br/>I can't stress how little I felt for the (and I use this word loosely) characters, because they lacked so little actual ""character"". Even when (spoiler alert, everyone) Tris' mother died, just nothing. No emotion was felt. And that's not just because I'm a heartless bastard, it's because she, like practically everyone else in this blank canvas of a movie, had no major impact on or off camera and also her total screen time was about five minutes. But I guess it's really emotional because mothers dying is really, really sad(!) Then her dad died and I somehow managed to give even fewer f*cks than when her mum died; and I gave no f*cks for that. Even Tris didn't seem to care that much. Come on, Tris, how can I feel bad for you if you quite blatantly don't give a sh*t.<br/><br/>Seriously, the only person in this entire movie I felt anything for was Miles Teller's portrayal of Peter, but only because Peter was a complete d*ck who unnecessarily insulted everyone else and that made it fun to hate him. At least being a massive d*ck is some sort of character trait, something everyone else in this film just doesn't have. When your favourite character is the one you hated the most, what does that say for the film he/she's in?<br/><br/>I can't go into details about the main protagonists and antagonists and their respective personalities because, like I've probably said too many times already, they don't really have any. I wasn't even entirely sure what the main villain's motivation was because it was never properly explained. Oh well, I guess just being evil is motivation enough for these writers(!)<br/><br/>It's easy to see that the only reason this franchise is getting the success and attention it's receiving is the fact it's piggybacking on the success and attention of the Hunger Games franchise. I mean, for f*ck's sake, the similarities between the plot and premise of the two is ridiculous. The main difference is this movie is filled with a lot more contrivances, tropes and story clichés. Oh yeah, and it's so much more f*cking BORING.<br/><br/>So if you're thinking of watching this movie, I recommend you don't..."

"estreet-eva","4","1","2","2 February 2016"," A little worse than the source material would have suggested
","The book upon which the film is based would suggest the film version should have been been a little above average but yet Neil Burger turns in a little below average adaptation. The main culprit springs out of an uninspired cast nearly top to bottom. Lead Shailene Woodley deeps lacks the Jennifer Lawrence's big screen charisma and the viewer's eye frequently loses attention on what she's saying in favor of some interesting CGI work on post-apocalyptic Chicago. English thespian Theo James has the gravitas of someone in their early thirties which ramps up the ick factor when you dwell on the problematic plot point of a male teacher starting a romance with his 16 year old female charge. Most of the rest of the cast is indistinguishable although some of that is a side effect of the book which struggled to distinguish the male characters. Ashley Judd and Kate Winslet could have easily swapped parts between the criminally under-used mother character and the villain with the least evil name ever - Jeanine without any diminishment. The boring cast does play the plot close to the book although the necessarily condensing accelerates as the movie goes on until an ending that is just a quick greatest hits of the last dozen chapters of the book. In short, given a mediocre Hunger Games and Harry Potter band wagon jumper as the source material this wasn't going to be great but it could have been much better."

Couldn't wait for the end to come. (Which, of course, cues up the next episode nicely.) Why do films based on books insist on being so long? At least 45 minutes too long. I am unsure who the prop guy was, but I reckon he had a job lot of old Blakes 7 guns to get rid of. Hilarious. It was also a bit disturbing watching the love interest angle. As although nothing really happens, Shailene Woodley (Aged 24), looks 14, and Theo James (Aged 29), looks like he's in his early thirties. Very strange. I would not recommend this film to anyone except die-hard fans of the book."
"angelofmusic-18009","5","1","2","15 September 2015"," Extremely Disappointing
","I have to be honest. I was extremely disappointed with this movie. I have been a lifelong Potter fan, enjoyed Twilight (the books are way better than the movies) and loved The Hunger Games. I like Science Fiction even though many of these books were written for teens and I'm in my 20s. Regardless, I wanted to give the Divergent series a chance and my next read will be The Maze Runner.<br/><br/>First of all, the movie was SO not faithful to the book. If I had never read the book, I would have liked the movie more, but it was so horribly inaccurate. I found myself saying ""No,"" ""That never happens,"" ""WHAT?!"" ""What about...?"" to almost everything. I'm kind of shocked that the author approved this movie. Entire scenes and characters were left out. This book was shorter than most of the Harry Potter books and the directors of those movies seemed to fit everything in nicely, so I wouldn't use that as an excuse!<br/><br/>Second of all, the characters needed to be expressed more so. Peter isn't mean enough, Jeanine isn't evil enough, Four isn't edgy enough (and he looks a lot older than 18, but I digress), etc. I did appreciate Eric though. I think they did a great job with his character.<br/><br/>There wasn't much for back story either. I don't expect a movie to go into extraneous detail since that's what the books usually do, but there was practically no detail. I found myself explaining things to my boyfriend while we were watching that way he would know why things were happening.<br/><br/>I don't know what else to say. It just wasn't a good movie because it's like they hardly read the book themselves. If I were about to direct a movie based on a best-selling book, I sure would be studying the book cover to cover."

Therefore, I am never bored with plot and can continually watch this over and over again. The actors and actresses in the movie also do a really good job at displaying intense emotions and portraying how their character is really feeling.

","""Divergent"" is all about identity—about searching your soul and determining who you are and how you fit in as you emerge from adolescence to adulthood. So it's all too appropriate that the film version of the wildly popular young adult novel struggles a bit to assert itself as it seeks to appeal to the widest possible audience.<br/><br/>It's the conundrum so many of these types of books face as they become pop-culture juggernauts and film franchises: which elements to keep to please the fervent fans and which to toss in the name of maintaining a lean, speedy narrative? The ""Harry Potter"" and ""Hunger Games"" movies— which ""Divergent"" resembles in myriad ways—were mostly successful in finding that balance."

However, it is always difficult to get all of the details of a book into a movie, so maybe that is why some people were disappointed. I know the movie was set in the future, but you can certainly see how some of the factions are similar to today's world of the have's and the have-nots, as the middle class dwindles away.

"trixie-k-88","3","1","2","7 November 2014"," Why people don't respect the ""young adult"" genre
","Since we apparently needed to continue the theme of young adult dystopian adventure, they adapted the first book in the Divergent series to film. So, how does it measure up? <br/><br/>Divergent takes place in a bleak, strictly regimented future where everyone is born into certain ""factions"" based primarily on their personality traits. Those may include intelligence, selflessness, fearlessness, justness and kindness. At a coming of age ceremony the young members of this society are given a test that dictates what faction they belong in—however, they able to choose the one they want no matter their results. Our teen protagonist Tris (Shailene Woodley) was born into the selfless faction, and is shocked to learn that the results of her personality test are inconclusive—therefore she is ""divergent"", and cannot fit into society. However she chooses to join the fearless faction and with the help of some friends begins a covert overthrow of the government so this faction business can be done away with.<br/><br/>Before I get into anything I'll say I've not read the books, so I do not know how this compares to the source material, nor if they did anything ""wrong"" in the film. This movie felt forced. It felt like it just really, really wanted to be The Hunger Games. But unfortunately none of the characters, plot, or fictitious government were very good. I spent the entire movie thinking that the concept of their factions was so flimsy it was ridiculous. Mainly because the personality traits—kind, just, intelligent, selfless, and brave are NOT at all contradictory. I find it flat out impossible to believe that any person could possibly fit into just one faction. Not only that, but what the hell is the point of the test if you can choose your faction regardless of what the test says? It would at least make more sense if people must stay in the faction they're born into like a caste system, or just that one MUST go into the faction their test dictates. I didn't find any of the characters particularly likable, and the acting really fell flat. I was very aware I was watching a movie, and was never engaged or excited by anything that happened.<br/><br/>All in all this movie was a poorly acted and poorly executed mess that left me checking the time every few minutes. It's based on a storyline and characters that make no logical sense, and who try to be poignant but just come off sounding juvenile and foolish. Definitely not worth the time it takes to watch it."

","This exhilarating, Dystopian-based story line tests the limits of Tris, a teenager who is forced to make a life changing decision. The beginning scenes depict the society as a clear dystopia. The factions go about their monotonous duties and the color scheme is very muted and dull. It is the day of the aptitude test which selects the faction for which you would be the best fit. However, Tris is forced to decide on a whim as the test does not work on her. Leaving her brother and parents behind, she chooses Dauntless, the faction whose job is to protect the city's walls from the outside world. Here, she faces extreme physical and psychological stress during the competitive initiation into Dauntless. Tris learns her true strength and determination as she lifts herself up from the bottom of the score boards to prevent becoming factionless. As she prepares for the final test in order to become a member of Dauntless, her mentor, Four, realizes that she is divergent. Four confesses that he is divergent too and they join forces as Erudite manipulates the members of Dauntless into attacking the leading faction, Abnegation. The divergents risk their lives in order to save their society from a complete Erudite take over. <br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because of its action and suspense based plot. I especially liked the capture the flag scene and the zip line scene that followed. Both scenes used an extreme high-angle but from the character's point of view. The use of this point-of-view ties into the overall theme in the movie which involves self empowerment and determination. The view from the top of the ferris wheel and the zip line, both which overlooked the run down city, gives the view this feeling. I also thought the soundtrack was great and fit perfectly with each scene and the movie in general. Many of the sounds were instrumental, allowing the viewer to focus more on the actions taking place in the movie yet giving the scene a clear tone."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","1","2","3 September 2014"," ""Divergent"" finds a happy medium between great and awful YA adaptations
","In the world of young adult book adaptations with a fantasy/science fiction edge, ""Divergent"" is one of the few to actually fall in between really good and intolerable. It's no ""Hunger Games,"" but director Neil Burger (""Limitless"") and writers Evan Daugherty (""Snow White and the Huntsman"") and Vanessa Taylor (""Game of Thrones"") do a respectable job bringing the Veronica Roth novel to life with maturity and actual filmmaking talent.<br/><br/>Having read the book, it's kind of in the same boat. It's not as good as the first ""Hunger Games"" book but it has that same adult, ultra-violent tone with romantic subplots that don't overtake the plot but rank a clear second to it. The dystopian world of ""Divergent"" is far more complicated than ""Hunger Games,"" which widens in scope as the trilogy continues instead of turning the whole world it has built on its head in book one as ""Divergent"" does. Essentially, ""Divergent"" the movie is as good as the material allows it to be, meaning its faults run as deep as those of its source material.<br/><br/>That said, ""Divergent"" is an intriguing and engaging story, even if it feels unpolished at times. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) is a teen living in one of society's five factions in dystopian Chicago. She has reached the age when young people are tested to find out which faction (all of which are based on different virtues) they are best suited to, though in the end they are given a choice no matter what the results say. When Beatrice takes the test, her results are inconclusive. This means she's divergent; she doesn't belong in just one faction, and in a world where everyone is supposed to fit in a specific place, this is dangerous. She chooses to leave her selfless faction, Abnegation, for the bravery and free-spiritedness of Dauntless.<br/><br/>Woodley's talent and career trajectory suggests that Summit Entertainment was going for the next Jennifer Lawrence-type to play Tris and she's as good as it gets. With the book being told from the Tris' perspective, it's incumbent on her to communicate the many feelings that Roth so excellently expresses in the book and she does. The rest of the cast isn't too bad either, though only Theo James as Four, Tris' Dauntless mentor-turned-love interest, gets much of a platform. He's every bit of mysterious, dark and handsome as the part necessitates.<br/><br/>""Divergent"" sacrifices these side characters in the name of bringing all the memorable plot points of the story to life and explaining Roth's highly intricate dystopian world. There's nothing simple about the faction system for those who haven't read the books, so it eats up some screen time. And with so many scenes and moving pieces, there's little breathing room in the screenplay. The other initiates that Tris befriends (or tangles with) in Dauntless who keep the story grounded in a lot of ways don't develop in the film so that parts including Tris' experiences in the fear simulations, the capture the flag scene and more can all have space in the final cut. ""The Hunger Games"" took a similar philosophy, to let the main character be the real emotional focus of the film and to shut others out, but again, ""Divergent"" is more complicated, and the story doesn't have emotional turning points in the same way ""Hunger Games"" does.<br/><br/>Artistically, however, the adaptation does a nice job, even if it borrows on the ""Hunger Games"" aesthetic a little. Burger nails the test and fear simulation scenes, in which Tris experiences a lifelike simulation induced by a serum. He gives them the eerie, larger-than-life quality they require but in a natural way that outdoes the average film's creepy nightmare sequence. The adrenaline rush of Tris' dauntless adventures also comes through. Speaking as a Chicagoan, it would have been nice to see more of the city's actual aesthetic in the film, which is essential to this series, but there's more potential for that in the sequels.<br/><br/>So many young adult novel adaptations have been made, and maybe barely 10 percent manage to become ""Twilight"" or ""The Hunger Games."" It isn't and won't become those (even though it's better than ""Twilight""), but ""Divergent"" proves there is room for a successful middle ground in this genre, something it desperately needed.<br/><br/>~Steven C Thanks for reading!

","Utopias are by their nature, dysfunctional - so it is redundant to call this society who appear to be living outside of the city limits of a major city destroyed in some previous future war.<br/><br/>UTOPIA can be thought of as a classic Marxist/Socialist fallacy in which class warfare constantly takes place between the Haves' and the Have-Nots', the Workers versus the Owners, the Proletariat versus the Bougeiouse. In ""Divergent,"" society is allegedly divided up into five factions that are meant to represent the inner person. It is a choice that never happens in Utopia because there is always a group of Elites who make all of the decisions for everyone else.<br/><br/>As it turns out, about 45 minutes into the story, you get to find out who really is in charge, aka the ""goverment or ruling faction who want to have a world bereft of all ""human nature"" because they see it as the root of all evil.<br/><br/>Now that I said this, I wouldn't back it up with a bet because I had to come back here to learn how others viewed the movie before I, as a fairly savvy film critic, would venture my own critique.<br/><br/>From my perspective, what is most ""Divergent"" are all the plot contrivances. The actress who played Nikita on CW17's popular series was inserted into the drama, but if there was a reason for her insertion beyond just someone else telling Tris to watch her step, I didn't see it. What a waste of acting talent! It would have made much more sense if the people were born into the different factions paralleling the kinds of caste system,s that still exist in our world. Choosing a faction looked more like a reality TV game show than a life-changing experience.<br/><br/>Divergent, so the story goes, don't ""fit"" into any one faction because they still have personal choice to make and change their decisions thousands of times. Unlike the Dauntless faction, the Peace-Keepers, aka the police, they are eventually set up to become automatons controlled by the Erudite - that faction supposedly smarter than everyone else. In other words, our present day, liberal elites.<br/><br/>There is a grand plan that became hatched out of nothing and on the spur of the moment for all the members of the Abnegation faction to be executed. The reasons why were never made clear - especially from all the movie trailers, it seemed that only the Divergents, the ""misfits,"" were the enemy of the State and had to be eliminated.<br/><br/>This movie diverged into far too many directions without any divulging of what was happening and why.<br/><br/>Shoved into the training time set aside for the Dauntless, we come to learn that both Tris and her ""boot camp"" instructor are Divergents, and you can imagine what the last scene of this movie will contain if you know that both survive an insurrection apparently let by a small group of Divergents - and not the Sheep known as the Abdegnation faction.<br/><br/>It seems that Tris's mother and father were members of Dauntless at one time (well maybe just her mother) and had switched factions to the Abnegations. Or, they were Divergents hiding out there.<br/><br/>Like I said, this movie was a total washout in terms of plot, of character development, of story idea, of plot lines, and a very predictable ending. The dialog was forced as was the acting. Shailene Woodley would have made a great actress back when they had no sound tracks. Tris' constantly changing expressions that often had no correlation to her actions were the most annoying feature of her performance,.<br/><br/>The ONLY bright spot was the acting of ""Four"" - Tris' trainer and love interest, actor Theo James.<br/><br/>Four stars - and that's a generous rating, too."
"TheFilmGuy1","6","1","2","14 August 2014"," Has Potential To Be Something
","I went into this open minded, and while I do think this movie establishes an interesting concept and has interesting plot points, it kind of disappointed me. I will say that it's not complete crap like some of the Hollywood films based on teen books are, so perhaps thats why I kind of want to go easy on it. It's good to see some effort being put into a film. Comparing this to say, The Hunger Games, perhaps is why I was left a little underwhelmed, because I think the first Hunger Games was not bad, and then Catching Fire ended up really impressing me. I kind of hope that since this film is the first in a series, the next will take what was interesting in this and bring it to the fore front. It certainly has potential to be a good series, but it's off to a slightly rocky start.<br/><br/>One of the stronger aspects of this film is Shailene Woodleys performance. She is a really strong actor and the film benefits from putting someone with skill in the lead role as opposed to the usual ""pretty but terrible actress"" kind of girls they usually put in these kind of roles. The rest of the performances we're okay. No real stand outs but they work for the most part. <br/><br/>The plot is another strength that works. It's about a society where young adults are sorted into different factions based on skills and it's a very stressful process. But what's great is that it is clearly a metaphor for the modern day process of pressuring young adults into university and making them make these big choices that affect the rest of their lives. I have always found issue in the way society does this ever since I started high school, and I think it's interesting to see that concept in this film. It kind of works, and I will give it credit for handling a subject that can be quite relate-able for many young people today.<br/><br/>Overall, the films strengths come from it's concepts and it's potential to improve in future sequels. As a person who likes film in general, I will always be positive about movies and I do hope they can smooth out the next film and make it something great. I would be really happy to see the sequel be something great, similar to how Catching Fire improved on The Hunger Games dramatically."
"zeigkel88","6","1","2","11 August 2014"," Rather Enjoyable
","I enjoyed this movie, through the trash I've seen from the horrible Twilight and Hunger Games movies, I was surprised.<br/><br/>One thing I love about movies is when they makes the ""threat"" feel real. These bad guys that essential want to kill of a whole The Nice Faction (There are five factions: http://divergent.wikia.com/wiki/Factions )... FOR BEING TO KIND, is a pretty big douchbag move. Oddly enough, it's the Intelligent faction who, together with the leadership of the Military Faction, who wants to do this. I wish I would have read the book before I watched the movie, feels like I am missing some crucial backstory here. Like why would the intellectual ones go ""Let's Fascist this up!"" after a lot of thought. What kind of philosophical thinking survived in this future?<br/><br/>But I think this movie does many things right: The main character goes from being helpless to rather bad ass ""You are not going to shoot me"" Henchmen nr32 says. ""Why does everyone keep saying that?!"" BOOM, from our heroine. Compared to Twilight and Hunger Games whiny and unconvincing ladies.<br/><br/>The characters presented are everything from stereotypical to believable, you know what is going to happen with them but the movie still keeps you interested in what happen next. You care (mostly) what happens to these characters, not just a screen in the sky (Hunger Games) that tells you that some character that you didn't know died.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed the movie, but there are some points that doesn't make sense. Doesn't the other factions have anything to say about all what's going on? Like I wrote earlier ""What kind of philosophical thinking survived in this future?"" What was it that made the Intelligent+Military Leaders go, ""We should kill those Peaceloving guys who help the freaks (Divergents) and Factionless?""<br/><br/>But I hope future movies will clear this up (should prolly read the book) and I hope it is some twisted Anarcho-Dwarinism like ""Only the strong should survive, the divergent and factionless are the weak and should die"". But that rules out any kind of humanitarian thinking...<br/><br/>//Cheers, the Academic."
"ChosenTorture","4","1","2","11 August 2014"," Probably One of the Worst Modern Sci-Fi Movies Made
","The basic purpose that this movie serves is to glorify generalists and appease emotional people it even fails to do that properly.<br/><br/>Behold the city of Chicago where an isolated society is divided into five factions according to certain distinct qualities. How this isolated society manages to survive in the middle of nowhere remains a mystery. Teens are categorized into specific factions after they attempt a test that evaluates their qualities. An individual has the freedom of choosing the faction of his choice regardless of the test results. How this brilliant 'test' works remains a mystery.<br/><br/>The Abnegation faction is a truly hilarious and a ridiculous part of the story. It is a group of 'selfless' people who feed the faction-less and run the government. Really? 'Selfless' people? There's no such thing as 'selfless'. It's the fundamental biological human nature to be selfish. And why would any sensible person want a bunch of humanitarians to run a complex system of an entire government? Someone who knows a thing or two about political science would be a better candidate for the job.<br/><br/>One of the most pathetic lines in movie is spoken by the character 'Four'. He says that ""I don't want to be just one thing. I can't be. I want to be brave, and I want to be selfless, intelligent, and honest and kind. Well, I'm still working on kind."" -_- The guy wants to be Super-Mario.<br/><br/>This movie reminds me of Elysium. It had a similarly bad story and there was no original concept in it whatsoever. The characters played by Jodie Foster in Elysium and Kate Winslet in this movie are equally useless, boring and repetitive. It really is UNsurprising how this junk of a movie got 7 stars because of how so many people dump the logical part of their brain in the toilet before watching a movie, enjoy the graphics and think that a movie is good. The Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic page for this movie serve justice to this dauntingly dumb movie."
"aljumaily-anas","1","1","2","10 August 2014"," Terrible movie
","Without exception, this was the worst movie I have ever seen. The story is both so predictable you will get it within the first few minutes of the movie and you might as well snooze through the rest. This movie doesn't have anything. No action, no comedy, no anything. Arguably is has a bit of drama but even that I found lame because it wasn't coupled with any good character development so I didn't really care for the good guys and was almost half rooting for the bad guys just so I can see some action. All in all, this movie was terrible and I do not recommend you waste any of your precious time seeing it. If you're absolutely desperate and really have nothing else to watch, I'd recommend the shopping channel or any wall really for better entertainment."

","In my humble opinion this movie is so far the biggest mistake I've seen in 2014, with movie I Frankenstain. I was scandalized by it's relatively high rating on IMDb, almost 7.1, which is in my opinion too much. Totally uninteresting movie, thrown into the wind 2 hours of my time. Probably the best part of movie is its very beginning. The plot is terribly predictable, full of holes, illogical, with shallow characters. Just to mention I have a feeling that Miles Teller plays always the same character in all his movies. Not that I was expecting something from a movie, but then again ... I could not wait to film ends."

","While it's set in a dystopian future similar to The Hunger Games, it's central premise is FAR less compelling and didn't make for a good film experience. For most of this almost 2.5 hour film, I was never really convinced there was a meaningful conflict or personal struggle; I felt like the film was just going through the motions really. Whether it's the source material or Shailene Woodley's bland performance (I'm yet not convinced she has the screen presence to carry a series like this), this was mostly uneventful, underwhelming and just didn't resonate with me.

"Chanandler-Bong","7","1","2","29 July 2014"," Better than I expected
","Im coming from the perspective of not having read the books, although considering reading them now. I was quite impressed with this movie! Im surprised actually. I've recently watched Vampire Academy which is probably the most shameful and horrific adaptation of a damn good book I have ever seen. Anyway, so I wasn't holding up much hope for this film. But instead I come out of surprised and having enjoyed my experience in the Divergent world. Obviously in the books you get a deeper back story and deeper insight into their lives, so I understand that in the film there is going to be some lacking of both, it's pretty understandable as you cant get everything in. The acting was great, I saw a few familiar faces in Shailene and Theo, as well as a fellow TFIOS actor Ansel. The main cast were fantastic. I'd never seen Shailene before and wow she blew me away, she was great. Its not as testing as her role in TFIOS for obvious reasons but perhaps it test her in different ways (physically). She was pretty badass in this. As for Theo I've seen him in a few others and I think in this he really impressed me, as he did in A Passionate Woman. A lot of people are saying he's not right for the role but seeing as I haven't read the books I have no idea what he was meant to be like, so I'm reviewing his performance in this rather than in comparison to how he should be. Emotion wise this film built up to that and it was emotional at times. I liked that they didn't focus too much on the relationship (come on guys it's pretty obvious it was gonna happen). I have a few downsides however. The CG wasn't very good, not realistic enough. I felt like I was in a game like Beyond Two Souls or The Last of Us. It wasn't very real, you could tell it was CG. In the beginning with all the people walking into the city was just ridiculously bad, like I was playing Sims 3. And the other issue I had was with the story line, which isn't the fault of the movie writers but of the author. I saw too many obvious similarities to books like The Hunger Games and The Vampire Academy. I'll giver her this, it's difficult to be original nowadays but there were some things so obviously the same as stories before hers. But other than that, fantastic film and worth a watch."

Terrible plot holes, terrible acting and unoriginal, pointless story line. <br/><br/>The plot actually made no sense. The so called 'factions' played no relevance to the story other than to leave you wondering what the purpose of the factions was in the first place. The ""Dauntless"" Warrior Faction that the protagonist chooses to become apart of; is supposed to be the protecting/policing group of the city they all live in. There was not one seconds of any kind of policing that they did.

"supatube","6","1","2","13 May 2014"," The Marshmallow Soul
","'A war has left a dystopian world where people are divided into distinct factions based on human virtues. Tris Prior, born into one of the five factions has the desire to be in another. Each faction provides something essential to the whole society and the premise was created in order to preserve peace. Before her switch she is warned she is Divergent and won't conform to one but rather to all factions and that resistance to conform to a singular faction makes her dangerous to the faction system. Now Tris must learn to trust in the mysterious Four (a guy, not four people) and together they must find out what makes being Divergent so dangerous before it's too late.' <br/><br/>Separating society into different factions that are based on basic, yet strong, personality character traits is the beginning of a spectacular premise but somehow the film that is likened to ""Twilight"" and ""Hunger Games"" (girl-in-love-teen-book) sits sadly in the middle. When the political intrigue and dystopic world fascination is juxtaposed with a girls love crush, the intrigue and fascination dwindles. <br/><br/>A montage of the training may have served my impatience well as the pace at which the initiation was delivered was excruciating to sit through. Although initiation/training is meant to be excruciating, therefore the pace served the story, it still left the viewer waiting. Waiting for the inevitable. <br/><br/>How does one review a film that has many great aspects? The soundtrack is awesome, the visuals are fresh, the story is captivating, Ashley Judd is compelling, the action is fluid, setting is interesting and I want to become completely enamoured with this world but I'm not. If my interest could be measured it would have peaked in the opening, hit a rock bottom by the end of act one, remaining there till the middle of the second, and hitting 'mildly-entertaining' by the end. And this is the movie's down fall – it starts off on its highest note possible, the story of factions. From there the story starts to show its true fluffy and fake, marshmallow soul and one that's infuriating to sit through. And the fact that the best bit is garnered from the first ten minutes of a two and a half hour movie I am pretty sure disappointment is right up there with the most important things one would feel after sitting through a screening of ""Divergent"".<br/><br/>I'm not saying it's a bad film but please, I beg and plea; don't make me watch it again"

When what felt like the 'intro' was dragging on for over an hour, I googled whether there were follow-ups to come. Unfortunately, yes.<br/><br/>The story follows this girl who lives in a strange futuristic society, in which people have to enter one of five factions. Which one is determined by character. This faction system, it is mentioned, is essential in keeping the peace after the last global war. It is not clear, however, how this faction system contributes to peace. It seems to me that it causes competitive behaviour between factions, but maybe the next movie explains how it works. Well now, to prevent spoilers, the girl experiences the beginning part of an adventure. It is actually quite a predictable movie.<br/><br/>I did not like it very much, but I presume I am not in the intended audience group and I didn't read the novels either. I rate it five stars because some parts of the story made sense, I did not feel offended by it and the (albeit quite anticlimactic) suspense of and questions about the history of the world war that caused the demise of civilization.<br/><br/>Reminded me of the hunger games: based on books, with a female lead role, and a strange society with questionable behaviour.

Overall there are few memorable moments.<br/><br/>Viewers that enjoy this genre, or are new to it, are likely to enjoy it; for the rest of us it is a painful two hours.

"JPfanatic93","5","1","2","4 May 2014"," A future caste society based on schoolyard archetypes
","There is nothing 'divergent' about Divergent. It's a formulaic piece catering to young adults in every conceivable way. Accusations that it was only produced to cash in on the superior Hunger Games franchise among that most lucrative demographic cannot be denied a certain degree of validity. Divergent is a predictable teen flick with overt aspirations to grow into a full fledged franchise too, and it continuously feels as such.<br/><br/>The greatest pleasure to be had from this film is the set-up of its admittedly ludicrous dystopia, a form of repressive civilization that feels untenable from the get-go and<br/><br/>proves just that. Sometime in the future the world order has collapsed. The city of Chicago has cut itself off from the world by an enormous fence, protecting the supposedly harmonious society within from the ruined outside. Life is determined by belonging to one of five factions: Abnegation (selfdenial and government), Dauntless (police/army), Erudite (science), Candor (law/order) and Amity (farming/food production). Children grow up with their parents in one of these groups, but get to pick their own faction at the age of sixteen after a harrowing personality test. Of course, rivalry and shady alliances have formed between the various factions, and nobody appears to like Abnegation as they seem a redundant part of the whole. There's your overall plot right there.<br/><br/>Enter Beatrice Prior, a 16-year old girl who never felt at home growing up as a child of Abnegation parents but kept her personal convictions bottled up. When the test reveals her personality not to fit into any one specific group but rather to carry qualities of all, her test agent labels her a 'Divergent' and falsifies her results, as these rare outcasts are considered a danger to society because of their mental versatility and are eliminated accordingly. You'd think the people who came up with this social pattern would have opted for the city to be run by Divergents to coordinate the other factions for the good of the whole, but that would put an abrupt ending to the following two hours of Beatrice's self-exploration. When the choice is put before her, she goes with Dauntless, because that's where all the cool kids are. This future dystopia is actually little more than a caste system reflecting a contemporary schoolyard, where the usual stereotypical classifications of punks, nerds and the like are strictly adhered to by everybody. Scary, unable to break away from the high school pecking order for the rest of your life.<br/><br/>After abandoning her parents and changing her name to the much slicker 'Tris', she is confronted by a rigorous training, to get rid of her former life and determine whether she's tough enough to join the warrior caste. Fortunately for her, her enigmatic tutor Four proves a likable guy with a killer body and charms to match. You know where this is going. If you're hoping to see more of the logistics of this unlikely dystopia, you're out of luck, as most of what follows revolves around Tris and Four (too) slowly but (too) surely getting romantically entangled and making that most shocking of discoveries imaginable; they're both Divergents. As much as Woodley is no Jennifer Lawrence, the chemistry between her and James is passable<br/><br/>but never thoroughly engaging. The same is true for the interaction with their peers, while the more experienced actors among the cast hardly get a chance to shine. Even Kate Winslet, an otherwise impeccable actress, delivers a less than stellar performance in her role as the movie's baddie, an Erudite official out to wipe out the Abnegation caste. It's a diabolical ploy nobody is surprised to encounter after the first five minutes of exposition of Divergent, which already convinced the spectator this form of government was doomed from its infancy. Our heroic duo of Divergents swiftly prove their worth as they figure out a way to halt Winslet's evil plot of assuming mind control of Dauntless to annihilate Abnegation. However, since there's three more films to follow, don't expect them to get thanked for their decisive actions.<br/><br/>Ideologically speaking, Divergent's plea against mindless conformation and its case for individual freedom is handled too obviously. The movie proves a teenage angstfest, laced with the pubescent search for personal identity and the development of the sense of true belonging to such an excessive degree that the plot's metaphorical value is utterly wasted. Tris gets to question her role in society through all the tests and challenges to such an extent her process of selfdiscovery starts to bore us. Whereas the fear of growing up to adulthood and the anxiety regarding the need to fit into society's repressive standards were addressed to<br/><br/>better results in The Hunger Games, such thoughts prove all too overt and in-your-face in Divergent. Nevertheless, there is room for improvement as much for this film as there was for the first installment of that rival series. Now that the set-up is over and done with, the viewer does wonder where the plot goes from here. The brief glimpses – limited both in terms of scope and frequency, mostly due to budget restrictions no doubt – we witnessed of this dystopian future do leave room for curiosity as to how exactly this world functions. Considering the target audience has flocked en masse to theaters to get lost from their own woes and identify with these relatable issues, those sequels are guaranteed. Hopefully a final similarity to The Hunger Games can be made in the future, as Divergent's sequel proved to be much more intricately crafted than its otherwise bland predecessor."

","You know how we rate dogs on the intelligence scale? By their ability to obey human commands and perform their predefined roles. In many ways, in muggle or wizard world, this quality of every entity doing their predefined role is man's vision of a perfect society. However, it is in human nature to sacrifice altruism over ambition, and hence the only two factions that will stand the test of time are the oppressed and the oppressor.<br/><br/>Divergent is the latest movie adaption of yet another young adult dystopian novel by the same name, written by Veronica Roth. Typical of the genre, it explores themes such as friendship, love, relationship with families and authority figures, diversity and socioeconomic status through a young lead character, Tris Prior, played by Shailene Woodley.<br/><br/>""Faction before blood""<br/><br/>Sometime in the future, society in Chicago is divided into five factions- Abnegation (selfless), Amity (peaceful), Candor (truthful), Erudite (intelligent) and Dauntless (brave), based on their personalities. Much like the sorting hat, young 16 year old citizens have to undergo a test that defines their fit. While most conform to these factions, there are a few who display characteristics of all the five factions, called Divergents. These folks can think independently, and not according to pre defined norms, which makes them a threat to the social order government, so are usually terminated. Tris is born in an Abnegation family, but her results show that she is a divergent, and to stay alive she chooses Dauntless. <br/><br/>And why not. In a slew of drab, the fearless, military faction members are uber chic- get to wear snazzy black, put on cool tattoos, fight peek-a-boo style and get to jump on and off running trains. The initiation and trainings in this faction are severe tests of strength, conviction and courage. All is not well though, as the Erudites and the Dauntless leadership collude to bring down the rule of the Abnegation, leading to a final showdown as Tris struggles to fight for her parents. While the movie by itself is reasonably good, there is a feeling of deja vu. The success of Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, and the Twilight Saga have led to film producers treating young adult fiction movies like stones thrown in the dark, hoping for a hit. There has been more misses than hits. The hits managed to transcend its audience, from young adults to adults. While the film adaptations of the misses- such as The Host, The Mortal Instruments, The Golden Compass, Percy Jackson were made in a way that they appealed to only their fan base.<br/><br/>My feelings after watching Divergent were mixed. The good is that it largely eschews spectacle for substance. Considerable amount of time given to develop the characters, and their motives. There is no shortage of grit- the characters embrace the violence gratuitously. But the script is utterly predictable, and that is kind of sad for a movie that is all about being different. No wonder Shailene Woodley is so talked about these days. When she smiles, she lights up the screen. Pity though the script allows her to do it so little. Also, since this is a trilogy, director Neil Burger stays away from giving us three climaxes (one in each movie), rather keeps setting up things for subsequent films, which makes the ending of this movie a bit non entertaining. <br/><br/>Strictly popcorn fare. Fans will love it though- 7/10"

","Without having read any of the books in the series, I can't make any comparisons to how closely or loosely the movie follows. However, I don't know if I necessarily need to read the books, as I walked away seeing comparisons to multiple other dystopian works, both books and movies.<br/><br/>First, I will get to what I thought worked about the movie, and without a doubt I would say it was the acting. For the predictability of the overall plot, I walked away really believing that the characters came to life. I could feel for Tris as she tried to hide her true nature while just trying to survive. I could tell that Four had a connection with Tris that was on a deeper level than most movies aimed at a young audience can deliver (just look at Twilight). The concern that Tris and Caleb's parents showed not only for their children's safety, but also for the survival of their own faction, was evident. And the continual tension between family loyalty and faction loyalty felt real.<br/><br/>The plot however, as I already alluded to, seemed to me pieced together from other works of dystopian fiction. The ""savior"" who thinks independently, as well as the scenes of intense training the guardians of the status quo go through seemed reminiscent of ""Equilibrium"". The idea that a serum could control the masses, as well as hordes of people living beyond the bounds of society, seemed a lot like ""Brave New World"". The monitors that could track everyone seemed to me like ""Nineteen Eighty Four"", whereas the factions themselves seemed reminiscent of the districts of ""The Hunger Games"".<br/><br/>Overall, I would say this piecemeal of a movie was powerfully acted, but I walked away believing that I had seen it before. I would also say however that I hope that the sequels can maybe break the mold of what dystopian fiction has become."

","Rating out of 10: 10 stars ********** <br/><br/>Notes to remember for the review Great actors Great story line Amazing costumes Awesome special effects <br/><br/>Pros (Good things / what I loved) They chose good actors for the parts They used good emotions The special effects<br/><br/>Cons (Bad things / what I didn't like), and how would you improve on it (next steps) The only thing I didn't like was that they left out some parts from the book<br/><br/>Introduction Divergent takes place in the future and after the war the country is divided in factions. There are 5 factions Abnegation (the selfless) Candor (the honest) Erudite (the intelligent) Amtiy (the peaceful) and Dauntless (the brave). Tris is the main character she is divergent the government doesn't like divergent because they think that they will try to take over the country.<br/><br/>Evidence This is a action movie and it's sort of like the Hunger Games. The main characters are Triss (Shailene Woodley) Four/Tobias (Thoe James) Jeanine (Kate Winslet) Tori (Maggie Q) and Eric (Jai Courtney). You would like to watch this movie if you like the Hunger Games, Catching Fire and action movies. Also if you liked the book you will probably like the movie. This movie is about Tris who is divergent she goes to Dauntless but she finds out that Jeanine is trying to take over the government controlling the dauntless people and making them kill the abnegation people Tris and Four are Divergent so Eric and Jeanine can't control them but hey have to pretended or they will be killed. In the end Tris and Four stop Eric and Jeanine!<br/><br/>Conclusion I think that Divergent is an amazing movie and I can't wait to see the next two! <br/><br/>Rating out of 5:<br/><br/>I still think it's 10****** Stars"
"interestingfunstuff","10","4","19","29 March 2014"," What A Powerful Cautionary Tale!
","Divergence is an incredibly powerful, but violent political story not suitable for children! The bottom line here is about the violent overthrow of a benevolent government. While far from perfect, these benevolent rulers are certainly 1000 times better than being governed by psychopathic killers dressed in business suits! <br/><br/>Another message from Divergence: Some people use fear to their advantage, they are awakened by it, while others are overwhelmed and are ""shut-down"" by their fears. This film focuses a lot on facing every kind of physical and psychological fear imaginable.<br/><br/>This also is a story about adolescents making adult choices and facing the consequences of those choices. A true transition into adulthood - that affects every adolescent - takes place. One I wish existed for all of us in real world!"

","Despite all the negative reviews about this movie, I have to say that in my opinion, he is really well done. I didn't read the book but I am looking forward to read him, so my review is not complete.<br/><br/>""Divergent"" captured my attention from the first minute until the last one. I will not say that it was flawless... It had some non-sense scenes that I stood a little confused, but it passed away.<br/><br/>Everyone is saying that he seems to older and she seems to younger. For me that is not a relevant thing if they didn't perform the scenes quite good together. Shailene Woodley and Theo James deserve my congratulations because it is not so easy to do.<br/><br/>I gave my ten stars because one movie to be good it has to captivate us.

"matthewwatowich","10","5","27","26 March 2014"," Divergent Best Movie Review
","Divergent is a movie about a young girl, Beatrice (Shailene Woodley), who lives in the dystopian future. In this world, when people are sixteen, they take a test, which assigns them to one of five factions where they will live for the rest of their lives. Beatrice's test results are inconclusive, and she decides to go live in the Dauntless, or the brave faction. In this faction she meets many new friends. She also meets Four (Theo James), who is the faction leader, and falls in love with him. Beatrice, or Tris (her new name) then discovers a plan made by another faction leader, Jeanine (Kate Winslet), to take over the government and kill many innocent people. This causes her to go on a journey with Four, who she is unsure if she can trust, to stop Jeanine. <br/><br/>This movie is filled with splendid acting, realistic visuals, and a twisting and unpredictable plot. Shailene Woodley, who plays the main role, does an incredible job playing a character that has not found out where she belongs and has to lie to survive. It is also filled with realistic visuals, such as Four and Beatrice climbing about 300ft in the air to the top of a Ferris wheel and looking down over a futuristic city. Another effect is when the main character glides through this futuristic city and past tall buildings on a zip line. These realistic effects make the viewer feel as if they have been transported into the movie.<br/><br/>The unpredictable plot makes this movie somewhat hard to follow for people who have not read the book. There was so much that happened in the book and the movie that made it hard for the viewer to understand what was happening. This movie may cause some viewers to ask questions, such as ""Where did this woman come from"", ""Where are they now,"" or ""Who is this?"" Another reason that many viewers may have questions is because this plot is shrouded in mystery. Many of the characters reveal their backstory and how they tie into the plot at the end of the movie, so do not worry. I felt like there were a lot of unnecessary training scenes; however, these scenes were nice because they provided action to the movie. This was a long movie, lasting two hours, however, it went by extremely fast because of how much action was in it. <br/><br/>Another thing that I thought I was going to be disappointed with was how similar the plot was to the Hunger Games. Both of these stories are set in a dystopian future with a government who is disliked by many common people, which causes the people to rebel. However, Divergent puts a new and fresh spin on it. Instead of the government being the bad thing, it is a woman that wants to take over the government, who must be stopped. The villain, or antagonist, was a woman, which made the film seem different than others in its genre. One thing that might deter some people is the amount of violence in the movie. There are many scenes, which contain fighting, knives, and blood. <br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone interested in an action movie with a new, fresh plot idea. I think that it might have been slightly better if I had read the book because it would eliminate some of the confusion. However, it is still fun movie to watch even if you have not read the book, since it is filled with spectacular acting and visuals, along with an unpredictable, surprising plot."
"rannynm","8","3","13","28 March 2014"," Where Outcasts Have to Hide to Protect Themselves
","Based on the wildly successful novel by Veronica Roth, ""Divergent"" tells the story of teens struggling to find their place in post-war Chicago. Society is separated by factions based on personality traits and virtues in attempts to keep the peace and encourage the population to participate equally in maintaining a functioning community. When a person turns 16, she takes a test to determine what faction best suits her characteristics to help her decide whether she should stay in her home faction or move elsewhere. Tris, played by Shailene Woodley, is a modest girl from Abnegation, but her entire life is turned upside down when the test reveals something about her she didn't know was possible. She is a Divergent, which means she does not fit into any category, therefore cannot be controlled and is a threat to the system. With the advice of an older faction member, she is warned not to tell a soul or her life will be at risk. Young Tris then decides to leave her home of Abnegation and transfer to Dauntless, a fiery group of individuals that show no fear and protect the people. There, she has to learn to fit in and test herself physically and mentally, all the while guarding a dark secret.<br/><br/>I really like this film. I went into it not knowing anything about the book trilogy so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I was pleased with the outcome. The visuals are interesting because even though this film is set in the future and it features some advanced technology, everything is kept quite simple looking. There are, however, some flaws with the visuals and effects because at times it is very apparent that green screen is in use. The soundtrack is absolutely incredible. It features a variety of artist that I really enjoy and I've already downloaded music from the film because it is something I actually listen to on a daily basis which isn't the case with me for most motion picture soundtracks. <br/><br/>My favorite character is surprisingly not one of the leads, but a supporting role. I like the character Will, played by Ben Lloyd-Hughes, who is a boy Tris meets during her training in Dauntless. Will is a sweet, kind-hearted person who is always very supportive of Tris and her friend Christina, played by Zoe Kravitz. He is very level headed and is someone you can always count on. I had the pleasure of meeting Ben Lloyd-Hughes and I think he is perfect for the role of Will. The rest of the cast works very well together. Shailene Woodley does a great job portraying her emotions and showing Tris's character development. She goes through quite a lot over the course of the film and Shailene is really able to embody Tris and show how she transforms from a timid, modest Abnegation, to a fearless young woman who is not defined by anyone or anything. The only problem I have with the casting is that Four, played by Theo James, is supposed to be 18 in the book series. However in the film, he appears to be in his mid 20's, since Theo is 29 years old. He does a wonderful job playing his character, but it makes the romance between him and Tris really uncomfortable. <br/><br/>My favorite scene in the film is when Tris and the rest of the new members of Dauntless are heading back from playing a capture the flag like war game. They each strap up to a high-speed full body zip line that goes rocketing through the empty city. I think this scene is visually appealing even though it is very short and has really no importance to the film. The CGI and landscape in this scene is just well done. <br/><br/>Since I have not read this trilogy, I was a little let down with certain aspects of the film. In ""Divergent"" the film, the whole movie is mainly Tris training in Dauntless and it feels like the plot takes far too long to develop. The last 15-20 minutes of the film is where the action and the conflict begin to happen and then the movie is over. I found out that this is how the first book is written as well, but as someone who has very little prior knowledge of the series, it seems a bit odd. The second thing that threw me off was that it seems as if quite a bit of the dialogue is taken directly from the book. This is something that fans of the book will love since the films stays so true to the novel. However, from my point of view, a lot of the dialogue does not translate very well to the screen and appears a bit cheesy and forced at times. Like I said, this is really only an issue for me since I have not read the series nor was I a fan prior to watching the film. Overall, I was entertained despite these points. <br/><br/>I recommend this film for ages 12 to 18 or for anyone who has read the novel. The movie gets a bit violent during training scenes and towards the end but is nothing too bad and if you've read the books you know what to expect. Overall I give Divergent 4 out of 5 stars because it is entertaining and I'm already eager for the next installment in the series. Plus I and all my friends that saw the film have been quoting the movie non-stop and making ""Divergent"" references in almost every conversation, so it clearly left its mark on us! Be sure to check out ""Divergent"" in theaters on March 21st. <br/><br/>Reviewed by Raven D, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews, go to kidsfirst dot org."
"movielover2014","9","3","13","28 March 2014"," The movie was great, just didn't follow the book that well.
","If you have not read the book, the movie will probably seem pretty good. A few of the fights were a little cliché, but it is still an overall good movie. <br/><br/>My second point I direct to a person's whose username is ELSIDALIAJ. You cannot review a movie if you walked out in the first 20 minutes of it you fool. You obviously missed key parts of the movie that apparently confused your trivial little mind. The trains don't stop for a reason you uncultured swine. The people jump on the train because they are DAUNTLESS. There entire faction's purpose is to be brave. They climb up to the train because it is brave. Read the book or at least watch the movie before you open your foolish mouth about how stupid it is. Furthermore the Dauntless run everywhere and made loud noises because that's who they are. It's part of their character. Simple minded people like you are what deter people from great movies"
"justinmccans","10","3","13","28 March 2014"," I must admit... Filipinos love DIVERGENT + BOOK <3
","It wasn't very good as the book...the writing was incredibly lacking, and the actors did what they could with what they had to work with but they certainly could've been better as well. Some of the directing choices made the film feel visually disjointed, which I suppose fits with the writing so maybe it was intentional. The music and set/special effects were perfect, as was our introduction to the Dauntless, but as with most adaptations, the film didn't do the book justice.<br/><br/>But overall, i still love this movie (of course) and i'm shipping ShaiTheo (awe). Even though there was those some details were cut/lack, I enjoyed the movie ! (YASSS!!) And this movie really deserves a Rated A & the most top grossing + #1 Best Movie in the universe!<br/><br/>PS: Filipinos really love Divergent <3"
"tiffanyyongwt","9","3","14","29 March 2014"," The story had an antagonist Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet) whose character resembles ""President Snow"" (The Hunger Games).
","I wrote this review before reading the book, so do pardon me if some of the observations/reviews/assumptions were wrong. If I have to summarize the story of the film in a few words, it will be a Harry Potter + Hunger Games. In the movie, you are ""sorted"" in the muggle way by taking an aptitude test. The story had an antagonist Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet) whose character resembles ""President Snow"" (The Hunger Games). She felt that people who are Divergent have to be killed, which drove Tris and Four to the outskirts of the city.<br/><br/>Still, I can't help but like the movie, for some odd reasons. I was gasping Maggie Q's name when she first appeared, no surprise, she played a minor role, but the character was important enough for me to be impressed, as she was a familiar face in many Asian films.<br/><br/>One main reason why I like the film was the choice of cast for the ""badass"" characters. When I first saw Miles Teller as Peter in the movie, I was amused by his appearance, partly because of the prior comedy ""That Awkward Moment"" which he starred in screened just not long ago. Playing the resident bully in Divergent, Miles Teller brought a slightly humored approach to the film character by making the jerk a little more tolerable and interesting. Down side, another character Al (Christian Madsen) looked a little like Teller, which got me kinda confused between the two characters during the film.<br/><br/>Kate Winslet as the antagonist, Jeanine Matthew? Seriously? She looked so nice and smart that I could just take in what she say without any questions. If she says the Abnegation are bad, they are bad. No questions ask. Reasons for overthrowing them seemed so sound and legit coming from her. Well, what can I say? She's a villain you got to be careful of.<br/><br/>When Four (Theo James) showed Tris his tattoo, I could hear giggles and squealing in the cinemas. It was almost like the anticipation of Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) stripping his clothes for the Twilight. The only part I was a tad disappointed with was the drug-induced fear hallucination of Tris. I'm not sure if this was according to the book (Yet to read till that chapter!) but getting stuck and attacked by crows is definitely not what I will define as scary. I can't help but refer to The Hunger Games, but the obstacles in the games were definitely scarier than Tris' dreams.<br/><br/>While many online reviews lament about the similarities from various sources, the fact that the film raised several thought-provoking questions ie. individuality, where you belong, facing your fears, etc made it a relatively interesting movie to catch. It might not be the Hunger Games, but if you watch it without the comparison, it will have almost everything you want in a movie (or perhaps it's just me): Excitement, Romance, Great Cast, Thought-provoking points, so there is no reason why you shouldn't catch it too!<br/><br/>For those who have caught the movie, so which Faction did you belong to?

","I had been waiting for this movie for a really long time ever since I read the book. I really enjoyed this movie. It was simply amazing, if you don't count all the details that were missing, or undeveloped. Overall, I think that Shailene Woodley and Theo James are a really good match. The action and fighting was really interesting and I loved the movie.<br/><br/>However, I was a bit disappointed that they left out some key parts from the book.<br/><br/>1.

They just slightly hinted that Will and Christina were together, which kinda ruins it because Tris has all this guilt after shooting Will.<br/><br/>3. There was no parents visiting day.<br/><br/>4. They didn't have a funeral for Al, and that was really sad, probably because they didn't talk about his relationship with Tris.<br/><br/>5. TRIS NEVER CALLED HIM TOBIAS. ONLY FOUR. THATS WHAT MAKES HER SPECIAL TO HIM. SHE KNEW HIS SECRET.<br/><br/>6. SHE TELLS HIM SHE LOVES HIM WHILE HES UNDER THE SIMULATION. No explanation that the simulation was used on him as an experiment.<br/><br/>7. Tris takes the flag instead of Christina.<br/><br/>8. The ferris wheel scene was like, 30 seconds.

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Divergent"" (2014) is a superb entertainment. I haven't read the book, but i was hooked from the beginning till the very last end. Shailene Woodley gives a great performance for this kind of movie, you simply can not resist for rotting for her. Other actors did a descent job for the material. ""Divergent"" which is based on a book is type of the movies that i call ""21 th century movie adaptations Beverly Hils style"" - it's all actually a bit familiar for this type of movies, aka. ""The Host"" (2013), ""The Hunger Games"" franchise - you get the structure, and there is always a hero (a heroine)which isn't like all other, and she starts a rebellion - no spoilers here. But ""Divergent"" is better then ""The Host"", and it's better than the first ""The Hunger Games"" film.<br/><br/>Overall, if like these adaptations, you will definitely will love ""Divergent"", which is wonderfully paste, good acted, solidly written and to sum it up, it's a great entertainment."

I also can't believe they left out the butter knife and scary ferris wheel part. I did love the way they portrayed the zip line scene in the movie and the final mental fear initiation.

"oscarxp25","8","2","8","30 March 2014"," The Cerebral Games
","Since the release of the juggernaut ""Twilight"" back in 2008, Hollywood has been searching for any film, based on a young adult novel, that would spark the same craze those movies did. While some are successes, such as ""The Hunger Games"", there are countless others that just fall to the waste side. Does the new film ""Divergent"" rise to occasion or just fall into the same league as the other failures? The plots of ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent"" are very similar but different in their own ways. Both take place in a futuristic society that has become a wasteland. The people in these societies have been split into different factions that serve their own purpose to the high power of the government. These governments try to play it off as if they are one of the people but, of course, stand for everything these societies are built on, which is freedom.<br/><br/>In ""Divergent"", which takes place in a post-war Chicago, people are split into five factions: the selfless Abgenations, the peaceful Amitys, the honest Candors, the brave Dauntless, and the intelligent Edrudites. When children are sixteen they are given a test to see where they would fit in. After the results are given, they are must choose to go with what their results were or choose their own path. Our young heroine, Beatrice or Tris as she later refers to herself as, is urged by her family and faction in Abnegation to stay, but becomes part of the Dauntless. She wants to be part of the group who protects the city and lives a more wild lifestyle than the other four.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is a bit slow paced. It is a very stereotypical journey of a fragile young woman slowly being transforming into a strong woman. As Tris, the film's star Shailene Woodley does just fine. Tris isn't as powerful of a character as Katniss from ""The Hunger Games"" but also isn't a complete bore like Bella Swan. She falls nicely in the middle. Though Woodley, at times, does play it bland at times she does own the role and makes you care about this young girl and her journey.<br/><br/>Director Neil Burger does the future well. It is a very sterile future that seems too clean and pure for its own good. As far as the look of everything it echoes science fiction films like ""Logan's Run"". Burger does have some pacing issues with a run time that went a bit too long. It is close to 150 minutes. Some of it, especially the beginning, could have been trimmed a bit. The only other fault I would give the director would be the waste of the role that Winslet has. What is with Hollywood casting great actresses to fill roles that aren't good enough for their talents? It happened in ""Elysium"" with Jodie Foster and it does in this film with Winslet. It isn't a terrible performance but one that just requires them to go through the motions of being a typical female baddie, right down to the wardrobe.<br/><br/>Those things that don't work are overshadowed by what does work. The film is quite smart in the way it handles what it has to say. The title of the film comes from those select people in society who have all the qualities of the five factions. They have the ability to have empathy and see situations as whole instead of just through their own factions beliefs. Of course, the higher ups, who are the Edrudities, don't want this because this would inspire hope in people through ideas. They are creating soldiers through brain washing their citizens into doing their dirty work. It is a an interesting way to communicate to younger people, who read these novels, the power of influence and the even greater power of fear of non-acceptance. Even though she can kick ass, which she does to her costar Milles Teller, who plays a sleaze bag here, who also starred with in the the terrific ""The Spectacular Now"", Tris' true power is her ability to influence others and show that they don't have to succumb to others beliefs. Woodley does have the pureness to sell this ideal. One of her initiation processes is facing her fears head on in a dream like sequence. Burger captures the insanity that goes through a young teenage girl's mind perfectly. Especially one in the wasted world where Beatrice grew up in. There are other surprisingly wise decisions made in this film to communicate the down falls of a controlled society which you should see for yourself.<br/><br/>While ""The Hunger Games"" shows its points through a grand and epic scale, ""Divergent"" is more cerebral in the way it lays out its evidence. ""Divergent"" maybe the answer to people who like a less flashy way of telling them the downfalls of the ""perfect society"

","I've been reading reviews on this website for a while and I've seen some overly harsh judgments in the past...but nothing like what people are typing up about this film...so lets address the movie first. <br/><br/>Divergent is an underdog story about learning to stand up for who you are and fight back against a society that is constantly trying to shove you into a box...Its a great film, one I highly recommend. <br/><br/>Now on to the complaints The first ""studios are always looking for the next hunger games or the twilight saga and this is just another attempt..."" So your argument about this movie is because studios are trying to produce good successful movies...got it...they should only make crap indie films makes total sense to me now (maybe you should just stop going to the movies...maybe just not watch TV)<br/><br/>The Second ""It was nothing like the book they butchered the book"" um..grow up...if you love the book then read it again this movie doesn't change how great the book is...did I scream and complain about how Man of Steel wasn't exactly like the comics...NO!

","Another movie based on a bestselling novel. I think the first time I heard about this flick was when I went to see Beautiful Creatures, which is also based on a bestselling novel. I first herd of that movie when I went to see the Host, which if I'm not mistaken is also based on a bestselling novel. You get the idea. It's good to hear that young girls are reading novels.<br/><br/>Though these movies are for young girls mostly, I do get a kick out of them. After all, most of them are centered on some super natural creatures or have a large Sci-Fi theme. This movie takes place in a post-apocalyptic Chicago, which was visually awesome by the way. A War broke out about a 100 years ago, and In order to bring back order in a world fallen apart, the society sectioned off its people into 5 Fractions and when a child is old enough, they take a test to decided which fraction they actually belong too. Most people go back to the fractions they were born into with very few being chosen for a different Fraction, However in the case of the main character Beatrice, the test were not conclusive, meaning she would not fit into any Fraction. The people of this world refer to this as Divergent and being such is not good. <br/><br/>The movie screams the message for young girls to grow up and be what they want to be, especially with the plot of Beatrice, who was born into a Fraction of mostly boring framers, choosing to join the fraction of really, really enthusiastic Law Enforcers. Although I can't help but to point out the similarities in this movie to The Hunger Games, and I must admit, though I find Beatrice who becomes Tris when she joins the Dauntless fraction, warmer than Katniss Everdeen, I realize if I have a Choice, I prefer my female protagonist tougher . There were way too many times in the movie that Tris' boy toy, Four, one of the leaders and trainers of the Dauntless, had to come to her rescue. In all fairness, this may have something to do with the fact that unlike most Super heroines that have been exploiting the big screen lately, Tris has no love triangle. She has 5 chooses to where her life will go, but only one choice in men. Maybe in the Sequel?<br/><br/>The movie has a pretty well-known cast. Some people I knew by name like Miles Teller, who co-stared in the Spectacular Now, with Shailene Woodley, who played Tris. I felt a little sorry for the guy as he had a chance to grow in this movie outside of being type cast the sarcastic easy going best friend thing he's been doing in a lot of flicks, but it did not happen. Zoe Kravitz, who plays Tris BBF, taking after her father Lenny Kravitz, who is in the Hunger Games. Ashley Judd, who has a small but important role as Tris' mother and Naomi Watts who put on a little weight since the last time I've seen her, but still looks hot. Then their where a few faces that seem to float around the teen to young adult movies. <br/><br/>The movie does a good job in appealing to a lot of people. Its starts as a dramatic film focusing greatly on the society these people live in, which I found unique in a movie of this caliber, but they give you a nice helping of action as well.<br/><br/>It was a good choice for a movie to see, but I like hunger games better."
"michael-sengwah","8","4","24","24 March 2014"," Best adaptation after Harry Potter and The Hunger Games
","The film might not be extremely popular as compared to other hot young adult adaptation franchise, but the familiar formula used in the screenplay, the trick manipulated by the director, Neil Burger for minimizing the loving part have overall made this science fiction fantasy an amazing and worth adventure. Running for an approximately 139 minutes, it begins with a nice presentation of narrating the basic of the story, progresses into unexpectedly not draggy story line which is not overshadowed with love scenes and ends in an overall good way which opens for the upcoming sequel. The scores, composed by Junkie XL, produced by Hans Zimmer are surprisingly good, youthful and suit the film well. The performance of Theo James﻿ and Shailene Woodléy﻿ made a perfect chemistry couple, of course, the film is also balanced out by amazing contribution from Maggie Q, Kate Winslet﻿ and Jai Courtney﻿. It is the greatest YA adaptation after Harry Potter and The Hunger Games."

","I really enjoyed this movie! Story is original and interesting, this is not entirely what i expected when i went to see the movie. Less romance but more about the fight to survive being different which is basically something we all do eventually in some way, however, the main problem in that 'perfect' society is control over people, they put their faction before family. About the book-movie adaption i don't know much, i haven't read the books, but a good movie for me is when after seeing it you want to read the book and that is what Divergent did for me. Story was summarized nicely so that you actually got enough details about relationship between Tris and her family, Four and new found friends and enemies in the new faction. This movie was worth watching and i'm looking forward to the sequel :)"
"phd_travel","9","2","9","16 April 2014"," Much better than similar movies
","The story is so much better than ""Hunger Games"" which I found sickeningly stupid. The more intelligent premise of Divergent is involving and you feel more for the characters. Even though the movie is long is moves a long and is well directed and well paced. The fight scenes aren't overdone which makes it convincing.<br/><br/>The cast is likable and well cast like in Twilight. Shailene Woodley is actually good and sympathetic here seeming vulnerable and feisty at the same time. She isn't as beautiful as Lily Collins in Mortal Instruments but she is a very believable actress here. Theo James looks a bit older than her but they have good chemistry. Supporting cast is good too. Liked seeing Ashley Judd on the big screen again and she looks like she could be Shailene's mother. Maggie Q is quite a welcome presence too. Kate Winslet is suitably loathsome without overdoing it.<br/><br/>Looking forward to the next installment."

","I appreciate your idea of dividing the world into five factions: Abnegation, Erudite, Dauntless, Amity, and Candor. But you didn't state clearly why the world is broken in that way? War is not enough. In Chicago but don't know when it is, why it is??? @@ All sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives after taking an 'aptitude' (placement) test. But no orientation, no tutorial. Just follow what they have seen in other factions which are all beyond their imagination. Factions before blood, so every teenager just puts aside their origin, their parents, follow some guys but don't know who they are @@ Dauntless people could kill even their parents. Too ridiculous. Being divergent is also very easy, just think that ""This is not real"" to overcome fear. Otherwise, dauntless ones always fight back to the fear. I fear the world when everybody always want to inject sth into your necks and tests you all the time. It's also superficial to prove that Tris is divergent by testing results. There are so many people used that way to overcome fears,... T___T Many scenes of chases are also unreasonable when so many guards couldn't stop just 2 or 5 people. I also doubt of the invalidation of new drug on Four."

","I saw ""Divergent"", starring Shailene Woodley-The Secret Life of the American Teenager_t.v., The O. C._t.v.; Theo James-Golden Boy_t.v., Underworld: Awakening; Ashley Judd-Olympus Has Fallen, Kiss the Girls; Zoe Kravitz-After Earth, X-Men: First Class, and oh yeah, she is the daughter of Lenny Kravitz & Lisa Bonet and Kate Winslet-Contagion, Titanic_1997.<br/><br/>This is another one of those movies that is based on books aimed at teenagers-think 'Hunger Games', 'Twilight', etc., so you can expect sequels. The story takes place in Chicago in the not-too-distant future- I don't remember them mentioning a specific date. The world is divided into five factions,based on their personality traits. Abnegation is for selfless people that do anything for anybody, without expecting a reward-think boy scouts. Dauntless is a warrior clan that police the city when they are not thrill seeking by jumping off buildings and moving trains. Erudite is the really smart people. Candor is the totally honest people that never lie-great politicians. Amity is the pacifist people-think latter day hippies. When kids reach a certain age, they are tested to see which faction they will become a member of. Shailene plays a young girl that has to pick her future path, and like lots of teenagers, she just can not decide. She doesn't fit into any one faction and when that happens, you are called Divergent. But, being Divergent is highly frowned upon-it can get you banished or even killed-so Shailene keeps it to herself and joins the Dauntless. Theo is her trainer, and maybe future love interest? Ashley plays her mother. Zoe is a fellow recruit and Kate is the leader of the Erudite. FYI: At my theater-AMC- they were passing out little bracelets with the five different factions printed on them-I even had a women offer to buy mine from me before the movie started so that she could give it to her granddaughter. I kept it. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and sexuality-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 19 minutes. I have never read the books but I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu- Ray."

","Goodness! Many of the other User Comments for this film seem unjustly brutal. I confess I would probably not be considered part of the usual demographic for this type of movie, being more than half way to my 'three score years and ten'. Perhaps it is because of this I was able to just sit back and enjoy this movie for what it is - solid escapist entertainment with a bit of romance thrown in for good measure. When our real world currently appears to be going to hell in a hand-basket, what on earth is wrong with a healthy dollop of romance and escapism? Some have accused the film of being totally far-fetched - but isn't that rather the point of a futuristic fantasy film? Again, futuristic/fantasy/ sci-fi films are not usually to my taste and I try to avoid anything with wizards and/or dragons at all costs - not my bag at all.<br/><br/>I thought that Theo James as Four and Shailene Woodley as Tris had wonderful chemistry. It was also very good to know that the amorous Mr. Pamuk from Downton Abbey lived to fight another day after all! Does he remind anyone else of a young Charlton Heston, or is it just me?"

","Divergent has been compared to other best selling film adaptation before it such as the Hunger Games. Having no prior knowledge about the Divergent film series, one would not be as disappointing if did not enjoy the film. This film is best suited and aimed for those fans that enjoy films as the Hunger Games, Twilight or Maze Runner, and we can see why. As these are more teenage, young adult based theme films. The Divergent Series has done well box office wise which is why it is a trilogy. About the film, the effects and visuals as well done, the presence and lead portrayal of Shailene Woodley is good as she is a likable lead to root for. <br/><br/>Divergent is quite long and seems to drag at times though there are some scenes of entertainment in general. It is quite predictable and not as suspenseful or thrilling as one had assumed. Towards the end half, the film plays out more like a romance love story (as we all saw the romance between Tris and Four happening) in which it starts to go slowly downhill and become a little more boring in regards. The film also doesn't show as to why there are fractions of the world split, we are just to assume something happened in the beginning. Dystopian futuristic movies have a certain praise as we enjoy, but without much detail, it becomes a little wondering as to why. In general the film features a lot of stunts, jumping around, running, fighting and other forms of survival."

I would recommend this film to people who like film with action (fighting) but also romance. If I were to give this an age rating I would give it a 12+ due to the amount of use of guns and violence.

The problem is the person who has some characteristic of all faction needs to killed since they are considered as a threat to human society who do not fit in any category. The story revolves around how Shailene Woodley the lead who is a divergent gets into one of the faction and later is recognized as a divergent.

"stevetrowbridge98","9","1","3","3 November 2015"," Underrated movie based on great books
","I think the reason that the critics were so harsh on this film and why some people on here don't like it is because they take Divergent and compare it so much to The Hunger Games and purposefully try to point out the similarities between them and criticize the movie for it instead of keeping an open mind and really understanding and appreciating the story and movie for what it is. Is Divergent similar to The Hunger Games in some ways? Yes. However, if some people would actually pay attention they would see that Divergent is actually quite different from The Hunger Games in many ways and is not just a ""rip-off"" of the Hunger Games. Personally I enjoy the Divergent series more than The Hunger Games. So, I really liked this movie. I read the book beforehand and I've got to say that this is actually a pretty good adaption of the movie. The only thing I wished the could've done is make Peter more cold and aggressive like he was in the book. In the movie he just seems like your stereotypical bully. Also I wish they could've included the scene where Edward gets stabbed in the eye as that was pretty disturbing in the book and it would've made the movie a bit darker in my opinion but it's in the deleted scenes so it's all good. I thought the acting was very good, Shailene is superb as Tris as is Theo as Four. I thought Winslet was amazing as the cold, cunning Jeanine Matthews and everyone else was very good as well. I also absolutely loved the soundtrack to this movie, one of my favorites personally. So, again, I think some people and critics are kind of harsh either because they compare it so much to The Hunger Games (which there are going to be similarities, it's the exact same type of genre) or because these types of YA movies aren't for them and if that's the case then maybe they shouldn't be trying to see these movies in the first place.

"dan_grecu76","8","1","3","4 May 2014"," This movie talks about the defensive mentality and its consequences
","Let's talk a bit about the dangers of defensive mentality. This kind of mentality proved time and again to be very detrimental. But let's see why what is it that makes this type of mentality so dangerous.<br/><br/>The first reflex of the defensive mentality is to build a wall as tall and as strong as possible, be it a concrete and barbed-wire wall as it goes with human communities, be it an imaginary wall, just as strong in people's minds and hearts. Anything coming from outside is now automatically rejected. The logical consequence is inertia in all aspects: economic, political and cultural when it comes to societies, spiritual and emotional with individuals.<br/><br/>Once this wall is built, the second stage involves the removal of any element, this time from inside (as the outside world is already blocked) which does not conform to the already established standards. A feeling of fear is maintained in the society by the means of external and internal imaginary enemies, so that people can accept repressive measures more easily. This fear also helps to bring people to support the regime in power. The same thing happens with the individuals: the mind maintains all sorts of anxieties and imaginary diseases, which keep them in a continuous state of fear, not allowing them to leave the confinement defended by the wall. Thus, they remain in their imaginary stronghold, believing themselves to be safe.<br/><br/>As this regime matures, a very dangerous process takes place, namely the transfer of one's responsibilities towards the others. The citizens are no longer responsible about the community, as the system is talking care of everything and everyone. The system educates, takes care of the people's health, builds and distributes housing and so on. Consequently, people only need to focus on delivering on their duties at their work place. Moreover, they do not even need to worry about how the results of their work is used. The scientists are just scientists and the system is making sure that the results of their work are properly used. Soldiers and policemen no longer need to worry about the morality and rightness of their orders, they only need to carry them out, regardless of what their conscience might tell them.<br/><br/>The final blow delivered by this process is applied to the most fundamental values of the people. The isolation erodes the connection between people and makes them unable to feel. The human bond is lost. Now the system raises the stake and attacks savagely the most important human values and call into question even the human nature, proclaiming the need for a new man, most of the time a man that relinquished the feelings and the weaknesses brought upon by them. The blood ties and family bonds are nothing more than abstract notions stemming from the humanity's primitive past. Family is now only a social unit that prepares responsible citizens to be delivered to the society. As a replacement, total loyalty to the collective is demanded as well as the willingness of sacrifice for this greater body, which now represents family.<br/><br/>The consequences of this process can only be disastrous for both individual and society. The diversity and pluralism are eliminated, everyone must behave and think the same, any progress or personal opinion threatens the stability of the system and are nipped in the bud. Fascism and communism proposed and implemented such systems, and the majority of the population embraced them willingly or tacitly, out of their desire for ""peace"" or ""tranquility"" and out of their fear of others coming to take what was theirs. What were we talking about in the beginning? About the defensive mentality, about building walls around communities as well as hearts and minds.<br/><br/>And what could be the solution to this problem? Is hard to believe that the solution could come from the top, as once installed in a position of power, elites are unlikely to relinquish that position willingly. Then, just as the problem, the solution could only come from the grass roots, from the rank-and-file people, more exactly with people realizing the trap they have fallen into. These people manage to find their true self through a painful and dangerous introspection. Afterwards, they break down the imaginary walls built around their hearts and minds and also smash the walls around their societies.<br/><br/>The discussion about the defensive mentality and its consequences, have covered the main philosophical, political and motivational themes of this movie. It is an example of a movie that sinks its teeth in a theme and never lets go until it is done with it. This way it has a chance to actually transmit something to the viewers. The rest is action and suspense, sensuality and special effects meant to sell this ""masterpiece"", which by the way is well made."

","While I haven't read the best selling book 'Divergent' by Veronica Roth, I was quite amused and baffled by the comments from individuals mentioning how the movie doesn't capture all that's there in the book and of various other dis-similarities between the book and the movie. After all, the movie is based on the book and not a replica of the book.<br/><br/>Divergent, the movie, is directed by Neil Burger who is known for his films The Illusionist and Limitless is about choosing a faction as defined by the futuristic society and survival in the respective faction. The movie has Shailene Woodley who plays Tris, Theo James playing Four, Ashley Judd playing Tris' mother and Kate Winslet plays Jeanine who is the head of one of the factions called Erudite.<br/><br/>Apparently, there was a war and Chicago was the only place that was saved which led to formulation of a society that is divided into five factions - Abnegation the selfless, Dauntless the brave, Erudite the intelligent, Candor the honest, and Amity the peaceful. As per the rule prevailing in the society, when all teenagers reach the age of 16, they have to undergone a simulation that would help them understand which faction do they belong to. However, each individual is free to chose his/her faction and the same choice can't be changed later whatsoever. Tris' parents are under Abnegation wherein her dad is a close aide to the President of the society. On the day of the test, Tris learns that she doesn't belong to any faction and hence is ""Divergent"" however she must guard this secret with her life or else she will pay for it with her life. Tris, much to her parent's surprise, choses to be a Dauntless and then initiates a daunting journey for Tris.<br/><br/>Dauntless are hard, demanding, emotionless (well mostly) and tough to the core. Tris has to become dauntless, both physically and emotionally. She meets Four there who is the instructor at Dauntless and with this team he makes sure that the new recruits 'earn' their place in the faction or else they shall be faction-less. What follows is a fast paced and an exhilarating journey for Tris and her friends to be above the line and eventually become officially Dauntless. The journey is incredibly tough with hardcore training, merciless fighting sequences and some dare-devil acts.<br/><br/>Neil Burger couldn't have picked up a better cast as each character is perfect for his/her role and makes you believe their part. Shailene Woodley understands her transition from Beatrice to Tris and plays it without a flinch. Theo James is what he is supposed to be; arrogant, rude, serious, tough and kind, probably all of these at once. Kate Winslet has a smaller screen time but she delivers it with panache and with such poise and ease that you want to see more of her. She as Jeanine is absolutely cunning, shrewd and witting to put Abnegation down and have Erudite be the rulers. Casting Winslet as a sweet villain is one of the best decisions by Burger. The movie is full of pumped up dialogues and jaw dropping sets. Cinematography is brilliant with capturing incredible frames with excellence.<br/><br/>I keep hearing statements like 'Divergent' is a different version of 'Hunger Games'. Well let me break it up for you - it's NOT just like not every ship sinking movie is not Titanic.<br/><br/>I am excited to learn that a sequel will be in place by 2015 but I am sad to learn at the same time that Neil Burger won't be directing it because he insists on been given amply and adequate time frame to bring 'Insurgent', the sequel, to life and the makers are not willing to provide the same. I echo Woodley's thoughts when she says, ""It was weird, he was the leader of this entire pack, and he created this world, he dreamt it up, he made all of the executive decisions. It was strange to think that somebody else is going to come over and take it on.""<br/><br/>My recommendation - go watch Divergent for brilliant performances and excellent execution."
"gmd4462-623-52926","6","1","3","19 April 2014"," Divergent or Deviant?
","I usually judge how engaging a movie is by how many times I look at my watch while it is playing. For Divergent, it was four. (Four! Really!) It's not boring, exactly. It's justÂ…meh. Despite the exciting music, high-value production and characters that pant and strain and STARE intensely, there just isn't much to go on here. The book was better because it had WORDS, and Veronica Roth is a pretty good writer (unlike certain other dystopian blockbuster authors I could think of). The movie exposes the story's basic weaknesses: a paper-thin premise and too few interesting characters (when one dies I can't even remember which one it was.) Moreover, we've seen this storyline so often before that we can practically write it ourselves. But Divergent delivers in some important areas: A-list actors, a kick-ass teen male hero (with beautiful tattoos!), some pretty cool action sequences, a great soundtrack, and Shailene Woodley, one of the few young actresses who really can carry a movie by herself. Four, of course, is practically perfect in every way: teen boys, if you want to know what girls want, GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Just grow muscles, have an old-fashioned sense of honor, be protective but don't be a chauvinist, be good at EVERYTHING but also have a deep psychological wound that a girl can help you overcome. Simple."

","In a world divided by factions based on virtues, a young teenager named Tris is learning that she's a Divergent and won't fit in any factions. When she discovers a plot in order to destroy Divergents, Tris and Four must find out what makes Divergents dangerous before it's too late.<br/><br/>Fans will be pleased as Divergent is actually working well on the big screen and people who didn't read the book are easily drag into this both dark and really realistic world as well. Neil Burger did some good direction choices; Artistic direction and special effects are great. The two and a half hour run time of the film was not unbearable, mostly thanks to Tris character and an interesting plot. On the one hand, Tris' character starring the neo-Jlaw: Shailene Woodlay is ambitious as we're able to see, due to how the movie is shot, her external ad internal experience as well. We got to see how she becomes so strong through the film. On the other hand, Four (Theo James) is a sort of mysterious military leader but everything change when he meets Tris and fall in love with her, his character opens up progressively. Plus, Jeanine played by our beloved Kate Winslet, believes that the rigidity of the factions maintains peace. She knows as thus everyone, that there is such a thing as the Divergents and that those people are messing with the purity of the factions. She wants to exterminate them. Divergent belongs to teen movies, such as Hunger Games (hard not to link both of them) and many more. Combats made Hunger Games looked fake and pointless. But it's not only a franchise piece or a teen novel full of action scenes. I feel like there's so much more than that. I mean a concept; We as human being, we all want to come from somewhere, count for something, be true to who we are, to follow a path we chose. For instance, Four back tattoos are symbolic of what he intends to be. Each one of us went through idealistic questions, and I am not afraid to say that is tough work. This film is dealing with very important values. <br/><br/>Overall, it seems like every popular books nowadays, especially if it's a book series targeting young adult, is being turn into a movie franchise but actually what's most surprising is that it's not that bad. Don't miss it!"
"evxsilvx","7","1","3","9 April 2014"," Amazing
","I have read the book, and the movie makes justice to it. But there were also things I didn't like about it, such as: 1. In the book, Tris is 16 and Four is 18. In the film though, Tris is 18 and Four is 24. The difference between the actor's ages is too big. 2. There should have been a scene, after the Aptitude Test, where Tris was walking back home and saw a group of factionless. A factionless man approached her and said something like ""Choose wisely"". This didn't happen and it should've. 3. After she chose between the beef and the knife (at the Aptitude Test) there was another test where a man asked her if she knew the person in the picture he was holding. She said that she didn't, even though she felt like she did. So the first test ruled out Amity and the second ruled out Candor.<br/><br/>But the movie was still great because: 1. Most of the characters were EXACTLY like they were described in the book. 2. The relation between Tris and Four/Tobias wasn't too romanticized, which allows her to be the center of the story, and Tobias to develop as a character. 3. Most of the scenes were the same as in the book. 4. The movie itself was simply amazing. Most of the things were well done, the characters had the chance to be independent, the soundtrack was really well chosen and the faction's wardrobe was very well combined with their personalities."
"alexcomputerkid","7","1","3","2 April 2014"," Treat Divergent as another version of The Hunger Games, then it works.
","After the success of the first Harry Potter movie that later that spawned a very successful series of movies or the Twilight movies that made big money off the "" teenage vampires and humans in love"" theme, it has become more and more common each year for the studios to look for successful teen novels that could spawn a film series. It does come at some risk though as a film like Vampire Academy from this year was a bomb and critically panned followed by a cancelled series. This was a prime example of a film based on a teen novel-based film that didn't quite work and there are other examples.<br/><br/>Being not a reader of the Divergent book series, I was clueless as to what Divergent was all about. Based off the popular teen novel written by Veronica Roth, Divergent is a three part trilogy with two spin-off mini stories on e-books. In total, this series could be possibly five films and by judging from strong box office from it's first week, you wonder what kind of money how much a movie series like this could make or how long it could last.<br/><br/>Based in the future in a dystopian society in Chicago, Divergent's setting is a world where everyone is put into specific factions based on their own virtues. Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) learns that she is a ""divergent"", an extremely rare condition in which a person can't be assigned due to one faction because she has the attributes of many factions. Divergents are considered threatening by the government because they are free-thinkers who cannot be controlled by the government. Later after Tris puts herself into Dauntless, a faction of people based on courage, it becomes evident that the main faction leader Jeannie Matthews (Kate Winslet) is planning to kill any divergent that they can identify. Tris must find herself, fight her enemies and learn to survive all at the same time.<br/><br/>Like The Hunger Games and other sci-fi films, I am always interested in seeing a dystopian society if done right. Shot in Chicago, this dystopian setting offers real some cool shots of the city including Navy Pier and Michigan Avenue. Most of the film interior sets are placed in what seems to be abandoned warehouses which gives the film a different and hollow atmosphere. This dystopian society of Chicago is enclosed by a big wall and it seems as if this government wants it's people to be held up within the walls forever. The movie gives no hints as to why the city is walled up or what is beyond the walls and you really would hope a sequel will give some type of explanation on this. Still though, the setting here is a strength of the film.<br/><br/>With yet another correlation to Hunger Games, rising star, Shailene Woddley works as the young adult lead who's trying to rise up against this society and who you do root for. Her instructor for Dauntless, Four Eaton (Theo James) is both a mean and likable character and a romantic relationship eventually develops between the two. The chemistry between them is not there at first but it eventually falls into place. Peter (Miles Teller) is the mean member of Dauntless and you can say the only cast member who brings humor to the story. Divergent has a big cast filled with a lot of depth and emotions from the characters.<br/><br/>Where the idea of ""training"" as Hunger Games was only a small aspect of that movie, one of the main themes of Divergent is training. The training is often brutal as we see many people trying to get into Dauntless who did not get to a certain level and then were thrown into the streets. Much of the training is people fighting one on one and further you are tested on your fears. For example, to even enter the training building, you have to jump down a big hole in a building where you do not know what is below.<br/><br/>Unlike the Harry Potter movies or The Hunger Games, this is a much more dark film based on a teen novel. The overall tone is quite dark with a suicide and an attempted sexual assault depicted among other things. This might not be some of the most fun things to watch but it does add variety and possibly brings a slightly different audience to Divergent than some of the other teen films mentioned earlier.<br/><br/>Divergent can be very long and also tiresome at points. It also has some lack of originality but there is still a lot to like here. Treat Divergent as another version of The Hunger Games, then it works."

""In a world divided by factions based on virtues, Tris learns she's Divergent and won't fit in. When she discovers a plot to destroy Divergents, Tris and the mysterious Four must find out what makes Divergents dangerous before it's too late."" Lets be honest act two is practically non existent here with story that seems to not really developed well. ""Divergent"" is a mixture of ""Hunger Games"", ""The Host"" with elements of ""Ender's Game"". The whole time as the audience we are waiting for a story to take a bigger, more epic dimension but it does not go there. It is all introduction, but were in ""Hunger Games"" we bond with all the characters, here we feel indifferent and that is not good. The climax feels not well executed story wise. The romance element works well but ultimately is not enough in full spectrum of the films otherwise flat s/f movie to safe it. The acting performances are solid but the material here is not very challenging for someone like Ashley Judd to give the best of herself. There is some symbology here after nuclear war the rest of humanity is divided in to 5 fractions symbolizing virtues but indirectly 5 elements including "" Aether"" the spirit/life force that connects all the other elements together. By you choosing one of the fractions you choose to live your life according to it's doctrine. Being 'Divergent' is not being able to fit to non of the fractions and therefore being automatically excluded out of the perfect public ecosystem. The premise seems to be more appealing then the actual execution. ""Divergent"" can comfortably be a DVD rental. Bottom line there were other movies with similar concepts which were better executed.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews please go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique"

Though the movie can't go into detail like the book, I would still have liked to see 'how' Erudite and Dauntless leadership came to their agreement which set-up the climactic final act of the movie. How did E convince D to use the soldiers to upset the faction balance? Kind of left hanging there. Does the book provide details about their relationship/agreements???

"gaussgoat","7","2","12","23 March 2014"," Neil Burger gets the important things right.
","As a parent who has been taken into some fairly painful movies, I wasn't sure what to expect with Divergent. I absolutely loved Neil Burger's Limitless, so I was really hoping that he was going to not inflict too much pain on me here. Fortunately for me, and very happily for my daughter, Mr Burger has delivered a solid film that, while it doesn't shatter any expectations, does a nice job of bringing the material to life.<br/><br/>Divergent's strongest elements are the wonderfully actualized setting of post-apocalyptic Chicago, and the strength of the varied cast, particularly our young leads. Woodley and James do admirable work as the Heroine and Hero of the film, and I think there is some legitimate chemistry between these two. Burger does a nice job of understating things early on, but showcasing a growing bond between the two as the film progresses.<br/><br/>There are some truly great moments on screen throughout. Divergent could have been an utter bomb with the amount of personal soul-searching that goes on, but through an admirable combination of pacing, character development, and fine detailed world building, Divergent never gets too preachy for its own good.<br/><br/>There are a few weak moments here and there. The film definitely has a bit of bad-guy monologuing, and you have to wonder where the hell the scene that defined some nefarious back room dealings was, particularly with the star power in this movie. Some exposition at the end is a little uninspiring, and some of the plot is not what one would call a twist.<br/><br/>Rough spots aside, the great moments well outweigh the bad. The movie also really steers away from any kind of brutal violence of any kind, as this is easily one of the best PG-13 movies I could recommend for parents in ages. In addition, Woodley's Tris is a wonderful heroine for girls. Tough, complicated, smart, and she doesn't give up.<br/><br/>Go ahead and take the family to this one, you won't be disappointed. It may not win best picture in 2014, but Divergent delivers where it needs to and is definitely entertaining."

"ladytrol","9","1","4","1 June 2018"," Much better than Hunger Games (that's why I'm writing review)
","(sorry for my bad English, I am Serbian) 
I gave this movie high score, because I was annoyed with low score and bad comparison with the Hunger Games trilogy, so although I don't think that this movie deserves score 9 when comparing to all kinds of movies especially classics, I think it deserves score 9 when comparing to similar movies
...ok, here is a brief comparison of the both movies which are the first in their trilogies. First of all, the Divergent has much more better plot, much more interesting story, the world is post apocalyptic - not only post- war like in Hunger Games, and these are first things that come to mind. Second, the chemistry between the characters is excellent in Divergent, and although great team of actors plays in the Hunger Games, their chemistry and excellent acting doesn't really have a good story to tell. Although the Divergent has pretty predictable love story (that is not so relevant to me, I find many mistakes in other places concerning some practical problems) and some other problems that annoy me like : why no one investigates murder attempt on Tris, and how could she be expelled from her fraction after the fight when she wasn't give up or surrender herself, after she had all those points which ranged her up? The actresses are both very very talented, and although I love Jennifer Lawrence, I must say that Shaileen Woodley is far more better (or maybe the character itself is more suggestible) in the Divergent, than Lawence is in Hunger Games. 
The camera is far better in the Divergent because in the Hunger Games 1, the camera is so nervous and moving that it's really annoying the eye of the viewer (when the movie is action, there is no need for this ''nervous''camera)...
Although the Hunger Games has more critical implications on this our world of today (the critic of the reality shows, society differences and most of all, the horrible dictatorship and all of its wickedness) - in that matter both movies are not so comparable - since the Divergent is placed in the post apocalyptic world of tomorrow - which seems to be in some, more or less, justice and order. 
These are the reasons why am I so annoyed with comparing these two franchise. 
The other thing I must say is that The Divergent reminds me on the Twilight trilogy in many ways. For both of them I am very sorry that they are basically MADE FOR TEENAGERS, with lots of juvenile moments and commonplaces, and with illogical mistakes (the Divergent) and much more ''girly'' moments (the Twilight) but what can I say, the writers of the books did it that way so the movies probably couldn't go far from that. 
The Bottom line is: the Divergent is very good action movie, with interesting post appocalyptic world (some kind of mixture of the movies Gattaca and Brave New World book , and some moments from Equilibrium - by far more mature movies or better written novels) but which has appealing atmosphere, at least for me. You will certainly have much more fun watching the Divergent tha the HUnger Games!"

I like how they changed some things to make the movie a little different than the book. The soundtrack was perfect, however I noticed that they tried to squeeze in the crazy scenes that happened in the book into the movie. Also, I didn't like that, in the movie, Four doesn't tell Tris to call him Tobias, as he does in the book because when he tells her to call him by his real name, he's giving her a part of him that he doesn't want anyone else to have.

I'd imagined it as a small recording-booth like setup. With an office on one side and the simulation room on the other. The rooms were separated by one way glass/mirror, and Tris was unable to see the people monitoring the test, though they could see her. Other than that, I loved the film. Shailene and Theo did an amazing job of portraying Tris and Four. I'm excited and looking forward to seeing 'Insurgent' with my book club."

","Divergent is just another teen book to film translation that only a person under 17 could care about, written by a woman in her first novel attempt and boy it shows.<br/><br/>I have not read the book but if the film is any indication of the plot it must have been a bad read too.<br/><br/>This story is so dull through the first hour I was begging for it to end. Nothing happened and I found myself laughing and rolling my eyes at the corny plot. The acting is wooden and you can see what's coming next by a mile.<br/><br/>As with a lot of modern books and movies aimed at teens this one is full of nonsensical rules that people need to follow. You are born into a caste system, but then you can't choose another, and if you fail to succeed you are cast out to be a homeless person?? And if you choose different from your families group you can't see them again? Ridiculously silly stuff. Mass mind control?? <br/><br/>The rule in today's teen movies like the Hunger Games, Harry Potter, etc is that anything goes no matter how inane and out of place. The physical challenges and mind/drug inducing is amazingly unreal. Girls fighting guys twice their size bare fisted?<br/><br/>Isn't a divergent the same as everyone today? Don't we all have multiple skills and desires? I can imagine the 14 year old girls coming out of this movie thinking ""I'm so divergent"" because I play soccer and I like silly novels about the future."

","One of the best movies of 2014! Went to see him twice, and that happens not much. Really recommend this one, original story and great actress! Shailene Woodley is not the typical Hollywood actress and that makes it even better to watch. I also became a great fan of Theo James, an actor I didn't notice in the movies he played in that I have watched before. Great concept, leans a lot toward my own thoughts about life sometimes. Normally I don't like to watch movies in this genre but this one surprised me. Fingers crossed for a sequel. I saw the movie before reading the books. But it definitely triggered me so if I find the time I'm sure going to read them as well."
"mollypocket14","9","1","4","24 April 2014"," One of the best movie based flicks in a while
","The film is a fast paced action packed fun flick. Lots of one liners that really show the personalities of each character. Most impressed with Theo James as Four, also Shailene Woodley was the best Tris for those novel readers who may be questioning. However, some of the narration and choices of what was explained and what not was questionable. For example, I did not initially like the scene with Tris as a young girl, but thinking back -I believe it is good setup for people who did not read the book. However, the scene with Tris on the roof in Abnegation was pointless to everyone. I believe readers will all nitpick but the best part is how the feel of the movie matched the feel of the book. The lighting was good, and the Dauntless compound wasn't dark with blue lighting -which was my fear based on the description in the book. I was also glad to see that the setting all matched what I had in mind.

","I absolutely loved it, but I haven't read the book. I tried reading it a couple times but never got that into it. But now I will definitely try again! I loved Trice and Shailene Woodley! I watched her in the Secret Life on abc family but she didn't have the most likable character. In Divergent, she was great and totally changed my opinion on her. She was good at being Trice and her and Four were so cute together! I was literally cringing my friends hand in the theatre!!!! When her mom was shot, which was predictable, her crying was genuine and great for acting. The plot was your typical dystopia but still great and A+ material. People may compare it to the Hunger Games but there is no reason to. There are many more dystopia movies coming and book series like the Uglies, and Matched. Also I found the plot very understandable, like it was clear enough even if you haven't read the books. And the supporting characters did a great job also! Miles Teller really annoyed me which was good because that was exactly what his character was meant to do, and so did the actor who played Eric! I was super excited when Trice ran after the train and won capture the flag. I loved how Four was afraid of heights!!! I knew it though before he said it!"

"marieosuna8","9","1","4","13 April 2014"," Divergent is an awesome flick all the way around.
","Prior to watching this film, I had little knowledge of the plot and any other details for that matter. The director behind this book adaption, Neil Burger, is what attracted me to see it. And wow, can I say that I am glad I did. The essence of the story line is slow to come at the start of the film, especially for someone who hasn't read the novels. But soon enough, you learn of the 5 factions or in other words, the segregated groups of their society that encompass the story. The intense dilemma surfaces from there. <br/><br/>The setting in Chicago's metropolis and the rural community separated by a massive fence is presented very convincingly. The five factions, Abnegation, Erudite, Candor, Amity, and Dauntless are the only people who inhabit the city. Each is dramatically different from the other in just about every way. What struck me the most and perhaps what made the film so engaging, is how it essentially mirrored real life society. As viewers, we can all relate to a level of separation in our society, but instead ours pointing to other factors such as economic status, education level, or race. That concept alone drew in my interest. The action all kicks off when the lead character Beatrice is tested for her faction. Every individual is born and raised in the faction of their parents until the age of sixteen when they are tested. The intense testing experience results in identifying what faction they truly belong to. Once she receives the rare and hugely controversial results of ""Divergent"", a slew of action packed events soon follow. <br/><br/>Lead characters, ""Beatrice"" and ""Four"" also provide an element of romance that enhances the story instead of dominating it. It is important in action films like this to find a good balance when incorporating romance. I also personally liked that the actors chosen for these characters, as well as for the rest of the film were unfamiliar. It helped us viewers' focus on the story itself and not on a famous face. These fresh faces portrayed the characters convincingly as they seemed to perfectly fit the roles they were playing. Beatrice especially, underwent a transformation from a selfless, innocent member of Abnegation to a fearless, strong member of Dauntless. The costume choices were also an important element. Each faction's differences were displayed well in the opposite styles of costumes they wore. For example, the Dauntless wore darker shades and tougher materials like leather. This helped differentiate the groups and support the ideals that they each represented. <br/><br/>The extent of the gripping cinematic effects is most apparent in the faction testing processes. It transports the character to a world of their fears that is unlike anything else. Use of dramatic music and angles helps understand the extent of what they are experiencing. This encompassed some of the most action packed parts of the film. However, one complaint is the music utilized in slower scenes, which was primarily Elie Goulding. That is perhaps the only thing I found a bit unconvincing. Music without vocals might have been more fitting for these scenes, but that is just personal preference. <br/><br/>All in all it is a must see for any movie fan. It's unique plot sets it apart, especially with the repetitive story lines we seem to be surrounded with these days. Divergent is action packed, interesting, displays compelling acting performance, and is something a variety of people could enjoy. Because it is based on a novel trilogy, those fans are quick to judge this movie adaption. If you have read the book, try not to be so apt to harshly compare the two. Many are unimpressed, however it is important to focus on the overall quality of the film instead of how much it incorporates every element of the book. With such an elaborate story, it is virtually impossible to include everything in a two-hour time frame. If you are able do so, you will leave pretty satisfied with the result. I can definitely say that I am now eager to see what's in store for the next film."

","i think this was an excellent movie. i liked the hunger games but for me it wasn't the best movie, i like this movie a lot more ! got hooked and I'm probably going to read the book. cant wait for insurgent coming in 2015. Since the beginning to the end you get hooked, and it has a lot of action, romance. <br/><br/>a lot of people say that it excluded many things from the book and even though i have not read the book, this happens in most movies, you cant fit everything in a book in a movie, it would be too long, movies a books are different so read and see both of them!! it complements!! i really recommend this movie!! if you haven't seen it go to a theater near you!!!"
"watersprinkls","9","1","4","6 April 2014"," AMAZING! Completely sucked in. (& I read the books)
","WATCHED IT IN THEATERS TWICE! I really couldn't get over it. Was not disappointed. 2 hours and a half, really went by fast and wish it lasted longer. <br/><br/>When I first heard about this movie was when I saw a trailer last year, and this world just seemed so interesting and it completely captivated me. This hadn't happened to me in such a long time from a trailer, and I have good instincts of knowing a good movie (at least I'll know if I'll like it.) I really couldn't wait so I read the books. <br/><br/>Eh, in all honesty, I kinda do wish I hadn't read the books before I saw the movie OR at least had read it a long time ago and forgot every detail. Because every detail of the book was still fresh in my mind and I had imagined it a certain way without even noticing. I really couldn't help compare each scene to the book. It's okay though, the second time I didn't do that I just appreciated it as a movie<br/><br/>On that note, I think Theo James captured and portrayed Four P E R F E C T L Y. He did it in a way that I didn't imagine, so yes it was a little different, but he embodied the essence of Four's character, with every manner and mannerism. Shailene Woodley played Tris really well also! She was different from what I imagined, but at the same time, the same. <br/><br/>The actors are good, the production is good, the soundtrack is okay to me, but it wasn't bad or anything.<br/><br/>I REALLY LOVE THIS MOVIE. Before I read the books I thought the romance would take away from the identity of the female character, like it would just become a romance film, but nope! They make each other stronger, and I kinda am in love with Four. It has a good an interesting plot & storyline, good action scenes, and funny moments. I think it's a really different and unique movie. I really would not compare the story to Hunger Games. I liked Hunger Games, read it too, but I think this is better. <br/><br/>My friends who hadn't read the book really loved it too (though they would've been slightly confused if I hadn't explained stuff, but I think they would've been okay), and some of my guy friends like it too. I know this doesn't represent everyone of the male gender, but hey I thought it's knowing a guy can like it too and they thought Four was cool.<br/><br/>I want the next movie to come out now!!! And I want this on DVD <3"

Sure she could go for fearless, tough? Take a punch tough? Not even close. A different problem but same vein, she spends 18 years of her life with no training, but in 10 weeks she rules. Guess that's the book, but lame. AND the big one, they just win. Knock out plan.

"Seraphion","6","2","14","22 March 2014"," A good franchise starter
","Divergent<br/><br/>Here comes a new post. Another movie review, on this week's highest buzz on the cinemas, Divergent. FYI, I haven't read the book as I write this review, but I just saw the movie just now, on the local theater, which I seldom do. <br/><br/>Looking at the buzz, not just from IMDb and movie sites, but also from my own community of colleagues, I think the title does worth a review.<br/><br/>So the story of the movie is another post apocalypse future of the real world. Everywhere else is presumably wiped out, all the way BUT Chicago. Yeah, you can bet that feels strange for me. Why Chicago? It eludes me why Chicago should be picked as the city surviving the apocalyptic war a hundred years earlier. So anyway, the society of Chicago is then divided into groups, Factions, based on the 5 basic dominant nature of humankind according to the author. This also bothers me, why only five? And after that, why THOSE five?....... okay, enough with it LOL, let's get back to the story. The five traits are intelligence, represented by the Erudite faction; justice, represented by Candar, kindness, represented by Amity; caring, represented by Abrigation; and last but not least bravery, represented by Dauntless. And then we go to the main protagonist, Beatrice, an Abrigation kid, who comes of age and has to choose her own faction freely. Before so she has to go through a test that will advice her what faction suits her best. But guess what, her test results are inconclusive, a Divergent as it's called. Beatrice's faction advice was Abrigation, Erudite, and Dauntless altogether. The test admin Tori then secretly sneaked her out, Divergents are considered dangerous to the society. She then chose to enter Dauntless, and change her name to Tris. It's a logical decision, in my opinion, that she chose Dauntless, even without her being aware of it as logical. Any unaligned behavior would be most tolerable within the Dauntless, which are tasked as soldiers and guards. She then goes through rigorous physical and strategic training. She had to strife well on the physicals, but she surpasses everyone else in collective strategic training. At the next step of training, which is supposed to be the hardest, mental test through hallucination of your biggest fears, she passes with ease, so easy that her instructor Four is suspicious. Four and Tris then get close, and they found out a plan of the smart Erudite wanting to overthrow the caring Abrigation from government. Four then is revealed to also be a Divergent hiding in the Dauntless. The finale is the Erudite manipulates the Dauntless using a chemical controlling agent. Tris and Four's identity as a Divergent is discovered, but they manage to escape death.<br/><br/>For me the cast is quite good, mixing in the seasoned ones with rising stars. After that sexy performance in ""The Spectacular Now"" Shailene Woodley is to proof to the cinema world that she can have a good franchise movie series. Theo James acts well enough for a newcomer in the big leagues. Same goes for Zoe Kravitz. Seniors as Ashley Judd, Tony Goldwyn and Kate Winslet adds flavor and appeal to the movie as a whole. Unfortunately their role dies out on this movie, since with that kind of ending, I'm sure there will be sequels.<br/><br/>The basic story is indeed very interesting, though indeed too imaginative. In reality, that kind of categorization of the society will not run at all. Logically a normal person will have more than one dominant nature within him or her, even from the five natures that were chosen as the story's faction natures. But then again it is indeed a very interesting story that is also developed well. The story twists are quite good, despite of them being a bit predictable, and the whole story being designed to appeal primarily to young adults.<br/><br/>The advanced development into screenplay is just average for me. The dialog and expressions don't really expand the basic story. But they are alright, in the way that it does just meet the limit to communicate the message of the scenes well enough.<br/><br/>The action sequence is just simple one-move stunts or scenes that are heavily manipulated through editing, making it relatively easy for the cast who are mostly without any previous background in movies of action or fighting. In my opinion the stunts are relatively simple because they are can be easily shoot in one take using multiple cameras in different angles to get the editing process easier and offer more perspective to the shot.<br/><br/>The fighting style is quite unique. It sports a new-to-the eye stance position. It is close, but not being to close, in launching attacks. In my opinion this addition compliments the movie greatly.<br/><br/>Being a movie about the future post-apocalypse world, costumes do play a big part in it. And costumes for ""Divergent"" doesn't fall into the disappointing category. Costumes for each faction at the same time matches the look for the respective factions and not being to hyperbolic. Touches of coloration is played well in the costumes section. Having the movie's tangible element for story emphasizing focused on the costumes, the makeup for the movie doesn't really have to stand out, just enough to depict the conditions of each faction. <br/><br/>For me the scoring for the movie doesn't really stand out. It is just there to fill out the audible moments. Yet the soundtrack contains many catchy contemporary musics. I hear tunes that sound like Emmy Rossum's songs, which are happening currently, a tune with some clubbing culture influence, but not being too much of a niche's music. The soundtracks are put beautifully into matching moments.<br/><br/>Overall, for me it's a good movie, but still is not as good as ""The Hunger Games"". From me, I give it a 6 out of 10 score, and a go-and-see- it recommendation."
"g-bodyl","9","1","5","4 March 2015"," Another Good Franchise Starter!
","To be quite frank, I enjoyed Divergent. I tried to read the book, but I was never able to finish reading the book. The movie is a better movie than I thought. I honestly don't get the comparisons between this and the Hunger Games other than the dystopian futures and a strong, female protagonist. They are both different stories and I enjoy each movie for different reasons. This movie doesn't feature strong romance and I like the fact how there are factions based off virtues, which I find intriguing. There are some cool action scenes and I also enjoyed the pretty effective visuals. <br/><br/>Neil Burger's film is about a girl named Tris Prior who was assigned to the Dauntless faction, or pretty much the army of the city. She has a dark secret in which she is divergent, or the ability to have all virtues. The government has a plan to wipe out all Divergents and Tris, along with the mysterious Four, must figure out why and how to stop them. <br/><br/>I believe that the cast did an excellent job. Shailene Woodley is a good, young actress and she played her role very well. Theo James actually made for a good Four and of course all the girls would be all over him. Jai Courtney, whom was bad in the last adaptation of Die Hard, delivers a stronger performance as the leader of Dauntless. Kate Winslet gives a malicious performance as the head government leader. Other standouts include Miles Teller and Ashley Judd. <br/><br/>Overall, Divergent is the beginning of what seems to be another profitable, young-adult franchise. I love the nature of the film and it is a better movie than book, which is often very rare. I was able to understand the concepts, thus making me more appreciative of them. Is this the best young-adult movie? Of course not, but I regard highly the value of it being fun and entertaining. I cannot way to see this story continue. <br/><br/>My Grade: A-"
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","5","27 March 2014"," A dry script leavened by one great actress
","It is nice, once in a while, to encounter an actor who doesn't have to scream to get noticed. That is a very rare quality that has all but disappeared in an age when actors feel the need to push full-force at us with cloying overconfidence. The best actors, in my opinion, are those who capture our imagination with ease, presenting themselves as if they are visiting the movie frame from the real world.<br/><br/>The actress Shailene Woodley is like that. At 22, she is diamond in the rough, a performer who projects intelligence and grace, yet possesses and upfront vulnerability that is comforting. Watching her, you feel like you're watching not only a real person, but one who is relatable. She is pretty, but not conventionally beautiful. She's smart, but not a know-it-all. Plus, unlike her contemporaries who all seem to be interchangeable clones of the same personality, you actually remember her. Check her out sometime as George Clooney's daughter in The Descendents (for which she won Best Supporting Actress at the Independent Spirit Awards) or as the sweet, level-headed girlfriend to a class clown in the perfect teen love story The Spectacular Now.<br/><br/>She has proved herself in down-to-earth dramas. Now the challenge for Shailene Woodley is to see if she can buoy a dry popcorn entertainment. That test comes in Divergent, an otherwise standard post-apocalyptic dystopian thriller that is not exactly original, but is brought out of the doldrums almost exclusively by Woodley's unforced performance.<br/><br/>Based on the best seller by Veronica Roth (which I haven't read), Divergent borrows the pattern of dozens of other post-apocalyptic thrillers, most prominently Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games (which I have read) and takes place in Chicago in an unspecified future when wars have allowed the government to separate the population into factions based upon their best personality traits: Abnegation (selflessness), Amity (kindness), Candor (honesty), Erudite (intelligence) and Dauntless (bravery). As teenagers, each member of the population gets to choose, through a series of tests, which faction they will join for the rest of their lives. Nearly everyone possesses one discernible trait. If they possess more than one of these traits they are called Divergent. This is a quality that the higher-ups don't desire for reason I won't reveal.<br/><br/>Up for the choosing process is Beatrice Prior (Woodley) who soon christens herself with the name Triss, and discovers that she must hide her Divergence. She's put into the Dauntless category and sent off to something that amounts to a military school. Needless to say, she's at the top of her class. Her training includes not only fisticuffs and sharp-shooting but also digging deep into her darkest fears (she has a thing about crows) to learn how to deal with them in combat.<br/><br/>You can guess that this is not the most original story in the world. It's out of that ancient formula of the weak kid who is put into a cruel boot camp and proves that she is not the runt of the litter. Of this, Shailene Woodley proves that she is more convincing using her brain than her fists. Yes, she's tough but there's something else about her that exists in her eyes. You don't feel in her supreme confidence. In other words, she acts her age.<br/><br/>She brings a welcome spark to a film whose function rests with Hollywood's current obsession with cranking out film versions of every moderately popular Young Adult novel currently in the hands of your local high school student with hopes of creating the kind of midnight door-buster fury that has previously accompanied The Hunger Games, Harry Potter and Twilight. Coming up, by the way, are adaptations of ""The Giver"", ""The Maze Runner"", ""Fallen"", ""Uglies"", ""Leven Thumps"", ""The Discovery of Witches"", ""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"", and ""The Fault in Our Stars"" which also stars Miss Woodley.<br/><br/>Of this overcrowded market Divergent is better than some but not as good as others. It has an interesting message about the importance of individuality and a warning about overblown government bent on keeping the ordinary citizen in its place. Kate Winslet comes into the picture as an executive who has some frighteningly reasonable excuses for keeping the population at bay. It's nice to encounter a script that has a point and not just a lot of kick dancing and crummy buildings. And with a natural talent like Shailene Woodley in the lead, it actually makes you look forward to what will come next."
"jdesando","Null","1","5","25 March 2014"," Good old-fashioned young adult thriller
","""You're different. You don't fit into a category. They can't control you. They call it Divergent."" Tori (Maggie Q)<br/><br/>Does Divergent diverge from the YA formula established by the Twilight series and fattened by the Hunger Games franchise? Not much. But I have to admit I was carried along by the interesting sci-fi story and solid performances of lead Shailene Woodley (Tris) and Theo James (Four). In other words, my intellect was teased by the allegory and my heart by the true romance. Divergent is just good old-fashioned young-adult storytelling that engages adults and teens at the same time.<br/><br/>Faced with making a choice of what category of five the teen chooses to belong to for a lifetime (Erudite, Candor, Amity, Dauntless, and Abnegation) Tris chooses the protector group Dauntless, while knowing she doesn't fit any (that's why she's ""Divergent"") group. Already you can see the author, Veronica Roth, has allegory in mind, viz., a caste system that freezes people forever in a category (surely a great fear of teenagers) and a social order that allows similarities to flourish but individuality not.<br/><br/>The Katniss of Divergent, Tris (shortened from Beatrice, an allusion, perhaps, to Dante's guide into hell), is not as glamorous as Katniss (but then that's relative since Jennifer Lawrence is not a classic beauty either), nor as skilled initially, but she has a reserve and humility, as well as interior demons, that can endear her to the audiences' sense of their own flawed humanity.<br/><br/>Like other young adult fiction, Divergent plays to teen fears and a societal concern about stifling individuality. By overcoming the former and becoming who she is meant to be for the latter, Tris embodies the ideals of a healthy democracy and individuality. And as Woodley plays her, a normal teen with normal hang-ups and some abnormal potential. Just don't buy into the airbrushed posters with her perfect bod—she's only fairly good looking and fairly flawed.<br/><br/>If that's not enough to get you to this actioner, see Kate Winslet play a bad Erudite named Jeanine—she's quite believable and quite different from her carefully framed persona of a simpering goodie. Wait. Wait. She is expressing her individuality as a talented actress. She's divergent!<br/><br/>""The system removes the threat of anyone exercising their independent will. Divergents threaten that system. It won't be safe until they're removed."" Jeanine (Kate Winslet)"
"socrates99","8","2","17","26 March 2014"," The New York Times review forced me to defend this film
","I did not read the book. But this movie makes me wish I had despite my not being in its target audience.<br/><br/>First of all, Divergent is a far better film than I expected. If you must compare it to the Hunger Games franchise, I think it holds up quite well for the simple reason it is clearly the more intelligent of the two. The idea of splitting society into five factions is brilliant and more than a little suggestive of reality. The key idea, that those who don't conform are dangerous, is practically sacred scripture in our society and with our security people in particular.<br/><br/>Second, the two leads are impeccable choices, Shailene Woodley and Theo James do a great job. Ms Woodley captures your interest and evokes more feeling than most actresses do in their entire careers. And Mr James moves as convincingly as a trained martial arts star and is easy to imagine as a leader.<br/><br/>That said the first half is much better than the second where the movie devolves a bit into a much more run of the mill story. I can understand why it would given the demands of the market, but I was so pumped by the first half I was more than willing to forgive. It made me wonder what the novel was like especially when I read beforehand that the novel was written by a woman. <br/><br/>I have never read anything written by a woman as unexpected as this movie's setup. The specific territory I'm referring to, paramilitary training, is almost never gotten even half right by women. There's a better understanding of it here than most men have especially because most men haven't seen military service. For once the female lead is not treated as some superwoman. Tris, the heroine, is knocked down and bloodied as a real woman would be and the focus on courage is something else I was glad to see properly addressed.<br/><br/>For a teenage girl this is going to be a special event. I highly recommend it for them all, even if they haven't yet read the novel. As for everyone else, all I can say is I enjoyed it. And I know for me the name Veronica Roth, its author, is now one I'm not likely to ignore."

There was too much supernatural soap opera going on the last couple of years, it's the time for something much less smooching and much more plot than chasing shirtless hotties. And here it comes - yes undeniably the romance is still on, but so far much more clean and painless. Beside that, the story offers some the food for thought, the point being how you build your character when you are young and how the choices make us who we are. It is to be argued if Tris is more or less or the same level of complexity as Katniss but definitely there is much less darkness to her than to the Hunger games' heroine and I must say this is very likable. So the story is quite real to keep you invested throughout the whole 2h of it. The end is nice though not much of a cliffhanger for the next movie. But the cast delivers quite engaging performance so you would love to see them again. I really enjoyed the progress of Shailene Woodley after ""The spectacular now"" and I believe there are more great performances from her to come. The rest of the cast was charming as well - very hateble villains, very reliable boyfriend, dedicated friends and above all - marvelous bad, bad, bad Kate Winslet. Enjoy this new series and don't forget - the easy way tends not be the right one."

","This movie raises one difficult question - and that is, whether the book version or its adaptation was worse. It is comparable to Twilight, albeit the dystopic environment made the plot a bit more interesting - that is, of course, until you start actually thinking about it. This is mostly the book's fault, as it is not particularly well written.
The movie itself is hard to rate, as it bring almost nothing new or innovative. The cinematography and the acting are basic to say at best.
It also has its good points - for example, former teens can see how much they have matured since liking this in their youth."

In a film scene permeated by movies such as The Hunger Games and The Maze Runner (which is easily a superior series of books), Divergent lacks the appeal of the other two by not having characters that seem real."

","Despite what most people think this is nothing like ""The Hunger Games."" Are there similarities? Yes, but there are also similarities to the Giver and I don't hear people calling plagiarism on that. While some of the dialogue is a bit cliche, and it felt like I'd seen some of the movie before, as a whole, I enjoyed it. They could have chosen a better actress for the main character, Tris, because at times it feels like Shailene Woodley is not delivering the dialogue as she should be. Sometimes she sounds bored, and sometimes she overacts, but Kate Winslet portraying the evil leader of their post-apocalyptic world saves it because she's almost as creepy as Donald Sutherland's portrayal of President Snow in the Hunger Games. I enjoyed the subtle bits of humor sprinkled throughout what is otherwise a dark film. The first hour or so was a bit slow, but the third act was great. I was really enthralled by Hans Zimmers' score, and the electronica music inserted here and there, even though it makes no sense to have it there. I have never read the books (and don't plan to because I want to be surprised) but still enjoyed the film. This is one YA novel film adaptation series I hope succeeds.

","This movie was torture to watch. This teenage dystopian plot have been done before and better.

I don't even remember the plot anymore. Plus there's hardly any action and the few fight scenes are boring. I certainly had no interest in the sequels after sitting through this. I would give this a pass. There are much better movies in a similar vein like the Maze Runner series which is much more interesting with a better story and much more action and mystery. The main problem with this movie is the weak story and slow pacing where too much of its runtime is wasted on training which adds no suspense and no story but also the fights lack excitement. I think this was trying to be the new Hunger Games which is better IMO but I didn't particularly enjoy that either though I've only seen the second chapter."

If I think of twenty things to get someone to do something and even mention one outlet for her not to do so if that one is her wish even with only a 51 to 49 % advantage she'll probably just take that one outlet if she replies at all. This leads to a quick next thought. Not once in any fashion have I ever gotten a direct reply trying to intro or not much next after thoughts with electronic communication to the girl. Some responses of any kind have been detected by me but those ways currently are next to impossible for me to detect. Dating services of any fashion lead nowhere. I did get one response once about 7 years before the Internet existed joining a $700 plus dating service giving a in person application that lead to a car drive and a bar date. That was about the last time I think I had a date. Previous to that I had my share but this letter isn't a review of my life. The number one rule nowadays is that the girl must be lifetime money self sufficient living anywhere. That leads just about everyone out. Only 1 in 1000 are that way and the actresses of any fashion be it over twenty of them who weren't one of the 1 in 1000 used slut entertainment thoughts involving me to be a 1 in a 1000 self money sufficient person but the sad movie or singer concept to that is none of those girls thought that sharing their wealth with me was a requirement or even a intro one in person date let alone my preferred minimun requirement thought of 25 dates. So it's understood outthinking their thoughts of what is best for them or what they want or what they are willing to do is at least in my case impossible to outthink or even partially persuade. I'll just say the difference between me and you girl (any girl) is if the girl approached me by mail or in person giving her contact number she'd have to say next to nothing for me to reply if she was attractive and money self sufficient. But for those that weed out hundreds of suitors per day I've never known any of them to focus and when they focus their focus leads nowhere however public popular. I was going to write about 20 reasons why girls are into idiots but this email is already too long. You can though in the immediate future reach me at johniverson4@peoplepc.com There's my contact. Need I say again the difference between me and you girl (any girl). The sad fact is 9 out 10 movie concepts are light years from this letter style with many much more so than others yet those sort that yet detect me feel there is some sort of invite to them when there isn't. I could write pages about how mentally ill I would get getting involved with them. But this letter concept is not looking for dismissal with me and IMDb. I sort of had Ashley Judd in mind when writing this being more positive than negative but more or less focus writing to a star is banned here. Personally it's been decades when getting annoyed by people it's by those you can't find however immediate the interpretation and with I don't even know if they qualify for I wouldn't want to know you or them even if I did. Biggest mistake in writing these emails is if you know that any response if at all will lead you to get mentally ill if I involve myself hundreds of times over with them and not much else especially in money concept or marriage dating then why try at all from the get go. Even at the best if a romantic attitude is established it will probably only be done in some group thought fashion and will having nothing to do with being a couple. That's about the only way current Hollywood fashion stays in fashion. I current thought about Ashley is I'm over 50% positive on my approach to her but there is too she'd have to really a lot kiss my over a long time in person for me to really fall.

","An adaptation of a bestseller by Veronica Ruth, Divergent is a dystopian YA novel where the population is split into factions based on their attributes. The five factions are: Abnegation, the pious; Erudite, the smart ones; Amity, the peace lovers; Candor, the honest, and Dauntless, the brave ones who are in essence the city's police.<br/><br/>Our heroine is Tris, who joins Dauntless after the being brought up by her parents in Abnegation. This is after tests are conducted (think Hogwarts Sorting Hat) to determine which faction candidates would be best suited to, and hers are revealed to be- as you can work out from the title- Divergent i.e. having attributes from multiple factions. The factions have been set up to retain order in the city and thus, ""Divergents"" undermine the system and must be eliminated. I can't fully get on-board with this idea though as I find it puzzling that the vast majority of the population can have just one attribute. What's stopping one from being- God forbid- smart *and* peace-loving? Dauntless also spend a lot of the time jumping around and being a parody of parkour enthusiasts.<br/><br/>The social commentary is weak in comparison to the Hunger Games and it borrows narrative elements from the superior Ender's Game.

A lot of the film can feel natural, even though such as The Pit is rather different to the book.<br/><br/>The film makers / director are / is, not surprisingly, very visually orientated rather than technically orientated and to me this is the root of the main problems that I experience in Divergent the film. To fully experience most features films one has to suspend disbelief, which can take a bit of work. Mostly with Divergent I find it easy to suspend disbelief, but I had not read the novels for about a year prior to my first viewing.<br/><br/>With the feature Super 8, the train crash is deliberately visually orientated to an unreal extent and its commentary says why. Divergent: My biggest problem, first viewing, was the zip line ride from the Hancock building. Visuals gone wild at the expense of reality. Try such a ride in even a less windy city would be asking to get smeared on the buildings that are passed. Building such a ride would not be so easy for such a society, either. Yet the novels feel very real in their depictions of the ride. The Abnegation underwear of Tris, a more humorous piece of unreality.<br/><br/>There are plenty of other parts of the story where the visuals are too hotted up for my taste, becoming unreal, but to point to them can easily get in the way of appreciation of the film.<br/><br/>I get the descriptor 'delicious' from that magnificent second childhood story Ramona And Beezus."

The setting starts out showing all the tall buildings in ruin then the colorful fashion of each faction Candor being black and white, Abnegation gray, Dauntless black, Erudite blue, and Amity red and yellow. Veronica Roth's ideal principle shared the different types of personality traits that coexists in all of us and the many ways we show, express, and model it. Personality the combination of characteristics or qualities that form an individual's distinctive character helps people observe and reflect a persons behavior and the instincts they have. <br/><br/>After I finished the book I took the quiz and resulted in being divergent in three of the factions like Tris–I tested in  Abnegation, Dauntless, and Erudite because of all my traits put together. For a couple of months I thought of this all the time but now I see how these factions impacted me through life. While I admired the fact that I'm selfless, brave, and intelligent compared to Veronica Roth's Tris Prior in Divergent I thought a lot about my strengths, values, and accomplishments since. Sometimes I would imagine life in the faction system dedicated to hard work and trying to fit in but though I find myself wondering why divergence isn't allowed in society while others know what exactly they are. Some have a combination of many factions but nevertheless would we as people understand that we are improving everyday.<br/><br/>I see myself in many shades of gray, a little aquamarine in Erudite and as always black as Dauntless, somehow I manage to fit in various factions rather being in one category  that makes up a person.

I must say and dare say the first part is rather nice, and a thrilling piece of work to watch. Yeah, there are weaker moments, too. What many have already mentioned before, the plot is at times terribly predictable, and you can easily tell the next twist before it even happens. Is it so bad? Yes, as it turns a movie a bit sour. No, as it does not spoil the whole movie. The video effects are very spellbinding and the lush soundtrack proves to be a pretty strong point. But still, many, many characters beg for deeper portrayal and a better explanation. Sometimes, some elements seem to be a bit shallow and not that persuasive, it just happens and you have to go with it. I say, this movie should be watched and will be enjoyed, but a second try? I am not sure so much."

I did not know the books were better, so will buy them when I go to the US. Hopefully the follow-up of the 2nd one will have been printed because I want to know what the divergents are going to do. Am hoping Divergent 3 will come out soon. Sometimes movies do not have to be academy award material, but just plain and simple fun and entertainment and this one that projects you into a world that you could think might be what the future looks like.

"khaktus","9","0","1","23 June 2015"," The best queer science-fiction (alternative perspective)
","While not the most appreciated and perhaps not the most innovative, breathtaking or technically exquisite, Divergent series have become my favorite science-fiction & distopia on screen in the recent decade.<br/><br/>What rings my personal bell is unintended parallel to a topic, that was never before ""discussed"" on screen. There is an old tradition in native American tribes of two-spirited people. If a boy (or girl) in his/her early pre-teenage years did not show required characteristics of its own gender, a ceremony was held to find out what are his inclinations. If a boy chose weaving utensils or girl went for the bow&arrows, he was considered a two-spirit - that is having male and female spirit in one body. These people were not punished, condemned or persecuted - they were considered quite important for the survival of the tribe. Having both male and female characteristics, they were believed to possess talents to bridge the world of men and women, settle the disputes, harmonized them. As much as bridge between material and spiritual worlds - they have become healers, shamans, storytellers, organizers of the ceremonies.<br/><br/>Even if this traditional role was not considered ""sexual orientation"", but it was gender based (""third and fourth sex""), it nicely translates into contemporary language. While straight people are naturally more competitive, self-centered (me, my wife, my kids, my family) and also they are much more prone to become specialists (they tend to excel in one thing, but are often narrowly focused on this one domain only, without much understanding of the importance of the others ... they are experts always competing with the other experts ""who's better""), queer energy is more generalist, cooperative, inclusive, seeing bizarre interconnections between various topics, seeing things from the perspective, a ""bigger picture"". Hence - the harmonizers, the bridge between worlds, the glue among the professions. There are more artists, teachers, caretakers among them - that's exactly the modern version of shamans, storytellers, those who educate and give different perspective, those who are able to see things from multiple sides.<br/><br/>While even the contemporary LGBT/queer movement is afraid to discuss these quite provocative queer histories and myths, it is interesting to see the exactly same topic being shown on screen. We see the majority of specialist (factions) who tend to quarrel who's more important for the society, compete for the power over the other factions ... and the rare (!) hated (!!) minority (!!!) of the generalists (divergent) who have the abilities to appease the eternal wars among those talented only intellectually (erudite), physically (dauntless), socially (abnegation), green (amity) or have strong sense of justice (candor).<br/><br/>This - competition versus cooperation, specialists versus generalists, majority versus minority and also the omnipresent ""versus"" - are the most hot topics of the contemporary world. Gives us more of it!"
"maphy775","9","0","1","14 June 2015"," Fairly good movie, missing seriousness, no special effects,...
","The movie is about future society built in isolated Chicago after World War that devastated everything. No explanations what, who, when and where happened beyond that Chicago is pictured and you may not even recognize it unless you are from around.<br/><br/>You may find it is a great movie if you watch it relaxed and let your mind be taken to that place, their time and space. I started watching it completely unbiased, without any expectations in advance, taking ""Let's see what this movie is all about"" I found this movie surprisingly good.<br/><br/>But if your expectations are to see typical set-up: police, army, special forces, streets filled with cars, people in bars, good-kicks-bad fight and that alike (what is already in number of Hollywood movies, one may call it a stereotype of present); also if you start looking for logic in events and imperfections in scenes... then this movie is not for you, better skip it and instead re-watch Avengers, Hulk, Matrix, Harry Potter...<br/><br/>From technical point of view, this movie could benefit with a little bit more of special effects. Just to add make-up and polishing. Any CGI is contained within candidates psychological testing (watch and you will see what I mean), nothing else outside in their world.<br/><br/>The movie lacks a bit of seriousness. For example - take 'Dauntless' faction that suppose to be armed forces (peacekeepers, equivalent to police say at least)... Throughout the movie it looks like guys having a lot of fun and a bit of not-so-rough training. From that point you may take it as teenager movie.<br/><br/>Overall - recommendations for watching 'Divergent' and waiting to see its sequel."
"michaeldfishel","8","0","1","19 May 2015"," Excellent movie with fresh actors
","I can't believe so many people are knocking this movie. My wife introduced me to it and I'm surprised I never heard of the books before. Anyway, it definitely peaked interests in both of us. This movie has fresh young actors and a popular young adult dystopia/post-apocalyptic feel to it. After seeing this movie, I wanted to know the ending and ended up reading all 3 books. Great book to movie adaptation. Although it is similar to the Hunger Games style in many ways, the story is still fresh and excitingly different. Divergent is a must see for teens and young adults.<br/><br/>We have watched almost 10 times in the last year. Four is the obvious star of the show. All the girls love him and he is quite noble and attractive. Other characters do their part to make this an exciting movie and some good character development."

","Let me just say first, I LOVED the book. I read it about 3 months after the movie Divergent was released and my friend really recommended the movie and was starting to read the book. So I gave it a try and LOVED it. And so on I finished the series and thought ""How about seeing the movie, like my friends told me to?"" But since almost all of the reviews were bad, I started to have low expectations. But, you know what? The movie wasn't near bad. Of course they changed some parts (even left out my favorite part in the book, but then found it it was a deleted scene) but that didn't bother me. I liked the story and the characters. It's not nearly as bad as people here say, but also not as good as the book. The one thing I especially liked about the movie, is how they could make Tris look like she's actually 16. A great casting of her. Four was supposed to be 18 but looked a bit old for that, but then I realized that they changed his age to 24. Fair enough. So you should see the movie, but just don't have your expectations too high."
"Raxing","7","0","1","4 April 2015"," Engrossing movie with a somewhat flawed premise.
","A great war/disaster destroyed nearly all of humanity. Chicago is one of the last surviving bastions of humanity. In order to preserve the peace, society has been split into five factions (Abnegation, Erudite, Dauntless, Amity, and Candor). Teenagers of each faction take a test to determine which faction they belong to and they decide which one they will end up in for the rest of their lives. Divergent centers around Beatrice Prior, a girl that takes the test and finds out that she doesn't belong to any of the factions. This is what a divergent is. Divergents are considered to be a threat to society due likely to propaganda spread by the heads of the Erudite faction, the main protagonists in this movie. <br/><br/>You kind of have to overlook the flaws in the premise and accept the world of Divergent in order to enjoy this movie. I personally don't think this is all that difficult. The acting could have been better, but it was not at all bad, the scenes are beautifully shot, and overall I found myself escaping into this world. I imagined myself catching trains and jumping off of them, jumping into a pit, and gliding through the air. I watched the movie unfold and enjoyed it greatly. It isn't a perfect movie by any standard, but it was very well done."

It was very similar to The Hunger Games. It was pretty entertaining (as was the second one) but overall pretty predictable. I know they say that the book is better than the movie, but after watching this, I don't have much of a desire to read the book. I enjoyed following the character Tris on her adventure of finding out who she really was, and where she really belonged though! It's an interesting plot, with a wonderful soundtrack, and decently well put together characters."

","I've seen on here that this movie has a lot of bad reviews and low ratings and felt I had to watch to see if it was that bad. Everyone is entitled to their opinions but I , myself did like it. Is it amazing? No. Is it a classic? no. But it's entertaining enough. Plot holes? Doesn't make sense? Well, it's a fantasy movie. If you watch the premise for what it is, it's a fun ride. Of course I can understand if readers of the book were disappointed, I have not read the book, but often when I do, I am disappointed at how much is left out or does not come across on screen, but that is inevitable across the two different media platforms. Set in the future, after a world war. The state of Chicago (all that's left of the world apparently) is now split into five different factions, depending on your natural or strongest characteristic. If you fit into more than one category or none at all you're considered a divergent. Our sweet, pretty heroine (Tris) is such a person, it's a dangerous situation, as divergents are caught and killed. She manages to find an ally however, in the handsome love interest Four, who takes an immediate interest in her because he senses a connection, which is revealed later. Together they learn of a plot to kill all the people in Tris' s original faction putting her parents and other innocents in danger. Their aim is to try and stop it. The acting is good coming from the main two protagonists and Tris's mother (Ashley Judd). Some of the scenes are well filmed and lift you up into this dystopian future. There were a few edge of your seat moments for me. The only let down for me was Tris's rather stilted reaction to her father dying, after already mourning her mother, that would floor anybody, but she seems to get on with things rather quickly. The ending nicely sets up the sequel, and the story itself left me interested in possibly picking up the Divergent book series one day for a fuller experience."
"alindsay-al","7","0","1","21 March 2015"," a good fantasy film that I enjoyed
","With the new film insurgent coming out I though it was about time to see the first film divergent and I was quite surprised as I actually enjoyed this film. This film is set in a dystopian future where the world is split into five different factions for different jobs. Tris is a girl who is what they call a divergent who don't belong to any faction and they are a menace to society so they must be eliminated. Now shailene Woodley plays tris and I haven't seen here in much before but she was really good in this film and I definitely want to see more of her. You feel sympathetic for her character and you believe in her transformation as a character. Theo James plays four her love interest and to be honest yes women will say he is handsome but I don't think he is a great actor and he probably would have been more suited in the twilight franchise. Kate Winslet is a big actress but she was completely underutilized in this film as her role was incredibly small and it doesn't allow you to have any connection with her character at all. It's funny that one guy I did like in this film is Jai Courtney because I have never been a big fan of this guy but this evil role was perfect for him and 8 think he did pull it off well. I like training in films and this film did it well with the transformation of tris being the best part of the film. But they really give you no backstory on the universe you are in and the overall plot isn't really talked about allot and it makes you wonder why we bothered. The script had some really good drama to it towards The end of it but sometimes it was cliché and didn't help the character building. The style of this film was great with the action scenes being shot fantastically and you can see everything that is going on. Overall I enjoyed this film and it definitely makes me want to see insurgent."

","This review might contain some spoilers! After reading 'Divergent' and watching the movie, I must highly agree that reading books is so much better than watching movies! all the details i lived with the book are so much alive than the movie, the consistency of the events are more realistic than what the movie has personalized, if you do not read the book then the movie would mean something to you but for me the movie was just good because i could see what i actually read, like all the descriptions i have went through, some i imagined right and others i did not, i do understand that the director of the movie had to make some changes but there is always a limit for changes and for those who read the books will understand the kind of change he has made, like where is Edward who got stabbed in the eyes when he got the first? and Uriah? did he really erase a whole character out of the book? and why did he not create the firm friendship that Tris made when she got there with Al? it could have been more tragic when he died to show how they were really close. the book has given me lots of feelings that i searched for in the movie, i just felt that all the 'incidents' were covered perfectly but all the insides were vanished and all the firm relationships that connected the characters also disappeared, i wasn't disappointed with the movie the movie was great for me to watch what i have just read but all the important stuff that the director has missed is what lacks this movie and sure would get it to have very low reviews for all the readers out there, the first thing that came into my mind when I finished the movie was that this book could have been made into a better movie, putting in mind that Roth(the writer) has put some tips to make her book into a movie at the end. nevertheless i enjoyed the movie as much as i did with the book."

"john32935","6","0","1","20 January 2015"," More than a Hunger Games ripoff
","This movie has me torn and may qualify as a guilty pleasure. While clearly in the same category of Young Adult novel adaptation as the mega-successful Hunger Games trilogy, this first installment of the Divergent series has some obvious similarities and some differences. I think the similarity that has me liking this movie is the strong female lead played wonderfully by Shailene Woodley. However, Divergent's dialog is weaker, its plot more obvious, and its philosophy delivered more heavy-handedly; all-in-all making it the inferior of the two series' initial installments.<br/><br/>I understand that the movie also sanitized some of the more violent aspects of the book in order to avoid the harsher R-rating which would have hurt its box office potential. Such loss hurts the movie as the danger element is not as apparent as one would like to better vest the viewer in the trials of the lead character.<br/><br/>Are these flaws enough to make the film unwatchable? No. Are the strengths of the movie (Ms. Woodley, good CGI and production design) enough to give the movie a strong recommendation to watch? No, too. However, if you are a fan of science fiction and action- adventure (whose body count is high but whose gore is very limited), you too make like this movie. But if you are looking for Oscar-caliber movie-making, this is not for you."

","Divergence keeps you interested and wondering what is going to happen next. The movie starts off talking about about the dystopia city and how it is divided into five factions. Early on, we find out that Beatrice is a divergent which is considered a threat to the government because divergents can think independently which is an apparent threat to the system. Later on, like in Harry Potter she is sorted into a faction. She chooses Dauntless which are the warriors. The movie then focuses on her time at Dauntless and training there. This is good for a movie as you want to build relationships. While there, she meets a handsome emotionless man named Four who the main character eventually falls in love with. He too is also secretly a divergent and helps Beatrice manage to pass a test which may have revealed her secret.

And the music and soundtrack is good too, since it was co-produced by Hans Zimmer from Batman trilogy soundtrack composer. But the action is not very solid though, the fight scenes are too soft like a bitch fight. Im looking forward to a more brutal like the Undisputable or Ip Man.

You get to pick the one you want and somehow this is supposed to keep the peace after a 100-year war. Humhh.<br/><br/>Like Hogwarts, the Factions represent different skill sets. Unlike Hogwarts, you get tested first, and a Faction usually comes out as dominant. I no dominant trait comes out, in rare cases, you are labeled a Divergent. The government, which apparently wants to control people, does not like Divergents, and they typically find them and make them disappear.<br/><br/>Similar to Hunger Games with evil Donald Sutherland, except here you have Kate Winslet, who plays the evil government leader.<br/><br/>The lead female character breaks from her family, and loves her family, but still has to do what she has to do. The training scenes are pretty good, and the story is entertaining. <br/><br/>In the end, these stories leave the ending completely open, and you have to wait for part 2 to find out what happens next.

","Divergent I liked Divergent. Yes its genre is that of Hunger Games ( least able to fit into society overcoming expectations and saving others). I particularly liked the relationship between Theo James and Shailene Woodley and their portrayal of their characters Tris and Four. <br/><br/>Divergent is a story about the future, where in an effort to protect society from past wars, people are assigned to a faction, most follow the blood lines of their parents, although choice is allowed once a child reaches maturity. Once in that faction, they are expected to forgo their blood ties, and form new ties with the group they join. Each group has a function that society needs to survive; Characteristics such as intelligence, bravery, kindness, amity, candor. However, as usual the human race cannot forgo envy, jealousy, conflict and war to solve their darker side. The movie's plot follows this line, where jealousy of one of their leaders leads to a rivalry amongst the factions and ends in all-out war that only the divergent can stop. <br/><br/>There is a mild romantic interest between the 2 main characters that could have been developed more, and the ending was rather week but as it goes for this genre of film aimed at a teen audience it worked."

","When I first heard about Divergent, I though the first Hunger Games rip off was upon us, and besides that the whole story seemed somewhat confusing. It is Science Fiction and Directed by Neil Berger, the mind behind Limitless, so I decided to give it a shot, and it was the best idea I had in a long time. In a post war America, the city of Chicago is fenced off from the rest of the world, and has split into five factions of people. At the age of 18, all citizens must take an aptitude test, to determine where they belong. Beatrice (Shailene Woodley) is one of the girls taking the test as the movie starts, and her results show that she has an aptitude for all five factions, making her Divergent. Divergent's are highly intelligent, rebellious, and seen as a threat to the Government, so she hides her results and joins Dauntless, the equivalent of the National Guard in Chicago. During her rough training, the now renamed Trice, meets up with Four (Theo James) who she has an instant connection to, but who is also a threat to her secret identity. One thing that was never explained is why these people have to take the aptitude test, if they are allowed to join whichever faction they choose. It's a major plot hole and the only reason this film didn't receive 5 stars, as I really hate plot holes. Shailene Woodley stars as Trice, making the jump from TV to film, and she has done it with a bang. In much the same way Jennifer Lawrence was the perfect choice to play Katniss, Woodley was perfect for the role of Trice, and brought so much more to the film than I ever thought she would. Theo James is also terrific as Four, the mysterious trainer and love interest of Trice, and together the team is the perfect pair. Divergent is highly original, really well written, and introduced Hollywood to a whole slew of new stars, not to mention it's Director, Neil Burger, is on one hell of a successful run of films. Divergent has everything I look for in a film and in my favorite genre, and for that it is now one of our must see movies!"
"hiroito-com","9","0","2","7 December 2014"," Amazingly Good! Of course, it's got flaws...
","Divergent is another movie that joins the sci-fi YA genre. It's been compared to The Hunger Games multiple times, but I think they're not entirely similar, aside from being of the same genre. The world is very interesting. A dystopia disguised as a utopia. People live happily and in peace. Till a conflict arises between two factions and Divergents begin to get hunted down. It's got a lot of action and tension and danger for the main lead. The acting was not Oscar- worthy (though Shailene Woodley had her heart-breaking crying moments) but it wasn't horrendous. By the middle it felt like it dragged on a little bit but it pulls you in immediately. Like in the book, the is-dangerous-being-divergent thing wasn't fully explained and the world-building was not the best (though those who read the books know the origin of the faction system is explained till book 3). The climax was really good and we get to see Shai kick ass with her mother. Kate Winslet delivered a great performance as the baddie also. All in all, Divergent is an amazing movie with all the right touches of action, romance, humor, and intrigue. Since I'm a book fan, I am going to check out Insurgent, the second installment, but even if I haven't had read the books, I would have still wanted to watch it, to know what's coming next."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","2 December 2014"," Less intelligent Hunger Games
","A movie series, based on a book by Veronica Roth, which both try to ride the coattails of The Hunger Games franchise, with extremely limited success. The basic premise is the same. The world as we know it has ended and in the ruins of what used to be USA there exists a society where people are held under an iron fist, all in the name of keeping order. And of course it's up to a teenage girl to fight against this oppression.<br/><br/>Granted, in this series there doesn't exist any kind of elite class that keeps the rest as slaves or as lower class, which is different enough that you don't feel like watching the exact same movie, but the themes, mood and the general feeling are very, very similar.<br/><br/>So yeah, zero points for originality. That being said, the movie is not without value. The technical aspects of movie making are more than fine to please, the two main leads are not without talent and have chemistry together. And while the plot is predictable, it's paced well and doesn't overstay its welcome. The scenes dealing with mindscapes and subconscious fears are the most interesting thing in the movie and offer some creative visuals.<br/><br/>In the end I cannot really recommend this film. It's too similar to The Hunger Games, so you should watch those if post-apocalyptic teenage survival interests you. It's not a bad film, per se, just much more average, less ambitious and lacking in scope than its predecessor and source of inspiration."

","First of all this movie had a different plot unlike other Hollywood moves. In the beginning of the movie you find out all of the factions and what they all mean. You also see that Tris is different from the rest. When she first takes her test the thrill begins as she isn't supposed to say what she is. This movie is action packed which makes it such a great movie. Once Tris gets into her group she has to keep her self in the group by undergoing many obstacles. The couple of the obstacles she doesn't do well but then shortly progresses. Tris and Fours first quick the director made the music quiet and slowly builds up when the kiss which was a good idea cause it shows the importance of pretty much the one time they kiss. In the movie there's a lot of zooming in and out and also the camera moving as the people in action. Towards the end it all goes down as four tries to kill Tris yet you hope it doesn't end like that and later you find out it doesn't which you are relieved then the dynamic duo goes at and kills everyone and stops the factions. In the end you see Tris and Four and some other people riding a train out of their hometown and you hear the narration of Tris. The light shines on Tris and Four and you can tell they were the heroes. Then as they travel the music picks up and it ends. Now the audience is hoping for the second one since the first one kept you on your toes because it was so exciting to watch."
"thomas-w15","8","0","1","22 November 2014"," Don't listen to the critics and just enjoy the film
","Divergent 8/10- Most are skeptical of book to movie adaptions, especially when it is in the young adult genre, and most movies of the past have not given the genre a good name. Divergent however, is a solid film that without a doubt makes up for all of them. It takes you on a non-stop suspense-filled ride while staying true to the book and literally makes the magnificent words fly off the page. <br/><br/>I would like to clarify that it is not some twilight garbage or trying to rip the Hunger Games. It is its own film and does a fine job standing by itself. <br/><br/>I will begin by saying that I do agree that at certain points of the film, it does feel like they are going a little slow and are dragging on a certain scene. These scenes are this way though because the director has a gigantic respect for the book and wanted to stay true to the book as much as possible. The main problem that I heard most people had with the film is that they felt like the ending was too rushed. I can see why someone would think that, and I do agree that is was a little rushed but I still thought it was a near-perfect scene. Again, the reason it was this way is because that is how it is in the book. I love the book and I loved all of the scenes that they chose for the movie, but I would have maybe changed the scenes a tiny bit just so it would be more amicable for an audience. Those changes would be very small though and all of these minuscule problems in no way stopped me from enjoying the film.<br/><br/>Whoever was the head production designer deserves an Oscar for this movie. He made the exact images that I pictured in the book come to life. He picked the perfect shades for the colors of each faction and made amazing communities for each faction as well. He did an outstanding job particularly on the dauntless designs. I was very concerned coming into the film about how he would portray the dauntless and the place they live in, but I was just astounded by how great of a job he did. The fighting arena, the pit, the rooms, they were all awesome. I would also like to give props to the choreographers of the film for completely coming up with a new way to fight. They do not follow the usual boxing type fighting, they design their own that significantly contributes to each combat sequence. <br/><br/>The casting directors of Divergent could not have done a better job, particularly with Shailene Woodley and Theo James who play Tris and Four. I'm really glad that they took their time and found the perfect people for the movie who have such great chemistry together while still each giving off a good intensity of their own. Shailene Woodley, Theo James, and all of the rest of the cast were amazing together and you could tell that they were all fiercely dedicated to their roles. Shailene Woodley did a great job at really diving into her character Tris Prior and no one could have done as great of a job as her. The emotional scenes she was in were really the highlight of her career. I see plenty of actors that just completely mess up those scenes because they are just not good at acting, but Shailene Woodley really made you believe she was experiencing what Tris Prior was in those moments of the film. Theo James did just as good of a job and I truly believe that no one could hold his own with Shailene Woodley as well as he did. He really puts on the mask that Four does at the beginning but as his character develops, he changes with him and really was a perfect choice for the role. The rest of the cast all did an above-average job, but Shailene and Theo were really the ones that were mentioning walking out of the theater. <br/><br/>My advice to you is do not listen to the critics, most of them just do not like the young adult genre in general. The movie the best film out right now and I strongly recommend that you go see it in theaters.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"

"frans-vandamme","9","0","1","7 November 2014"," A riveting, deep-going satire on modern society
","The dystopian film ""Divergent"" casts a critical look at industrial society and how its requirement for specialization forcibly divides people into fixed categories. One thing that's probably often overlooked is that this critique on modern society also subtly covers gender stereotypes: in a scene early in the film, people from different factions line up in queues. Almost ALL the Erudites (analytical, e.g. librarians) were men, and almost ALL the Amities (compassionate, e.g. caretakers) were women. I'm not quite sure whether or not this was part of the movie's satire on boxing people in, but I haven't found any critiques mentioning this. But what's worrying is that most viewers will probably never even notice this because it agrees so well with our spoon-fed expectations. Of course there are some biological differences between men and women, but in the movie they're portrayed as total. In reality men aren't always more analytical than women, and women aren't always more compassionate than men. If anything it's an average tendency, significant only statistically and one of the worst parts of (post)industrial society is that people are treated as masses, as statistics, and anyone who will not let the statistics apply to them is cast out."
"Buddy-51","4","0","1","3 November 2014"," Yet another ho-hum dystopic movie
","Is it even possible in this day and age to make a dystopic science fiction film without it feeling somehow derivative of so many earlier, better works? I tend to doubt it. <br/><br/>Take ""Divergent,"" a futuristic tale based on the book by Veronica Roth, itself just the first in a series of novels aimed primarily at young adults. Right off the bat, one can see that ""Divergent"" owes a great deal to Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World,"" both being set in a society built on a strict caste system, where every member of the community is assigned a social level and a specialized task from which there is basically no escape. The difference is that, in Huxley's world, one is engineered from ""conception"" to be a member of a certain caste, while, in Roth's, individuals are, theoretically at least, free to choose, at one crucial point in their adolescence, the group to which they will forever belong.<br/><br/>In ""Divergent,"" there are five categories or ""factions,"" as they're called here, only two of which have any real significance in the film: Abnegation, whose principal function is selfless service to the community, and Dauntless, which serves, essentially, as the police force in this walled-off, post-apocalyptic version of old Chicago. Caught in the middle is a young woman named Beatrice (Shailene Woodley), who, while raised in Abnegation, finds that she may actually be what is called a ""Divergent,"" a rare individual who fits comfortably into more than one category, making her an existential threat to the stability of this homogeneous society, where everyone knows his or her place and role. Beatrice opts to join Dauntless, a decision which leads to innumerable training sequences that seem to drag on for a minor eternity.<br/><br/>Par for the course for the dystopic genre, our divergent heroine soon finds herself on the run from diabolical government forces (led by Kate Winslet) bent on destroying her lest she throw a monkey wrench into their ""peaceful,"" ""well-oiled,"" ""harmonious"" society.<br/><br/>And that's pretty much all the movie is about. Throw in some dreamscape elements straight out of ""Total Recall"" and ""Inception"" - both much better films, by the way - and soon we find ourselves heading down the rabbit-hole into incoherence and confusion from which it becomes virtually impossible to extricate ourselves.<br/><br/>Even decent - if pretty much standard, at this point - production values can't rescue a generally drab film."

","Well lets start with positives for a change. There were some (maybe 5-7) on point but still pretty basic similarities between current systems and systems in the future, like egoistic scientists + army = recipe for disaster or how is this this society divided into groups by professions, ideals, environment or how world systems forces humans to be tunnelvisioned in what they do, to always praise what they do without actual thinking why they praise it and to excell in small amount of things and make them into perfection instead to be more diversive and actually grow as an entity, etc etc. <br/><br/>One point that i woulda love to see and it actually wasn't shown to the fullest is the opinion that some small percentage of homeless people are people that didn't come to terms with what world systems are forcing on them, wanted more freedom and eventually became depressed with the reality unlike general opinion that they are just weak plain quitters and low iq people.<br/><br/>The story itself was pretty cheesy, stereotypical, very predictable and modeled in the way to appear to the largest audience possible/gross the highest possible amount of money. In the last scene i almost predicted fully to the word what character will say - my prediction was ..Youve got me and i know who you are.., only half was actually said. This is a perfect example of the cheesienest, predictability and mainstream teen oriented dialogues/script. Very poor. Another problem is that some things didn't made logical sense in a reality based scifi. The amount of violent struggles between factions would be far greater, people would behave far more differently in many situations and the character behaviour was just so unrealistic with the purpose to strengthen the already weak story/plot by lowering the quality of realism. The last point is the music, which confirms that it is just a teenpop flick that wants to play on all your senses/emotions in a very primitive way and wants to look complex in every area but in the core is very poor."

"rogerdarlington","Null","0","1","28 September 2014"," ""The Hunger Games"" 2.0 - but not as good
","The ""Divergent"" series of novels, which started to appear in 2011, owes a great deal to ""The Hunger Games"" collection, which began to be published in 2008. Both are three works aimed at young adults and written by female American authors (in the case of ""Divergent"", Veronica Roth). Both have a principled and plucky 16 year old heroine (in ""Divergent"", Beatrice 'Tris' Prior). Both are set in a post-apocalyptic dystopian world located in the former United States (in ""Divergent"", an enclosed Chicago). Both involve societies strictly divided (in the case of ""Divergent"", into five factions based on different human attributes). Both mix violence and romance in an exploration of coming of age and discovery of identity. And both are being turned into four money-making movies.<br/><br/>I have read the three ""HG"" novels and seen the two (so far) films and so, while not having read the ""Divergent"" books, I was happy to give this first spin-off film a go. I don't think it packs the punch of its rival but it's certainly entertaining enough. As with the ""HG"" movies, an absolutely key ingredient is the casting of the central heroine. Again we don't have quite the talent that is Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, but Shailene Woodley - whom I first spotted in ""The Descendents""- is an appealing young actress of genuine potential and 2014, which saw her in ""The Faults In Our Stars"" as well as ""Divergent"", is definitely her take-off year."

","Not as bad as i thought it would be, yet still not satisfying. In this movie stuff just happens, there is close to none logical sense in the continuity of scene to scene and huge shortcuts on the story which by itself is pretty uninteresting and brings nothing new to the table. Character motivations are unclear or unconvincing and the character themselves are either clichéd, cheesy or banal and are portrayed with equal dullness with the exception of Tris, who at least feels rounded thanks to a very good performance by Shailene Woodley, and whilst Four is miles away from being a real character, Theo James brings some very healthy charisma to the screen. The movie is filled with contradictions and minor plot holes that all add up to very poor storytelling. However the movie managed to be mildly engaging and times and even comes close to be exciting with a couple of enthralling sequences with great set-pieces. The film looks pretty neat and there is a very good cinematography which managed to keep me involved in what ever was going on, I have to give a shout out to the score too. Yet I can't stress enough how chaotic everything regarding characters, story and plot feels. This all culminates in a very dull third act with and equally uninspired ending. Sometimes this ""stuff"" that happens is actually good, other times it's stupid but laughable (in the first act I was laughing my ass off in the sequences that included the Dauntless and the train, I'm still laughing now), but for the most part it's distracting or and makes you cringe. I have to say that at least you can feel the director is trying o make a good movie and has actual interest for the material and as I said there is some fun to be had, but all in all it just felt mediocre. I don't know if the book is good or not since I have not read it, but it does feel like it borrows some ideas from other pre-existing franchises."

"ArchonCinemaReviews","7","0","1","15 September 2014"," An OK book adaptation - just sit back enjoy, but don't think too much into the plot
","Veronica Roth's series gets the silver screen treatment with the first film adaptation Divergent.<br/><br/>Set in a post-apocalyptic dystopian society, our protagonist fights against adult authority and existing social structures amidst violence as the protagonist transitions to adulthood. Sounds like most young adult novels being made into movies but, loosely summarized, that is the plot for Divergent. While not having personally read the books I was familiar with the series from seeing the distinctive covers monopolizing shelves in bookstores.<br/><br/>It is in the details that Veronica Roth's novel Divergent differentiates itself from its peers. The tale begins in the future in a decimated Chicago some time after a debilitating war. Society is no longer sustainable as a democracy and a new system is set up to prevent future conflict and maintain peace. Now the population is divided into virtuous factions: altruistic Abnegation, intellectual Erudite, kind Amity, honest Candor, and protector Dauntless. Adherence to the faction system is imperative to its success and is dependent upon individuals within the population identifying and belonging to a specific faction, and only one faction. Those who identify with multiple are called Divergents and can not be controlled or contained.<br/><br/>Beatrice is the daughter of one of the superiors within the Abnegation faction; the faction that governs the city. She and her brother Caleb are of age to test and choose a faction they will remain with the rest of their lives. When Beatrice takes the aptitude test the results are inconclusive, a rarity and a dangerous one at that, and she must choose her own path. Though truly a Divergent she chooses fearless Dauntless.<br/><br/>She leaves her life and family behind, transforming from Beatrice to Tris. Along with the other transfers she begins training as Dauntless under the coaching of Four. She must persevere and prove herself Dauntless or be cast aside to the undesirable factionless if she falls below approval standards. Or worse, be killed if found out to be Divergent. All the while the Erudite faction are working tirelessly to discredit and overthrow abnegation to become the new ruling faction.<br/><br/>It's a riveting tale for the YA book adaptation Divergent. The back-story is fed to audiences well to provide sufficient narrative seamlessly within the protagonist's plot. The film is action packed with fight scenes with a minor love interest line for the teens. All casting and acting is spot on. The set design really produces a dilapidated cityscape with costumes modern enough to pass for a sci-fi future. Divergent is good despite what it is: a Hollywood blockbuster to appease the masses and make boatload of money.<br/><br/>The issue is with the character development which is lacking as soon as Tris lands in the headquarters of Dauntless. At that point, all evolution is from the physical training and the film turns into one fight scene after the other and the movie just blends and fades. There just has to be something more to the story between the characters in the literature. The audience is supposed to believe that the teens are fighting for their livelihoods but there are few exchanges besides pats on the back and chummy punches to the arm.<br/><br/>Divergent is action packed, glossing over development details rather than creating a fully realized futuristic story. Hollywood gets its hands in Roth's novel and turns it into a typical blockbuster with the unrelated top-40 soundtrack to match. These minor details should not deter those from enjoying the film. If you look deep within the plot you will find darker broader themes regarding conformity and independence.<br/><br/>More recent movie reviews can be found at our website."

Anyway, this benchmark could launch an interesting movie, but what we see is getting entangled in clichés and mostly trivial performances, actors-actresses based on looks (apart from Shailene Woodley and ""older"" generation actors). There are some twists, but having seen about half- an-hour, you will be pretty sure who will have crush on whom, who will not survive, etc., but many of them whose acting could be pleasurable spend too little time on screen (particularly Ashley Judd and Kate Winslet). And a closed society with hostile outside world - not a very novel one, and there is no contact between them (perhaps in sequels?).

Only this time I didn't have to read the book to be disappointed.<br/><br/>In Divergent's world there exists a ridiculously defective caste system society that consists of five factions: the Selfless, the Peaceful, the Intelligent, the Brave, and the Honest. This system is not in itself the fault of the movie, rather than the book, but let's assume it's granted, and there's no need to criticize it. So, basically Tris (Beatrice, played by Shailene Woodley), is a girl born to the Abnegation faction (the Selfless), and having turned 16 she's coming of age, so she'll need to decide which of these five factions to join for life. A very easy decision indeed, especially when given she must stick with her choice. The results of a personality test tells her she's a Divergent, i.e. she doesn't fit into any of the factions, and this is extremely rare (really? these factions offer very limited career options!). This means Katniss... I mean Tris will be hunted by the powers that be and executed, shall this fact become apparent.<br/><br/>So, what was good and appealing in the first place, was the cinematography of the movie. The dystopian Chicago is impressing, and add the 1st class shooting, you'll have something that looks gorgeous. I particularly enjoyed the scene in which Tris rides the wire from the skyscraper to the ground in night-time, for the night-time urban scenery was astounding.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, looking under the surface, the product is not as beautiful inside. <br/><br/>The screenplay is predictable, unimaginative, and even naive: firstly Tris's no pain, no gain rise from the bottom of her faction class to the elite has been seen in countless stories so many times before, and this one offers nothing new to the subject. Falling in love with her trainer, Four(Theo James), could be seen from miles away, and then there's the power battle between two factions resulting in killing - trouble in paradise. The plot really doesn't give much to the viewer, and it all feels like somebody chewed it ready for you. <br/><br/>The acting is average at best. No one in the cast really made a memorable effort, save perhaps for Woodley when Tris's mother died. She really tries to make most out of her role, which I massively respect, but being Tris is mostly restricted to being anxious all the time. I begin to understand who this movie was targeted for... <br/><br/>The message of Divergent seems to be that everyone should be themselves, no matter what, and to be with your family and other people of your kind, to support them, even when society forbids it. These are important issues, but they could really have been expressed with more finesse and a storyline that actually makes yourself do something with your mind.<br/><br/>One last thing I want to point out is the immense playtime of the movie. I'd understand the 134 minutes if the contents of the movie were worth the time, but as I have made several points about how they are not, it's no wonder I found myself looking at the time several times during this duration.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this movie. I really mean it, without sarcasm or anything else, but my high expectations died as the movie went by. This wasn't so devastating as I maybe led on, having its moments, but I desired to see more than something that inspires a simple 'meh'. Maybe it's the case of the Hunger Games - the movie wasn't a masterpiece, but the book was great, and Catching Fire a fine improvement to its predecessor. I still have a little hope left, and my final judgment on the Divergent movie series depends on the sequel Insurgent, supposedly coming out in 2015.<br/><br/>Rating: 2/5"

It is interesting because often, the adaptation of a book series allows to discover some new actors who create a new generation of actors.<br/><br/>I think it is a good start for the franchise which follows the steps of Hunger Games. If you liked the book, you will like the movie (of course there will be some deceptions like I said previously). If you like dystopian stories, watch it right now !"

","Based on the novel of the same name by Veronica Roth, 'Divergent', despite being ambitious, is a mediocre fare, at best. A predictable storyline, along-with an excessive running-time over a 140-minutes, take away its glory, in totality. But Shailene Woodley makes for a worthy leading-lady & delivers a knock-out performance. <br/><br/>'Divergent' Synopsis: In a world divided by factions based on virtues, Tris learns she's Divergent and won't fit in. When she discovers a plot to destroy Divergents, Tris and the mysterious Four must find out what makes Divergents dangerous before it's too late.<br/><br/>'Divergent' is visually brilliant & some of the action set-pieces are absolutely stunning. But, the storyline & the narrative are so been-there-seen-that, that I wasn't engrossed after a point. While the first-hour moves on a slow-pace, the second-hour gathers momentum & offers a good climax. But overall, the result is just about average.<br/><br/>Evan Daugherty & Vanessa Taylor's Adpated Screenplay has a few aces, but they aren't many. Neil Burger's Direction offers grandeur. Cinematography is top-notch. Editing isn't crisp. Art & Costume Design are superb. Graphics are outstanding.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Woodley shines & steals the show. She's in terrific form & leads the film's stilted narrative with a knock-out performance. Theo James has the tapping's of becoming a fine actor. He's impressive. The always-excellent Kate Winslet adds a streak of delicious menace, despite limited screen-time. Zoë Kravitz is natural. Miles Teller is perpetually irritating. Ashley Judd is first-rate.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Divergent' is a so-so fare. Watch it for Woodley!"
"tjaceline","6","0","1","23 August 2014"," Why oh why?
","I was so excited to see this movie after reading the amazing books. I really recommend reading them, but the movie was a complete let down. There was no character development for Tris's friends which made things confusing. As well as making Tris seeming plain and unlikeable. The focus was changed from divergence to an ""action/love story"" kind of thing. I think personally you will like the movie if you haven't read the book, but if you have you will notice so clearly what they have missed out. They missed a lot of important details and some characters that are of great importance. Such as Wills sister. All i say to the director is good luck in making the next film with all the gaping holes in the plot."
"Stella_R","9","0","3","19 August 2014"," Definitely recommended, although looks like Hunger Games
","When first watching Divergent's trailer and reading it's info, I was mildly enthusiastic and expected the movie to be a lot like the Hunger Games. After all, both movies (or books for that matter) set place in a post-war world and depict a society divided into groups in order to keep peace. However, even though the story lines have their similarities, Divergent evolves in a different way. It may be a story of fiction, but Divergent gives us viewers a way to look at society's problems and ask ourselves whether we can end up divided into factions in the future as well. One major thing I loved about the movie was the acting work; I think all actors did a wonderful job in defining the characteristics of their persona. The chemistry between Tris and Four was heartfelt. I am looking forward to seeing Insurgent and Allegiant."
"rzajac","6","0","1","19 August 2014"," Sci-fi breakthru wannabe
","""Divergent"" strains to be the next Blade Runner or Matrix. You can see where they tried to throw in all the de rigueur elements: There's a social status quo that people accept and within which they operate. This is a little like the Matrix, except that there's (spoiler) the sense, by the story's end, that the social system in Divergent fails not because it's a systemic horror-show illusion (a la Matrix), but because the checks and balances fail; so Divergent doesn't *really* go for broke in that sense.<br/><br/>There's a VO backstory involving a war and the city of Chicago being surrounded by an odd sort of ""wall"". This comes off like a quaint throwback to Blade Runner, with it's backdrop social reality of off- planet white flight. The difference is that Blade Runner's social backdrop feels strangely warm and contiguous with our reality, whereas Divergent's feels contrived for the express purpose of explaining how the ""new"" Chicago's progenitors got pushed to contrive the faction system. Frankly, I prefer a backdrop that looks like a version of ""home""; and that shouldn't just be another contrivance to ""explain"" things.<br/><br/>I think the flick was supposed to be an extended parable on the importance of mutation for survival. But, in the end, I wasn't convinced that it sheds light on this; it veered too far into future dystopia action hero fantasy shoot-'em-up territory. We're supposed to understand that the heroine transcends her faction. In the end, it just sorta looks like she simply lucks into the position of getting the big picture and then using her faction-developed skills to blast through and stop the malefactors.<br/><br/>There's a lot of stuff in the flick that doesn't seem to gel. There's an interpersonal antagonism within the heroine's caste that seems more designed to generate dramatic tension than it does to demonstrate caste- functional social behaviors; in other words, from time to time, writing for character just doesn't compute. In the end (spoiler) there's a deus ex machina moment where we're to believe a drug-programmed person is induced to snap out of it at the point where the heroine just-so-happens to need his aid to extricate her from yet-another brush with death, so she can go on to save the day.<br/><br/>What's good about the flick? The actors were marvelously professional, and took direction exceedingly well. Set work, effects, stunts, shots, editing, and scene-by-scene dramatic flow was managed well, in a general sense. Production work was fully what one would expect from a contemporary sci-fi action flick. Hollywood has honed that stuff down to a razor sharpness which is always a marvel to behold; and might even see you through the viewing with nary a thought to leaving the theater or ejecting the medium from your video box.<br/><br/>But if you're hoping to see the next mindblower sci-fi wunderkind, abandon hope."
"RichieL-1","8","0","1","18 August 2014"," Good Metaphor and Fun
","I am not a teenage girl, and it's been decades since I was a teenage boy. Nevertheless, I liked this film. When I 'was' a teenage boy I enjoyed Metamorphosis by Kafka - ignoring the implausibility of a human maintaining personal identity in a roach's body. That's how I felt watching this film: as escapist, at times silly - yet fun, metaphor. In truth, we are consigned by categories and function in our society; we are constrained by early decisions, and we do change loyalties and families with time. Those choices create moral and emotional crises. That was this movie, on an imaginative stage. Beatrice's stress at selecting a faction reminded me of ""having"" to pick a major, the sexual tension between her and Four, the wanting to fit in, and the re-framing of parents once out of the home are nearly universal experiences. Also nearly universal is the feeling that the World rests on your shoulders. Although that changes with the perspective of time in ordinary life, in this film the fate of the city does rest on her shoulders. That is what art does; paint scenarios that reflect inner life better than ordinary life."
"leonblackwood","4","0","1","17 August 2014"," Wasn't that impressed! 4/10
","Review: Man, this film is way to long and I wasn't that impressed with the storyline or the whole concept. The director wasted so much time on the training and I expected the main character to be something special but she just turned out to be like the other candidates. Anyway, the acting wasn't anything special but it was good to see Kate Winslet play a baddie for once. The director gave the movie a big build at the beginning but by the end, it was all a bit pointless. It just seemed a bit over complicated and after a while it seemed to drag and become uninteresting. The 5 different factions didn't really come into play because the director concentrated on the girl keeping her secret and falling in love with the trainer. Maybe the whole story will unfold in the sequel which is bound to come out soon, but I won't be rushing to see it. Disappointing!<br/><br/>Round-Up: This movie did get a big distribution and it looked good in the adverts which is why it made so much money. After watching the movie the film does seem like there is a loads of information missing, but I wasn't that bothered to be honest. The love story was really predictable and the action scenes wasn't that realistic. On the plus side, there is a deep moral to the story about equality and everyone becoming one but apart from that, the director really does need to use the profit to make a better sequel because the concept needs a lot of work. <br/><br/>Budget: $85million Worldwide Gross: $275million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there futuristic, sci-fi adventure movies about 5 different factions, which have been separate by personality type, and 1 girl making the decision of were she belongs. 4/10"
"p-jonsson","5","0","1","16 August 2014"," Fairly mediocre movie for the younger audience
","I should probably mention right away that I have not read the book-trilogy that this movie is based on. Given the content matter I might actually have liked the books. The movie? Well to me the movie was a rather mediocre one. As the blurb states the story is set in a dystopian future but we do not really get to know how they got there except the standard explanation that ""there was a war"". The world is a bizarre mixture of primitive post-apocalypse living and modern, futuristic tech. The division of people into factionswell to me it felt pretty dumb to begin with and the idea that some people could not possibly fit into more than one faction was absolutely ludicrous to me. How the hell was it supposed to keep peace by deliberately factioning people against each other? Okay, trying to get over these gripes, what about the rest of the movie. Well it was okayish I guess. It did give me the same feeling as when reading a young-adult book and I would say that this movie is most suitable for a younger audience. The story is rather predictable. There is the initial training part where Tris of course gets a few friends and in particular befriends one of her tutors. Not surprisingly there is also the obligatory jerk. The one thing that makes the movie a bit out of the ordinary are the induced dream sequences which are not too bad.<br/><br/>Later in the movie Tris starts to discover the plot of the bad guys and of course goes off to save the day. Again these part are simple and predictable. The ease by which Tris and a few of her friends manages to infiltrate the lab/headquarters of the baddies is rather unbelievable. It of course helps that it seems like it is only the good guys who can shoot straight or fight worth a damned with a few occasional exceptions when the script calls for it.<br/><br/>The movie is, as far as I understand it, based only on the first book in the trilogy so it is perhaps not very surprising that it ends with a lot of loose ends but, for Christ sake, they fight their way to stop the plot, taking down a lot of people on their way, and then they leave the chief mastermind of this despicable plot lying unconscious but alive on the floor just taking off. That just felt dumb! It is not a bad bad movie but I do not understand the high ratings some people seem to give it."

","Divergent was awesome no doubt.<br/><br/>Veronica Roth is a book genius. She created a brand new world where people could not even imagine living in. Where the world is cruel, and dangerous. Where you have to make life changing choices.<br/><br/>This movie will make you feel all kinds of things: sad, happy, and revengeful. <br/><br/>Shailene Woodley and Theo James were perfect for the roles they got. I can't even imagine anyone better. That's how perfect they were.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the movie yet, I advise you to read the books first, because if you watch the movie without reading the book, you will become confused at some point. <br/><br/>The books explains everything that will keep you on track and make you understand: Why this is happening. <br/><br/>Most of the time, movies don't include everything that is in the book, so it get kid of confusing. <br/><br/>I was disappointed at one point because there was this part that I was really looking forward on seeing, but I guess they cut it out. To me, the part that they didn't add felt like it was really important and it really needed to be there. Because in the second book and the second movie (that is coming out soon)it is more about that one topic.<br/><br/>Divergent has is all: the drama, romance, action/adventure, thriller, and more. Again, if you haven't already watched the movie or read the book, please read the book first before watching the movies."

","The war is over and now when one becomes 16-yrs of age, one must make a decision as to which group to belong to: Abnegation (selfless), Amity (peaceful), Candor (honest), Dauntless (brave) and Erudite (intelligent). These Factions, as they are called, are designed to maintain peace so war won't happen again. Tris (Shailene Woodley) leans toward Dauntless, but she really doesn't fit in there. She is Divergent (free thinker, non conformist) and Divergents are considered dangerous and may be put to death. This can't be good. <br/><br/>I believe we have found another Katniss as Tris (Shailene) reminds us of another HUNGER GAMES kind of thing. I will admit that in the beginning when they showed Tris, I saw Katniss. See? There are some differences: no bows and arrows, no killing of children. The children in here undergo intense initiation training that can kill them if they are not careful enough. <br/><br/>But, make no mistake about it, this is still a dictatorship under the guise of peaceful Factions. Their mantra is Faction before Blood. The real culprit that this dictatorship wants to control and eliminate is: The Human Condition. Can you believe that? Who makes this stuff up? (dictators is the answer) <br/><br/>As we looked to Katniss to affect change, we now look to Tris to do the same. But, this won't be easy. She doesn't have a bow and arrows. Oh, oh How can she do this?<br/><br/>Most of the movie shows the training of Dauntless hopefuls and some of it is hard to watch. This training focuses on individual fears and how the candidates perform when confronted with his/her greatest fear. <br/><br/>In time we get to see a love story, sort of, and hope for the best, of course. We watch Tris try to qualify and not be dropped out of the program. But, to be fair, it's the love story angle that keeps us in our seats. We know it's there, however, that aspect takes a long time to crystallize, but we are a patient audience and believe we will be rewarded in time. <br/><br/>The fight scenes and acting all around are very good. Besides Shailene as Tris another standout is Theo James as Four who comes across as a very strong character. There was a little joke in the beginning when Four announces his name and one of the candidates says to him, ""Four? Were 1, 2 and 3 already taken?"" We are told that the candidates are only to speak when spoken to. So right here we know the candidates will be in for a rough time of it. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast performed well and Ashley Judd as Tris' mother, Natalie, does a credible job. <br/><br/>Seems most of the candidates have to have tattoos and we can only hope they are washable.<br/><br/>Over all a pretty good Sci-Fi story. <br/><br/>The ending leads us to believe there will be a sequel or sequels. Can't wait, can you? (7/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Soft stuff and not much of it."

","I really didn't expect this movie to be any good. Thought of it as just another teen novel turned into a movie like Twilight. Surprisingly, the movie was pretty good. <br/><br/>I loved its premise. A post apocalyptic world where Chicago is like Mankind's last safe place left surrounded by a huge wall. A five factions system ensures that no further war ever takes place. Kinda reminded me of Equilibrium and Hunger games. <br/><br/>The story was pretty good. It follows a girl who tries to find her role in this faction system. The actress who played her did a fine job in my opinion. Liked her slow transformation, it was one of my favourite thing about the movie, her whole journey after joining a faction of her choosing, it was really good. Kate winslet plays the main baddie and she was pretty good. The rest of the cast was from okayish-lame. There were some emotional scenes here and there too, some executed perfectly, while others hastily.<br/><br/>The CGI was a mixed bag. Some shots were good, while many weren't. Didn't distract much from the movie so that's a plus. Liked the soundtrack, had some nice pieces. <br/><br/>The main dude was very generic however and just wasn't good for the most part. Also, the movie had some pacing issues, it often slowed down.

","Just watched this film and, as I usually do with all movies, hopped on to IMDb to see what other people thought. And BOY, was I surprised!<br/><br/>All of these negative reviews are insane. I mean was the writing good? No. Was the acting Oscar- worthy? No. Was the premise rational? No.<br/><br/>I thought the writing was entertaining, it used many old tricks. The tricks that made you feel like the movies were magic when you were a kid. The storytelling was well-paced, and felt much more like an adventure movie than an intellectual sci-fi. <br/><br/>Speaking of which, I'm so underwhelmed by sci-fi films being all intellectual and sad and coldly existential. **** that ****! So what if the story itself wasn't particularly believable or filled with holes? At least the characters here have agency. At least they go out and rebel gloriously instead of spending two hours moping about, contemplating their incompetence and accepting the sad truth of reality. I mean what happened to the good old sci-fi fantasy flick anyways? People obviously love it, but is telling a fun adventure story full of holes suddenly not OK with the review hipsters anymore?<br/><br/>The acting was credible. People who say Shailene Woodley cannot act are out of their minds, she did a great job and was absolutely adorable, especially considering the script. Sure, every character was played in a way that at times was pretty annoying. But it was clear to me that this was intentional– as in intentionally annoying you for emotional fuel. Again, I think all the actors played their roles well in the context of the adventure template. The leads, even if they could not play whole characters (because of the script), accomplished admirably what was needed to move the story forward.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the premise. What makes a good sci-fi story worth our time? Is it a post- apocalyptic background setting where the zombies rose on Dec. 21 2015, spread by a rare virus strain incubated in the asses of mutated monkeys? Seriously who gives a ***!<br/><br/>All the pieces in the setup have major flaws, but they come together fine. They get the point across and I'd like to remind you critics that everything in the creative world is a simplification and reference to the infinite complexity of the real world. That is the whole point of movies and other creative mediums.<br/><br/>This is a teen fantasy adventure movie. It's about being different and not fitting into categories. It's about family, love, and courage. <br/><br/>It's entertaining, emotionally engaging, not particularly smart, and retells a classic story we've all heard/seen/read a thousand times.

Once this one dimensional and juvenile view of world is challenged, the whole movie crumbs down and I simply can not take it seriously anymore. <br/><br/>This movie seems to suggest that divergent is extremely rare and a very small minority. Just look at those brainless dauntless drones, it seems to suggest that vast majority of human beings are one dimensional and easily categorized, like different breeds of dogs. Is that how author think of human? That's really sad. I tend to believe that everyone is a divergent to various degree. Isn't every single human being a natural ""four""? In the later portion of the movie, almost all the dauntless are susceptible to the mind control potion, except the limited few divergents. And the movie repeated suggests that divergent is very rare. What the heck? Do you truly agree with this? Is this how you would view other people, that most people belongs to set category and only few odd balls defies category? <br/><br/>How can I take the movie seriously if the world view of the subject is that of a high school teenage? <br/><br/>Overall, I give credit to the attempt to bring highlight on individualism and democracy.

I really like the idea and Hunger Games did it fantastic. I really sets the right mood and the storytelling seems ""logic"" in it's turns and twists. Although Divergent didn't. For the most part of the movie I got bored. Some of the drastic turns or dramatic scenes seemed illogical and they felt forced to get the story forwards. And them scenes are just irritating and you just ask yourself why they couldn't get a more credible or comprehending storytelling without these forced scenes. Although they had some scenes that moved the story forward in a great way, which that captured your attention. <br/><br/>And this fictitious world with the different factions just felt... silly..."
"siderite","6","0","1","23 July 2014"," Harry Potter in the future
","The film is well done and all the actors are playing OK. That's about all I can say that it good about the movie. The script, though, is terrible. Basically it is about a bored little Amish girl who decides to switch Factions and join the Fascists, just for fun. The faction system is a sort of Hogwarts house system, only people are separated by more clear virtues which somehow need to preclude any others, for no good reason. The training is just like in Harry Potter, seemingly controlled, but actually quite insane. This system is threatened by divergents, people who have characteristics from more than one faction and that ""the system"" wants them destroyed. Guess which one is she.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie does possess a subtle irony that I believe was unintentional. A brainwashing movie made for masses of young adults is advocating rebellion against a brainwashing system. Of course, only do that after you trusted the system most of the time and obeyed without question, then found out something so outrageous about it that your only alternatives are fight or die. And I am still not sure whether some part of the film didn't advocate death as a good alternative to resistance. I mean, she had to be really weird and rare in order to do that, so that means the rest of them had no chance to begin with.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I felt cheated of more than two hours of my life and offended by the radically dumb message of the story. They fight the system, they win, and still they end up running. And do you know the crazy bitch that started it all? They let her live at the end. Because they are good guys. Sheesh! Just for the annoyance factor, I rate this under average."

","Everyone who had read the book and seen the movie told me that it was terrible. That it was slow and the acting was student film level. So going into it my expectations were low and I think that's why I enjoyed it more than most people.<br/><br/>The acting is mediocre as well as the action scenes that go along with it. This takes up most of the movie but for some reason, I liked the main character and her dilemma. The whole concept is pretty cool and original. Some of the dialogue was very poor and I laughed when the scene didn't call for it. If you can look past all these flaws, I believe you get an original story with a few characters you can really root for. It won't win any awards or movie critics, but who cares? If you had doubts about this movie, drop them and give it a shot."

The movie follow the bock only diverging in some parts in order to make the information pass in a small amount of time, if they follow the book in some parts it will be confusing because you don't follow all the little information that they don't explain in the movie. The awesomeness go that is even they changing little things, the changes ware awesome. And made the movie different but still awesome as the book.<br/><br/>The movie charters: I'n the beginning i expect Tris less beauty. And in the movie i king of like in one strange way Petter, a big amount of that its because of the actor that represent Petter, he is funny and alway's smiling, in the book i get a more ruff idea of Petter and don't really enjoy the Character in the book.<br/><br/>The movie effects: I mean, wow, i was expecting a good production but never like this, never in my imagination i have the time or the ability to create all that instruments and stuff they show on the movie. I men little stuff like the way the cups of serum are made, the way the city's are destroyed and all the wind fans systems in the buildings... All that environment stuff that the movie bring to the story king of give it a now approach even using the same arguments. I was not expects the scene when they throw themselves from the building hanged by one rope. In the movie that was awesome, beautiful... Made me make a little smile and king of feel a title of the freedom that Tris was feeling.<br/><br/>Music: You know what i am talking... :D I'm not a big fan of Ellie Goulding but you need to accept that her songs in that movie are just well placed, and even when the movie strait's to touch your hearth where it came one song that melt your feelings and make you live all the charters of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall: I thins its kind of obvious that i love this movie... Because i don't think you can understand that string of thinking but, when you read that state of the art book you don't expect to someone to take that and make it even better. In your mind you know that's possible but its really close to impossible. When i hear that they will make a movie of that book i really don't expect that to be that good, even because i have seen a lot of movies that are made mirroring book's and never find it well engulf... But this time, they get it right. Awesome movie."
"pennyelenabooks","7","0","1","8 July 2014"," Good start
","In a world where everyone must choose a section where they will belong for the rest of their lives, Tris discovers that she is a divergent, a person who doesn't fit in any of the sections. However, divergents are hunted down as they are considered dangerous. There for Tris must hide her true identity and try to fit in in the section that she has chosen. Divergent is a book adaption, but you can watch it easily without reading the book first. The storyline is great, as the facts are presented in equal times, something that many action movies fail to do. The performances were great also, and very convincing, as were the special effects and the costumes, very original. So 7 out of 10, hoping that the sequel will be as good or even better."

"nicolechan916","9","0","1","16 June 2014"," Action packed, intense and suspenseful.
","It was a really well made movie and the action scenes were well executed. I missed a bit of the beginning of the film, so was a bit confused throughout but I get it now. It""s a pretty good storyline. Actually, it's quite brilliant really. So simple, yet so captivating.<br/><br/>The visuals were really stimulating and detailed, which made it really believable. Some elements reminded me of 'inception' as well. Just in the way it was edited and contrasted.<br/><br/>But the thing with these stories (Divergent and Hunger Games) is that they all question the leaders of the society or the way that society works. I don't know if they're trying to get more people aware of the power that leaders abuse and to take action against it, but I think because it is set in the future, people might not think of it in the present. I mean, there are already a lot of people aware of the power that leaders abuse- especially if you turn on the news and hear about the rioting and civil wars going on in parts of the world (Syria, Venezuela etc), but because we all live in our own little bubble, we don't think it concerns us. So maybe these novels/films are trying to reach out to the younger population and to make them think about these issues and if that's the case, that's totally awesome but it doesn't necessarily make them think of the NOW.<br/><br/>Right.<br/><br/>Moving on, I'm a huge Maggie Q fan (Nikita FTW), so was a bit disappointed that there wasn't more of her. She could've done a lot of action scenes as well, maybe in the future films! *Crosses fingers* Not even sure if her character lives beyond the first book though, but I'm praying so hard that she does. I'll read the books soon.<br/><br/>Also, I kind of hate the fact that though we have this powerful female protagonist, she is still mostly portrayed as the damsel in distress and needs the guy to save her. I guess they were trying to establish the 'chemistry' between them, but I found those scenes to be a bit awkward and unnecessary. Oh well, at least this passes the Bechdel test.<br/><br/>Wait- I just thought of this one example (which was evident in Twilight as well) that really is extremely problematic. The guy goes ""if I wanted to hurt you, I would already have' or something like that. I've never noticed this before but thanks to my gender studies class, I realize how pro-abusive these kinds of statements are. Think about it for a second. The guy is asserting his dominance, saying I have the power to hurt you, but I choose not to.<br/><br/>Please. I could kick you in the balls but I choose not to. Whatdya think of that?<br/><br/>And the fact that the cast was predominantly white. Not hating on this film, just pointing out the obvious that most often flies over our heads.<br/><br/>Read the full review at championangels.wordpress.com"
"WilliamCQ","6","0","2","16 June 2014"," A nice buildup to a disappointing ending
","This movie feels like it's trying to pick on the wave created by The Hunger Games. I dislike the latter as it's a *major* ripoff of Battle Royale, and don't label me as a hater before seeing the older Japanese movie, but at least there was a reason why the young duo toyed with their lives at the end. One might have figured the important duo of this movie was reckless, but for unnecessary reason.<br/><br/>The protagonist put her life highly at risk to regain the consciousness (the normal state of being awake and able to understand what is happening around you) of her mentor & love interest. There was no need for it, she had a gun and was trained. Seeing her father die in front of her for the cause and earlier her ability to kill an acquaintance (not just in VR), she should have been much more aggressive.<br/><br/>I liked the premise, although it was cheesy, the special effects, the protagonist coming into adulthood & her trials, but the bit about her 1 second pointing her gun at the immediate threat, as she was pinned on the floor after her hallucinating/brainwashed mentor/lover just beat her up, to the next second putting the barrel end on her forehead is absolutely insane. The movie would have been good if one of the 2 died while the crazed men held the handgun stuck to the protagonist forehead. One just had to go...<br/><br/>Another matter: As soon as I saw the humongous wall far away from cities, it--immediately--came to mind the movie was appealing to Game of Thrones watchers/readers."

","Divergent is valid movie it own genre. Maybe even better than Hunger Games. Divergent thou have same problems than many other movies at the same genre. To maximize the profit movie violent must keep mild. If they would go to PG-15 instead of PG-13 they might get more depth to the movie. Also it might get more adult audience to watch it. Now this feels like Twilight meets Hunger Games. Story itself is quite fascinating, but it is too dragging. When something finally starts to happening movie comes to its end and you have to wait for sequel at least a year. Maybe two movies instead of three might work better. But the studios won't think viewers as much as they think profit. The problem here is that the second movie will be just a middle story to tell and you have to wait the third movie to see how the story will end. Chemistry between Tris and Four be conspicuously absent, but luckily Four is worth to watch; ) This movie is little bit better than average on its genre, but it might work better in 3D format.<br/><br/>http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/"

","I love science fiction, I do, but somehow I am not really that much into dystopian stories. Those stories always contain a thread of gloom and sadness that does not do much for me. I am actually a deeply optimistic person which may not be gleamed from the surface of my personality. Divergent is a story of young love, growing up and finding oneself. The movie more or less follows that pretext and delivers a compelling story. I suppose that one needs substance to make a movie based on a book. I have not had the pleasure of reading Divergent before watching the movie, and to be honest, after seeing the movie I will definitely not. Unfortunately this leaves me without bases for comparison and deprives me of insight which would help me decide if this is a movie worthy of the story from the book. This is a smoothly flowing story that contains hardly any stumbling points and unnecessary parts. The young cast is likable, very lovely and good looking. They all do a good job and leave a glimpse of promise for their future endeavors. I left the cinema thinking of a nice glass of red, not about the movie I had just seen. That tells a lot about the impression it left on me. If you have time to kill and do not care much how, go and see this movie. If you decide instead to spend time with friends over a nice meal, it may be a better choice. I am looking forward to seeing both main cast actors in new projects. I think they have more to offer at least while they are as good looking as they are now."

","Making films for teenagers is easy but at the same time really difficult. First off the things they are interested in are pretty basic, adventure, love, school, mythology and themselves. Okay so it's one thing to make a film that appeals to teenagers, they have to make it successful too for that you need a good basis. That's how we got to Veronica Roth's trilogy that Lions Gate snapped up. Divergent was a good choice, than vampires, because the topic isn't only for teen girls. Since Twilight making films from YA books became popular but just ends up being another useless teen trend. The problem isn't that they make it to film, but with the quality of the films. Okay so how does Divergent stack up. The story: It's a futuristic Chicago, society is divided into five factions: Abnegation (the selfless), Amity (the peaceful), Candor (the honest), Erudite (the intelligent) and Dauntless (the brave), people are sorted based on their aptitude tests. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) has grown up in Abnegation, the faction that is selfless and runs the government, though she has always been fascinated by Dauntless. Each year, 16-year olds undergo a serum-based aptitude test that indicates the faction into which they would best fit, and informs their choice at the Choosing Ceremony. Beatrice takes the test with Dauntless woman as her proctor. Her test shows attributes of several factions, meaning she is Divergent. Tori records her result as Abnegation, and warns her to keep the true result secret, telling her that since Divergents can think independently and the government cannot control their thinking, they are considered threats to the social order. The next day at the Choosing Ceremony Beatrice chooses Dauntless. After the brutal training we find out more and more about the problems in this perfect world and there is a love story too. The film is based on an interesting world, that I think is a good basis for a film and carries us through the first half hour of the film, but there is no social critique even though it could have been included. Beatrice unfortunately doesn't compare to the many layers of Katniss' personality. The rest of the characters make the film interesting. One of the biggest positives of the film is that even though there is a love story it's not too important. I didn't read the book but apparently they changed it a little but I don't think that hurt the film, but there are 2 things wrong with it. 1: it's 2 ½ and if you haven't read it it's not interesting, apart from the first ½ getting to know the world and the end it was boring a few times during the middle. The other mistake: Is the lack of drama, it could have used more seriousness, blood maybe something scary even at the expense of a higher rating. All in all Divergent is one of the better YA adaptations. It's not as good as Hunger Games, but much better than a few flops out there. And it has an actress to rival Jennifer Lawrence who was good in The Spectacular Now. I give it a 6/10. https://www.youtube.com/user/silverscreenreviews1"

Every faction represents something special like bravery etc and the whole inflation has been separated to those faction. In that society where people are being testing, which means that government knows exactly every person's advantage and what they will become in the future, there's a woman (the main character) that the test failed to her and here comes the title.. Divergent. While she knows that she is a Divergent, which mean that they will come after her and kill the sh** out of her, she tries to be part of that society and get lost in the crowd thinking that they won't get wind of her.

This film stands completely on its own and I can't wait for the sequels because audiences have got the biggest surprises in store for them if the the filmmakers stay true to the books, which considering how great and true the first film was, they will. I had such low expectations for this film after the flops we have had in YA (minus THG) recently and I think that is why I was so blown away with this. It's exiting, enticing and executed so well. The acting is top notch and they drive the narrative, creating such depth to them and bringing them alive from the books. Ignore everything you thought about YA and go into this film with an open mind and I promise you will at least like it a bit to see the next sequel that has already got the green light."

"frankrensen","8","0","1","3 May 2014"," Finally, an old-fashioned great film
","I have watched a lot of the newer movies that came out over the years that were part of either an older franchise, or an older theme. With the latter example, where a new movie adapts an older theme, I mean divergent. Two great classic dystopian novels, 1984 and Fahrenheit 451 have both been converted into excellent motion pictures. But when you see franchises like Godzilla, James Bond, or Star Wars take a turn for the worse in the later adaptations, I often feel that the movie industry is also fading in quality. But then, movies like Divergent pop up and rejuvenate the idea I seem to have of Hollywood. It is an excellent film, in storyline, acting, screenplay, and, what is o so important to me, staying true to the older movies that have comparable themes (like 1984, but mostly my favourite Fahrenheit 451). Do not doubt about seeing this film, ever. The themes and storyline are familiar, yet refreshing because of the modern-day extra's like romance, emotion and action."

I don't want to list the details but there are many. At times the movie becomes a little too melodramatic. Shailene Woodley was OK in her role but in real life she'd never survive. I think she was miscast.<br/><br/>If you're like me, you'll spend a few edgy moments getting past that and if you're lucky you'll be able to enjoy the movie for what it is.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie gets bogged down and has too many shootout and kung-fu scenes for my liking.

In the first 10 minutes of the movie, I thought it was really boring but then after then the movie got really interesting because the acting was really good witch made it believable by the audience. One thing that I would say for the next movie is that they have more settings in the movie also have more action in the movie. The ending of the movie. That was the best part of the movie because that is when the action started and after the movie thought that this movie is way better movie than The Hunger Games. The best part of the movie to me was when Tris was at the final stage and then we saw her fears and at one point Tris started to kick a guy. Also I was was about to cry when Tris parents die at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>I think that this is the best movie of 2014 so far because it was really an amazing movie and I would love to watch the movie over and over again because that is how good the movie is to me.

","This first series of movie that comes out from the stories written by Veronica Roth is worth watching! The story of Hunger Game-ish type that takes place somewhere in sometime that's intriguing to see. <br/><br/>This movie falls more into the direction of the young adults that wants to have sensation of romantic action type of movie. The story that develops more as the story progresses in the point view of a woman certainly gives out more points into the movies nowadays and it happened in Hunger Games but it actually felt more in this movie! The process of thoughts that runs through a teenager girl in facing the adversaries of getting through emotional situations and feelings of believing in something no matter what gives out the story of the movie! <br/><br/>Despite so many things happened in the novel is not screened in the movie, it has depicted the main concept into the screen.

","My thoughts before the movie: I'm honestly scared to see this movie because I feel like it won't be anything like the book.<br/><br/>My thoughts after the movie: Whoever was in charge of casting deserves an award. Shailene Woodley is the perfect Tris. I was a little nervous about Theo James at first because he seems a bit old to play Four, but he's the perfect Four. Miles Teller is hilarious as Peter. Kate Winslet is such an amazing actress that she made me hate Jeanine even more than I already did. I love how the special effects crew made Chicago look as if there had been a war there and not like the typical futuristic city. Although the movie wasn't 100% accurate, it was pretty close to the book. I see why they left out the things that they did. But, I'm really disappointed that they didn't have the butter knife scene, Uriah, and Dauntless cake in the movie at all. Uriah's name was on the ranking board, but that doesn't explain his character and he is really important in Insurgent and Allegiant. I also didn't like that Tris just shot Will and moved on without any emotion. I hated that, in the movie, they didn't really go in depth with the secondary characters and I think that they should have because friends are an important part of the book. Overall, the movie stayed true to the book. I really enjoyed the movie and will definitely be seeing it again on theaters.<br/><br/>My Three Words: Action-packed, wonderful, and intriguing<br/><br/>My Rating: 8/10"

There is however a group of people that have more versatile personalities, called 'divergent', and the establishment wants to terminate them because they are considered as problematic.<br/><br/>The main character realises that she belongs to this rare group of people which instead of causing her to feel special she knows she is material for extermination.<br/><br/>On the positive side, there is a futuristic look and feel to this movie, people accept they are not free and somehow try to live with this reality. There is even some resemblance with the Hunger Games and it does convey a decent moral story where one could even go so far as to think this is some form of North Korea.<br/><br/>Whilst the story has merits, it does not go very deep and the tendency to insert a romantic story into this fight for survival deprives it from further points."

","From seeing the trailer a while ago. I forgot about this film then I saw the trailer on TV. <br/><br/>I haven't read the book so I can't compare the film against it.<br/><br/>The main character played by Shailene Woodley seemed strange seeing her since I am currently watching the secret life of an American teenager. In that see seems quiet but in the film she seems to have more courage. She played the role in this film very well and I can't really think of someone that would fit it better.<br/><br/>Although she isn't a main character Maggie Q. From being in Nikita, priest and die hard 4.0. She has different personalities but her kindness and taking care of another person in this film and in Nikita makes her perfect for being in this movie since she was helping Tris (Shailene Woodley) was good.<br/><br/>Overall I found this film good. And makes me think, could this actually happen. People being divided into factions and controlled. Although this is after a war that broke out. <br/><br/>I would like to do what the actors did, like jump out a moving train, jump off a building into a hole and land on a net. I known that most of the scenes use CGI and the fall isn't that far. If this was a real thing I would go in this faction just to have an adrenaline rush.<br/><br/>What would you do?"

","This movie is great in my opinion, since I have read the book, and you MUST read the book before you watch this movie. Since I haven't read Divergent since New Year's Eve 2014, I don't remember some parts in this movie, but it's mainly because some parts were changed, deleted, and or altered, so that's why it's good to read the original.<br/><br/>This movie does contain sensual scenes, shooting violence, and blood/gore, so I suggest unless your child is mature for this, kids under 13 shouldn't really watch this film. Especially not your 6 year old children. I saw a small family with a mother and her two girls leave the movie theater, and I am 100% sure it was because of the loud shooting noises and the blood. <br/><br/>It has stunning quality and good visual effects, and the moral of never giving up, being brave, and the main plot is fine, with no major alters, but it still annoys me it's not exactly the same.

","This movie definitely held my interest, but I had a lot of questions when I left the theater. I am not sure if that's a good or a bad thing, but I am getting little tired of these trilogy movies where you have to wait for the second book for things to really start to gel. Where are the really old people? Why are there no stores? Do they have currency? With one city, how does it not get over-populated? As you can tell, I haven't read the books. I may though. I downloaded a sample on Kindle. Everyone in it is very attractive. The whole movie is pretty neat looking. The general premise was a little derivative, but still an interesting enough concept and some of the details were interesting, like the names of the different factions and how each of them was kind of a caricature of the society. If it had less of a budget, it would be a SyFy original. I thought it had a better message than the first Hunger Games. It's obviously a statement on non-conformity."
"triple-e","7","0","1","19 April 2014"," Engaging Movie, but does not do the story justice
","It is impossible to expect a movie to be identical to a novel, especially when the novel is filled with so many details. However, the movie adaptation of Divergent not only changed parts of the novel, but altered the characterization of many of the initiates and even completely left out some important characters and events. For those who see the movie without having read the novel first, it is a thrilling and engaging story. But for those who have already read the true story, it leaves us wanting much more.<br/><br/>WARNING: SPOILERS On the plus side, Divergent's cast was stunning, and the chemistry between the lead characters was breathtaking. Those who did not read the books would be able to easily understand the plot. The final scenes were very emotional, thanks to the brilliant acting of the cast, and the entire movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>However, the film seems to focus more on events then the actual characters were are extremely important to the plot. Several characters are never even mentioned. Al's friendship with and feelings for Tris are never made clear, so one who has not read the novel would not understand why his death is so significant to her. Peter's brutality towards Tris and all of the transfers is so oversimplified he seems more like any other transfer than a lifelong enemy to Tris. In one of the last scenes, in which Tris must find a way to shut down the simulation, the plot was unnecessarily altered. Rather than just Tris and Tobias alone in the room, Jeanine Matthews and a number of soldiers were also present. Although this added additional action to the scene. it took away from the intimacy and emotional connection between Tris and Tobias during this scene. After Tobias recognized Tris, they immediately had to start battling soldiers. It gave the final hurrah to Tris for figuring out how to use the simulation on Jeanine, but this created a more predicable and cheesy ending.<br/><br/>Considering the amazing chemistry between Woodley and James, it was a disappointment that the movie didn't delve farther into their relationship. Tris never refers to ""Four"" by his real name, taking away from the special connection only they have. In fact, during one of the fear simulations in which Tris is afraid of being intimate with Tobias, it seems more like he is trying to rape her, which just makes the scene seem uncomfortable and out of place.<br/><br/>Overall, Divergent was an engaging and thrilling film with excellent acting and special effects. It is perfectly understandable that the plot had to be shortened for the sake of time, thus changing the story slightly. However, the abundance of inconsistencies between novel and movie leaves viewers longing for more depth into the minds of the characters and their relationships. The movie offers plenty of action, emotion, and romance, but the rest of the story is left to the imagination."

","I expected this movie to be a boring teenage love story because I had never actually seen the previews. Boy was I wrong! The movie starts out kind of slow, but then picks up after the choosing ceremony, and keeps on going without stopping until what seems like a 45 minute long climax scene that makes you wonder how many levels it'll step up.<br/><br/>I enjoy Jai Courtney's portrayal of Eric the Dauntless leader, and the Dauntless faction as a whole. If I was a bit more physically fit I could possibly be one of them. I also enjoy seeing Maggie Q getting a post Nikita role as big as that of Tori.<br/><br/>I do have a few nitpicks though. I don't like how slitting your hand open is shown as being mandatory as it sends a bad message. Also, the relationship between Tris and Four seems to send the vibes that a student having a relationship with her teacher is perfectly OK.<br/><br/>I also think another actor could've pulled off Jeanine better, like Jane Lynch or Kristen Wiig, maybe even Cameron Diaz. It just didn't seem like Kate Winslet was the right choice.<br/><br/>If you're OK with having your kids witness a lot of physical and gun violence, go see this movie. You won't regret it one little bit."

","Just saw the movie. The movie is 2 hr 20 mins but does not feel like it which is refreshing. I have read the books but it was a while ago so I'm not sure what all is in which book any more. The movie stays fairly true to what I remember though. <br/><br/>It's a decent movie and I would recommend seeing it. <br/><br/>From a fan of the books: I was disappointed on the adaptations of parts of the books. The romance between 4 and Tris was really not captured well. They needed a few more moments to show their romance building or needed to expand on the ones they had. I just didn't feel it when Tris said I love you towards the end. I think they needed to go into the fear landscape more not necessarily show more fears but talk about it before they move to the seen with them in the waiting room. They also needed to show what happened to the other top ranked person not just skip to Tris's attack.

","""Divergent"" is about identity and purpose. It takes place in the future where order and control have been established by a rigid government. A society where conformity is derived by fear, societal factions were formed to contain individuals with particular character traits in a sub society. The contradiction of an individual's self-awareness in relation to their affinity toward conformity versus the pursuit of individuality or rebellion, if you will, prevails in this arena.<br/><br/>Neil Burger brings the characters to life as the heroine, Shailene Woodley as Tris, discovers her weaknesses, her strengths, vulnerability, aptitude, willingness and gift in a place where structure is necessary and freedom suppressed. Supporting actors fulfilled their positions in creating the perfect outlook of conformity due to societal disunion. The story was easy to follow in the development of a dystopian community where teenagers are required to take aptitude tests to identify what their true character is. Based on the explicit results, they are forced to choose to dedicate their lives to one of the five factions. Abnegation, where Tris and her brother Caleb are originally from, were raised to live humbly, avoid being vain, remain simple, without creative thought or expression, and avoid conflict at all cost. The Candor are responsible for regulations and law. The Erudite are the elite in knowledge, conservative, and have arrogant tendencies. The Amity are free spirits, happy, and not grounded to anything in particular. The Dauntless are brave soldier-like police enforcement who are trained to uphold the law. They have tattoos and piercings and are perceived to have a thrilling purpose. The faction-less are those who have no known identity or cannot be identified with any of the five factions. Tris, encounters a position of fear when she was advised not to reveal her true character trait. Her future unknown, she follows her gut and chooses a faction where she meets and is immediately drawn to Theo James as Four. To her surprise, what Tris imagined would be an adventurous and rewarding future, the untelling compromise of her decision brings her danger, destruction, pain, mistrust, deception, and need for survival.<br/><br/>The risks and consequences in equality to true life decisions are all too real, but the ability to succeed and overcome even under the most impossible circumstance carries the story with hope. As Tris proceeds to see the corruption in society where neither creativity nor expression of self is intolerable and opposing one's faction inexcusable, the story remains interesting as to see how hope, if any, will prevail.<br/><br/>The cast and characters were believable and interesting to what would be the targeted audience. The support and attraction between Tris and Four culminated in dark warehouses of their training grounds and certainly the development of their resistance from one another to their alliance in finding freedom. To be their true self and the mission to provide the same to others was to be embraced. The creation of a dystopian, futuristic society was depicted by the gaunt look of the faction-less, the damp, dingy, dark rooms and deserted cities of the where Dauntless spent their time, the seemingly untouched, buildings of where the Erudites resided, and the very modest, colorless walls of where the Abnegnation seemingly lived out their lives.<br/><br/>The camera shots and lighting certainly supported the development of what seemed to be a good societal idea to the danger of conformity and what lies ahead. It foreshadows what elements can come out of complete control and how each individual has a will to do what is needed to fulfill their purpose. The long shots of the run-down city represented the utter reality of the desolate state of conformity. Full shots of the characters developed the main characters which helped carry interest throughout the movie."

","Jeanine Mathews: ""You're a poor blend of impulses and impurities."" The storyline is based upon the novel written by the 25 years old Veronica Roth. The novel is a totalitarian dystopia and it showcased how teenagers are trained to fight, kill and rebel against dictatorship. This novel is directed into a movie by Neil Burger, casting the three main characters, Shailene Woodley as Tris (Beatrice), Theo James as Four and Jeanine Matthews (Cast: Kate Winslet), the dictator who ruled the 5 factions of citizens. The main theme of the novel and movie starts with the word ""Divergent"" where in the movie was referred to as someone who behaves and interacts differently from the rest of the populations. As described in the quote, divergent is an impurity and black sheep of the society. Therefore they are hunted down by the dictator Jeanine Mathews.<br/><br/>The populations were diversified into 6 factions. The Abnegation, Erudite, Dauntless, Amity, and Candor which represents selflessness, intelligence, bravery, peace, honesty respectively. Not to be mentioned, those that do not belong to any factions which are homeless and less- fortunate are known as the faction-less group of people. Teenagers are testified to categorize themselves into factions that they belong to, based upon their natural reactions toward fear and judged upon their tactics used during the test. Those whose test results are inconclusive are known as divergent. Tris and Four are the two main characters who did their best to find out why divergents are taken down and the main reason of destroying all divergents. As it is necessary to hear about people's perspectives and ideas about movies, I talked to those who went for Divergent before I did. Regardless of all those negative comments on both movie goers and readers, I made it to the movie. I was really surprise to find out that this Sci-Fi movie was actually using less computer graphics throughout compared to Hunger Games. I admit that the plot and storyline is pretty similar to Hunger Game but if it is compared to Hunger games, it is actually more tactical and unique. If you've watched Hunger Games, you know exactly what you're supposed to expect out of the movie. However, with ""Divergent,"" you just have to watch and feel that excitement with Tris until you found out what was going on. Especially when the setting of the whole movie was under a deep hollow cave than the deep forest like Hunger Games. The major character, Tris is just like a tour guide of the movie taking you from the finding of divergent to discovering the reason behind diminishing all these divergents. I like about the part where Tris was being really naïve and being unprepared about what is going to happen around her and with the people whom she trusts. The movie keeps me excited and makes me think who the good ones and the bad ones are. The movie use short synopsis and does not reveal the twists of the plot until the ending. In addition to the plot, Ellie Goulding's song, ""Dead in the water"" had really expressed the inner side of Tris. I was really thrilled by how that song matches Tris's inner feeling. Overall, the movie is sensational and breathtaking in a way that you would not even want to compare it with Hunger Game. I should say that the movie is more realistic and make me thought about the possibility of such synopsis happening in the mere future. Another credit to the movie would be the fact that there was less romance compared to any other teenage movies I had watched so far. It portrayed more of dilemma between trust and mistrust in a relationship than the overwhelming romance that people dream about. You really don't want to miss a movie that is more realistic and active than Divergent. I would strongly recommend this to teenagers and parents as it is very heart-touching with less romance and more tactics. It is more like a mind training movie and motivation for teenagers than violence."

That our society must change, is obvious. That until we do not change inside, any form that our society will take will always be unstable because we will destroy all again and again, is also obvious. So I like films like this, which show how a possibly good idea can turn bad if people start repeating the same mistakes we are doing. For me, 8/10.<br/><br/>I understand well those who have read the book. But they must understand how difficult it is to put one book in one film."
"kingswoman","6","0","1","12 April 2014"," Divergent - movie review
","Divergent, yet another YA bestseller book trilogy trying to archive the box office caliber close to the Twilight Saga or the Hunger Games, and based on my experiences watching the movie, it might fall a little short. It's hard not to compare Tris to Katniss, and die hard fans can stop yelling ""They're not the same!"", cos I agree, they were very different. As a heroine, I like Tris more. There's going to be some minor spoilers, nothing unpredictable.<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer, I was quite excited. I like Shailene Woodley. Though I haven't seen any movie of hers, I had a feeling that she could be the next Jennifer Lawrence, who is my second Goddess who I worship (since you asked, my absolute first place Goddess, now and forever, is Emma Stone). Shailene added enough lure for me to pick up the books. See, I'm one of those who tries their hardest to first read the books, then see the movie. Because I love books, and because books don't have the two-hour time limit to tell a story. I want the back story, I want the stupid inner dialog to get to know the characters. So I read books. I'm still reading the third and final book, and am actually quite disappointed. The first book was marvelous, I loved Tris. But the second and now the third so far were less than mediocre. It all depends on the ending now. Let's talk about the books later when I finish the whole trilogy. Let's get back to the movie.<br/><br/>Shailene Woodley makes a great Tris. She's not the traditional kind of beautiful, but she can be very pretty. I imagine Tris to be more muscular towards the end of the movie, but Shailene did carry herself with more dignity and pride after she had been training with the Dauntless. She was believable as a warrior, especially at the final fighting scenes. I'm not sure if the real Tris do come across in the movie, because it lacked the inner dialogs from the books. The reasons and struggles behind making every decisions don't quite come across, because while Shailene is a very good actress, nobody's that good. Another thing is, I keep marveling how good an actress she is during the movie, but that's just the thing. She kept reminding me that she's an actress, she didn't quite become Tris at any point for me.<br/><br/>I was OK with Theo James's Four. He was easy on the eyes, he's butch enough for the role, but he lacks that certain charm and mysteriousness that I imagined in my head that Four would possess. While I'm fine with Theo being Four, I don't feel loyal enough for me to care if they find another actor to play the role in the next movies. Shailene and Theo's chemistry was medium heat. It was believable but I didn't blush when they kiss but they do look good next to each other. <br/><br/>As for the supporting cast, both Kate Winslet and Ashley Judd were outstanding. For others, they didn't have the time for character development. Like Peter for example. He seemed more petty than cruel in the movie, in the books he did some despicable things to Tris. And where was the Edward story line? <br/><br/>The movie seemed quite rushed for an over-two-hour feature. It had next to no breaks for breathing and absorbing. All the relationship seemed shallow. I didn't get the material nor the time to feel the tension or friendships, to mourn or to cheer. And the script had several alternations and rearrangements of the story line compared to the book, most made the story move on smoother, but some were just annoying. Like the hugging of the Prior family before the Choosing Ceremony, thus stepping out of the faction habits. But I guess they didn't explain the faction habits enough for anyone to notice. I'm actually surprised that the author Veronica Roth allowed that many changes to her books. Though considering the quality of the next books, maybe it's a good thing that they take quite much liberty to alter the books.<br/><br/>All in all, if I consider the movie and the book separately, Divergent the movie isn't half bad."
"sesht","Null","0","2","10 April 2014"," Not as spectacular, now
","Neither have the books withstood it, nor will the movie/s - the comparison to 'The Hunger Games' works, and other t(w)een/YA franchises out there. <br/><br/>Straight-off, let me be the one to say that this one pales in comparison, in every department. The style, look, production and art design is evocative of Andrew Niccol's Gattaca and In time, albeit without the polish (and that's not a good thing) that both of those had (Sad that he had to kill his goodwill with 'The Host' - and it is creepy that both Diane Kruger in that one, and Kate Winslet in this one, are characterized in a similar fashion, along with their looks).<br/><br/>The film begins strongly, and has one of the most strongest 1st half's committed to mainstream film. Its when people start sharing/viewing each others' dreamscapes that it started losing me, and by the time it chugs along to the very contrived ending, that's no surprise to any veteran of teen dystopia, this is completely run out of steam.<br/><br/>Neil Burger has made better flicks, though this one does benefit from his involvement.<br/><br/>Theo James fits the part, Shailene Woodley's as good as Jen Law, in basically a relatively more straight-forward role, with her 'Spectacular Now' co-star, Miles Teller, this time locking horns with her rather than lips. Winslet's alright, as are Judd and Goldwyn, and there are others who might prove their mettle in the sequels. And oh, in case you were wondering, Maggie Q's wasted, as is Mekhi Phifer. On the other hand, Jai Courtney and Miles Teller have their moments.<br/><br/>The cinematography and soundtrack are top-notch, with one sequence being scored spectacularly so, at around the 20 minute mark, when the leads are being 'initiated' into their new faction. Another thing that went wasted - the propensity for full- blown parkour. Sad.<br/><br/>The icky teen-romance bit is toned down, which is a relief, since it has been done to death since those sparkly vampire movies. And yes, you do find yourself thinking about not just the Hunger games franchise, but also Twilight, Mortal instruments, Warm bodies et al.<br/><br/>I just wish more care had been taken to ensure that the movie's 2nd half matched the momentum, as well as the quality of the 1st. Plus, the depiction of future-tech in this is borderline pathetic, working just like a bad Bollywood flick to force our suspension-of-disbelief up about 9,99,9999 notches. OK, not That bad, but Bad, fo sho. Not done, not in this day and age. Not a good thing, by any means. Here's hoping the sequel fares better from those perspectives."

The hard working erudite and the lazy erudite? The sadistic erudite and the merciful erudite? <br/><br/>Veronica Roth has quite a few options for a trilogy of prequels if she doesn't become the rich, lazy, caring erudite!<br/><br/>All in all, an interesting interpretation of an ant farm bursting from the roof of its glass casing."

For me, I read the entire series, and I went into the film with low expectations. Happy to say that the film surprised me a few times, but after the 100 minute mark I lost interest. The film shouldn't have been so stretched out, seeing as they could have cut or even condensed certain unnecessary scenes like some of the mindless banter between Tris and friends, or even the first dining hall scene. I've found that those who have read the book agree with me. Thise who haven't enjoyed the pace because it made the film easy to follow and understand. So it's a win lose for viewers. <br/><br/>In terms of technical, well I'm not that big a fan of some of the CGI, there are times when you can go ""oh this is definitely fake"" but all in all not a bad job. One of my favorite shots is when Tris is walking down the hallway to the main control room. Nice classic directioning and movement. I won't get too in detail seeing as most of you who read this probably haven't taken a film studies class before.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this film, but only to those who have 3 hours to kill. Add up the 140 minutes of film and the inane previews and that's a grand total of about 160 minutes.

Hence, to be safe, she must choose a faction and live her life.<br/><br/>Quite a bit of the movie showed her training in her chosen faction and this was awesome to watch. It was awesome to see her go from the underdog to a badass, and it felt believable that she became an efficient fighter. The romance in the movie felt alright as well; didn't feel like it was forced. The latter part of the movie didn't disappoint me either, it was actually fun and exciting.

","To make things short, it wasn't perfect. It took too long to get to the end, several events were expressed ineffectively, and the characters (mostly supporting) did not develop enough to be likable or cared for.

With the film not being able to show enough psychological aspect of guilt, endearment, friendship, etc., an audience shouldn't be expected to follow through the emotional roller-coaster that a story should take.<br/><br/>However, with that being said, this film was able to present sufficient content as far as the novel goes and were carried through (mostly) by lead actress, Shailene Woodley, who presents the attributes of main character, Tris, with finesse and the right subtlety."

The acting was good and I am eager to see what the two leads will do next. Another thing I liked about the movie is that it didn't rely too heavily on computer generated effects. Not to say they aren't there, but they are not as big apart of the movie as some others. They are only really used to great extent on the simulation sequences, and are not distracting at all. All in all, if you are a fan of the book you will enjoy this movie."

","Several years recently, there are many women's adventure novel put into motion picture. Not many of them got great response, the rest just failed and disappointed. ""Divergent"" is more likely in the middle between those films. It's not that horrible but not so special either. The theme is quite familiar and seems formulaic with other fantasy movie. It has an uninteresting plot, soulless and predictable at climax which could make some audiences feel exhausted after seeing this. Luckily ""Divergent"" is still engaging as a movie and an impressive performance by Shailene Woodley as Tris has also raised this first installment from disaster. Perhaps ""Divergent"" won't make me curious to see the sequel but the movie undeniably has a fine premise as opening franchise and got potential to be fascinating."
"TheMovieVlog","6","0","3","28 March 2014"," ""Divergent"" is very well executed and actually has a surprisingly satisfying story.
","Better than The Twilight Saga but never as good as The Hunger Games, Divergent is the latest YA fantasy adventure to make it to the big screen with all of the aplomb of a soggy paperback. Of course, this adaptation skews way closer to Games, presenting a dystopian near-wasteland where its government-fearing denizens live an almost Quaker-like existence until unrest causes...hey, wake up! Okay, granted, that other series got exponentially better with the sequel, Catching Fire. Divergent, however, wobbly stands on its own slight merits. The ideology and theocracy behind the plot points look about as paper thin as the script pages it was written on, probably a hold-over from the novels on which they were based, which were criticized for the same infraction. The story - though far from ground-breaking - moves along at a brisk and exciting pace thanks to a strong main character, beautifully realized.<br/><br/>In this PG-13-rated sci-fi adventure, Tris (Woodley) learns she's Divergent and won't fit in a world divided by factions based on virtues, so she infiltrates a war-like faction to discover what makes Divergents so expendable to society before it's too late.<br/><br/>Like a certain actress working from, er, in Hunger, Divergent works so well because of an amazing lead performance. Shailenne Woodley runs with the role and never stops, hitting all of the emotional marks and administering - and taking - beatings for 2+ hours. Without the stunning work of director Neil Burger, however, all would be for naught. Though the whole post-war district thing has gotten old, he manages to color outside the lines with enough verve and originality to warrant a sequel. Let's hope the inevitable follow-up aspires more to Catching Fire than catching Eclipse though."

","As an adaptation this movie had both amazingly perfect transitions and horrible mistakes, no wonder reviews are so conflicted about it.<br/><br/>I will go through 1) characters 2) events of the movie to try to explain the best where there was excellence and where was a giant mess.<br/><br/>1) Characters.<br/><br/>Four/Tobias - in the book is the very composed, strong, collected character that has dramatic emotional past which crafted the man he has become - a man who hates being weak so much he will torture himself by facing his own fears every day for the rest of his life not leaving a trace of weakness inside him and keeping himself in check, a man who won't lose his composure ( poetically speaking and literally ). However, do not confuse him with a cold-hearted man that just learned not to care, he has a heart that can warm you up in the coldest situations, if that's what you really need, cause most of the time he will give you tough love. So, not the easiest character to bring to life, to say the least. Unfortunately I cannot say that the movie has done a well enough job at introducing us to this character or making his story have as strong of an impact on the viewer as it had on the reader, as a viewer you probably won't feel the admiration or respect that character really had. However, as someone already 'knowing' what he was like, I'll have to say that, to my greatest joy, Theo James has done unbelievable job making Four as fearless and lovely as he was in the book. If anything, the only difference would be that Four in the movie was less vulnerable, less shaky, more solid and profound than you'd remember him in the book. That change of course took some color of his book-character away, but, to be honest, that color was not fitting him to begin with. Reading the book I always had trouble putting Four-still-a-huge-mess-inside and Four-does-not-even-flinch-meeting-his-biggest-fear together. This way, more believable.<br/><br/>Tris - good! Don't have much to say about her. She is easy to picture for the Tris of the book, she could put together being inexperienced but brave, innocent but not a victim, genuinely scared but smart teenager.<br/><br/>Jeanine - perfection! In my head, Jeanine was one of those people that you just wanna attack physically she was so unbearably senseless in her own ideas. Like you cannot believe her! In the movie Jeanine was a total perfection. She pulled off the Erudite soul so well that I can describe that faction with just her character - her detachment, her weird evilness as if 'I really do mean good to the world'. Even small details like when she is physically approached how it surprises her, how unfamiliar she was to any type of power other than the intelligence. Bravo. <br/><br/>Peter - Now, this is why the movie was boring. You see, the most thrilling part of the story is supposed to be the transition of Tris- Abnegation to Tris-Dauntless, and you know why? Because Peter, the real Peter of this story, made it hell and nightmare for Tris to spend a night in the Dauntless compound. He was not a jerk or a dick or an asshole, he was a psychopath, got it? He wasn't making jokes that made you wanna joke back, he made jokes that made you shiver inside and barely hold your composure. I am fine with certain scenes not being there to make it PG-13, but making a real threatening character instead of, actually, very lovely one, would be much appreciated, thank you!<br/><br/>Other characters were well enough or not too much important to go detailed about. Christina was so well cast it's scary ( I actually visioned exactly her features / appearance ), Al - good, just a bit abrupt, Will - yeah but was I supposed to care for him? Molly - are you kidding me.. She is not bad at all, I felt pity for her.<br/><br/>2) Events<br/><br/>When Tris jumps - that scene - is important for her character building. She does not just jump cause she likes to try, she jumps to show to Peter ( who managed to intimidate her already at that point ) and all his dauntless 'hunters' that she is not a victim. That is her first step from selfless to self preserving. She tosses her jacket on him and jumps! That is a much better scene, why change that to whatever, it's not like it would last any longer than it did.<br/><br/>Christina hanging over the pit scene. Overall, OK. But with the timer it would be something! Without it first Eric feels less of a douche cause you already do expect him to pick her up right before she falls, second, it's less scary. With the timer Christina has only herself to save herself, and you really don't know if she will be able to, cause it's no miracles zone.<br/><br/>Stabbing Edward in the eye. Well, not much to say about this scene cause it wasn't freaking there! Errgh.<br/><br/>Well, as you can see, good points outnumber bad ones, overall quite a good adaptation, but not exactly great, cause the few bad ones were really really off. I am not a detailed reader or watcher, things that stand out to me are probably out there for everyone. I am angry a lot on things like Peter not having anywhere near the vibe from the book, but at the same time genuinely glad for so many others ( Four, Tris, Jeanine, Christine ) being so correctly done. For a reader that's a great pleasure."

","Imagine if high school guidance counselors ran the government, or more like, if they were the government<br/><br/>In DIVERGENT, society is broken up into five factions, ranging from the brains to the needy to the helpful to the muscle, and after an important test, it's ultimately each teenager's choice under which group they will fit into, for life<br/><br/>To delve into all the faction titles would be a waste of time, especially since the source material fans are way ahead of those unaware of the ingredients that make this adaptation work or not So let's just review the film by itself...<br/><br/>The important group is Dauntless, which are basically the police and/or military, and our humble heroine, Tris, secretly a ""Divergent,"" meaning she doesn't fit into any category and could provide a threat to the government, is set to join ranks with the fearless warrior clan.<br/><br/>Most of the story has Tris going through extreme tests, both physical and mental, to become a Dauntless member: like the shyest kid in school joining the Marines. In the leading role, DESCENDANTS starlet Shailene Woodley turns in a good if subdued performance while love- interest Theo James as Four, a hard nosed trainer, really stands out in the acting department, displaying a robotic, militaristic persona that progressively chisels down into a vulnerable guy, without being sappy or predictable. <br/><br/>The best scenes have all the characters competing to remain in the group. Herein Woodley has her own arc, progressing from a timid novice into a cunning fighter, making for a worthwhile action hero within an aesthetic futureworld resembling THE HUNGER GAMES, only not as primitive: Buildings are dilapidated and semi-structured while vast fields, full of immense electric fences, are spread hopelessly across a scorched earth. But the white walled rocky interior, resembling the corridors of Disneyland's Matterhorn ride, is where most of the film takes place, and train tracks connect everything. All this is overseen by high tech computers that aren't very far-fetched: A few of the characters actually use what look like iPads.<br/><br/>Sweeping action coincides smoothly with the storyline, which is somewhat wordy and complimented but still easy to follow. The most suspenseful element is how Tris fights to stay within the boundaries of the group's pecking order while keeping her secret, like a spy undercover, and toning down her capabilities, which is harder than it seems: Imagine a Jedi taking a crash course at Stormtrooper College and you might get the idea. <br/><br/>Overall, DIVERGENT is entertaining yet occasionally goes too deep over non-reader's heads, sporadically veering into seemingly pointless subplots, meant only for later installments, while the climax is stretched about twenty minutes too long. And on a philosophical level, it's interesting how kids today are enlightened by authors influenced by the likes of George Orwell as opposed to the fantastical HARRY POTTER or TWILIGHT craze...<br/><br/>Perhaps the depiction of a ""dystopian"" society, where youth means everything, caters to the intense narcissism of young adults, while the romantic element of sacrifice always works for the female audience: After all, no matter what the genre, escapism is everything!"
