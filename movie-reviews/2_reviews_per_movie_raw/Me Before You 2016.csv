","Absolutely brilliant film. Those who criticise it for dealing with the subject of disabilty should look past the fact Will is disabled and look at the film in the light of what it aims to be, a touching, romance film. Emelia Clarke is great. Sam Claflin is brilliant. A definite must see film."
"pattypiazza","10","205","237","9 September 2016"," A Most Beautiful Love Story
","At times I feel that humanity has forgotten, or never really knew, what it is to really love someone. Jojo Moyes obviously isn't one of those people. Love isn't the lust we feel at the beginning of a relationship. It's not the thoughtful vision we compile of what the future could be like or how compatible we are. It's not about how financially successful a prospective partner is. It's certainly not all about sex, although it would be hard to come to this conclusion when the media generally plays strongly to that idea. It's the undeniable, overwhelming pull from our hearts that grows only when we really let ourselves care about someone unselfishly. <br/><br/>Thank you Jojo for playing this out so beautifully. Thank you Emelia and Sam for either knowing this experience or fabulously, convincingly portraying it on screen. This movie is a treat to watch and a glimpse of what it feels like to be a person who lives their life with a moral conscience, an open mind, a respect for beliefs that are different than yours and a desire to see the best in the world. <br/><br/>I feel absolutely cleansed of negativity after watching this and my hope for the world is renewed. A glorious experience!"
"whitbyscallyred","9","352","428","3 June 2016"," Clarke is adorable and the critics get it wrong
","How can so many people get this this movie wrong, especially the critics? The high point of the film is the performance by Emelia Clarke. She is hair-brained, and scatty, completely adorable and wonderful.The camera-work is gorgeous and the soundtrack is second to none.<br/><br/>Lou (Emilia Clarke) gets a job as a carer to a man (William) who is paralyzed more or less from the neck down. A budding friendship/romance develops; and this is 90% a feel good movie.<br/><br/>The criticism of the movie that it depicts a life with profound disability as almost worthless is completely mistaken. The movie depicts William's life as worthwhile and precious. It is William's own judgment that his life cannot go on as it is, and that he would prefer to die.<br/><br/>With regard to this, the movie does tend to downplay the pain and suffering that William experiences. Instead it focuses on the good times and precious moments he spends will Lou. And as already stated, the character of Lou is completely adorable. I am in love."

","The movie really was adorable! I knew exactly what to expect since I read the book, but I loved the adaptation. <br/><br/>What helps the movie most is that the novelist, Jojo Moyees, wrote her own screenplay. She did a great job transitioning the story from paper to screen. Little things that were left out of the novel weren't really needed to move the story along. <br/><br/>Both Emilia Clarke and Sam Clafin were excellent. Her facial expressions were amazing and her insane eyebrows deserve some type of award all on their own. <br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed the soundtrack as well.<br/><br/>Don't listen to critics and go see this movie."

","This film is getting mixed reviews, but I really enjoyed it. A very bittersweet film that will leave you feeling happy and sad at the same time. I never read the book that which this film is based on. But sometimes movies are never has detailed has the books they are based on.<br/><br/>A beautifully well made story, it about Louisa(Emilia Clarke) a 26 year old who finds a job taking care of Will(Sam Claflin) a young billionaire who is permanently confined to wheel chair after an accident two years earlier, the use of his arms and legs are gone. At first Will does not want Louisia there, and she does her best to put up with him. But soon the form quite a friendship, she teaches him to enjoy life again, and he shows her to be adventurous in life. But the question is will this last? <br/><br/>I like the chemistry between Claflin and Clarke, at no point it feels forced. I really bought the affection they feel for one another. At times Clarkes performance feels overly cartoonish, but still good in most of it. Claflin is believable, and the question is how would you feel if you where in his shoes. I don't care what the critics say, this was a perfectly well made bittersweet film."

","I admit that I have read the book and so when the movie came out, I just HAD to go see it. So I drag my poor husband and we went to watch a late show that was relatively full. I didn't tell him anything about the movie and I watched him watching it. He actually really enjoyed it. The movie was lovely. The movie itself was beautiful. The scenery was set somewhere is rural England. There are green pastures, a castle and beautiful stone walkways. <br/><br/>We first meet Lou, a beautiful,charming, bubbly girly girl who is a strong character but maybe a little too comfortable with her current life and then we have Will. Dashing Will! Sarcastic, funny, a little mean at first. They are world apart but through fate ( and Will disabilities) they met and slowly realize what one possessed, the other needs. Even if they never really knew it. <br/><br/>As the movie progress, they falls for each other and we all fall for them. I loved Emily as Lou and Sam as Will. They played their roles perfectly and the chemistry between then was undeniable. I think everyone should go and watch this movie if you love romantic comedy. It is hilarious at times and yet sweet. I assure you that you'll feel every emotion out there with this movie. It's so beautiful. <br/><br/>Go watch it and judge yourself. For me, this is an amazingly beautiful love story."
"dewittambassador","9","90","120","2 July 2016"," I don't like sappy movies, but I really liked this sappy movie. Clarke wins again.
","Emelia Clarke's work on Game of Thrones is the only reason I watched this movie in the first place. She is occasionally transcendent in that role, where she must keep her eyebrows restrained, and I wanted to see what would happen if her amazingly mobile brows were set free ... free as her dragons.<br/><br/>There are a lot of solid things about this movie. The story (of a young woman who cares for a quadriplegic young man) is strong, the direction and cinematography good though not exceptional, the screen writing also good-not-exceptional, the supporting cast (especially Janet McTeer and Charles Dance)and leading man (Sam C.) quite good, and the emotional notes it hits, though all predictable and often a bit overwrought (cue swelling, heartwarming music...), ring true enough for an unabashed romance.<br/><br/>So, not really my type of movie. But I am happy to say that I was (almost) completely taken by Clarke's performance. Her character here is nothing like her GoT role, but is in many ways an equally fantasy-based role (but with clumsy shyness and striped leggings instead of fireproof skin and dragons) -- and Clarke manages to pull this character out of romantic fantasy into believability as effectively as she brings to life her role as Mother of Dragons. She has the combination of charisma, physical beauty, character-acting chops, and inner luminosity to pull a fairly nice, 7-of-10 heartwarmer up to a 9-of-10 charmer."
"emixam-28961","10","178","249","2 June 2016"," The Tear-Jerking ""Me Before You"": Reminding Ourselves of Living Boldly!
","Thea Sharrock's film adaptation of Jojo Moyes's ""Me Before You"" is one of those hidden gems, which we should all watch rather early than later. <br/><br/>First, the talented British cast is impressive. Emilia Clarke, Sam Claflin, Janet McTeer, Charles Dance, Matthew Lewis, just to name a few, beautifully create an emotional journey, which is more than just a heart-breaking love story. Challenging our life perspectives every step of the way, these actors invite us to live boldly and seize the opportunities passing by. <br/><br/>Louisa Clarke (Emilia Clarke), a naive 26-year old English woman, lives in a peaceful village where nothing seems to be happening. Supporting her whole family financially, Lou has a dull life working hard without ever leaving our native city. When she loses her job at Buttered Bun Cafe, her world is turned upside down. Desperately looking for a new job, she goes to the local job center and is proposed to work for a despicable 30ish-year old quadriplegic man called Will Traynor. His desire not to get help makes him look miserable and frustrated. However, with time, Lou pierces his shell and unveils Will's true colors. She starts showing him how great his life could be. But one revelation changes their relationship forever.<br/><br/>Best known for his roles as Finnick Odair in ""The Hunger Games"" series, Sam Claflin's portrayal of Will is exquisite. It is almost inconceivable to imagine him not being a part of this movie. The physical and psychological challenge of playing a quadriplegic man, who needs to feel like a man again, elevates the English-born actor to Hollywood's acting A-list. In ""Me Before You"", Claflin convinces us that words are way more impactful than being good looking. Through his presence on the screen, Claflin inhabits one of the most powerful quotes of Jojo Moyes's original story, ""You only get one life. It is actually your duty to live it as fully as possible"". <br/><br/>Playing opposite Claflin, Emilia Clarke (""Game of Thrones"") shines through with her naivety and authentic, clumsy attitude on the screen. Her unique facial expression, while crying and laughing, makes us fall even more for the quirky, innocent Lou. No one could have ever filled the role better than the Mother of Dragons herself. Emilia Clarke is LOU CLARKE! From her crazy outfits in the movie to her charming personality, Clarke has it all. ""Me Before You"" will be the catalyst in her career, so let's be ready to see some more of this bumble bee.<br/><br/>On a final note, we should be grateful to Jojo Moyes for questioning us on the reality of assisted suicide and physical disabilities.There are not lots of writers who have been able to make such a statement and shake the status quo when it comes to life and death, but Moyes did it beautifully. <br/><br/>The only thing left to say is: GO WATCH this movie! You will not regret it! It will make laugh, cry, but most importantly push you to embrace life fully!<br/><br/>P.S. Bring with you some tissues! You might need them!"
"mmbudny","8","39","51","5 September 2016"," Thoroughly enjoyed the movie
","All movies can be scrutinized for faults, as some reviewers have done, but if the movie makes a mark, then those faults really don't matter, do they? I found the ""angry"" Will Traynor not completely believable, not like the anti-social Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets, but Sam Clafin did well with his transformation. Emilia Clarke was absolutely wonderful and I will be on the lookout for other roles she has taken and will undertake in the future. Kudos also to the characters who played Will's parents, Janet McTeer and Charles Dance. Two thumbs up for the movie. Am seriously considering whether the movie ought to bump another movie off my favorite 50 relationship movie list."
"Doasnow95","8","75","109","3 July 2016"," Amazing
","I loved this movie. It stayed very true to the book and I love the book. I think Emilia Clarke was born to play her. I feel like she was just playing herself cause she has a personality like that in real life. It was pure joy to watch her play Lou. The expressions she makes, the way she talks and most of all, her amazing clothes! I loved every single outfit she wore. This film made me laugh and it made me very emotional, just like the book. I think Sam Claflin was also born to play Will. They had an amazing chemistry throughout the entire film and the rest of the cast is also spot on. There are of course some parts from the book that were left out but nonetheless, this film was still amazing. I also want to point out that the soundtrack of the movie is amazing as well."
"amedineabd","8","34","47","5 September 2016"," A sad but meaningful story!
","One of the best Romantic movies lately.. I am very taken with Emilia Clark's performance and smile. She was amazing and breathtaking. The music is well chosen and the acting is good and there were some very touching moments that will make the audience who didn't watch yet cry. Lou is a funny young woman who wants to live a simple life, who wants to wear clothes and be fashionable in her own way. The paralyzed man is a damaged cause looking for hope. Both these characters are very different, yes they pick things from each other and they put smiles on each others faces. A couple that wouldn't get bored giving and taking to their souls.. Maybe, when it comes to believing in love unconditionally, Faith is hope then. Live the life as it faces you then. In health and sickness. In the sweetest moments and bitterest ones. Just live your life No matter what happens to you. Always get back and fight to survive and be alive. That is what this movie is all about..."
"jbam_46","7","84","129","1 June 2016"," It was a pretty cute
","Felt very derivative of Intouchables I did however really enjoy the romance that was in this film.<br/><br/>Emilia Clark has the most expressive face I have ever seen on camera.<br/><br/>Watch her eyebrows! That's all I have to say. You could almost watch this entire movie just staring at her eyebrows I had a hard time not doing that.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed her character. She is a silly, eccentric, perpetually happy girl. With a pretty eclectic sense of style.<br/><br/>Emilia Clarke was perfectly cast for this role.<br/><br/>She ventures far from her intense power house character the Mother of Dragons from Game of Thrones.<br/><br/>At times it was hard to tell if Emilia Clarke the actress is just extremely expressive with her face, or if it was something she was doing for the role which I suppose speaks to how well she did.<br/><br/>Because I'm thinking she was exaggerating it, therefore she played the part marvellously.<br/><br/>The male lead is Sam Claflin, who you will more than likely recognize but not be able to place. His largest role as of late is the water proficient fighter from the Hunger Games.<br/><br/>I also feel he played the part very well. No complaints, He has a great smile, or smirk, that he does through out, which allows us to empathize with him a little more when he seeming unlikable.<br/><br/>There are a lot of light moments, actually the whole movie has a very light tone to it it's a serious topic, but with Clarke's character it's hard for anything to be too serious or solemn. There are those sombre moments, which is, I'm sure, why I was given a tissue box at the advance screening.<br/><br/>There were only a few editing aspects I didn't enjoy. There were far too many cuts in certain scenes Emilia walking up to the mansion for the first time and her conversation on the bench with her boyfriend. They were distracting. This was sprinkled throughout the film to greater or lesser degrees.<br/><br/>I think the film looked pretty, great locations. And a wonderful set, really. The house Claflin's character lives in looks very nice. I loved all the walls that opened when pushed on. Very modern, and expensive I'm sure.<br/><br/>There is a little treat for any Harry Potter fans! Neville Longbottom, all grown up and looking fit, he plays the part of Emilia Clarke's boyfriend. I hope to see him in more roles, maybe even a lead one day.<br/><br/>As for family friendliness, this movie is a G, it is good to go. In the opening scene Claflin is presumably being intimate with his girlfriend, they are obviously naked, but nothing is shown, they are under sheets.<br/><br/>There is no cursing or obscenities in this movie worth mentioning."
"boodt-62758","10","45","67","10 June 2016"," A wonderful story
","I was expecting the usual American love story, but that's not what this is. I have neither seen nor heard of these actors prior to seeing this film. That said, I usually don't go to see films like this.<br/><br/>What a wonderful movie! The acting was so well done. My heart broke where it needed to break, and it laughed where it needed to laugh. <br/><br/>For those who need help working on their empathy, or the opening of the mind, this is a very good movie to see!<br/><br/>It's very thought provoking and I would even suggest to professors (philosophy,english,cultural perspectives in science, sociology) that they have their students write a paper on this. There are so many issues involved here. Great for discussion!"
"ThomasDrufke","7","52","81","4 June 2016"," Live Boldly
","I wouldn't consider myself the target audience for these romantic dramas. In fact, I'm usually turned off by the overabundance of forced clichés and unnecessary plot devices. While Me Before You definitely falls victim to some of those unfortunate young adult tropes, there's far more charm than harm here. <br/><br/>The film stars Emilia Clarke (Lou) and Sam Claflin (Will) from Game of Thrones and The Hunger Games respectively. I've enjoyed both of their works in the past and they both make the most of the script that was given to them. Their budding charisma on screen is by far the highlight of the film. It's nice to see Clarke take on a lighter and more exuberant role than she has played in the past as it mirrors her off-screen personality as well. <br/><br/>Clarke's likability as Lou is put a test as she has to deal with the stern and far less cheerful, Will, who became paralyzed after a motorcycle accident. If you didn't guess it already, yes they do grow to live with each other's quirks and inconveniences and maybe even share some affection for each other. It's pretty much the basis for all of these romantic novels adapted for film, but if you're film has enough likable qualities to it, the overused plot points and clichés can be forgiven.<br/><br/>The main qualm for these characters are Will's questionable wishes about his future living as a quadriplegic and Lou's inability to fulfill her potential and aspirations due to her commitment as the breadwinner for her family. The way Lou effortlessly deals with these issues is what makes her so likable. It's also why you root for her and Will to become romantically involved as the film gives us compelling enough reasons to desire it. With that said, I was pleasantly surprised with how the romance is depicted. Everything is earned and not forced.<br/><br/>I think my only real complaints with the film involve its tendency to veer into clichéd territory. I'm not a fan of when romantic films play popular songs that tell you exactly how to feel as an audience member. Or when a certain character is written specifically to give us someone to dislike and is used a plot device more than anything else. On more than one occasion, Me Before You does that. But it's when the film attempts to take an original and realistic spin on the romance that the film really shines. It's because of the ladder that I think Me Before You is definitely worth a look.<br/><br/>+Clarke's undeniable likability<br/><br/>+Charm and chemistry with the Lou and Will dynamic<br/><br/>+Romance is earned not forced<br/><br/>-Popular songs tend to ruin the big moments<br/><br/>-A few clichéd characters and plot devices<br/><br/>7.4/10"
"tashlast","8","7","8","4 January 2020"," Romantic Dramas are often a hit or miss
","But this movie brought a very solemn smile and tear to my face when I watched it. I genuinely loved this movie. I had two reasons to go watch it in theaters when it came out. 1.) I love Emilia's performance in GOT and wanted to check this out. 2.) I have been needing to drag my boyfriend out to watch it with me.<br/><br/>In the end , Clarke and Claflin have great chemistry, and my heart truly broke when the movie was coming to an end. Most people who hated this movie have told me ""Oh, it promotes the suicide of the disabled,"" but that isn't true. I have a friend who is disabled. Paraplegic, and she basically lives in her wheelchair except when she needs assistance to get to other places. I wanted to get her view on it, so I took her to watch the movie 2 weeks later. When the movie finished she was in tears. She gave me a pat on my lap and asked for a hug and whispered ""Thank you"" into my ears. She is a huge sap for romance movies, she explained how it was touching that a movie was touching on the idea of people on life support who find it a struggle to survive. She said that yes, it was unfortunate that William wanted to end his life, it made her happy to see that he was cared for by person who loved him and he didn't die in vain, but with a sense of fulfillment.<br/><br/>Maybe it might send mixed messages, but hearing firsthand from a friend who basically told she knows what its like to be William that this movie wasn't insulting to her made me happy and brought a tear to my eye. Humanity is failing to know what love truly means. People tend to go the looks, wealth and lust in relationship at first, but we forget the friendship, the bond and company that love brings, which is why so many relationships fail nowadays. And this movie shows that everyone is deserving of a chance to love. Even the more challenged people are deserving of love. This movie sends a lovely sentiment, and I am glad I saw this movie."

Both characters were charismatic, and enjoyable, and matched the dialogue of the book, which I thought was great.<br/><br/>The movie itself was heartbreaking, hilarious at points, and just and lovable. The story itself is well thought out and great. One of the best things about this, is it is not just your usual love story. The real love doesn't take over the whole plot. It isn't fully made to feel intimate, but just to feel real.<br/><br/>So I say: Go see it. If you are a boy or girl, it doesn't matter. This movie is memorable for everyone."

It is nice to sometimes be able to empathize with the characters as well. I can't really think of anything negative at this point either. Maybe that most of the movie was kind of predictable.

"jrarichards","8","6","7","30 June 2016"," Worthwhile, moving film with much more edge than it may first seem to have
","Reasonably, this film (based on Jojo Moyes's book and screenplay) is indeed 'romantic drama' more than 'rom-com"", which is not to deny its comedic elements. But all should know that there is a powerful, demanding current capturing this film, which draws in part on the case of disabled British rugby player Daniel James and the question of his parents being charged for accompanying him to Switzerland's Dignitas clinic (in the end they were not). In the (full) cinema I was in, there really were few dry eyes in the house. I'll concede that mine stayed dry (not always the case), though I still find the piece affecting and thought-provoking and unquestionably worth seeing.<br/><br/>2 big questions concerned Emilia Clarke's chances of getting beyond (and above) Danaerys, and Sam Claflin's ability to portray someone who combines near-total physical disability with marked vulnerability to infection - the double whammy that convinces our hero that his life really and truly and literally is not worth living.<br/><br/>To my mind, both questions can be answered affirmatively.<br/><br/>Claflin's character Will Traynor is good-looking, rich and still influential. He has a commanding personality (if mostly initially grumpy and arrogant), a sharp mind and a capacity to develop Clarke's character Lou(isa) ... Clark (yes, really). That begs A LOT of questions (not sidestepped) about the contribution he can still make, not least because he has support (moral and financial) from loving and well-to-do parents - nicely done by Janet McTeer and Charles Dance. And of course not least because he makes Lou Clark love him, even though she at first has a relationshp with Patrick (played by Matthew Lewis), which is not getting very far, but is genuine, affectionate and definitely physical, if also sustained by Clark's decency and supportive nature. <br/><br/>Patrick is by no means a failure (he's been Entrepreneur of the Year). He's a bit dull, but not stupid or unkind, and of course he's a triathlon-type athlete. Yet he can't quite offer Lou what Traynor can (a huge and demanding thought in itself).<br/><br/>And Emilia Clarke does indeed offer a convincing and often-touching portrayal of that growing love (as mirrored in her character's personal development in terms of interests and style and maturity - though emphatically not basic kindness, decency, humility and optimism with life, given that this is manifest from the outset and never wavers).<br/><br/>This is actually then a demanding role. So much emphasis is placed on Clark's eccentric dress sense that one might start to write her off as a bit oafish. But that does not pan out. Clark is (over-?) loyal to her family, helping out financially, and so taking jobs below her potential. But she does what she does with conviction and optimism, puts all her heart and soul into each of her jobs, and she does know who she is. Hence her metamorphosis in the film adds new dimensions, but not at the expense of the old ones.<br/><br/>Emilia Clarke is great at all this, and she proves well able to portray inner beauty increasingly augmented by outward beauty in the more conventional sense; and when Clark looks at - and touches - her nearly immobile charge, an audience-member not made of stone is going to feel the power of the affection, and also the restraint associated with the inevitable non-physicality and asymmetry of the bond.<br/><br/>At at least one point in the film a comparison with Stephen Hawking is made, and this is not an idle one. There are also references to ""My Left Foot"" and that film's real-life Irish hero Christy Brown. Hawking steadily lost abilities, yet espoused technology to fight back and contribute. He wanted to understand the universe, and he has lived longer than anyone else ever with his disease. Christy Brown taught himself to do great and wonderful things with the limb he could still control (hence the title of the story). At first glance, Traynor has fewer aces than Brown (whose story in fact ended unhappily with his death aged 49 in 1981), though more than Hawking (whose amazing story continues). Yet Traynor wants out and is committed to that idea with a devotedness that even Clark's love cannot shift.<br/><br/>In spite of the chocolate-box pretty Pembrokeshire, Buckinghamshire and Mediterranean locations, this is not forgettable movie-candy. One does indeed return to the subject. And the person I saw it with came back at me a while after with the suggestion that Traynor and Clark could have married, had a kid (not necessarily even adopted?), and been worthwhile and useful and good parents making a contribution to the next generation, all the more so given further years of support from his parents and also her family (portrayed sympathetically enough by the familiar Brendan Coyle, Samantha Spiro and Jenna Coleman). And while that would have involved sacrifice and risk (given Traynor's endless susceptibility to disease that would presumably have done for him soon enough), it would have left a legacy.<br/><br/>There's really no answer to that, given that Traynor chooses to eschew such options; and - as the film emphasises again and again - that's his sovereign decision in regard to his life. One gets the feeling that Clark's mother would not accept that choice, but the other characters come round to the idea - with great reluctance, but nevertheless.<br/><br/>This is then a modern and radical film in a pretty and often traditional setting, but - as the above, nuanced references in it make clear - it is not judge and jury, at least not 100%. That role therefore falls to us, and this is as always a precious thing a (better) film can offer its audience."

","This film is one of those rare instances where a novel (by JoJo Moyes) is adapted for the screen by the novelist and finds a sensitive director such as Thea Sharrock and the result is a story that could have been sanguine but instead is an enriching emotional journey. To discover this film among all the crime and killing and morbid vampire or other undead creatures stories and overblown CGI comic book/fairy tale adventures is a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>The story takes place in England and in a very subtle way shares an insight between the wealthy and the poor – emphasizing that richness is truly in the spirit rather than the bank account. Lou Clark (Emilia Clarke) knows lots of things. She knows how many footsteps there are between the bus stop and home. She knows she likes working in The Buttered Bun tea shop and she knows she might not love her long-term boyfriend Patrick (Matthew Lewis). Her family (Brendan Coyle, Jenna Coleman, Samantha Spiro and Alan Breck) needs money and insist Lou seek employment when Lou loses her job: it is out of pure fortitude that she finds one - as caretaker of a young wealthy quadriplegic – a job that ultimately keeps her sane. Will Traynor (excellent Sam Claflin) knows his motorcycle accident took away his desire to live. He is supported by his male nurse Nathan (the superb Stephen Peacocke) as well as his loving parents (Janet McTeer and Charles Dance). He knows everything feels very small and rather joyless now and he knows exactly how he's going to put a stop to that – a planned death after fulfilling his parent's plea for a six month reprise. What Will doesn't know is that Lou is about to burst into his world in a riot of color. And neither of them knows they're going to change each other for all time until Lou concocts a bucket list of events that brings light into her life as well as joy into Will's final days.<br/><br/>Without becoming morbid, the interplay between Lou and Will is a transformation and due to the splendid script and sensitive direction and a cast of superb actors in every part this little film makes a lasting impression, restoring our faith in what friendship and love can achieve. In short, this is a brilliant little film worthy of at least one watching- if not multiple! Highly recommended."

","Repeat, spoiler alert. Though, if you're wise, you won't waste your time on this movie.<br/><br/>A summary would be, enter William, a rich, spoiled playboy who has everything he wants and does anything he wants with whomever he wants. Then he has a tragic accident, leaving him paralyzed. He decides that this kind of life isn't worth living, and wants to be killed. He promises his parents 6 months, where enters Lou, the charming, high-spirited woman who in an effort to show him life IS worth living (in which is still an entirely self-centered focused only on making himself happy), she falls in love with him. All seems to be going well, they think he has abandoned thoughts of suicide... but no. He selfishly decides to throw his life away, because he can't have everything his way. And it is wrapped in a cloak of care, and love, and support to people's decisions... but ultimately, it is sending the message, ""It doesn't matter who loves you, or how important you can be, or what you can do for others... if YOU don't have EVERYTHING you want and have it YOUR way, just give up."" In a day when depression and suicides are at an all-time high, here comes a story that had the potential to be a great encouragement to anyone dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts, but instead encourages people to give up and throw it all away.<br/><br/>Especially when you think of the high percentage of suicides or attempts by teenage girls, and an actor like Sam who is idolized by many, presenting this message, it is appalling that such messages are being presented as ""entertainment""."

"TheOneThatYouWanted","1","146","285","4 July 2016"," This movie is one of the things wrong with the world today.
","So you can tell I'm not a fan of this film just by my title and score. The movie itself is okay at best. Emilia Clarke does a well enough job with the role because the character she is playing is pretty much who she is in real life; in other words, this role didn't require Emilia acting much and that is a good thing because people are slowly figuring out that she has a very limited range when it comes to acting. Towards the end of the movie is when her limited acting range becomes apparent thanks to the crying scenes, most of the scenes she does with tearless crying which help to take you out of the movie. Don't get me wrong, her acting isn't bad until the end when she is forced to show another emotion other than bubbly. I should note the director does an excellent job of hiding a good amount of Emilia's emotional scenes by having her hug someone and then showing mostly the other person's face. I can write a whole book on Emilia's overrated acting chops but I'm not here to do that so let me carry on with this review. If it wasn't for the ending, where we finally learn the real message of the film I would have ranked the film about a 6 out of 10. But halfway into the film we learn the quadriplegic character made a deal with his parents that he will end his life after 6 months. During the film we learn this guy is smart and etc, etc. Someone even points out that he could go back to work if he wanted to but this guy is hell bent on killing himself for the simple reason of which happens to be that he misses his old life so he is giving up on this life. And apparently that is a good enough reason to let the man kill himself. Great message to put out there into the world. We recently lost Muhammad Ali. We all know about Muhammad Ali's condition and we all saw the impact he had on the world both before and in spite of his condition. He fought until the bitter end and became more of a legend because of it. This movie encourages people to take the easy way out. Now, I can understand how depression can play a role in all of this but this character is a pretty boy with a sh!t load of money.. and on top of that he found the love of his life and she is more than ready to be with him forever. But his reasoning is that he would only be a burden on her living her life. So yeah, this movie pretty much matches the materialistic and self- absorbed nature of what these modern times have transformed into. Whatever, the movie is a chick flick at best so I don't care. Apparently suicide isn't frowned upon when a quadriplegic is concerned. Moral of the story, you have nothing to contribute to society once you become paralyzed. Maybe this movie was funded by the government as a way of reducing the cost of people with disabilities on healthcare. Euthanasia for the win! Frankly, a disgusting message and an even more disgusting movie."
"paulgwilliams","1","62","114","16 June 2016"," Sets back perceptions of disability by decades
","This film, and presumably the book on which it is based, commits a triple whammy. First, it portrays disabled people as miserable. Second it perpetuates the idea that they need rescuing by a vivacious non- disabled youngster. Third it presents disabled people as still so miserable, despite being 'rescued', that they have to go to Switzerland to be euthanased. Prince Harry must be tearing his hair out after all his efforts with the Invicta Games to portray disabled people positively. The film is nothing more than propaganda for the really dangerous Swiss death machine Dignitas. It is ghastly and should be banned."
"hdavis-29","2","94","179","5 June 2016"," Hokey, manipulative and overdone
","Don't get me wrong. I like a weepy, romantic chick-flick as much as the next guy. But this one is so manipulative and over-the-top that I felt myself getting hostile about a third the way through. It took self-control not to make rude comments at the screen.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is Emilia Clarke. He character is modeled after the Brigit Jones style of self-consciously, klutzy, heart on her sleeve heroine that holds appeal to many viewers. Clarke's acting is filled with so many facial tics it almost becomes unintentionally comic. If you shaved Ms. Clarke's eyebrows, she'd convey no emotional range. But with them, she'd be a natural silent movie actress. Her eyebrows literally stole every scene they were in.<br/><br/>The music, especially the segments used between scenes goes beyond intrusive. It is downright offensive. If a character is about to die and is falling in love, do we really need an overwrought vocalist singing ""Oh poor me, I'm falling in love, yet I'm about to die."" This is like a Greek chorus with one eye on the AM playlist. I'm exaggerating here, but the point is real. We don't need treacly vocal music to mimic what we've just seen. Most of us got it the first time. You need a break between scenes? Instrumental segues would work just fine, thank you.<br/><br/>I've given this a ""2"" out of 10. In every way this big budget film deserves a rock bottom ""1"" for its manipulative and overdone approach. I've given it the extra point for the lovely location shooting. At least the castles don't have eyebrows."

","I enjoy a good romantic comedy or 'chick flick' that tells a tale of complicated people falling in love in even more complicated circumstances... when those people are actually decent people. That is not the case here. Lou is in a relationship with Patrick, a seemingly nice and decent guy. He's active, fun, appropriately funny, ambitious, sweet, and he truly cares for her. They've been together 7 years! Then she meets Will. Will is a complete asshole. No really... there is not 1 redeeming quality about him as a person. He's dull... he speaks in a completely monotone voice the entire movie... he's not funny, not even a little bit... he's insulting... he's selfish... he's suicidal... he does nothing to even attempt to make anyone elses life around him better. The only thing that this man has going for him is that he is RICH AND HANDSOME. He even admits that he would want nothing to do with her if he was still able to walk, and this doesn't phase her one bit. We're supposed to give him a pass on all of those things just because he's in a wheelchair? No... sorry... just no. She falls for this guy and you could say ""oh, but he was sweet and he gave her compliments"" but NO. She clearly falls for him well before that. Everything she falls for is superficial. She loves the adventure... she loves the money... she loves the feeling that she gets from taking care of him as it makes her feel needed. There is nothing about him as a person that she falls for! So she throws away 7 years with a great guy for a fling with a rich and handsome asshole. WOW! And this was the movie that somebody decided to make. WOW!!! This woman deserves to end up alone and the only redeeming quality about this movie is that she is alone in the end and I can at least imagine that this fling that she threw away everything for will torture her for the rest of her life as she tries to find another rich and handsome man that can fill Will's shoes, which in reality she never will. This movie is a tragedy, not a love story."

","Me Before You is an outstanding adaptation of Jojo Moyes' novel about Louisa taking care of the moody and pretentious Will Traynor. The book itself is very detailed and gives you all the specifics about their relationship and this is also seen throughout the movie. I had waited a long time after reading the book to find out that the movie is coming out featuring Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke. What more could be better than Finnick from the Hunger Games and Daenerys from Game of Thrones? Their chemistry for one another is astounding. Even though some may see this as a cliché movie where Louisa finds Will love and expresses it throughout the movie whilst adding a lot of humour, it's the ending of this movie which changes a lot of views and perspectives. For me especially, I found it very emotional as did many who watched it because you expect there to be a happy ending. Even though the ending was still very good, I feel as if the movie is very rushed and you'd expect there to be more. I feel like a whole lot from the book could have been added to give the audience more awareness as some things were confusing and you'd have to read the book to understand. Nevertheless, the movie was amazing and heartbreaking to say the least and I do think it is a special thing for everyone to watch."

Once they see each other they start transferring energy into what they do at double the rate. The guy throws his yoyo into the canyon while staring straight forward and the woman sets her watch so it only displays 0's. She yells ""me before you,"" and he yells ""No, you before me.

Admittedly, it feels a little cheesy toward the start, but it never crosses the line. There are some good laughs and you may even cry too. The acting is great, as is the script and the directing.

Maybe it's better to read the book; it could well be that they edited out too much information?? but I wasn't convinced that Will absolutely had to make that awful decision.<br/><br/>I did love Lou's fashion - it kind of reminded me of ""Amélie"" - colorful and corky.

There's a true compassion in this film and it seems to have been done with the lot of love. As for the issue of the film allegedly condoning assisted suicides because of the perceived burden is just a bunch of moose caca! I've been a caregiver for many years and whatever Faith or moral View one has, we all have to accept that it is the choice of the person and ferfuxssake give them dignity!

","Me Before You (2016): When I read plot line of Me Before You,I was surprised to find it exactly similar to the french classic Intouchables (which was remade in Telugu as Oopiri),only in the other way around.The only difference is they have given a female lead in the caretaker role and as usually love blossoms between them even with such physical differences.But the only reason I watched this movie is for my Princess Khaleesi aka Daenerys Targaryen aka her off screen real name Emilia Clarke.<br/><br/>Plot: Louisa Clark (Emilia Clark) is a small town girl who knows a lot about the people around her. Will (Sam Claflin) a quadriplegic man who hates everyone around him. Louisa is hired by Will's mum to take care of him for six months. Although they have a rocky start, their relationship grows over time, going for hate, to like, to love.<br/><br/>What I felt: With exactly the same plot and almost same type of scenes like Intouchables ,Me Before You mostly works on Emilia Clarke's charming performance.Other than that,this movie has very few feel good moments but mostly the screenplay is totally predictable.<br/><br/>These movies would only work if it has lot of feel good moments which can bring tears but this movie has none literally.The dinner ate Clark's home and the scene where Clark and Will dances and the scene where they watch a movie are the scenes which are the highlight of the movie.<br/><br/>As said earlier,Emilia Clark's charming screen presence helped the movie a lot.But her expressions with eyebrows are weird.It felt like she can even move her eyebrows downwards to ;-o.So apart from that she really is charming and I never even imagined Khaleesi being cute like this.<br/><br/>Sam Claflin,whom I have seen earlier in Love,Rosie is very good in his role of a quadriplegic man.<br/><br/>Music also helped the movie in lot of scenes.<br/><br/>But the major surprise in this film is its daring climax.Most of them would not accept this ending (Including me to an extent),but as a fiction we cannot blame the director/writer.But he could have tried other options because this may affect lot of such disabled persons ideology.<br/><br/>So,Me Before You works mostly because of Emilia Clark's charming screen presence and few moments but its climax is shocking.<br/><br/>My rating 6.5/10"

"atanassovadi","9","15","24","27 June 2016"," Jojo made me cry ... again ... Loved it regardless!
","This is my first review on here so bear with me please. I actually don't view this as a romantic movie/story. For me this is a movie about life, choices and the influence we have on one another.<br/><br/>I understand that the main topic in the story is sensitive and controversial to say at the least. I also get that some people will be offended by the outcome of the story. However, I do think that as much as those people are entitled to their own opinion (as am I and anyone else who has seen or read the story), so is everyone else in life in general, which proves the point that Will is entitled to his own opinion and choice in life.<br/><br/>First let me start off with the fact that I read the book when it came out and it had a huge impact on me and the way I thought about the value of life. You see ... everyone has dreams, goals and to some extend expectations of the life we want to lead. When for some reason all of that is taken away from us, I can understand that it would be difficult for a person to find a positive way of viewing an impossibly negative adverse situation. <br/><br/>I love (really love) the fact that there always will be people like Lou who find a way to make any negative into a positive and that they will do their utter best to spread their love of life and positive attitude(even if they're not aware they do it). I also love that Will, even though his mind is set to end his life, appreciates and respects the effort Lou is making to make him stay and appreciate the little things (or the big ones like her love for him) in life. <br/><br/>What really got me thinking is that everyone would think that Will is selfish for wanting to take his own life. Generally speaking if someone takes the easy way out it would be viewed as a cowardly thing to do or a selfish act. However this is not really that simple, because Will is in a situation most of us will never be able to comprehend. Yes, there are definitely examples of people (Stephen Hawking) who have found a motivational way to live through such a tragedy, but not everyone is the same. Not everyone is able to move past their feelings, the physical discomfort and the limitations placed upon the person by such a situation. <br/><br/>Come to think of it, isn't it selfish for everyone else to want Will to stay alive for them, while he is in pain and has no way to live the life he has always wanted to live? Isn't it just as bad to not respect someone's wishes when we can never know how it feels to be them?<br/><br/>Generally I believe that the story had a positive outcome for everyone involved. Even though Will chose to let go of life, something positive remained. Something that will have Louisa pursue life in a different way than she had ever thought of before.<br/><br/>Anyway ... I can go on and on about the different themes, motifs & symbols in this story. It's rich and it certainly gave me plenty to think about. I hope that many people will get to fall in love with the story (just like I did), even though it's heavily loaded and most definitely hard to take in.<br/><br/>Thanks for taking the time to read this!"

","If the director of a movie has stirred an emotion in a viewer does that make it a good movie? I think 'yes' because the viewer has been touched within and the story connected with that person, on some level. Unfortunately for Director: Thea Sharrock and Writer: Jojo Moyes the emotional connection for this viewer (me) was negative and borderline angry. But the movie is a good 6 or 7 stars worth to me because I found it well scripted, acted and photographed.<br/><br/>The plot is so British class oriented I was gritting my teeth. We have Will Traynor an upper crust society rich boy who is able to afford any indulgence he so desires. He lives in a mansion and owns an ancestral castle. Has had top line education and was a multi-talented sportsman and is exceptionally handsome. Mr upper crust Will is arrogant, self centered, and oh so superior. Then there is Lou Clark a working class former shop girl living in a small bungalow with her family. Her father is currently unemployed and cannot find a job. The family depends on Lou's income to make ends meet. She looses her shop job and applies as a companion aide to the now disabled (quadriplegic) Will Traynor. His mother is so charmed by Miss shop girl Lou's cheerful and quirky attitude she hires her. So there's the first problem - a working class person having to survive by being 'in service' to an upper society family. What a good little Brit she is! And of course the Traynor's feel it's their duty to provide for the lower classes so they hire Lou's father as a 'castle facility technician' - read 'grounds keeper for the castle'! Then there is the ever available Nathan who supplies the muscle to move Will from bed to chair and back, plus keep account of Will's borderline health. It's never explained how Nathan is always - on call! Can't keep the 'superiors of society' waiting!<br/><br/>The title ""Me Before You"" is also an issue with this viewer! We are never given a definition of this title. Which of the two main characters is 'Me' and which is 'You'! Think about it ... as the relationship between Will & Lou warms up the easy answer is Will as the 'Me' because of his death wish and to hell with the now close emotional bond between Will & Lou. (by-the-way if Will so wanted to die why didn't he give in to his lung infection when hospitalized? It surely would have easily killed a quadriplegic)<br/><br/>On the other hand it's not too difficult to take Lou as the 'Me' because she has dedicated her efforts to 'change Will' and bring him out of his self imposed reclusiveness and bitterness toward life. Lou is determined to make him change his mind on being euthanized. So there's the conflict - neither one actually respects the emotional bond & love that has developed between them. Will hates his physical existence and wants death as a release. Lou can only focus on how happy she is being with him. Both are not thinking about how the other one feels.<br/><br/>My other problem with this story is very simple to grasp. Will has everything a person could want and the intelligence to create a new life for himself but chooses death because he cannot live as he did before his disability. The producers of this story are implying a disabled person is less of a human due to a disability, is permanently unhappy, and not capable of contributing to society thus death is their best option! If Will was fine physically but emotionally depressed and wanted to be euthanized would the viewing public be as enthusiastic about this movie? Definitely not!<br/><br/>The subconscious messages in this story are shameful but go completely unnoticed because they are wrapped up and hidden in a sweet & tearful tragic love story."

","So at first I thought it was going to be another pretty predictable movie and I was only watching it because I love Emilia Clarke. But I was actually pleasantly surprised. The movie was not predictable at all and really was special for a lot of reasons. <br/><br/>Also the acting performances were very good. Emilia Clarke did a great job at playing an adorable, clumsy, sweet girl and Sam Claflin too did a great performance as a disabled young man. <br/><br/>The movie did really hit me right in the feels cause it could really take you away and the actors had a great chemistry on screen.

"prospectus_capricornium","7","6","8","19 June 2016"," Mostly Manipulative, But Tears are Earned
","It would be hard to hold back the tears, once 'Me Before You' moves along the emotionally-charged course of its unevenly laid-out entirety. Imbued with charismatic flair and some ravishing sentiments, the Emilia Clarke and Sam Clafflin starrer, is every hopeless romantic dream. It is bound to recreate the familiar 'heaven and earth' trope, with all its utter predictabilities and tiring cheesy clichés, but here, the tears are mostly rightfully earned.<br/><br/>Clarke's Lou, emerges as the brightest asset of this manipulative drama, her buoyant demeanor creates an affectionate atmosphere for this whole fairytale-ish attempt whose often leaning towards emotional tragedy is ever screaming at every turn of the proceedings. Her sprightly charm makes an indispensible compensation for the largely stale performance pulled by Clafflin who plays here, a quadriplegic near real-life prince, who enlisted the service of Clarke's caregiver character. But together they conjure magic, enough to sprinkle their often predictable storyline with heart-crippling charm.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw of this film, perhaps, is how it seemed written to manipulate. That is not to say it isn't effective, because in fact it often works, but you would still think, and wonder, how more beautiful it would have become, had it been written with pure authenticity. Be that as it may, you've got to give it to those at its helm for molding an extremely poignant drama, that even if its often undermined by its easily recognizable motives, isn't devoid of wit, humor, and charm, and jaw-dropping glamor from two of the most beautiful faces to ever star in such romantic tragedy."

Except the 2 bits of classic music the rest of it was simply abysmal and it really hurt the movie .

","As an aspiring movie producer/director, I was amazed by this film! Yes, 10/10 is very presumptuous of me and may be a slight exaggeration, but personally I loved every second of the movie and was anxiously dying to watch it all over again the second it ended! This movie makes you think in different ways and to think in their shoes, which I LOVE. I also might love this so much because I can relate due to my brother having a born disease where he cannot walk. When people see this film, some of Will's ways of thinking are very unorthodox to some and viewers may think the character is crazy, but understanding the life that handicapped people live, I thought it was perfectly executed. This film was a fantastic movie! The location, the actors, the music scorer, etc. It all blew me away and I loved it!!!!! 10/10 would recommend."

","The twenty-six year-old waitress of a cafe Louisa ""Lou"" Clark (Emilia Clarke) is a charming woman that lives with her parents Bernard (Brendan Coyle) and Josie Clark (Samantha Spiro), her sister Katrina ""Treena"" Clark (Jenna Coleman) and her grandfather (Alan Breck) in a small town in the United Kingdom. Lou supports the whole family since Bernard is unemployed and Treena is a student. When she loses her job, she applies to the position of caregiver of the wealthy banker Will Traynor (Sam Claflin), who was hit by a motorcycle two years ago and became tetraplegic. Will´s mother Camilla Traynor (Janet McTeer), supported by her husband Stephen Traynor (Charles Dance), hires the unexperienced but happy Lou to take care of her son together with his nurse Nathan (Stephen Peacocke). When Lou meets Will, she finds a bitter, cynical and depressed young man that had lost the will to live. Further, she learns that the handsome Will was a successful athlete and banker. Will she lift his spirit? <br/><br/>""Me Before You"" is an adorable dramatic romance in the directorial debut of director Thea Sharrock. The central subject, euthanasia, is not discussed but it is easy to understand Will´s attitude based on his athletic and sexual performances before the accident. The chemistry of Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin and the beautiful locations in the United Kingdom are enough to grant a wonderful entertainment. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Como Eu Era Antes de Você"" (""How I Was Before You"")"

But the true stand out is Clarke, who's unquenchable cheerfulness and sunny outlook on life in the face of his depressed hostility has to be seen to be believed and maybe starts to turn him around? A lovely film with a beautiful ending."

She is sweet and funny with a cute but very quirky dress sense. The relationship between her and Will is so beautiful and inspiring. <br/><br/>This movie also introduced me to quadriplegia, a condition I had never heard of before watching this movie.

"bob-the-movie-man","7","7","10","4 October 2016"," ""You are scored on my heart Clark""
","""Me Before You"" is a bit of a queer fish of a movie. It never quite decides whether it wants to be a romantic weepy, a drama, or a rom- com and as such ends up rather falling between all three stools.<br/><br/>Emelia Clarke (""Game of Thrones"", ""Terminator: Genesys"") plays Lou Clark, an 'invisible' plain girl ""with potential"" who is trapped – due to unemployment-led poverty - living with her parents in a provincial castle town (a picturesque Pembroke, though notably hardly a Welsh accent in earshot). Her boyfriend Patrick (""Harry Potter""'s Matthew Lewis) is a running nut that doesn't play to her romantic needs in any way. Circumstances lead her into the job of a carer for a quadriplegic, Will Traynor (Sam Claflin, from ""The Hunger Games"" sequels) who also happens to be the son of the local millionaire couple (played by Charles Dance and Janet McTeer). They own the castle, a large mansion and most of the surrounding countryside too.<br/><br/>Will – previously a sports jock - is paralyzed from the neck down after an accident and is a frustrated and suicidal mind in a useless body. Can the quirky and vivacious Lou bring him out of his morbid shell and find him a life worth living again?<br/><br/>From this outline, you might think the story almost writes itself, and for most of the film it does. But the writers have a number of twists and turns in store which – depending on your sentiments – might entertain or appall.<br/><br/>As her first leading actress role in a non-action feature it's a bit difficult to sum up Emilia Clarke's performance. At face value it could be described as an advanced case of over-acting, with an extensive array of kooky looks and gurning facial expressions. On the other hand, she does it all with such vivacity and charm - and notably in a manner so in keeping with the character she portrays - that it is hard not to be enchanted by her: I certainly was.<br/><br/>Claflin plays the brooding and resentful Traynor well and Matthew Lewis shows he is growing into a really professional jobbing actor as he enters his mid-20's.<br/><br/>Also radiant (she always is sorry to break it to the wife like this... but I am basically in love with her!!) is the ever-gorgeous Jenna Coleman (""Dr Who"", ""Victoria"") in what is to date a rare outing for her onto the big screen (she previously has only had a small role in the first ""Captain America"" film). Coleman and Clarke make a very credible pair of sisters, with the ""bed"" discussion scene being very touching.<br/><br/>Elsewhere a number of other well-known faces crop up including Brendan Coyle (""Downton Abbey"") as Lou's father and Joanna Lumley as a wedding guest with a handy line in references.<br/><br/>The soundtrack by Craig (""Love Actually"") Armstrong is top notch with pleasing songs from Ed Sheeran, Imagine Dragons, Cloves and We The Kings.<br/><br/>The production quality is as professional as you would expect from a British-made movie, although the Mallorca and Paris locations are not particularly well exploited, since for a large chunk of these scenes I was convinced they hadn't left Pinewood!<br/><br/>So, a bit of a mixed bag, but enjoyable nonetheless. A guilty pleasure. If you like a romantic piece of escapism this is one for a wet Sunday afternoon, provided you have a box of tissues handy. <br/><br/>(For the graphical version of this review, or to comment on it, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com.

","i have watched very little of the movies which were based on any ROMANTIC BOOKS like ""The Fault in Our Stars"", but this movie is and will be one of the Greatest and one of the Best Romantic Movie I would have ever watched.<br/><br/>I have watched Emilia Clarke, playing the role of Lou Clark, in some great movies and of course Game of Thrones, it was good to see change in the type of Role she played in this Movie. I and many audience has made an image of Emilia Clarke as a strong and Bold Character playing actress( well according to me only) as she had the recent movie of Terminator: Genisys, and the famous Khaleesi/ Mother of Dragons.<br/><br/>Sam Claffin on the other hand did a tremendous job, he did his Homework very well, according to me he painted the perfect portrait of Will Traynor as a person who was full of life and how his life suddenly changes because of the Accident. He also acted well as we can certainly see how a person gets Cranky when something he had lost in his life which he cherished and loved."

","I have read the book and I will be interested to talk to my friend who hasn't. My only criticism is could you not have used one of our great kiwi actors - seriously you had to use an Australian pretending to be a kiwi badly. However the movie is lovely. I don't think I have seen a theatre in Masterton New Zealand as full as the one tonight and every one of us was thrilled to see it. They have kept the movie pretty much to the book which was great although I treat a movie as different from the book. Well done Sam Claflin I didn't see a single movement out of character. That must have been a tough thing to do so an impressive effort. I don't watch GOT so I had no preconceived ideas about Emilia Clarke and I thought she was great.<br/><br/>A difficult subject and one that we have had several notable kiwi's go through. Well done Jojo Moyes."

I note that someone has commented that it wasn't as good as the book. I disagree. There were a couple of small parts that were left out but they certainly did not detract from the movie. It has been a long time since I have seen a movie that I have loved as much as this one and would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a laugh, but also be prepared to have a cry as well.

Although we all had a massive cry in the dark, every single one of us loved this movie... I noticed for the first time in a long time a huge amount of people remained in their seats after the movie finished just regathering their thoughts and emotions.. That's how powerful this movie is. If you hadn't read the book and didn't know what was coming, (as in my case) then you really don't see the emotional bombshell coming and which direction this movie is going in.

","Me Before You, is a romantic drama that paves a light-heartedness throughout a confronting, profound context. Luisa (Emilia Clarke) is breathtakingly charming as caretaker for a recently-paralyzed, Will (Sam Claflin). While the story has its predictability's, it also surprises within them. Notable nuances by Clarke, and Claflin shift this film from tolerable to pleasurable.<br/><br/>The stand-out performance would go to Clark, with her vulnerability palpable, due almost exclusively to her extensive, engaging facial expressions, and mannerisms.<br/><br/>While some are calling this film controversial, in regards to the under-laying topic of euthanasia, I simply see it is as an account, a version of a story, of a characters mindset, and their decision regarding their own life.<br/><br/>In a society so quick to take offence, while being so offensive –– I conclude that it depends on your intent as a movie-goer.<br/><br/>If you're open to characters making their own decisions in a film, I'm sure you'll find that Me Before You, puts you first.<br/><br/>By Rocio Belinda Mendez<br/><br/>***/5"

","Me Before You is a romantic drama film directed by Thea Sharrock based on the novel by Jojo Moyes with the same name. The film stars Emilia Clarke, Sam Claflin, Jenna Coleman, Charles Dance, Matthew Lewis, Ben Lloyd-Hughes and Janet McTeer. The movie is about a girl named Lou Clark who is desperate for a job and so the goes on to take care of a recently paralyzed man from a rich family, who she slowly creates a bond with. This is a well made movie with amazing performances all around, especially by the amazing Emilia Clarke who gives a wonderful performance on the leading role. By her side is Sam Claflin who plays Will Traynor, and he does a very good job too. It is a movie filled with heart breaking emotional scenes, very good cinematography and a brilliant score by Craig Armstrong that makes Me Before You as a whole one of the best romances there are. Sure it has some problems, and the ending will leave some people confused and angry but overall this movie works on so many levels that those flaws are hardly even noticeable as the good outweighs the bad by a lot."

Since everyone, including me, knows her from the Game of Thrones series on TV, playing a real war-chick, it's hard to imagine her playing something so delicate. In the first 30 minutes of the movie, I already saw this was going to be great. Emilia can show so many emotions in her face without even trying, which makes it clear why they chose her. The way she lived Lou in the movie was just amazing, real and definitely sincere.<br/><br/>This is a must-see movie, not only today, but tomorrow, next year and in 10 years as well.<br/><br/>Rating : 10/10 for sure!"

"ferguson-6","5","35","71","3 June 2016"," for the hanky-loving crowd
","Greetings again from the darkness. Who doesn't enjoy a good cry in a dark movie theatre? The first feature film from director Thea Sharrock is taken directly from the tear-jerker novel by Jojo Meyes (who also wrote the screenplay). Although I try to avoid using the term very often, it's very much a by-the-numbers chick flick  complete with the heart-of-gold working class girl trying her best to ""save"" the handsome rich guy to whom life has dealt a tough hand. For fans of the book and the genre, it should deliver the desired effect  the studio even provided movie logo tissues for the screening.<br/><br/>For most of us, the effectiveness of this type of movie comes down to the characters. Luisa is the effervescent working class girl hired as a personal assistant to the extremely wealthy quadriplegic Will Traynor. Emilia Clarke (""Game of Thrones"") does everything in her power to make us (and Will Traynor) like Luisa. To describe her as optimistic is like saying Eric Clapton can play guitar. Calling her perky would be like saying Donald Trump has hair. Both statements are true, but hardly capture the totality of reality. In stark contrast, Sam Claflin (The Hunger Games: Mockingjay) purposefully underplays Will  the one time cliff-diving, James Bond birthday video type now confined to a wheelchair.<br/><br/>Lu is a constant toothy smile complemented by expressive and active eyebrows that somehow overshadow her chatty bedside manner, and kaleidoscopic and geometric clothes and shoes  all encompassed with an ever-bouncy step that would make Tigger envious. Lu mostly shares the screen with Will and the personal nurse and therapist Nathan, played by Stephen Peacocke. The camera certainly loves all three of these faces, and director Sharrock wisely adds Janet McTeer and Charles Dance as Will's parents. They bring a regal presence to what otherwise could have played a bit too cutesy.<br/><br/>Despite the heavy dose of ""awww"", the story deserves credit for touching on the ""right to die"" or ""dying with dignity"" debate. While those closest to Will selfishly proclaim they don't understand his plan to head to Switzerland, it's Nathan who says it best  'who am I to judge'. While a full on discussion of the topic would be out of place here, the film does a nice job of not shying away from the process.<br/><br/>Other recognizable faces in the cast include Jenna Coleman (""Doctor Who"") as Lu's sister and confidante, and Matthew Lewis (Harry Potter series) as Lu's fitness freak boyfriend who isn't very understanding  of either Lu or her job. There's also an odd but welcome wedding cameo from Joanna Lumley. My biggest issue with the story is that I just never understood how or when Lu fell so deeply in love with Will. Sure, I get the appeal of the castle, the concertos, and the tropical vacations, but where was the real personal connection? Was it simply that she thought she could charm Will into changing his mind on the big decision? That's not really love. Another piece that's difficult to take  the numerous musical interludes seemingly designed to make sure viewers are in the proper state of melancholy. There was another segment that I found not just ironic, but actually annoying; however, discussion of the ""Live boldly"" advice would give away the film's ending  something I'm not sure even matters since it's made pretty clear throughout, but it still goes against my movie code."
"hydearchie","1","31","62","1 July 2016"," An unfortunate tail
","I have never read the book so did not know the ending of this story (which I will not give away). I suggest however, that nobody watch this film without at least reading the synopsis so they know how it ends - it may change your mind about watching it in the first place or at least prepare you for one of the most tasteless endings in a film ever. The problem is that the movie is so sweet and monotoned that the depressing ending both assaults you and offends. It is not giving anything away to say that the male character is contemplating Dignatas' services. With no judgement whatsoever on this it is important to note that this is a compassionate organisation, but according to all media far from luxurious. The book may have dealt in detail with the realty of disability so deadly or degrading that the sufferer feels deeply they need release. However, this movie treats the illnesses associated with the male character's disability as intermittent blips in an otherwise improving quality of life. It leaves such a bitter taste in the mouth because the conclusion is that a valuable life must be expansive and in an able body! Being close to parents, loving unconditionally, life unexpected are failures. It is a shame as the performances are great - if the movie was a real romcom with a joyful ending or a serious drama with a tragic twist this story could have worked - unfortunately, it was neither; rather it was an amusing film that meandered off the side of a cliff with a thud..."
"suddend-58615","2","31","62","19 June 2016"," Uninspired & Unoriginal
","I'm not sure why critics are raving about Me Before You, but they clearly did not see the same film that the rest of us did, the one about a silly 20-something year-old girl who's hired by a rich couple to take care of their paraplegic son.<br/><br/>This film suffers from the same ailments that many American biopics and romantic comedies do, namely a lack of originality and a dull, formulaic structure - regardless of whether or not it's an ""adaptation of an award-winning novel."" <br/><br/>From the second the movie began, I predicted every single ""emotional"" beat in the film and when it would happen. Nothing caught me off guard or left me thinking, ""Wow! I've never seen that before!"" or ""I never saw that coming!"" <br/><br/>This film is a testament to the concept of ""Safe Filmmaking"" which pervades our entertainment industry. The main character, Lou Clark, played by Emilia Clarke, has no admirable characteristics other than she wears unorthodox outfits and likes shoes. She outright admits it herself in the film: she lacks intelligence. I suppose one could argue that she's an immensely compassionate individual, but what motivates her compassion? There's no depth to her character - or any of the characters for that matter. <br/><br/>Despite being financially unstable, Lou's sister and parents are happy as can be. She takes the job caring for the paraplegic, Will Traynor, played by Sam Claflin, to help keep her family afloat, but there's never any pressure that there family might be worse off if she didn't take the job. Nothing bad ever happens at all in the entire film, actually, except for at the end when Will tells Lou that they cannot be together, despite their love, and chooses to die. There's barely any conflict, Lou is never really put to the test, she never learns anything, she never overcomes any obstacles, the whole entire plot is a giant pile of emotions and obsessions (shoes for example) mushed together into a 110 minute pile of banal Oscar-bait. <br/><br/>I'd like to mention that this film has seen the screen in a different form before. A form that was much more enjoyable to watch, because it didn't take itself as seriously. I'm referring to the 2011 French film, The Intouchables. Perhaps the filmmakers behind Me Before You should have taken a few ideas from Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano's playbook.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, I came out of the theater very sad. I gave it a shot, hoping with all my being that Me Before You would challenge me or catch me off-guard with some serious wit or humor (despite knowing it would not), but instead, it was just another, average romantic drama to be filed away with the rest. It did not impress anything upon me. I did not leave the theater wondering about all the symbolism and imagery in the film and what it could mean, because there was none. Even the production design was lazy and trite - a sad misfortune indeed.<br/><br/>My advice to the Average Joe going to see this film: Go into the theater with zero expectations. Sit down with your popcorn and your significant other and prepare to shut off your brain like you do when you watch HGTV, sports, or sitcoms. You won't be carried away on a mystical, thought-provoking journey. No, not all. If that's the kind of experience you expect, you will be sorely disappointed."

Most of those same reviews also note that he's some selfish billionaire that wants to die because he doesn't have everything he wants. How shallow. It implies if he'd been a working class Joe he'd of been more accepting of his disability, not necessarily! My impression is that he would have given up the riches to be able bodied again. As an able bodied person I don't dare judge his decision to decide his own quality of life given his severe physical disability. I would hope quadraplegics understand that not all people are willing to ""adapt and overcome""! I have told my husband I would not want to live in a vegetative state. It's not a quality of life I envision for myself, but I respect the families that maintain their loved ones in that state. It's an individual choice and we need to respect that. This movie isn't advocating suicide for the disabled but rather advocating individual choice which I believe is an inherit right!"

","Me Before You is a simple yet beautiful film, Emilia Clarke captures the heart.<br/><br/>Clarke has taken on various roles without a blemish, she's an excellent actress. Sam Claflin, believable in the role as well. A quality soundtrack accompanies the film. Many dislike the ending, but not me as the film is about Lou and it allows her to move on with fondness and opportunity ahead. They always go overboard concerning the current boyfriend, being a complete jerk. In regards to Will's circumstance, I didn't see an accident or a mistake, I saw carelessness."

The story of the Louisa Clark, who unfortunately lost her job and Will who devastatingly paralysed after a motorcycle accident. When Louisa enters his life as his new care, she brings a new light to his life and the movie covers how their relationship develops. This movie seems that our life became changed when we met right person and you will understand how we love each other. I understand we must say ""love you and thank you"" for the all time. If we did not tell them, one day we regret it. The acting especially from Emilia Clarke who played Lou was brilliant. There were a couple of small parts that were left out but they certainly did not detract from the movie. A lovely film with a sad ending. Now i am reading this movie's book."

","In a beautiful Welsh town complete with a castle and moat, a young waitress becomes caregiver to a wealthy handsome young man who has become a quadriplegic due to a traffic accident. He wants to end it and she comes to care for him more than just as a patient.<br/><br/>Things are kept restrained and light hearted for most of the movie so that when more dramatic parts arrive it is much more effective. During the wedding of his ex girlfriend his pain is quite moving. The emotional climax in their tropical getaway is one of the more effective scenes in recent tear jerkers.<br/><br/>Emilia Clarke gives an effervescent likable performance with her quirky costumes. Her character is likable and one that could easily have been annoying but she avoids that. Sam Claflin does a good job. Considering he can only move from the neck up for most of the movie he manages to convey all his character is going through. The relationship between the two is believable and not over sentimental. Charles Dance and Janet McTeer plays his parents. Liked the contrast with her working class family and their simple pleasures.<br/><br/>If you can remember the Julia Roberts movie 'Dying Young', 'Me Before You' shows how to take a theme that has been done before but do it better.<br/><br/>The issue about assisted suicide is handled well. It doesn't preach but you feel alright with his choice at the end.<br/><br/>This movie deserved to be a success. Worth watching."

The girl is like a ray of sunshine penetrating the boy's cave, bringing him hope and laughters and joy. But instead of miraculously coming back to health and marrying the girl, the boy chose to end his life and inherit a fortune to the girl so she can go to college.<br/><br/>I disagree with the religious talks such as""fragile people don't get to make their own choices."" or ""artificial death is no better than murder"". Everybody is fit to make their own choices, especially people with high intelligence and iron determination, like Will. To decide someone else's life or death is the worst kind of arrogance, forced life with give Will endless pain and desperate torture that is enough to drive him crazy. Steven knows that, and Camilla understands that despite the struggle. If not for Lou, Will's life will serenely and naturally ends like a ripen apple falling to the ground. Lou is the alien factor that is added to an originally balanced equation.<br/><br/>Lou has potential, but her mind is simple and straight and pure and beautiful. ""Because I like him, I will try to save him. It breaks my heart to think that Will have to die."" After the seed is plant, she arduously plans all the trips, trying everything she can to cheer him up, insulting the restaurant waitress for him, ordering an hotel with him, falling in love with him, and even running home like a seventh-grade when she finds out that she can't save him. She reserves nothing, Lou packs up all her guts and livers and heart in a box and presents to him, but nothing will change the fact that Will is doomed. <br/><br/>It is absolutely heartbreaking to watch Lou going through the process of finding out Will's death cannot be changed by any of her efforts.

","In the South of Britain, near Wales, a young businessman, Will (Sam Claflin) has just kissed his girlfriend goodbye on a rainy morning. He tries to hail a taxi but, unhappily, he is struck by a motorcycle. Meanwhile, Louisa Clark (Emilia Clarke) has been a waitress in a nearby café for six years, where she proved to be a friendly asset. Unexpectedly, she is given a pink slip and a month's wages. At home, the Clarks hear this news with dismay, for Papa Clark has been laid off and Lou's salary has been supporting them all. Undaunted, the fetching, zany-dressed young gal goes to the job center for new leads. There's one promising one. It seems a mother, Camilla (Janet McTeer) is searching for a nurse's aide to help her paralyzed son. Yes, its Will, from the movie's beginning, who is now confined to a wheelchair with little motion below his neck. Will's family, the Trainers, are the richest folk in the area and live in a modified castle. In short order, Louisa gets the position, for she is chatty and gregarious, despite her lack of nursing experience. But, wait, Will greets his new caretaker with undisguised rudeness, asking her to ""not talk"" to him and stay out of his way as much as possible. A roving nurse, Nathan, though, tells Louisa he is delighted she is there and assures her that Will is rude because his situation is so bleak. In time, things change. Will does become more communicative and is cheered by Lou's weird clothes and infectious manner. When his former girlfriend comes to break the news that she is engaged to a man who was once W's best friend, Louisa is there to help Will from falling to pieces. In fact, Lou and the nurse decide to put forth a list of outings which will, hopefully, change his view toward life. This involves going to the horse races and a symphony concert. Indeed, Will does seem cheerier. But, oh no, Lou overhears Will state he agreed to give himself six months of living for his mother's sake, at which end he hopes to go a euthanasia clinic in Switzerland. Can this really be, when Lou has started to love Will and he seems to being feeling the same way about her? This sweet, sorrowful movie will have its viewers in waterfalls of tears. Yes, there are moments of humor and fun, but, the tale is always a story of a wheelchair bound man, formerly very active. who struggles to accept his new reality. The cast is great, with Claflin, Clarke, McTeer, Charles Dance, and all of the others doing fine work. Mr. Claflin, who also appeared in Love, Rosie, will hopefully not be confined to roles in love stories, although his handsome face is swoon worthy. Then, the setting is superb, a lovely glimpse at a little known part of Britain. Louisa's costumes are ""sublimely ridiculous"" amid a well clad cast and the script, from a novel by JoJo Moyes, is carefully, poignantly written. Finally, the direction is somewhat slow, at times, but hits all the right marks for its presentation. As stated above, some viewers will not like the film's stance on euthanasia, as it strongly supports personal choice. Therefore, listen to this caution. However, most viewers, especially fans of romantic drama, will welcome the opportunity for a sweet, sad cry."

","Yep. I hated it. I didn't find the girl super likable or well developed, the fashion was so far out there it was awful. It felt like there was very little character development there, we are meant to take her as a ""chatty Cathy"" but it doesn't seem that way. She's not that quick of a talker or that much of one. Likewise there is little reason to believe she hated the guy- he wasn't super developed either. Seemed like they hated / endured each other and then it switched all of the sudden. The male character had a chance to grow but didn't. It could have foreshadowed the ending better, (Scenes where she walks in and he IS in pain and hides it after he notices her, or times when he's a little crabby to other people and she brushes it off) I didn't find his decision that inline with the man that was portrayed, making him a hypocrite when he tells Clark to go on and live her life to the fullest.<br/><br/>There are several themes made by the ending that I fully disagree with. 1. If you're in enough pain, it's OK to kill yourself. 2. Its better to die than to be a burden. 3. You can choose to die, it's not selfish, and after a month, the girl you had WATCH your death will be totally OK and without grief. 4. If all else fails, give said girl a trust fund and you can buy her happiness, and she won't grieve anymore. 5. Death is romantic.<br/><br/>Yes, you can say it's up to the viewer to decide to take out of it, but these themes were implied by Clark's lack of remorse or sadness at the end. There are reviewers that say it highlights the joy of living and it is only the male that goes against them, but the happy way the end was portrayed discredits the highlights given.<br/><br/>The few things I did like: The castle and rich people house and quality of film was OK."

","A question that often goes around is ""What is art?"". And looking, throughout history, what was considered ""art"" it seems we are far away from the consensus on this question. But most people would agree around a general notion that art is something that makes you feel, that makes you think, that sparks a fire inside you, that transforms you. And this movie, in my humble opinion, does all of that, therefore deserving to be called ""a piece of art"". In the age of information overload where we usually forget what we had for lunch two days ago, this movie will stay with you for a long time after you leave the cinema.

This is a story of hardship, and of hope and also introduces us to the ethical and very personal struggles of people not only considering assisted suicide but also the family and friends who have no say in the matter but want very much to get involved. It was a very emotional journey, there were many light hearted moments and a very fitting soundtrack.

"abouhelier-r","8","8","13","4 July 2016"," Movie Vs. Book: Me Before You
","A girl in a small town forms an unlikely bond with a recently-paralyzed man she's taking care of. <br/><br/>It's easy to be cold and cynical these days, but we should never lose sight of the simple, cathartic pleasure of a good cry at the movies. At first, I didn't want to review this novel – nor the movie – because I knew I would want to re-read it. Which might seem perverse if you know that for most of the last hundred pages I was dissolved in tears? Based on the best-selling 2012 novel by Jojo Moyes who also penned the screenplay. This story will feel familiar to anyone who sniffed through Love Story or The Fault in Our Stars. Surprisingly it's better than both. Me Before You is a love story, a family story and above all, it's a story of the bravery and sustained the effort needed to redirect the path of a life once it's been pushed off course. This is also a story that is eloquent not so much in its delivery as in its humanity. The set up is the same as many of classic (and non-classic) romance: a poor but cheerful young girl meets a rich, grumpy gentleman and begins working for him. But what makes Me Before You different and quite interesting in principle is that Will Traynor is physically broken as well as emotionally.<br/><br/>You'll forgive the movie's clichés because of its surprisingly winning performances. As the film goes on and the frost between both protagonists melts, both actors give their stock roles unexpected emotional layers. On a basic level, it is engaging watching Lou enter this new world for which she is entirely unprepared. Game of Thrones' Emilia Clarke stars as Louisa, she's like Love Actually-era Keira Knightley, crossed with a Hello Kitty doll. Clarke's sincerity doesn't just win Will's heart, it wins ours too. Will Traynor since he's played by Sam Claflin, whose Finnick Odair was one of the best things in the Hunger Games series, isn't just killer handsome or impossibly good- looking even if his condition has left him bitterly depressed and cuttingly sarcastic in a wheelchair. The actor is good as Will, working well with the physical demands of the role and even bringing a gentle flirtatiousness to his character, as he develops his relationship with Lou. In fact, his grin, with its slight touch of a smirk – creates an unmistakable echo of a young Hugh Grant. Sam Claflin makes Will a broken man with a powerful life inside him. Plus, Will's character makes me think of Mr. Rochester in Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre; with his rudeness and temper. While Louisa is so Jane Eyre: ""One of the invisible"". Lou has never lived; Will has, but no longer can. You don't have to be Nicholas Sparks to know where this is heading – that these two opposites will end up attracting, and that love, at least for a while, will prove stronger than death. Lou is not heroic and her male counterpart may be nobody's idea of a leading man or Prince Charming, and yet with both of them, Jojo Moyes created an affair I will always remember.<br/><br/>Me Before You is a heartbreaker in the best sense. Employing emotional truth to bring the reader to tears. And yet, unlike other novels, tears are not gratuitous. Some situations, the author forces the reader to recognize, really are worth crying over. Furthermore, people can take an awful lot of sadness if you can be funny about it. Jojo Moyes is a literary stylist. Just a storyteller. And a really good one. She manages to draw on the skills she owned as a journalist to create a clear, candid picture of the practicalities of Will's situation. While the novelist's mind casts an illuminating light on her character's reactions. Moyes makes them coming together extremely tender, both sweet and real. But there's a deadline. One that haunts their love story haunts the novel. The author is masterful, in not shying from the complexities or shading the agony of choosing between life and death. It's achingly hard to read at moments and yet such a joy.<br/><br/>Screenwriters choose to lose the ""Maze"" scene when Lou recalls a sexual assault when she was younger. Often when you read about rape in fiction, it's the defining event of a story. And cutting it from the movie, I think, was a good thing because the scene is very opaque in the book, and putting it on film would have given it far more weight than it has in the book. Plus, it would have eventually change the mood of the story. However the ""Birthday Dinner"" scene, at Louisa's home, hits a particularly high note, offering the most poignant moment both in the book and the movie – its soul, really – as well as a pitch-perfect hilarious one. Finally, my favorite part of both the film and the book is when Will and Lou go out on a ""date"" to a concert. She wears a dress of sexiest scarlet, and as they are in the car ready to go home, he confesses in a very Hugh Gratian manner: ""I don't want to go in yet. I just want to be a man who's been to a concert with a girl in a red dress."" I know a good British rom-com reference when I see one.<br/><br/>Overall, Me Before You doesn't try to reinvent the genre. We've all seen some version of this movie before, but that doesn't make it any less effective. It knows what it is and embraces it. ""Tell me something good,"" Will says to Louisa at two transformative junctures of the book. This story at its heart is about two people who properly listen to each other, it is something good. Now if you'll excuse me, I have something in my eye. It's allergies, I swear."

And the impact of the depth of the story push me to the moments when I was dealing with my daughter darker moments, which were a few. If you are sensitive to the pain and suffering of others, go see this movie, it is entertaining and it gives you the opportunity to see two young actors reach a level in their careers which place them in a category with great performers."

I mean, one can watch this Movie With Family members, and even children. The Movie did justice to Our culture and traditions too, the praying part before the meal on Emilia's birthday was beautiful. It has become really hard to find wholesome Movies to watch With loved ones nowadays, We truly need more Movies like this one.

I watched this movie for the first time soon after it released. And I don't remember how many times I have seen this movie since then. In my brightest and in my saddest moment of my life this movie kept me going. It gave me hope, hope to live, hope to dream, hope to love. When I am watching this today for the millionth of time, I am still crying just like the first time I cried watching this.
This movie taught me how love should be and taught me to not expect impossible things from love, life.
Remember the dancing scene at Alicia's wedding where Lou and Will talk and laugh about how if things were different there wasn't any chance for them knowing each other and being friends. That is the most beautiful scene I have ever watched. That taught me love is honesty. Love is accepting people in their truest self and doing every possible thing to make them happy. Love is believing in time when they might not be together but everything will still be going beautifully for the other person.
Every scene in this movie is a pleasure to my eye. Every dialogue is more beautiful than the previous one. And @emilia_clarke is so phenomenal it's hard to not laugh when she laughs and cry when she cries. And.... Sam Claflin! Well, you @mrsamclaflin are pretty much everything that made me believe we all deserve a second chance :') Do I need to say how much I love this movie?
No. Right? :')"

","I knew nothing about this story until I saw the movie (obviously did not read the book). I loved it! All the actors were great! The chemistry between Claflin and Clarke was undeniable and made the movie.<br/><br/>Honestly, I don't understand the criticism of those who said it was saying that disabled people's lives are worthless. Really? It was completely the opposite! Everyone wanted Will to live, but he didn't want to. The movie really made me think about how I would feel in the same situation. I totally understand how Will feels. I can't imagine living like that. But at the same time, I'm not sure I would want to die either. The point is, this is Will's decision. What will he decide? How will the other's react to his decision? Can they change his mind or can they live with it if he doesn't?<br/><br/>What really irks me is the whole ""politically correct"" aspect of folks these days. What? A movie isn't allowed to show a disabled person who doesn't want to live? All movies showing severely disabled people must show them 'happy"" at the end with their predicament? This isn't a commentary on what makes a life worthwhile. This is a movie about one particular man who can't imagine living like that. It's not meant to tell the world that if you are disabled, you should kill yourself. Please!<br/><br/>The movie is life-affirming but we don't get to choose for someone else. They get to choose for themselves."

","I love a story that doesn't pretend to be a documentary, that says what it has to say in a straightforward manner but with considerations of the heart leading with every step. The scenarios and outcomes it depicts are realistic - not that they would play out in the same way in ordinary life, where the details of daily life are far more pressing than they can ever be in fiction. I am often turned off many recent movies as they are trying to depict real situations in convincing ways which really only relate to the screenwriter's manner of being convinced, or else movies are so far into the liberty of fiction you end up in animated special-effect nonsense land, whether it be the acting, the script or the sheer visuals.<br/><br/>Love conquers death. This is a movie of hope. The hope is not a laundered hope, and that contrasts wonderfully with this well laundered film.<br/><br/>I would have given it 10 stars but there was a little punch or something missing to it.

"vanessacarrillo-99554","9","2","2","16 July 2018"," Amazing film
","In any love movie, there has to be a tragic event happen but soon be resolved by the ""prince"" or man of the entire story. In many cases, romantic films have someone who is disabled and ends up falling in love with someone. The protagonist tragically has to tell their partner the challenges they have to face and they resolve the problem and live happily ever after. Me Before You is definitely a movie to rewatch because each character has significant traits that compliment the rest of the movie, shifting perspectives and giving a jaw- dropping finish.
 Director Thea Sharrock does a phenomenal job in making the personalities of each character very realistic and believable. A cheerful town girl named Louisa Clarke, got fired from her job at a cafe near her home that she has worked at for 6 years and is in desperate need of employment. She then finds the job of caregiving for a 35 year old disabled man and decides to take the opportunity hoping to get the job. Louisa is very happy and outgoing with a very strange sense of style while Will is the complete opposite. When Louisa was introduced to Will, he had already started with a bad impression and gave Louisa a bad vibe making her job difficult. Will, being disabled, has the stereotype that people in wheelchairs are weak and sweet people, considering that they have experienced such a terrible accident. However, Will comes off as rude and offensive, not caring about where his life is going. Louisa has the stereotype that she's calm and nice because she is the caregiver and he is disabled. However, she is very honest and blunt with him which he respects considering that everyone treats him like a baby and is unable to think for himself. For example, she was fixing some frames he had destroyed after he was invited to his ex girlfriend's wedding and he insults her while doing so resulting in her telling him that she does not deserve the treatment everyone else is receiving because she is only trying to do her job as best she can. It is very obviously to see how two completely different personalities collide and how the stereotypes of these certain people are quickly flipped and you get a sense of reality. She changes the idea of these two personalities and makes it seem like something like this would really occur in real life and it is one of the biggest factor in any movie. Viewers always look for how realistic the movie is and if it makes sense and Sharrock did just that. 
 Sharrock gears the attention towards the disabled man with his point of view to really see how people like him feel about themselves and what they have to go through everyday. Throughout the movie you see how Will feels embarrassed about his situation considering that he needs extra help from other people. Will Traynor had an amazing life before the accident. He was a businessman with many interests in sports, a very active man. Once the road accident occurred, he became his own worst nightmare. He hated himself every minute. When Louisa would want to do something with him, he makes ""suggestions"" which is really just sarcasm because he wants to be left alone and unbothered. Sharrock really shows how frustrated he gets with himself and it's what ties the audience in. You never see how a disabled person can feel about their lives when no matter how happy or fun your life is for some moment, you still go on every single day hating it. 
 One of the biggest make or break moments in any movie is how it ends and in this film it is done exceptionally well. When Louisa finds out that Will is planning to end his life in 6 months, she makes a plan to try and change his mind by showing him how his life can be with her. She takes him on a trip and they do many activities together building a romantic relationship. As the trips show how happy they were together you would think that he would change his mind and stay with Louisa because she has clearly shown that she will do anything to be with him no matter the circumstance. However, the last night at their romantic getaway, she admits that she knew about Dignitas, a society that provides assisted suicide, and how his parents only had six months. She begins to talk about how she can make his life better and show him what a great life looks like even if he's paralyzed. The saddening truth was that he knew no matter who it was, no one was going to change his mind. His mind was set and there was no going back. He knew that no matter what came in his way, they would never have to go through what he goes through and never understand what it's like to be in a wheelchair paralyzed from the neck down. 
 The ending is the sprinkles to the cake. The way the personality traits are set up, Will makes us believe he is having a great time with her on the trips Louisa plans, and soon coming down to keeping his decision the same before and after all the fun had occurred. It all ties together perfectly because in the perspective of a disabled man, you see how he truly feels and everyday he feels like a burden and doesn't want anyone else doing anything for him making it difficult on everyone. The ending wasn't a typical ""happily ever after"" or a ""he fell in love and knows that he can be happy again."" Sharrock ends with a completely different twist that will leave you with tears running down your face."

"blrnani","8","2","2","9 October 2017"," Wow, how different from Game of Thrones!
","Emilia Clarke is cute and totally lovable in this film, portraying a quirky character who is all heart. <br/><br/>And I can understand why girls might swoon over Sam Claflin, even when (SPOILER ALERTS) wheelchair bound.<br/><br/>Despite the tragic background, this is a delightful film that, while raising very serious issues, focuses on the personalities and how they interact. The result is often very funny, but also very moving.<br/><br/>Consequently, I am saddened by the reaction of some people, but it also helps me to understand the Trumpist backlash against the 'thought police' in American society. Because unfortunately there are some people who are not content to allow others to watch a film and form their own opinions about the issues portrayed. They want to tell them how to feel and how to think and it is heretical if the film allows the viewers to come to conclusions that may differ from their own. If the film does not specifically embrace their own views and values then they will try to harm it at the box office by driving people away through their rabid criticism.<br/><br/>Fortunately, this film is way above that putrid level and can be enjoyed both as entertainment (comedy, drama & romance) and for the meaningful questions about life that it raises. I found it comparable to ""Whose Life Is It Anyway"" and even better than ""The Intouchables""."
"renaeharrison","7","2","2","2 October 2017"," Worth a Watch
","I definitely consider this movie part of the chic flick genre which I usually avoid, but I could not stop myself from watching Emilia Clarke. It was so refreshing to see her doing something besides the mother of dragons. Don't get me wrong -- I love the Khaleesi as much as every other strong woman and Game of Thrones fan, but in this movie, I found her personality, likability and sometimes playful quirkiness delightful. It was mesmerizing and enough to make me glad I had watched the movie. Of course Sam Claflin is brilliantly handsome so there was no hardship there, either.<br/><br/>I found the movie somewhat reminiscent of The Fault in our Stars but without the waterworks that movie elicited. I would have preferred a different ending, but we don't always get what we want. <br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend watching this movie with a boyfriend but if you have a free night or want a slow night with a gal pal and a glass of wine, this movie might be worth a watch."
"bignose-67352","10","2","2","3 September 2017"," One of the few romantic films that does not suck!
","A wonderful movie even for people who are not fans of romantic films. It's not groundbreaking or particularly challenging for the viewer, but it's definitely entertaining and sweet. Both Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke are charming as Will Traynor and Louisa Clarke and they do justice to their book counterparts, although they do get a little cheesy towards the end but I think it's just the writers' fault. Anyway, the film is beautifully shot, the soundtrack is perfect and in general the writing is good and adequately smart, so I can forgive a few cheesy lines here and there. <br/><br/>As far as the controversy that arose over the way the film ends and its treatment of the disabled, well.. If a man choosing to end his life on his own terms is offensive then so be it. I personally think it fit the character's arrogant and stubborn personality even though I'd prefer an 'easy' and satisfactory happy ending. But then again, if there was a happy ending, there would be a whole new bunch of complaints about the stupid love-conquers-all cliché, or how Will's parents and Lou would be patronizing him, or any other crap that someone might think of. I do agree that representation of people with disabilities should be better. BUT that is not this movie's problem."
"Horst_In_Translation","8","2","2","2 September 2017"," Pretty good movie, with occasional shots at greatness
","""Me Before You"" is a definite contender for the most known romantic drama of 2016. But first things first: This one here runs for 110 minutes and was directed by Thea Sharrock while Jojo Moyes adapted her own novel for the screen here. And the result isn't shabby at all as this one scored a decent deal of awards recognition that turned the film into by far the most known work for both writer and director. And while male lead actor Sam Claflin has already starred next to the likes of Kristen Stewart, Jennifer Lawrence, Johnny Depp and other pretty big names from Hollywood, there is no denying that he plays only second fiddle here to female lead Emilia Clarke. The latter is of course known to millions, if not billions, from Game of Thrones, but good news is that thanks to the different hair color, it is very easy to not see her Daenarys character this time which may have hurt the film overall. I think she did a very good job. Her energetic, sparkling presence was one of the best aspects about the film and makes it easy to forgive her for occasional moments of ""overthetopness"", for example when her boyfriend arrives on her birthday and she tells everybody that somebody rang the doorbell. They also really tried to make her look not as gorgeous as she is, which was a huge challenge as even in these strange clothes she was obviously still a huge stunner. Claflin did a very good job too and he had the difficult task that really all his acting had to take place above his neck because of the character's disability. I found him memorable. Other known names include Charles Dance, Oscar nominee McTeer or Matt Lewis from Harry Potter, but honestly those were just in the shadows of the two protagonists because their material simply wasn't on the same level in terms of both quality and quantity.<br/><br/>As a whole, I thought this was a really good film. The writing was smart on many occasions and it is always a success for films closer to 120 minutes than to 90 minutes if they drag as little as this one here. It also manages to stay away from the pretentious side and there was the danger it could enter this area on several occasions. But it managed nicely. The film is also not trying to make any political statements as it really is all about the tragic(?) story of the two protagonists here. Some scenes stay in mind especially like when he reveals his suicide plans to her because his body was a cage. Or also the scene in which she is watching an old video of him before the accident. The film included exactly the right approach to romance too in my opinion. They did not have to go for a huge love story or anything in order to have the tragedy work here. If you enjoyed this film as much as I did, then let me recommend you ""A Walk to Remember"" or ""Griffin and Phoenix"" or ""The Notebook"" although I am sure you have at least seen the latter already. Back to this one here, I do share the praise and I think it is an achievement that feels both real and touching. Maybe it is generally more for women, but definitely not exclusively if you manage to open yourself up here to the fate of the two protagonists. I also quite like the title. I am not a Game of Thrones fan at all, so I guess this makes up for a slight Emilia Clarke fanboy tendency and turns me into a neutral observer. A good, no a great watch for people curious about Game of Thrones stars in other projects. And actually for everybody else too. This film is among 2016's very finest and I highly recommend checking out."
"saphiric","8","2","2","26 August 2017"," ""Live boldly. Push yourself. Don't settle.""
","Admittedly, I clicked this movie mainly due to Sam Clafflin. Thinking it would just be another cheesy romantic dramedy, I wasn't able to account for the tears rolling down my cheeks at the unexpected ending. This is definitely one of those stories that will leave a mark on me and join my other top 3 romantic films Amelie, Jeux d'Enfants and Man Up<br/><br/>What set this ending apart from all the others with forgettable fate was how it balanced out the themes of redemption and sacrifice. Will's pre- accident life/pre-Louisa encounter was perfect, he was happy, successful and on top of the world in everything. Lousia's pre-Will encounter life was ordinary: she had a stable boyfriend and a generally good life but was unable to really explore the world and find herself due to financial and self imposed obligations. Will's pre-accident character would never have noticed Louisa; their worlds were too different.<br/><br/>Their encounter gradually shifts the scales towards equilibrium. Now they're with each other every single day, their worlds opening up and slowly colliding as they share their experiences with each other. She learns about different cultures through French cinema, classical music, horse racing; he learns about the joyful simplicity of being carefree through her eccentricity and quirk. Their perspectives slowly change as they develop a mutual affection that transcends common romantic love, the type that always seems to hinge around lust and sexual attraction. Of course, there are selfish elements to their love: she needs the job for money; likes to feel needed, and he needs her companionship. But all of that is massively drowned out by the rich unconditional affection and care they develop for each other through their shared adventures. The relationship blossoms organically, and never once felt forced.<br/><br/>The ending ultimately re-balances the karmic scale. It didn't give us a happily ever after ending because that would be massively unbalanced: you can't have your cake and eat it too. He dies, because in his view, however warped and cowardly you may think that is, it's the only way out of his pain. But his death symbolically paves the way for her new life. She's no longer trapped because, more importantly than the bit of money he left her, her meeting him opened her mind and eyes to the amazing possibilities in life. It wasn't the fancy vacations, French bakeries or luxuries being associated with wealth, it was the raw feeling of living and taking any experience to its fullest, like the unnervingly beautiful thunderstorm they watched together.<br/><br/>Meeting him, in essence, freed her spirit. And she is now able to live her life to its full potential, in the same way he had lived his perfect life before his accident. And similarly, Will died happy and as contented as he could be. One would argue more content than before his accident, because he found for the first time, as brief as it was, a glimpse of love and affection stemming from a rare acceptance so deep as she was willing to put aside her own feelings, accept his life-ending decision and be with him until the end. They ""saved"" each other, inspired in each other hope and even though it wasn't enough to change Will's mind, and even though they didn't end up together, their encounter left a mark in each other, one that transcends time and death. It's really the purest form of love.<br/><br/>On a macro level, I love everything about the themes; they echo my own philosophies on life and love. Even on the granular level, the few stand-out emotional performances more than made up for some of the predictable writing and tropes. In particular, the scene when Will revealed the pain of living in his current condition to Lou, that he can't accept her love and be with her like how he wanted. So much kudos to Sam's stunning performance, it was not one bit under or overacted, and I really felt all of the character's unspoken pain in those few minutes.<br/><br/>I can understand controversies the ending created; some say it sends a bad message. But similar to Louisa's reaction to the ending of ""Of Gods and Men"", where she cried out incredulously how she didn't agreed with it, and how the main character should have stayed but all the whilst admitting she still loved the movie: that's how I felt about this ending. I didn't agree with Will's decision. He should have stayed. But I didn't take it as something negative and definitely not preaching an anti-disabled lifestyle moral either. People can't fathom why this mega rich pretty-boy wallow in so much self pity and decides to end his life when he seems to be on his way heading out of the trenches.<br/><br/>Of course, if you were to look at this without immersing yourself in his shoes, it's tempting to say nothing about his decision makes any sense. And that's pretty true:ample psychology research tells us that the future self we envision ourselves to lead is often very far from what actually happens. What likely would happen is Will adapting to this lifestyle and living happily with Louisa. But that wasn't the point of the story. He couldn't see past his disability, no matter how much love there was.<br/><br/>This wasn't meant to be a finding-hope-after-tragedy type of movie, and frankly, it would have fallen into the same vein as dozens of others with similar story lines if it played out that way. I took this movie as a coming of age story; love was just the undertone. Ultimately it is about finding your inner spark, and igniting that spark in others you've met. But regarding the romantic aspect, it was more than successful in its attempt to portray an ephemeral but pure unconditional bond between two people who never was meant to be together in the stark bitterness of reality."
"Jackbv123","7","2","2","30 July 2017"," Very relevant story
","At the heart of this movie is an emotional political issue, but first let me say something about how well done the movie is.<br/><br/>Of course Emilia Clarke does a wonderful job and is quite lovable in Lou's quirky way. Sam Claflin has a difficult part and does it well also. Janet McTeer and Charles Dance, as Will's parents, also play difficult roles and help us get drawn into the emotion of the story. I am a Jenna Coleman fan and had to wonder what she would have been like as Lou.<br/><br/>It becomes clear about half way in that this is not going to be a happily ever after story no matter what happens in the end.<br/><br/>As to the politics, I am against any kind of suicide for moral reasons. I don't believe that the choice of when a person dies lies with mortal man. More importantly, I am concerned that in a society where assisted suicide becomes at all common, it also becomes very easy for various forces to take away the choices of those who want to live. Insurance companies already are very close to taking away that choice in some cases. Will and his family did not seem to have the financial pressure. For people with a family that already lives on the edge financially, a medical condition like Will's could threaten to destroy it for everyone.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I can sympathize with the way Will felt. While I don't condone the result, I can see how the hopelessness, especially the day to day hopelessness, can lead a person to think that Will's choice is the better one.<br/><br/>I thought this story dealt with the issue respectfully and gives plenty of reason for thought and discussion."

The film takes the stance of being in two difficult places, one from a quadriplegic and two, an endearing young British lady who just needs a job - but is as bubbly, cute, color and inexperienced as you could possibly be! <br/><br/>The story here makes great sincerity and now, I really wonder if the book could be as good as what was depicted, shot and showed. Clarke's facial expressions are spot on and you clearly see the vastness of such a bright actress. She shows more in this film than in GOT and obviously in Terminator. In fact, she slimmed down so much and looks amazing that in this physical form, she fits the youthful and vibrant stance of the character to perfection with her bright smile. <br/><br/>'Will Traynor' is played perfectly and you believe he is - a quad. His attitude is spot on not to mention it feels realistic no matter what your background may have been. Eloquently, the two become interested in each other and this is where the story becomes even richer as you wish for a certain outcome... Very well written if not one of THE best films I clearly was going to overlook. The critics are shamingly very wrong on this one. It'll darn near tear on your heart and the scenes and locations were the right fit. I'm struggling to find negatives to identify, but honestly, if there are, they're very far and in between as your mind stays with the plot and keeps you moving. Loved it. Completely loved it and I do NOT like 'endearing love' style of movies. <br/><br/>There is a plot twist that shows itself midway and for a unique step, it challenges the writing. Well done; I praise the script and those that approved it. It'll leave you in a torn spot among movies in the past, for it truly moves the soul here. Simply, loved it. Cheers!"

","This movie treads a tricky line, both infuriating and charming viewers. Emilia Clarke tries to fill the emotional vacuum with full-on kook as a carer for a hunky quadriplegic in Thea Sharrock's wipe- clean romance. The charm can be chalked up to star Clarke; she makes Lou the type of beguiling creature we've seen in films before who's often known as a ""manic pixie dream girl"" -- quirky, irreverent, and usually irresistible. Which is also where the infuriation comes in: The MPDG usually serves the function of making a male protagonist feel lightened and leavened, without experiencing much development herself. Fully enjoyable movie, sit with pop-corn and enjoy."

","I loved the plot and the characters. It's the kind of movies that stays with you long after you watch it. Even though i don't agree with the ""Mercy killing"" concept but this movie was so full of emotions that you end up feeling the pain and joy of its characters. Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin were amazing, Lou or Clark's(Emilia Clarke) character was very easy to relate to and no women in her right mind wouldn't fall in love with Will(Sam Claflin). I also couldn't help falling in love with William's father (Charles Dance) and Lou's father (Brendan Coyle). This movie was not just another ""love story"" it makes you think about life and death, it's highly recommended and you'll want to watch it again."

Other parts of the movie were filled with happiness they made you smile and wish that you were in that film. I think that Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin were perfect together in this film and so great chemistry. That's why the film was so good. People that didn't like this film must have a cold heart.

","""Me Before You"" includes lush cinematography and a variety of exciting locales for a well-photographed romantic film. The story is about a pair of star-crossed lovers who sadly met at the wrong time.<br/><br/>Will Traynor, played stoically by Sam Claflin, is a wealthy playboy, who was paralyzed when struck by a motor bike. His well-intentioned parents hire a young woman to help care for Will, hoping that he will not choose to end his life with an assisted death.<br/><br/>Louisa Clark is the helper, who desperately needs the job to support her unemployed parents. Of course, money is no longer the issue when it becomes clear that Will and Louisa are falling deeply in love. The major dramatic question is whether that bonding will be enough to restore the life force in Will.<br/><br/>The actress who plays Louisa is a perky performer named Emilia Clarke. While there may be moments that are over-the-top in exuberance, the actress nonetheless conveys a bubbly, brimming-over-with-life quality that makes her a scene stealer throughout the film. If her ebullience is not enough, there are jaw-dropping, quirky costumes worn by Louisa that add to her colorful character.<br/><br/>The scripting of ""Me Before You"" was somewhat bland without truly scintillating dialogue. It was the standout performance of Emilia Clarke that made the film special. It would be difficult to imagine any other performer in this memorable role."

"TxMike","Null","2","2","16 September 2016"," The complications of taking your own life.
","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. <br/><br/>Set in England, Sam Claflin is Will Traynor, young successful businessman from a wealthy family. As the movie starts we see him going out to the street, momentarily distracted, and he is hit by a large motorcycle.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't dwell at all on the accident or its immediate aftermath, instead it switches to two years later. Will is now living back with his parents, he is mostly a quadriplegic and confined to a motorized wheelchair. He has a professional caregiver who comes in especially for the medical and personal care issues. But Will isn't happy or even faking happiness, he is always in a rather sour mood.<br/><br/>Emilia Clarke (of 'Game of Thrones' fame) is ditzy Lou Clark, a 26-yr- old with a job as a clerk, as we meet her near the end of her day's work she is given an envelope with her last pay, she has just lost her job. She is from a working family and with an unemployed dad, she needs to find work to help with expenses.<br/><br/>Through a placement agency she is presented a job, unclear what exactly it is but it would be working for Will's parents, she would be a companion of sorts for Will, drive him places, find ways to keep him entertained. Even though Will himself doesn't want any part of that plan. Will is dour, Lou always dresses colorful and funky and is always upbeat.<br/><br/>So the story here really is to see if somehow Lou can break through and get Will to better enjoy his handicapped life. Things are complicated quickly when Lou learns that Will is planning to travel to Switzerland for assisted suicide. He has promised his family he would give it 6 months before making his final decision.<br/><br/>So the story is both funny and painful. Both main actors do fine jobs with their roles. Life is seldom simple.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: In the process both Will and Lou fall in love with each other. Lou even lets go of her existing relationship. She desperately wants Will to stay, build a life with her. But as much as he would like that he can't forget his former active lifestyle. And he doesn't want Lou to be burdened, perhaps for many years, with him in his condition. So he goes through with his plans and in his will leaves a handsome sum of money for Lou, as he says, not so that she is fixed for life but enough to allow her a fresh start and a real career."
"cyim89","10","2","2","31 August 2016"," Bawled My Eyes Out
","So Me Before You consists of a very sensitive subject and for that, has received a lot of criticism. Putting my own views aside, this film is so charming and touching - really, one of the most moving films I have ever watched (can't remember one as emotional as this). <br/><br/>Lou, the main girl, is Daenaryus (spelling?) from Game of Thrones and her role couldn't be more opposite but I'm glad that it is - she is a total nerd, quirky yet witty and lovable all at the same time. *Spoiler* One of my favorite scenes was when she opened her birthday gift from Will and was absolutely shaking with excitement at the bumble bee tights he gave her. Her reaction was seriously heartwarming and hilarious and not to mention the beautiful smile it gave Will was enjoyable.<br/><br/>Will, the main guy, is so believable - from his depressed, bitter and sarcastic attitude in the beginning to the inspiring and witty man he becomes after meeting Lou. He doesn't smile often due to his unfortunate circumstances but when he does, boy, it lights up an entire room honestly. Love that guy!<br/><br/>I bawled my eyes out in the end, almost sobbing uncontrollably it was so moving. This film has stayed with me long after I'd first seen it and will continue to long after I move on. I only discovered it last week and have watched it three times already. Of course, this is my favorite genre and so it's very appealing to me. I also just got my eyelash extensions done and have had to be very careful in how much I cry. <br/><br/>Lovers of the romantic/comedy drama will not be disappointed and will absolutely fall in love with this film!"
"charles_de_bergeyck","10","2","2","29 August 2016"," Proof that Emilia Clarke is a way underestimated actress!
","I'm a guy, and by definition I will act as one, meaning: no movies about complicated love ever... But if you have to watch one, watch this one (that's what I did and I don't regret it for a single second).<br/><br/>Why? I'll tell you why: Emilia Clarke's portrayal of ""Clark"" is amazing; she's sweet, caring and above all: she makes you feel peaceful. Her role as Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones prepared me to anything but not to this. You laugh with her, cry with her and most importantly: live with her. Her eccentric dresses, her smile and especially her eyebrows radiate so much sincerity that it makes my heart ache with happiness. <br/><br/>Pace by pace, step by step, you follow her difficult journey through her life as the caretaker of a young, rancorous, disabled young man who just wants to stop living. She's able to give him a taste of what life good be and what good it still could bring. <br/><br/>This movie moved me with tears, but the good kind; the kind that leaves you wanting more of those movies, the kind that takes your breath away,, the kind that will make me watch all of the next Emila Clarke's movies.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope you'll enjoy this movie as much as I did, because it was magical and unique."

Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke is a wonderful match. They look so great in this film. I think one important part in the novel that shouldn't be left out in the movie is when Lou decided to move in with Patrick. I think that's quite a big point where we could see Will wasn't able to hide his feelings anymore. I think it can build more tensions b/w the characters.

","Im not much for romance, but so many people complained they didn't like the ending and Emilia seemed charming enough to watch. Yes, it suffers a few clichés, but i enjoyed it. You might say the pain was downplayed but we saw the story from Lous perspective and not Wills. And as someone who has recently struggled with severe depression I connected to it. I connected to that strange feeling of enjoying some of your time, laughing, enjoying a person you love and at the same time feel horrible. I saw my boyfriends reactions and pain in Clarkes reactions to his pain. I felt this movie. On the other hand, Sams performance was a revelation. I vaguely remember him from The Hunger Games, found him very boring and bland in it. But here, he shined. I believed him in his blank stares, happiness, pain. Not many actors pull that off for me. And of course Emilia's and Sam's relationship is great, they worked wonderfully together.<br/><br/>It has problems of typical romance films, but the story that looms behind it, and pops out is very strong, and well done. We are taken off into the charming romp com world only to be snapped back to the reality of his disability and pain he is in."

Since both movies have a quadriplegic lead and a caretaker , a hospital appointed nurse in case of guzaarish ..both asking for euthanasia..and budding romance between them.. they are almost similar.. But guzaarish is very beautifully shot and romance actually feels very real and other character are also well established and there is no way u won't cry 3 or 4 during this movie.. so after watching Guzaarish it wasn't a very money worthy experience for me since i kept on comparing both movies and me before u wasn't better even though it has 6 more years of advancement in filmmaking.."

We all know where it should go, but in other hands we have to realize it might not get handled in the same manner. So many other similar films just do not come off with the level of care this one does. It's only 110 minutes long but plays longer, but none of it seems forced or protracted.

The actors did an amazing job with their characters and the producers and director did an amazing job with the film.

Some people say bad things about Emilia Clarke and her acting, but yet again, unsurprisingly she was perfect. Through my heightened sense of empathy, I could imagine how a paralysed man would feel, and Sam Clafin performed the role to perfection. For a soppy romance movie, this was great. 8/10, it's missing two for the silly reason that it is a romance film, I rated The Flash a 10, so rating this 10 would go against my core values. In conclusion, even is this movie is not something you'd usually watch because of its genre, I'd give it a chance anyway, because...Emilia Clarke, even in her dorky dresses was absolutely sublime, and it's worth watching just because of her, well, it was my reason anyway."

The movie has one ending but I try to find out another one by watching it many times. I think Im so stupid. I think you will buy the book when watching it or something crazy that you will search for the bumblebee tights.<br/><br/>Clark,<br/><br/>A few weeks will have passed by the time you read this (even given your newfound organizational skills, I doubt you will have made it to Paris before early September). I hope the coffee is good and strong and the croissants fresh and that the weather is still sunny enough to sit outside on one of those metallic chairs that never sit quite level on the pavement. It's not bad, the Marquis. The steak is also good, if you fancy coming back for lunch. And if you look down the road to your left you will hopefully see L'Artisan Parfumeur where, after you read this, you should go and try the scent called something like Papillons Extrême (can't quite remember). I always did think it would smell great on you.<br/><br/>Okay, instructions over. There are a few things I wanted to say and would have told you in person, but a) you would have got all emotional and b) you wouldn't have let me say all this out loud. You always did talk too much.<br/><br/>So here it is: the cheque you got in the initial envelope from Michael Lawler was not the full amount, but just a small gift, to help you through your first weeks of unemployment, and to get you to Paris.<br/><br/>When you get back to England, take this letter to Michael in his London office and he will give you the relevant documents so you can access an account he has set up for me in your name. This account contains enough for you to buy somewhere nice to live and to pay for your degree course and your living expenses while you are in full- time education.<br/><br/>My parents will have been told all about it. I hope that this, and Michael Lawler's legal work, will ensure there is as little fuss as possible.<br/><br/>Clark, I can practically hear you starting to hyperventilate from here. Don't start panicking, or trying to give it away – it's not enough for you to sit on your arse for the rest of your life. But it should buy you your freedom, both from that claustrophobic little town we both call home, and from the kind of choices you have so far felt you had to make.<br/><br/>I'm not giving the money to you because I want you to feel wistful, or indebted to me, or to feel that it's some kind of bloody memorial.<br/><br/>I'm giving you this because there is not much that makes me happy any more, but you do.<br/><br/>I am conscious that knowing me has caused you pain, and grief, and I hope that one day when you are less angry with me and less upset you will see not just that I could only have done the thing that I did, but also that this will help you live a really good life, a better life, than if you hadn't met me.<br/><br/>You're going to feel uncomfortable in your new world for a bit. It always does feel strange to be knocked out of your comfort zone. But I hope you feel a bit exhilarated too. Your face when you came back from diving that time told me everything; there is a hunger in you, Clark. A fearlessness. You just buried it, like most people do.<br/><br/>I'm not really telling you to jump off tall buildings, or swim with whales or anything (although I would secretly love to think you were), but to live boldly. Push yourself. Don't settle. Wear those stripy legs with pride. And if you insist on settling down with some ridiculous bloke, make sure some of this is squirrelled away somewhere. Knowing you still have possibilities is a luxury. Knowing I might have given them to you has alleviated something for me.<br/><br/>So this is it. You are scored on my heart, Clark. You were from the first day you walked in, with your ridiculous clothes and your bad jokes and your complete inability to ever hide a single thing you felt. You changed my life so much more than this money will ever change yours.<br/><br/>Don't think of me too often. I don't want to think of you getting all maudlin.

"zoobaloogle","1","14","27","8 August 2017"," Disturbing
","Indeed the story was moving and the actors did very well, but the story itself is extremely disturbing regarding the value of human life. I can see potential for a few interpretations about Lou's take--she might still disagree with Will about his decision but she's supporting him because it's what he wants. But that's not really the question. There are definite politics here about the right to live and/or die with dignity that are very disturbing. How can we call ourselves civilized when we've come to the point that we can accept and support someone's decision to end his life simply because he can't enjoy it to the fullest as he once did? His parents were very loving and he definitely could afford to go on living. His mind was alive and well, and he was positively contributing to his society. Why are we supposed to accept this as his right to choose? Unbelievable. But that's not all. The other disturbing thing is the pushing of the notion that one can't accept life unless it's full of exotic and costly adventures. Lou wasn't free to live her life until the end when Will left her an inheritance of tons of money. Think. Life is worth living, even if you're in a wheelchair, even if you're going through hard trials, even if you don't have much money, even if your mind isn't as sharp as it once was, even if you can't do a number of things. Boo."
"hthbrr2","1","29","64","23 August 2016"," Emilia Clarke's eyebrows make this movie unwatchable
","I tired to watch this movie I really did. But I quickly realized that Emilia Clarke CAN'T ACT. And made the movie unwatchable.<br/><br/>What I do with movies is skip through them a bit just to get a feel of what the movie is like. Too many movies I sit through about 10 mins and I feel like 'I wasted 10 min of my life I will never get back!' NEVER AGAIN! So I skip and within a few minutes can tell if I should even BOTHER watching the whole movie. I did this with this one and saw there was nothing worth watching. Just a pile of dung really.<br/><br/>So basically, as most people can tell by the current state of cinema, that it's not really the movie that is important, it's what is behind the scenes. Like take the recent Suicide Squad. Hyped as all get out. And it turned out to be a dud. I have not seen it yet, but I am not shocked. The REASON that movie was made was to cash in on the popularity of superhero movies. Avengers, Justice League, Bat/Super/Spider man, etc.<br/><br/>Now to the reason this movie was made: THIS movie is a VEHICLE to try and launch the career of these two actors. Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin. Emilia Clarke is famous for the same reason Sasha Grey is, to put it lightly. Emilia Clarke appeared totally naked in the basically soft core p0rn TV show + gore that is ""Game of Thrones"". That is all really. The only reason she is in this movie is to make her look like a 'serious/real actress'. Nope, sorry girl, you are just a piece of meat, you wont fool me. And Sam Claflin, sorry, you can act, but you just can't carry a movie. You will ALWAYS be ONLY a SUPPORTING actor. Sorry. I thought we learned that lesson in the failure that was ""Love, Rosie"" (2014). Lily Collins ALSO can't carry a movie. WHY are we making the same mistake in THIS movie????<br/><br/>It was painful watching Emilia Clarke try to break her type casting as the 'hot girl' playing a 'nerdy girl'. REALLY? Painful to watch just painful. She can't act, and the movie is just trash. The story as well. I mean it's like insult to injury. Imagine a sick old hobo just lost control over his bowels and bladder, in a dumpster where he was digging for food, and you throw a dead body on top, vomit, throw some dirty diapers in there, and top it all off with medical waste. That is a good way to describe this movie. From bad to worse. 1. Bad actress 2. No leading man 3. Bad plot 4. bad .......well you get the point.<br/><br/>Good movies are just good movies, there should be no ulterior motives. Just make a movie. I don't even know what I fu(&!ng expected from this movie it was so bad. A nice little rom com at least. Nope just a pile of tripe. STOP making movies for reasons other than making a good movie!<br/><br/>(p.s. her eyebrows were Emma Watson level bad)"

It is very, very difficult to find a review of this movie that includes the fact that the film is an advocacy piece for assisted suicide for disabled people. My wife's friends from Church took her to this movie, thinking that it is akin to a chick flick. They wanted to help her see a lighter side to life, a mere 16 months since our older son took his life as a result of his mental illness. Needless to say, this movie is not the right antidote for that. But, who would have known the truth from reading the reviews of the movie? No one.

So he selfishly ends his ""pain and suffering"" by assisted suicide, thereby transferring his pain on those who love him for the rest of their lives? What a terrible message to send to anyone facing trials of life! AWFUL!"
"gulag","3","8","14","13 December 2016"," A Truly Dishonest Film
","So what does the phrase ""Me Before You"" mean? Does it mean I will be unselfish and put myself and my wishes before yours? Not from the context of this film.<br/><br/>For most of this movie I tended to be with it. It was refreshing to see Emilia Clarke as a vulnerable emotional goofball. And then came the point of decision. And she pours her heart out to him, revealing the depth of her feeling for him. And yet he resolutely chooses death. And then after what seems like it might have been a chance to ruminate over the meaning of life she is convinced very easily that the most loving thing is to be by his side at his chosen end. And he dies. Plot spoiled but you really should know this now before you see it. And she gets scads of money to follow her heart and and a goodbye note telling her to forget about him. Fat chance. At the point of decision I thought to myself if he chooses life even with his pain this would be a pretty good romantic movie. But then I thought if this story takes the road chosen by the obvious media proclivities of the 21st Century he'll choose to die, but he'll give her money. Sure enough.<br/><br/>And the moral to the story is this. Each person lives alone. Love is figment of the moment. Nobody changes their minds and to try to do so would be morally wrong. What is most important is to follow your dreams. Any serious lessening of the ability to do that would be to live so poorly that only death is a cure. So he can no longer follow his dreams, and though his existence clearly helps and changes her life for the good, that is NOT good enough reason to live with serious pain. And since she gets to follow her dreams everything is ultimately for the best.<br/><br/>What utter bullshit. It is really time to start questioning the assumption that the meaning of life is to follow one's dreams, especially since it is clear that this is the fondest wish of the commercial establishment upon us. It is only the illusion of choice. ""Me Before You"" now seems to mean I'm before you in line and you aren't cutting in. It becomes the complete statement of selfishness."
"christian-larson","7","8","14","23 June 2016"," Best romance from 2016 so far
","Me before you stars Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin and its the story of a woman (Emilia Clarke) and her story of how she falls in love with a man that cannot move either his legs and his arms. Emilia Clarke is amazing as her character, she completely became her character. I cannot think of another actress that will portray her character, well Daisy Ridley can because Emilia Clarke's performance did remained me of her. Sam Claflin was serviceable, he can easily be replaced. The story is really what drives this movie to the top. The relationship between Lou and Will is great, you really believe that they are in love. The music is used appropriately, only one time it annoyed me but it was once and it did not take me out of the film. The cinematography was great as well as the production design. The biggest problem i have with this film its is 3 act. It is really cheesy and makes the cliché that one person gets mad with one another, and you know they're gonna get back together and its just lazy writing. Its not awful but it ain't good either. Also since Emilia Clarke is so fantastic as her character, its really distracting when she is not in a scene, and you kind off get lost in the story. Other than that, I found that Me Before You was a great film about love, relationships and letting go. Beautiful visuals and an unique script made this film the best love story of 2016 (so far). 8/10"

The movie was funny in some parts, serious in others as well as sad in other parts. Emilia Clarke is hilarious in this movie and I absolutely love the character's dress sense, in which Will Traynor likes to mock. Sam Claflin plays the part amazingly which reduces you to tears by the end of the movie. Clarke and Claflin's on-screen relationship is one of the best things about the movie, in some parts it makes you laugh, others cry and a lot of the time you have a smile on your face when they're together. The movie overall was so much better than I thought I and cannot wait for the release on Blu-ray, I will definitely be buying it! I don't understand all the negative reviews, this film was absolutely brilliant. It was so good, that when I heard there was a book, I instantly bought the eBook and I've started reading it. Do not listen to the negative reviews and do not hesitate to see this movie, go and watch it while it's still in the cinemas or if you're reading this after the DVD release, go purchase the film and give it a watch, you won't regret it."

","When taking a beloved book from page to screen, it's tough to recreate the magic on screen. Well, the movie version of 'Me Before You' is the perfect adaptation of Jojo Moyes' book. Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin simply are Lou Clark and Will Traynor.<br/><br/>Me Before You is going to be your new favorite romantic movie. The movie will make your laugh, cry and smile from start to finish, thanks to Jojo Moyes' lovely book and Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin's stellar performances.<br/><br/>Me Before You is the film adaptation of Jojo Moyes' 2012 novel. Lou Clark (Emilia) becomes a caregiver for Will Traynor (Sam). Will was once action man, who sought out adventure each and every day. However, he was paralyzed from the chest down after a shocking motorcycle accident.<br/><br/>Lou's job is essentially just to cheer him up. Lou is bright and shiny, while Will is brooding and dark. Despite a rough start, Will's hardness begins to fade away with Lou's help. Together, Lou and Will discover new adventures and experience life in a way they never thought possible.<br/><br/>Lou falls hard for Will, and she believes she can make Will happy. Will, who will never accept his new limitations, thinks he's keeping Lou from living her best life. But that's not how Lou sees it.<br/><br/>I'm just telling you now, the ending of Me Before You will make you ugly-cry. Lou and Will's star-crossed love story will break your heart in half. I didn't think it was possible to love Lou and Will more, but Emilia and Sam did it. When Emilia smiles, you smile. When she cries, you cry.<br/><br/>Emilia and Sam gave their heart and soul to the roles of Lou and Will. Emilia's Lou is nothing like Daenerys Targaryen, and the role shows a new side of Emilia's incredible acting skills. Sam embraces Will's physical constraints and adds even more layers than were present in Jojo's book.<br/><br/>Their chemistry is electric, and it's bound by something more than just sexual tension. Because of their marvelous performances, Emilia and Sam elevate the emotional complexities of their characters even more on screen. Me Before You works on every single level. Even if you haven't read the book, you'll inevitably fall in love with this movie. And you should. It's that good."

","My wife and I were very impressed at the beginning of this movie, and through the middle. We grew a bit uncomfortable when the young girl finds out the fellow in the wheelchair has decided to kill himself (through assisted suicide). At the end of the movie we both felt very let down. Not only did she not succeed in changing his mind, she actually becomes happy about it as if life is only lived for moments when you can really experience something.<br/><br/>Sad, sad, commentary on life, and very narrow minded. First, I know a couple people who have been injured and confined to wheelchair, quadriplegic or otherwise. They took the time to adjust, and one has been that way for near 40 years and has a wonderful life. He did not quit or give up on life, just because his life before the accident was so ""Tremendous"" or whatever it was the wimpy dude said in this movie.<br/><br/>If you want to make a movie about someone with redemption or about overcoming adversity, then you had best not have the person quit at the end, like a whiny cry-baby and try to convince everyone out there that ""The world is better off without me because I hate my life now, but loved it before..."" That's a cop out, totally and completely. It's not an ad for assisted suicide, it's just a dramatic interpretation of a dude who gave up, and let everyone down.<br/><br/>We gave it 8/10 for acting. But, the overall movie is a 2 since the premise and the interpretation are so wrong. So, it gets a total score of 4/10 compromise from us."

","This story shows us what love truly is and makes us want to me more like the characters in the story. It shows us that to love someone is more than their appearance and more than what their ""disabilities"" are. It shows that love is when we care about someone so much that when we have to let go it takes makes every single part of us hurt, but we still let them go because we love them. Jojo Moyes is also known for the trilogy to this book, the movie ""Head Full of Honey"", and coming out with her new movie, ""Last Letter from Your Lover"". This movie is sort of similar to ""The Notebook"" or ""The Fault in Our Stars"". It is also sort of similar to the new movie ""The Upside"", however, this story is its own. I think that older teenagers to adults should watch this movie. It has a great story line that sometimes requires a little bit of reading between the lines and having a little bit of background information. I also would recommend reading the book and then watching the movie because the book adds a little more information that sometimes isn't explained in the movie so then by the time you do watch the movie it makes more sense."

","Recently released out , Me before you , film adaptation by Thea Sharrock of Jojo Moyes book became really popular these last few months. At first sight, the cast seemed interesting, and the trailer looked like a typical dramatic love story we are all used to see. Hopefully, I was wrong about that because it was really different and I recommend you to go watch it if you haven't done it yet. <br/><br/>The story takes place in England in a small and peaceful town. Louisa Clarke, 26 years old, works at the coffee shop to help her parents financially but when she looses her job, she needs to find a new one as soon as possible. After going to the job center, she is proposed to work for the Traynor's quadriplegic son, William Traynor. A job she struggles with because of his bad temper. The situation gets better when they learn to know each other, and the colorful Louisa becomes the only thing he lives for. But...a big decision changes everything.<br/><br/>Sam Claffin and Emilia Clarke, both well know for big roles have been well chosen to embody the mains characters. I seriously couldn't imagine it could be someone else instead of them. They convey so much emotion I couldn't stop watching and I felt like if I was with them in the film. During the whole film, they made me laugh, because it's not only a drama like I thought, they have a really funny relationship.<br/><br/>The landscapes and decors in the film are really impressing. I particularly liked the scenery around the castle and also the island where they spent their holidays. <br/><br/>If you like romance and funny movies, I recommend you to watch the film. It's sure, you will cry but it's so beautiful, it's worth it."
"rjkjklose","7","3","4","7 November 2016"," A Heartfelt Romance Avoids Mediocrity
","One of this Summer's biggest romances ""Me Before You"" stars Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin as two people who come together despite having very different backgrounds. Thea Sharrock directs this film based on a book of the same name written by Jojo Moyes who also provides the screenplay. While this movie isn't a breakthrough in any way and is host to many flaws, its leading characters chemistry and sincere tone carry it past mediocrity. <br/><br/>The premise here is quite simple: Will Traynor (Sam Claflin) a young man with an amazing life and everything he had ever wanted is tragically injured and left as a shell of his former self. Louisa ""Lou"" Clark (Emilia Clarke) a young woman who has recently been fired from her job and is struggling to support her family is hired as his caregiver. This incredibly simple premise is nothing new, and does little to break the formula. Thankfully, Emilia Clark and Sam Claflin are great. They have amazing chemistry that ultimately carries this movie. Claflin's Traynor steals every scene he is in and his performance as a quadriplegic is believable while at the same time not overbearing. Clarke's Lou performs admirably, but at times she comes off as a little too odd and outlandish. Nothing bad enough to take away from the movie, yet at times distracting. Both of these actors come together to form a pair that is addicting to watch on screen and the best parts of the film are when these two actors come together to form a sincere bond. <br/><br/>Other characters including Lou's boyfriend (Matthew Lewis) and Traynor's caregiver (Stephen Peacocke) are quite likable and provide some great humor despite being criminally underdeveloped. Lou's Boyfriend is a lovable buffoon, yet their strained relationship felt unnecessary in the film. The caregiver provides some comic relief but fails to provide more than an unnecessary third wheel to the overall story. The relationship between Lou and her sister (Jenna Coleman) tries to be heartfelt but ends up feeling completely unnecessary. In fact, the relationship could be cut out of the movie completely and viewers would never know the difference. <br/><br/>The story here is incredibly cliché yet there are some surprising elements. Other than a few surprises the plot here plays out exactly like any other romance movie. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing due to the fact that most viewers are not going to see this movie for its groundbreaking storytelling. Rather audiences will flock to it looking for a heartfelt and passionate romance film, and that is exactly what they'll get. The soundtrack of the film fits the film quite well and some big moments are only amplified by some impressive music choices. Subtle yet sometimes quirky tones and pacing in this film work fine. In most instances though, the film feels rather sincere in the way it presents its story. Though people who have seen the trailers (which unsurprisingly shows far too much of the story) can pretty much tell how the movie is going to unfold, there are some surprises waiting. The biggest surprise of the film lies within its ending, which tackles a real life issue in today's world. Amazingly ""Me Before You"" does a fantastic job of presenting this issue with respect, while at the same time not shoving it down audience's throats. The film does such a good job presenting this subject that viewers will have ""Me Before You"" fresh in their minds for a long time. <br/><br/>Despite running into a myriad of Romantic film clichés, ""Me Before You"" does an admirable job of telling its story. Claflin and Clarke's performances and chemistry are undeniably what carry this movie, despite being surrounded by weak supporting characters. The way it tackles a real world issue with grace and class are quite impressive and leave a satisfying impression. Ultimately, ""Me Before You"" is a simple film that achieves what it originally set out to accomplish. It is a sappy yet cliché romance that provides an interesting look at a real world problem. Score: 7/10"
"AdityaChaphekar","8","3","4","5 November 2016"," Heart Breaking!
","The movie talks loud about the subtle love we feel with each other's company, the way we get close to someone in no time and we end up with the fondness of the person. Well, the film reminds me of Guzaarish, a Bollywood film starred by Aishwariya Rai and Hrithik Roshan. The movie is based on similar plot. Me Before You is a film about a quadraplegic man-Will traynor, a successful, young rich man meeting with an accident and losing the ability to move again ends up, being terminally paralyzed. Lou Clark, who takes up this job of taking care of Will and serving and spending time with him. She is chatty, funny and shabbily dressed yet quite simple, sweet and adorable. They both find affection for each other but they cannot continue it. The climax is arguably practical where Will takes a decision about his life according to what he had told his parents. Can't say the ending was perfect, but there is one thing to learn-No matter how small or big, how ugly or beautiful, poor or rich-if you spend time with someone and feel for him/her and the other person reciprocates feeling the same, you certainly weave few things into each others heart. Spending time with the one you love is the best thing one can do! be it few months, few weeks, few days or few hours, those are the Moments!"

In addition, Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin give us a moving performance during the whole film. The plot is something that I had never seen before and it's something very serious.

","IMDb says this is a drama / romance. They are sure right. My Wife had tears streaming from her eyes from the middle to the end. In some places she actually sobbed. For me, that settles it, this is a drama / romance. (She has never cried at one of my Sci-Fi movies??).<br/><br/>So, Here we are somewhere in the British Isles. I believe that the old castle is actually in Wales. The scenery is sometimes breathtaking. Will's family compound is an amazing stately mansion. Will lives on an upper floor which is his ""apartment"" and very modern for something that is a few hundred years old.. The Castle is really authentic, right down to the oyster shells mixed in the brick and mortar walls. <br/><br/>Will is a sad case since he is a quadriplegic. Along comes klutzy Louisa (aka: Lou) Clark. She' in desperate need of a job since she is the only working soul in the family of a half dozen. She comes to the Traynor home for a job interview. She stumbles, stutters, sweats, and fumbles her way through the interview with Mrs. Traynor. Who, by the way is the epitome of a British, rich living, Matriarch. With all the hi-jinx by our heroine, Madam Traynor sees something that causes her to give Louisa the job right then and there. The true adventure of drama and romance now starts with Lou's first meeting with Will. It is the same story we have seen a couple million times from the Hollywood folks. That fact does NOT mean that this is another ""Ho-Hum"" offering. There is a lot of psychological undertone just shooting around all of the main characters that is not much different than watching the Pleiades Meteor Showers.<br/><br/>Sam Claflin did a fine job at a tough role. It isn't easy playing a quadriplegic. It is as hard as it must be to actually be one. Emilia Clarke is wonderful free spirit known as ""Lou"". Remember the girl in your high school class that couldn't even breath, chew gum, and walk at the same time. Well, here you are.To top this off, she has a fine sunny persona that does not allow anyone within a days ride to be somber. Remember, I have not said anything about her crafty and sometimes brilliant strategies. I will give you one more bit of info, Lou's friend Patrick (Mat Lewis) really irritated me. He was such a jerk that I wanted to throw him into the North Sea.<br/><br/>This movie is the kind of stuff you watch on a rainy Sunday as you sit and sip wine while watching.<br/><br/>Even I liked it and I hate romances. <br/><br/>WFHBear"

"terrellrobinson71","8","3","4","20 July 2016"," It's time to live boldly with Will & Louisa in this terrific feel-good love story
","It's really hard for me to not spoil the surprises of a movie like ""Me Before You"". For general moviegoers, they'll be expecting another love story about two people who fall in love until one of the characters has a dark secret that could tear them apart. For fans of the book, they will love the fact that it's incredibly faithful to the Jojo Moyes novel (See ""The Fault in Our Stars"", ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" and other true-to-the-book movies for details), but they will also get so much more out of it. I recently read the novel last month before the film came out and I found the book affectionate, funny and surprisingly uplifting. I think the key to any book-based movie is to find the right actors to have not only good chemistry, but to make sure that audiences will remember the characters in their hearts. Boy, have they lucked out with two immensely charming actors in this terrific film. ""Me Before You"" tells the story of Louisa ""Lou"" Clark (Emilia Clarke), a 26-year-old happy-go-lucky woman who has been trying to find the right job to support her working-class family. That is until she unexpectedly finds one by working as a caregiver to Will Traynor (Sam Claflin). Will was ""The Man"", that guy who had everything at the palm of his hands until an motorcycle accident left him an quadriplegic. Now he's sarcastic, bitter, moody and thinking of really dark thoughts. How did his heart turn to ice? Anyway, Lou refuses to be put off by a man who lost everything and gave his friends and everybody, as Lou calls it, ""the (crappy) treatment"". Suddenly, it starts off being an antagonistic relationship to a rather healthy one as Lou, with the help of her sister, Treena (Jenna Coleman), tries to help Will understand that life is definitely worth living for. And, yes, they do start to fall for one another, until Will has that secret that could end it all. I like the movie, but I do have a couple of minor problems: The first one is that the movie is not exactly as deep and sometimes dark as the book was. However, I give it points for letting the book and the movie asks the two questions: ""Can you fall in love with a person but disagree on what their opinion of life is?"" and ""Can that same person change your life, even when it's least expected?"" The second one is that first-time feature film director Thea Sharrock moves the film a little too fast without giving us a moment to understand Will's plight and Lou's cheerful earnestness while trying to get to the best parts of the story. But those problems did wash away with the help of Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin. Clarke, best known as the Mother of Dragons on ""Game of Thrones"", should've been a breakout movie star with that last Terminator movie. Here, that title suits Clarke well as the character of the quick-witted but sometimes vulnerable Lou. Claflin, in his first movie outside of ""The Hunger Games"" series, has the most challenging role, so far. But he is remarkable as the stubborn but sincere Will. Their chemistry together is amazing. The supporting cast is also good too, with Janet McTeer and Charles Dance (also from ""Game of Thrones"") as Will's parents who are constantly worried about him and his safety, Stephen Peacocke as Will's nurse, Nathan, Matthew Lewis (Hello, Neville Longbottom) as Lou's boyfriend who is completely uncomfortable about Lou's job, Brendan Coyle and Samantha Spiro as Lou's parents and there's also a really funny cameo from the ""absolutely fabulous"" Joanna Lumley. Credit must be given to Jojo Moyes, who adapted her terrific book to the screen (she also wrote the sequel book ""After You"") with some witty dialogue, tender emotion and sometimes dealing with real themes, although it's not as deep as the book. ""Me Before You"" is a simple story, sure. But while it probably won't be in my top 5 of the best love stories ever, I still found it to be in the same old tradition of tearjerkers, the one where you laugh, you cry and you'll come out feeling good.

","I was sadly disappointed with this movie. I feel that there was an agenda to make killing one's self romantic or heroic. Clearly, this movie is an attempt to making an emotional movie that softens and dumbies the general person watching the film, whose ""feelings"" get in the way of hard realities of life and trying to find positive endings. There was no positiveness end, only a glorified death. So, instead of helping a disabled person see that they have so much to live for and see their value as a human person, we instead see a depiction of a disabled man who would rather kill his self than live with what inner joy and dignity he possessed. A film like this, does not contribute to the beauty of all people regardless of their ailments. I found it sad and over done with a manipulative story line. The acting was good but not great. The filming was very good. Definitely will not see this again! No hero. Just a movie to isolate further those with disabilities! I wish I could get my money back!"

","The story is exceptionally moving and made me empathize Will and Lou very much. After watching a film one question has torture me: how is it living full life and then all of a sudden become enabled? All your life is separated into two parts – before and after. How do the relatives and friends feel when they see that person suffers every single day? It's awful and scary. Really, really scary<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, the movie is mawkish, though there exists a clear line between soppy drama and sweet girlish melodrama. Of course, there are lots of ridiculous moments and stupid dialogues, strange behavior, but everything is so harmonious that you may forgive all the flaws. <br/><br/>Sam Claflin was brilliant. He coped with role easily. The actor managed to convey all the difficulties faced by the paralyzed people. Both moral and physical. Emilia Clarke was too eccentric. I realize that it was so according to the script in order to show her the immediacy and ease. However, as for me she looks far too sweet.<br/><br/>In general, the movie turned out bright and pleasant. I think I will reconsider this story more than once and get a maximum of emotion the same I had in the dark cinema hall."

","Warning!!! The film deals with heavy themes that may contrast with your religious or personal views, or be personal triggers, such as: suicide, assisted suicide, emotional and physical disabilities, and the inability of coping with said disabilities. It's bound to rankle feathers.<br/><br/>The film is charming, quirky, and depressing. It's definitely a film to watch with the girls, the beau was only mildly interested. Like many romances, Me Before You follows the basic formula, but hits the right notes to sucker punch you in the feels. Rich boy meets quirky/normal girl, girl attempts to ""fix"" boy, they fall in love. But there's a twist, girl can't ""fix"" the crippling pain and massive amounts of self-loathing boy experiences.<br/><br/>Verdict: ""Glass of wine, tissues, and a girl's night in"" kind of movie, nothing more."

","I enjoyed 'Me Before You' much more than I had anticipated. I was originally interested upon its trailer release (and I mean, it is easy to sell me when you attach an Ed Sheeran song to the trailer, but that is besides the point.), but now that I have actually seen the film, I am more satisfied in the result of my viewing than expected and also very interested in reading the book series. To start, Sam and Emilia were excellent. I see a very strong transition from TV to film through Emilia Clarke. Especially going from playing a role like Daenerys from 'Game of Thrones' and even the strong personality role of Sarah Connor in 'Terminator Genisys' to the sort of ditsy, sarcastic, soft, and kind role of Lou Clark. Her character had me honestly laughing in multiple scenes as she had hilariously awkward interactions with some other characters on top of her constant sarcasm. Sam Claflin was nothing short of hilarious as well. His equally sarcastic character of Will Traynor was frequently sparking laughs among the crowd as well as his relentless strong personality that transitioned from his able-bodied self to his handicapped self. On a different note, the chemistry between the two worked very well. Nothing ever felt forced, in my opinion. Everything was smooth and easy-going. It was very entertaining to follow and the story as whole was something elegant yet heart- rending all the same. For a romantic-drama, I enjoyed this film very much so. I recommend this for all audiences as it is much more than the typical romantic feel-good movie."

","I'm guilty, again, of not reading the book of which this film is based on, written by Jojo Moyes; so I can't compare or discuss irregularities or about the comparison of the adaptation, but I can say Jojo did write the screenplay so we can be rest assured it's how the source author should have wanted it on the big screen. <br/><br/>There's not much about Director Thea Sharrock apart from a couple of TV series and this being her first main feature. She does a great job, really capturing the moment and atmosphere of a very British backdrop; the picturesque Pembroke Castle in Wales being very much the central location. <br/><br/>Sam Claflin famed for playing Hunger Games' flamboyant, charismatic Finnick, plays the larger- than-life, suave business man Will Traynor, who, after a brief motorcycle accident, unfortunately becomes a quadriplegic confided to his parents mansion in the Welsh countryside. Faced with a completely different way of life we see the frustrations and the bitterness that takes hold of him. <br/><br/>In walks in Lou Clark, a colourful, cheerful and sweet local lady played by Emilia Clarke who's down on her luck and becomes unemployed, looking for her next vocation. With little else out there she reluctantly accepts employment from Will's parents, played by Janet McTeer and fellow Game Of Thrones Star, Charles Dance, as carer for Will whose sole duty is to cheer-up the depressed and angry Mister Traynor. <br/><br/>She's met with hostility in the form of blunt sarcasm and general unwantedness but slowly and surely a relationship forms between the two and it's only her perseverance and pretty positivity that managed to eventually break down Will's stubbornness and get him out the house. <br/><br/>Harry Potter's Neville Longbottom, Matthew Lewis has come a long way and does good playing Clark's current fitness freak boyfriend and Hench-Hugh Grant look-a-like Stephen Peacocke is great support as Will's manual handler and I suppose friend. <br/><br/>Craig Armstrong does a good score as he usually does, (Love Actually, World Trade Center, Far From The Madding Crowd) but it's the soundtrack that is quite outstanding with a mellow remix of X Ambassadors' 'Unsteady' and tracks from Cloves, Ed Sheeran and Jack Garrett. <br/><br/>It's a great Britrom/com with all the same ingredients, sitting next to hits like Love Actually and About Time, but it isn't the tear-jerker I was expecting. Though hearing a lot of sniffles in the audience it didn't quite hit me as hard. There's some great scenes, it's superbly structured and well paced, it's touching but not quite the emotional train-wreck I thought it was going to be even with the controversial ending, which seems to gloss over the debate. I'm not faulting the film because it's probably most likely me. <br/><br/>Now the big controversial debate as this film has caused quite a stir within certain groups and I can understand why, but it's not about 'a people', nor does it represent 'a people' but be about a relationship between two people and nothing else and I think it boldly tackles real life issues without damning or belittling anyone's life, disabled or not. Regardless of circumstance we all face life's hurdles with different approaches and attitudes, and to reflect badly on this is to assume all people never face such thoughts of suicide which, with current statistics I find very hard to believe and euthanasia would not even be a word. I'm not saying if it is right or wrong, just acknowledging the fact it does exist and is real, and is a thought that haunts many people regardless of circumstance. <br/><br/>Running Time: 9 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 9 Story: 7 Script: 7 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 9 Job Description: 5 The Extra Bonus Point: 10, Emilia Clarke is simply amazing. Beautiful and funny, she's such a joy to watch on scene, her smile and glossy eyes just gleam wonderment and excitement.. I've said too much.<br/><br/>82% 8/10"
"mfbrunson","1","10","20","14 November 2016"," Nice acting, bad content
","The actors do a wonderful job in their roles and portray their different walks of life very well. The hard thing about this movie is, the people are nice, the story line is plausible but the ending is totally unrealistic, pie in the sky, unrealistic fantasy. This movie created a huge tension at the end, one that most people would want to see end in a different way. The message this movie conveys is raunchy bad because of the ending. Those of us who have lost a loved one to suicide don't have purely happy memories of one who took their own life. Losing a loved one to suicide is like surviving a terrible car crash, there are scars and wounds that never go away. It is absolutely ridiculous to think that this lovely young lady lives her life ""at peace and happy"" after having her heart won by this charming young man who chooses to end his life. Another reason the content is raunchy is because it gives a horrible message to those facing such a dilemma with their life circumstances. It doesn't offer them an alternative or hope. Come on, get real! Such hard circumstances require answers that are outside of our self!<br/><br/>A massive clash of values is expressed by this movie. For those who do not value life and see Humanism as their religion and framework to live by, the movie expresses it extremely well. Summed up, Humanism is, after all, all about me and what I want and what I don't want; don't tell me what to do or do anything to impose your limitations on what I want to do with my life, I am, after all, the captain of my fate.<br/><br/>In real life, a lovely young lady went through a heart wrenching experience when she was seventeen and became a quadriplegic. She has been so courageous, gracious and vulnerable to share her struggles, her pain, her hope, setbacks and successes. She has written a book: Joni: The unforgettable story of a young woman's struggle against quadriplegia & depression. It also became a movie. She shares her suicidal thoughts, anger, frustration, etc.. Her accident happened in 1967. She has persevered and touched hundreds of thousands of lives for the good. Her life message touches & challenges those of us who have the use of all our limbs as well as those who have physical limitations. She has accomplished far more in her wheelchair than most of us without one. She is a positive example of how someone with quadriplegia can live, overcome, and reach out on a daily basis."

But Will's will to choose that way of the remaining 'life' was crushing both mine and Louisa's hearts. He should've found strength in himself to live. Doesn't matter if in pain or constant agony. At least he should've lived for her. All of us saw that they fell in love. I hate people who choose to be selfish, to make themselves priority number one, because they are tired. The world and life doesn't work that way. You must want to live.<br/><br/>I have been sobbing my ass off for an hour straight. I would have given an A+++, but Will's decision made it to the damn F-.

","Where to begin...? Alright, Emilia Clarkes eyebrows are atrocious... <br/><br/>As for the story. Rich boy has an accident ends up with a spinal cord injury and paralysed and fails to accept his fate and sticks to his decision to kill himself at the end because he's missing his old life. <br/><br/>My issues with this stinker of a movie. 1. There is absolutely no depth to the main characters. One dimensional, materialistic morons who are absolutely unrelatable. 2. What is the message of this movie? 3. I'd find it easy as well to smile at the end, in memory of the person I loved, if that person would have left me rich after passing away. 4. One of the points, if not THE point of this tripe seems to be ""Once you are in a wheelchair you are out."" WOW, this kind of rubbish in 2017. However as far as this movie goes, the before the injury and after the injury was not teased out, kinda essential if your main character kills himself at the end and you want your audience to either understand his decision or to root for him. 5. If the audience would have had a chance to relate to both before and after injury, it would have been a better movie. 6. If the actual struggles and challenges of living with this injury would have been portrayed in a realistic enough way, it would have been a better movie. 7. If the main actress would have been able to actually act, it would have been a better movie. 8. If the main character would have been portrayed as a human being capable of making decisions for himself and people respected and supported him, regardless if they agreed or not, it would have been a better movie. <br/><br/>This movie is so one dimensional it is not even comical. It utterly misrepresents living with a spinal injury and relations to personal assistants."

","This has got to be the worst movie I have ever watched. I don't know if I'm being overly critical due to having recently read the book, but I genuinely feel that this movie has got to be the worst book to movie adaptation.<br/><br/>I thought that nearly every scene was over dramatized. Too much emotion where it is not needed.<br/><br/>The relationships between several key characters were awkward, there was no chemistry between them. In particular the relationship between Lou and Will was terrible, I partially thought that maybe it was the actors that created the poor chemistry. Although I thought that individually their acting was brilliant and I love Emilia Clarke, but together they did just not work! In fact I was kind of embarrassed for them. Lou and Treena's relationship was also all wrong! Poor casting of Jenna Coleman as Treena.<br/><br/>I was absolutely appalled by the errors in the story line. There were too many changes that effected the way that the characters are portrayed. Key ideas and events were often squeezed into the same sentence where in the book the same ideas were spread throughout. Some events were left out entirely. Multiple events were merged into one. Things that were done or said by a certain character were then said by a different character. And, there were characters missing all together!! Will's sister Georgie?? I appreciate that it is probably difficult to fit a whole book into the time of a movie but I feel that in this case it has been poorly done. Vital information is missing that would have been critical to character development and would have helped refine the whole movie!<br/><br/>I had high hope for this movie after reading what turned out to be an absolute page turner of a book, but I have been left miserably disappointed."
"keithcmilligan","4","6","11","5 November 2016"," Not About Love
","*** Warning Spoilers Below ***<br/><br/>This is not a story about love, it's a story about selfishness. The selfishness of the lead female character who treats badly her 7 year boyfriend for someone she only just met. The selfishness of the disabled lead male character who despite having the love of his family and carers, money and means to have a life chooses not to, sacrificing the feelings of the girl he just met with a crass financial payoff at the end of the film. The selfishness of the parent who thinks this is the only way forward. The selfishness of the boyfriend who puts his fitness ahead of his relationship. If this film was attempting to show selfishness and greed, and above all that money is the most important motive to happiness then it succeeded.<br/><br/>This is not a story about emotion, it's a story full of stereotypes and short-hand signposts with predictable results. We know the lead female is ditsy because she wears a different bizarre outfit in every scene despite having no money. We have the grumpy lead male character she tries unsuccessfully to thaw the heart of. We are made to feel OK about the way the boyfriend is treated because he buys her a not so great birthday present. In fact the one scene with real emotion involved the boyfriend calling into question the whole moral of the film. What little chemistry is there between the lead characters seems only made possible through money – expensive concerts and holidays. If the disabled lead male was poor this may have been a better film, but that would have involved trying harder so was avoided. Finally, the incessant use of the lead females surname by the lead male when talking to her is annoying and an unnecessary attempt to be cutesy that doesn't work. Or it's a clever signpost that to the lead male, the lead female is ultimately still an employee of his rich family despite what the story is trying to make us believe.<br/><br/>The film is watchable and for that it's awarded a 4 rating, but know what not to expect."
"jadepietro","4","15","36","14 June 2016"," Love So Lame
","(RATING: ☆☆ out of 5)   THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: There are disabilities aplenty in this sappy screen  adaptation, mostly in its politically- correct thinking.  GRADE: C-  SYNOPSIS: A beautiful caretaker falls in love with her handsome  quadriplegic patient.   JIM'S REVIEW: There have been much talk and many catchy phrases about  the subject of love that have been set to music: ""Love will find a way.  Love hurts. Love makes the world go round. Love will keep us together.  Love the one you're with. True love never runs smooth."" These pop  ditties are never heard in the insufferable tearjerker of a movie  entitled Me Before You. Still they do form the basis for the  relationship of two mismatched beautiful people who become soulmates  amid love's many obstacles.   ￼The story goes like this: Recently unemployed Louisa (Emilia Clarke)  becomes a nursemaid and companion to handsome but clinical depressed  Will Trayor (Sam Clafin), once a rugged sportsman and successful  executive, the whole package, and now a disheartened quadriplegic. Will  has no will to live but Louisa, or Lou as she is lovingly called, is  Little Miss Sunshine personified, a kooky supposedly adorable waif and  perhaps the perfect antidote to Will's bouts of suicide. At least  Will's rich parents hope that Lou will be the cure-all to lift Will's  spirits and change his mind and mood swings. It didn't change mine.  ￼With an abysmal screenplay by Jojo Moyes and based on her best-selling  novel (which I fortunately did not read but am told the book tackles  more serious themes), the film shies away from any semblance of reality  and settles smack dab in the soapiest of waters. I guess every  generation needs its own Love Story, but is it too much to ask for some  darker moments to help us relate to Will's physical condition? One only  hears of, but never sees, Will's pain and suffering.  ￼Yet Will isn't the only one suffering here. Any moviegoer in their  right mind would want to pull the plug on this claptrap. Truthfully,  the whole ethical issue of patient's rights and euthanasia deserves a  fair better and more honest treatment. (That was done in a film called  The Sessions. View that excellent film instead, dear readers.)  ￼But this is suppose to be a love story, the equivalent to a pulpy  romance paperback novel. And on its own terms and genre, the movie  fails miserably, mostly due to insipid directorial debut by Thea  Sharrock, who searches out for the tritest of images and succeeds in  making the bad even worse, laughably outrageous ""exotic"" costumes by  Jill Taylor, and the hammiest performance by one of the leads.   ￼Try as he must, Mr. Caiflin does bring some poignancy to his poorly  written character. How he was able to keep a straight face throughout  this film and watch Ms. Clarke overdo her acting in the most ridiculous  of outfits and hair styles would be challenging enough for any actor.  The actress is not helped by her director or costumers. She is seen in  the most garish of garb, from fuzzy colorful sweaters and busy ugly  prints, in outfits any fashionable 13 year old would instantly reject.  Her hair styles range from braids and pigtails to Frau Brucher Germanic  up-dos, which telegraph more emotion than the actress can muster. We  are suppose to be enamored by Lou's quirkiness, but the overall effect  is an off-putting goofiness. Who could blame Will for ending his  life...suicide would be anyone's choice after experiencing Ms. Clarke's  cutesy performance!  If nothing else, there is fine supporting work by Charles Dance, Janet  McTeer, and Brendan Coyle, all distinguished British actors who would  be wise to omit this film from their resume. Also, Stephen Peacocke,  resembling a young Hugh Grant, literally does some heavy lifting and  delivers a nicely nuanced performance as Will's full-time doctor,  Nathan, one of the few subtlest contributions found in this film. (By  the way, in retrospect, everyone is so inexplicably darn good-looking  in this movie.)  ￼With all that is said and done here, writer H. L. Mencken's ultimate  quote of the subject of love may succinctly sum up everything that is  wrong with this silly film: ""Love is a triumph of imagination over  intelligence."" Me Before You has neither of those valued commodities."

","I watched this movie the day after I finished reading the book and was heartbroken by how shallow the movie was. Obviously no movie will be able to contain all of the detail a book can, but ""Me Before You"" was lacking most of the gravitas that emanated from the book's pages. I have no idea how anyone who watched the movie without having read the book had any idea what was happening, because it jumps from idea to idea without segues or explanations and I had to fill in most of the information from what I had read. <br/><br/>I love Emilia Clarke in Game of Thrones but goodness she was ill-fit for this role. The Lou of the book evolved from a quirky, shy, small-town girl to a young lady who surprised herself by falling in love with her employer and working up the courage to try a myriad of new things, with his encouragement and help. The Lou of the movie is trite and goofy. Since Emilia seems completely unable to express any emotion except exhilaration, I spent the majority of the movie cringing at the cheesiness of her acting (especially when crying was involved). <br/><br/>The ending, which was supposed to tug at our heartstrings and leave us emotional and sentimental, was completely ruined by Emilia's performance.<br/><br/>Nathan's character and Will's father's character, for me, stole the show; they were the only actors who really convinced me of anything.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and read the book -- skip the movie."

A 21st century aristocrat with an MBA who becomes quadriplegically paralyzed in a traffic accident. His gradual transition from self-pitying fatalist to relatively cheerful Charlie, over a period of six months, is due mostly to Louisa Clark.<br/><br/>Lou, as she's known to family and friends, is played by Emilia Clarke.

","To be honest, I went into this film expecting a wannabe version of The Notebook that would frustrate me with cheesy and cringeworthy characters and romance. And, at least for the first half hour, that's exactly what I got, however the great thing about Me Before You is that it gets a hell of a lot better with every scene, ending up as a very enjoyable, if not generic, romantic drama.<br/><br/>However, before I get into the best parts of this film, I'm going to start with the first act, roughly half an hour wrought with problems that I expected to continue on through the whole movie. First off, this film is a textbook example of a bad first impression, in the form of Louisa, played by Emilia Clarke. With the benefit of hindsight and her character arc, I can see that Clarke's performance at the beginning wasn't her own bad acting, but rather a symptom of simply poor writing and directing.<br/><br/>As the film begins, Louisa is presented as a nice but pretty clumsy and dim young woman, who lucks into a job caring for the rich Will Traynor. However, despite all the smiles and brightly-coloured outfits, her ridiculous luck in the first act meant that she just wasn't a particularly lovable character for me, leaving me continually frustrated for the best part of half an hour.<br/><br/>That, combined with all the inevitably cheesy and insanely generic chick flick tropes, meant that I had no hope going into the second act of the film. However, as the story develops, we get some great character development for both the leads, and, thanks to Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin's excellent chemistry, the film becomes very charming, pleasant and simply enjoyable.<br/><br/>I'm not going to ignore the fact that the story follows an very formulaic route from start to finish, but what I really enjoyed about the film was watching Louisa and Will's relationship develop, simply because the two lead actors worked so well together, and gave very convincing performances that, especially in the case of Emilia Clarke, got less and less cringeworthy as the film moved along.<br/><br/>Put simply, I eventually came round to really enjoy Me Before You. Despite an awful start, the film's pleasant and positive atmosphere, combined with Clarke and Claflin's fantastic chemistry, had me smiling and enjoying myself by the end. It's by no means the emotional roller-coaster of a love story it aims to be, but as a simply enjoyable and pleasant watch, Me Before You does the job pretty well."

A thousand thanks to all the participants of this film for the extreme pleasance and enjoyment you offered to me.
And I swear I'll not miss a film of Miss Magic Emilia Clarke.
God proves his presence in many strange ways!"
"Movie-Scene-by-Temo","6","3","5","5 April 2019"," The right to death with dignity?
","We all have the right to a life of dignity... but what about the right to death with dignity?<br/><br/>Financial wizard, Will Traynor is a quadriplegic (paralysis from the shoulders down) who's living at home with his parents in a castle that lies on the edge of a small English village. He's been paralyzed for 2 years and despite all his efforts at physical therapy only has movement in his thumb plus facial muscles. His parents have created a safe environment for him: a conversion of their large castle's stables into a comfortable home, a male nurse to feed, clean, bathe and change him and now a friendly, quirky companion in Lou Clarke. Unspoken is Traynor's mother's prayer: Clarke will dissuade Traynor from his self-made appointment with death in six months.<br/><br/>Director Thea Sharrock (The Hollow Crown, As You Like It) effectively handles the introduction of this heated, controversial subject in this light romance by giving us the perspective of one life... a life that could go on into the distant future with heavy medical involvement, a life that could continue to contribute to society, a life that could perhaps find satisfaction in this ""lesser"" state. The mostly new-to-feature film director, writer and young leading cast, are well-supported by a cinematographer with decades of experience, Remi Adefarasin OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) (Match Point, About a Boy, Elizabeth).<br/><br/>Sam Claflin (Snow White and the Huntsman, The Hunger Games) plays the quadriplegic Traynor, the romance male-lead, with Emilia Clarke (Game of Thrones) his companion. They both have faces that are great for screen closeups, important when bodies can't move. Clarke, famously known for playing Daenerys Targaryen, Mother of Dragons, has a face so mobile her eyebrows seem to do acrobatics far removed from her stoic face in Game of Thrones. She also has a lot more to say in a candid, quirky manner, which soon brings out the mischievous side of Traynor, always up for a dare and adventure. The movie is carried by the two and they do a good job interacting.<br/><br/>Me Before You could have been set anywhere in the world, but the castle-village setting suits-if you have a Lord of the Manor character, why not give him one, with the young, naïve love interest played by a village girl. Also to emphasize the wealthy lifestyle is the private jet they use to go on holiday-very fairytale, Mills & Boon romance, a formula that has worked for decades.<br/><br/>Dialogue does flow and is well matched to the accompanying actions, not surprising as author Jojo Moyes also wrote the screenplay. The challenge of showing the life extreme-sports-devotee Traynor had before becoming a quadriplegic is easily and effectively solved when Clarke finds a short video (set to James Bond music) of Traynor doing many athletic feats-diving off cliffs into the sea, water skiing, bungy/sky jumping-narrated by a group of his admiring friends. Traynor definitely craved and loved physical adventure and his body was very toned and fit. Cut to his life now, immobile, needing assistance even to lift his head off his pillow or sitting, staring fixedly out of the window at the flat, colourless countryside, the only thing still agile being his mind and slowly recovering sense of humour.<br/><br/>The right to a dignified life for all is cemented in most constitutions across the globe. To choose when to die is something only provided for in some places, and only for those who have reached the hospice state of care when the doctor certifies that the patient only has a short period of time left to live, that death is inevitable from illness, disease, or injury, and that there are no medical interventions that can change this. At such a time the patient can choose death assisted by medical staff. But what if one is stuck in between: a diminished physical life that cannot improve but continues with high medical care and cost and still an acute mental ability. If such a person decides against living, are there ethical, social, moral, religious, spiritual, personal rights to be observed? Protected? Should that person too be allowed to choose death, or is it ""murder"" as one of the support actors states.<br/><br/>This is one of several books, movies and documentaries I've seen recently on the right to choose death, something many with the means have been doing for a time now. Well worth a watch, the viewer can take from it what they choose: the light-hearted fare of a chick-flick or the deeper philosophical discussion."
"neonx-76243","10","3","5","11 October 2016"," What a nice film
","I watched this film and really enjoyed it, which is strange for me and it being a ""chick flick"", and it wasn't until the end that I realised she was Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones because she is so different in the roles.<br/><br/>Great script with lots of both funny moments with the humour and serious moments with the story behind it. It was well put together, brilliantly cast and beautifully filmed in all the various lovely settings.<br/><br/>I might not be Oscar material but nonetheless it totally captivated me and entertained me which is why I watch a film in the first place."
"palavitsinis","9","3","5","14 July 2016"," Real and fairy tale at the same time
","This was one of these movies that you find yourself trying to constantly remember that this is just a movie and that this is not happening in real life. Although this story is revolving around the serious injury of a person, it's really ""light"" in the beginning and it actually gets more than some laughs out of you. <br/><br/>And I think that when everything climaxes towards the end, this is the reason why you feel even sadder. Clarke was awesome as was her co-protagonist. All the cast was brilliant if you ask me. The questions set forth by the movie and the morals that are ""promoted"" are irrelevant if you ask me. OK, it's always about living your life etc in movies like that. Doing things while you still can, not wasting time etc. <br/><br/>But the thing that stuck with me in the end, is the feeling of this otherwise energetic young man, when he wakes every single day, having dreamed his life as it was before, just to realize that he's still in his bed, not able to walk, or take care of himself. I think that for me, that was the punch in the stomach. And with all this going on, to fall in love with a girl that embodies life itself, in such a unique way. His attitude and how he held together till the end, was the most touching part of the movie for me. <br/><br/>The movie was brilliant. If you do decide to watch it, make sure that you're not in a really bad mood cause if you are, I can promise that it will really get you."
"subxerogravity","8","3","5","19 June 2016"," I was a very very beautiful love story
","It's a very beautiful love story about the connections that people make over their lives. It's actually funny how the movie's premise is about how short life can be and that it should be lived to the fullest, yet it tells a story about how certain people can have an effect on you that can stay with you forever.<br/><br/>And what I love especially about this movie is that it's not a traditional formulated love story that usually is spoon fed to the mainstream. <br/><br/>I'll take a guess that a lot of that has to do with the star power of Emily Clarke in the lead role. I heard some people did not like the idea of her doing the role. I can see that. After all, she plays a strong female character on Game of Thrones. The movie gives more of a stereotype of what a strong female character is, especially for a Romance film, but Clarke is so good in it. She's just so cute and it's wonderful to see the energy she brings to the role on screen. Plus she had good chemistry with the guy from the Hunger Games films, so you can't beat that. <br/><br/>I tell people I'm not a fan of Romantic films, but I did like what was going on here. It's not going to bring you to tears but it does touch you with it's message on life."
"moten200","8","3","5","15 June 2016"," Loved the book and the movie too!!!
","I had braced myself to expect the movie not to live up to the book. I was pleasantly surprised! The casting of the main characters was the best I have experienced in a film in many, many years. The screenplay is a seamless adaptation of the novel, keeping the focus on Lou and Will. The minor characters get enough exposure in the film to tell the story so that it all makes sense. Lou's quirky style of dress and personality was superb. While the performance may not receive a major acting award, it is nonetheless engaging and moving.The interplay between Will and Lou is balanced and nuanced. The ending will haunt me for sometime to come."
"agostino-dallas","8","3","5","12 June 2016"," Looking at the bright side
","I liked this movie - I gave ""8"" to it in the rating section but much more because the last movies available, my God, what a bad vintage of movies! Someone ought warn Hollywood that the Earth has been invaded and destroyed by aliens from space non-stop since maybe the 50's!!! Moreover, it also seems that ""The Exorcist"" has been reincarnating in other 100 movies too, last one ""The Conjuring""...please!!! Come on!! Anyway, back to ""Me Before You"", I usually take these movies with a grain of salt - maybe two grains. First of all, the cliché of a millionaire good-looking guy whose life changes after an accident. It is romantic, it is OK, but it is cliché. Secondly, the movie is too predictable. I watched it today. And today, June 12, 2016, it is Valentine's Day in Brazil -- I am Brazilian, I live in the USA though. My wife read the book and of course the book was much better. The movie is ""by the book"" indeed, but not literally, got it? It is a romantic by the book type - happiness-drama-joy-drama-happiness-drama-lovely message in the end. Enjoy but don't expect too much."
"eth_p","1","9","23","24 July 2016"," Most Awful Drama So Far
","The first thing I had in mind after watched this movie is that money can buy love. I'm not sure this one is made by Hollywood or not. Cos if it's made by Hollywood then I need questioning them how they can make this creepy movie like this. The story line was just so standard, it just remind me of soap opera from South America. the actors and actress just have bad performance the dialogue was so standard, no words that show the feeling of loss, hope or joy the only thing that good was just the soundtrack. It so wasting my time, I really don't understand how so many say that's a great movie. If I would have known it would end the way it did I would never of watched it."
"aegairsoft1","5","4","8","5 September 2017"," A Dishonest Movie
","Right away I felt something was off about this film. It had the actors, the acting, and the idea, and I couldn't quite describe why I felt this way. I was never sure where the film was leading me and couldn't understand the characters or their motivations. Overall it felt very confusing, that is until the climax finally came. After reflection I describe this film as entirely dishonest with its audience. This dishonesty kills the potential for that unrestrained cathartic ending we all were waiting for. Although, it did spur up quite the conversations and reflections after its viewing, it was not the types the conversations the writers clearly tried to push."
"zivsoondie","3","4","8","6 April 2017"," unrealistic cotton candy
","For people who read the book, please ignore the movie. I definitely should have, but I was too curious. To the rest of you, ignore it as well. Read the book. <br/><br/>First of all, this is a beautiful film. Beautiful people, beautiful scenery, Beautiful beautiful beautiful! There's just one problem, Will's life isn't so effing beautiful. Neither is Lou's. Where Jojo Moyes uses humor to lighten up the dark of Will's accident, the movie tries to gloss over everything! It made me sick. Lou is so cute, but annoyingly so. And I understand that Will is supposed to be handsome, but the character-developing is flat compared to the book, and the whole point of their acquaintance is lost! <br/><br/>A major point in the book is excluded completely! It's one of the things that makes sense to Lou's character. Jojo Moyes books are quite realistic, in a sense, because of her character's flaws. It makes you relate. Unfortunately, this does not come across in the movie, and there goes the humor, as well. I had to force myself to finish this one, as it felt like the movie was strangling me with cotton candy."

"MihaiSorinToma","10","2","3","26 January 2019"," Emotional Masterpiece
","After losing her job at a local restaurant, Lou desperately seeks a job in order to support her family. Thus, she accepts to take care of a fully crippled young man who seems to have lost hope in life. Much sooner than expected, her job will be taken to the next level as she gets emotionally involved, but will it actually be enough to make a difference?<br/><br/>It's a movie which left a big impression on me and I have to say this from the beginning. Its plot managed through its apparent simplicity to generate so much emotion that I was left breathless many times. It's so dramatic and romantic that it can fill you with you joy but also make your eyes water. It has such unique and charismatic characters that you simply cannot avoid caring for them. Everything they do and feel gets sent straight to you as you were part of the action, thus the emotion it generates is simply breathtaking. It manages to alternate drama, laughter and romance in such a way that I honestly haven't seen since ""The Fault in Our Stars"", another similar movie which I adore. You might find it a bit predictable from time to time, except its finale which is everything but predictable, but I can easily forgive this small flaw after seeing it as a whole.<br/><br/>The actors it has are simply marvelous. They are able to impersonate their characters in such a way that they make you believe it's reality. Their charisma plays a very important role here, making themselves likeable and also making everything credible and as a result, more emotional and dramatic. The dialog is another plus as its complexity helps a lot, especially when facing a more difficult situation which simply implies it. Their British accent is also worth mentioning as it brings some sort of flair to this film.<br/><br/>I cannot emphasize enough how much I like this movie. Its plot, its characters, its actors and especially its atmosphere are so good, but the way it makes you feel is simply one of a kind. It starts slowly but it builds up pace and ends up in style. You can see by far that these people truly know how to make a movie of this genre and the final result is simply great. It's simply a wonderful achievement!"
"imdb-58910","10","2","3","25 January 2019"," Awesome romantic film
","I don´t like romantic films but this one inspired me. The film feature Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, who also starred in Games of Thrones. The film was an adaptation of a book written by Jojo Moyes with the exact same name, but i learned about the book after watching the movie.<br/><br/>It´s a story about love of a two different people from English countryside. Louisa Clark ( Emilia Clarke) works in a local bistro and dated with Patrick, whom she probably doesn´t love. After losing her job at a local cafe, she got a job in the household of Traynors. She was supposed to be a companion and a caretaker of Will Traynor. Will Traynor (Sam Claflin) is a successful, young man who loved his life, but it quickly changed after a heavy traffic accident. He becomes paralyzed. Will´s mother was desperate, because will got depressed, and she couldn´t do anything on her own, so she tried to find caretakers who would help him and persuade him that life is worth living. After a few months full of crazy activities, they became good friends until love arose.<br/><br/>Lou is funny, optimistic, kind and she wears crazy clothes. On the other side, Will´s character changed during the film. At the beginning of this story Will was depressed, cynical, but over time his character grow and he became really funny and sweet yet still calm and mysterious.<br/><br/>They were like sun and moon, different, but they were meant to be together. In my opinion, this film is very romantic, funny and dramatic. I really liked it and I recommend it to watch."

","Such an amazing love story. Absolutely broke my heart, yet warmed it at the same time.
I heard about this movie years ago, but never got to watch it until now. So glad I did.
Sam Claflin is unbelievably talented. I have seen all of the movies he's been in, and I have to say that his performance in this one i just out of this world.
Emilia Clarke has great facil expressions. I could feel every single emotion her character was feeling just by looking at her face. Wow.
Great movie to watch when you just want to cry your eyes out."
"mshackletonchavez","7","2","3","1 December 2018"," A Wonderful Movie.
","A truly loving and endearing feature, with a talented cast in good use and very well meaning intentions.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film, greatly, most upon which lay in the interesting premise and wonderful performances. One immediately points to Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, for their chemistry truly drives this film, and scenes where they are separated have great weight as one can genuinely feel the disconnect and worriment felt by the characters, which is a great achievement on the part of the actors, screenplay and director.<br/><br/>The films screenplay is worthy of praise, however is also the root of some of the films flaws. The motion picture is an adaptation a novel, both were written by the same individual (Jojo Moyes). The screenplay builds upon the characters highly successfully in the first two acts of the picture, and delivers the dilemma with clarity and respect.<br/><br/>However the third act, I thought to be weaker, for I believe for Will's motives to not have been explored as deeply as could have been, for it was told and not necessarily shown, and what was shown didn't hit the emotive mark as well as it could have. Therefore when he chooses his final choice, and Lou's subsequent decision: it feels a little premature, a bit too out of the blue, the twist isn't as convincing as could have been. Thus this weakens the third act, although by the final scenes between the two is of great emotional impact, and rectifies many of the problems by the narratives end.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was of particular importance to how the story unfolded, I felt that some were stronger than others. I felt that Charles Dance and Vanessa Kirby were the most impactful upon the story and delivered as such in their performances. However I felt that Will's mother, played by Janet McTeer could have been stronger and had a greater part to play in the narrative, although the performances from the actress and the aforementioned actors were all splendid.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I believe for the doctor called Nathan to be a very telling character to the film, in that he spoke and delivered what he had to say and then left, as a expositionary source. That his impact was minimal and could of had a much more emotive arc and relationship with Will and Lou.<br/><br/>However, I must not forget the wonderful use of colour in this film; with particular praise for the costume design and cinematography. The costume designers for this film did a splendid piece of work, in endressing Emilia Clarke in all the happy, striped and multicoloured costumes, without ever coming across as silly, but as loving, friendly and caring. The cinematography further highlighted this interesting colour palette, and helped to compliment it, without the film descending into looking like madness or a fairy world. Apart from that, the angles are clear and fairly standard, but yet deliver upon the dramatic function to a fair and adequate quality, overall the cinematography aids and enhances from the film and doesn't detract from it, as it could have very easily fallen into more silly territory.<br/><br/>In the end, I did very much enjoy this film. I particularly liked the performances and the very loving and jolly atmosphere sustained thought the feature, which brings a fun and entertaining film. Though the screenplay at times hindered certain aspects of the film and some characters, it played to great strengths in other areas. Thus I give the film a healthy 7/10. I would recommend this film, particularly to people looking for something romantic or for quiet evenings and slow days."

"neil-476","8","2","3","30 May 2018"," A difficult subject handled well
","Who would have thought there were so many laughs in a tale of someone paralysed from the neck down? Emilia (Game Of Thrones) Clarke encounters Sam (Hunger Games) Claflin while involved with Matthew (Harry Potter) Lewis in a film which has nothing to do with any of those fantasy franchises!<br/><br/>Lou is a tea shop waitress in a small rural English town. On losing her job she applies to become a carer for Will Traynor, paralysed in an accident. She doesn't realise what a moody unpleasant person he is, nor does she realise he is determined to commit assisted suicide at Dignitas in Switzerland. But as feelings start to grow between them, despite their intentions, could it be that Will might change his mind?<br/><br/>To be frank, this isn't my sort of film, a feeling which was reinforced within the first 10 minutes as Lou turned out to be unbearably cute, endlessly compassionate towards the quirky old lady patrons of the cafe, possessed of an apparently massive wardrobe of unbelievably eccentric clothing and, to cap it all, convinced that all problems could be solved with a Nice Cup Of Tea. She was a character drawn from the Wacky And Loveable Young Thing box of clichés.<br/><br/>And Sam Claflin's immobile moody young man was more credible, but no different in essence: Mr Rochester on wheels.<br/><br/>But the two of them turned out to have decent chemistry, and the film turned out to have far more laughs than I expected, so I stuck with it. And I'm glad I did. It used humour to soften the edges of what, in many ways, was a very brutal story. Despite the late Christopher Reeve's sterling efforts in support of stem cell research, there is still currently no coming back from catastrophic spinal cord injuries, something which Lou does not initially realise, and something which lies at the heart of the once athletic Will's decision.<br/><br/>Whether the burgeoning love between Will and Lou will be sufficient to overrule his decision is the dramatic focus of the story, and I would not want to spoiler the ending. But I will say that the circumstances and issues of quadriplegia and assisted suicide are presented unflinchingly, and without any moral judgement in either direction.<br/><br/>This is an easier, more accessible film than Whose Life Is It Anyway?, the only other film I'm aware of which addresses this issue, but it doesn't draw conclusions any more easily than that film did.<br/><br/>After being a bit queasily saccharine to start off with, Emilia Clarke settles in to the role, and both she and Claflin provide an effective emotional heart to the film: Janet McTeer and Charles Dance as Will's parents are also touching. The main location (Pembroke Castle) is gorgeous, and Clarke's wardrobe is (deliberately) awful. There was only one wrong note: I felt mild annoyance at the Traynor family's wealth. The ability to load Will onto a private jet and fly off to the Caribbean added a glib tone which I would have preferred to have been absent. The very end of the film fell into this category, too.<br/><br/>Overall, though, this addressed a difficult subject in an entertaining and credible way."

","""Me before you"" is a 2016 romantic drama movie adapted from the bestselling novel by Jo Jo Moyes . It is set in the UK and shot in various historic locations such as Pembroke Castle in Wales, and Chenies Manor House in Buckinghamshire, England. <br/><br/>This movie is filled with amazing actors who truly make the film . Both Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin gave a legendary performance in this film and it was absolutely wonderful . I find that the casting for this movie is truly perfect, and the actors do not disappoint.
Me Before You tells the story of Lou , a resourceful, cheerful girl who has been wasting her potential in her small hometown because she feels responsible for taking care of her mother (Josie), her father (Bernard), and her sister, Treena.

Will is so moody and bossy . He seems bitter. With time, however, he slowly warms up to Lou, and their relationship grows closer and closer. That is, until Lou learns the truth about why she was hired: after a previous suicide attempt, Will made his mother promise to take him to an assisted suicide facility in six months to end his life. Lou's job has actually been to make sure he doesn't hurt himself before then. Our protagonist refuses to treat him like a kid , and soon his happiness means more to her than she expected so she decided to take him in a serie of discoveries . On the final night of the vacation, Lou declares her love for him, saying that she knows about his plan but wants him to be with her. Although he loves her, too, Will says that he's going through with it. Furious, Lou ignores Will when they return home.
Eventually, Lou relents and decides to share Will's final moments with him the assisted suicide facility. Before his death, Will writes Lou a letter that specifically requests that it only be opened while Lou is in a Paris café. So she goes. The letter says that Will has left Lou a small amount of money so she can go back to school and follow her dreams. It also expresses Will's sadness at causing her pain . Lou begins a new chapter in her life.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great movie with a mix of a ton of laughs and a love story all rolled into one.If you're looking for a good love and sacrifice story , this is undoubtedly the movie for you."

Now I'm not sure if the director of this is British or American but wherever he's from he did a great job with this movie and I applaud him for it I hope to see more movies like this in the future I really think Emilia Clarke should get herself out there more because I'm not sure that she has done that much but I think she's an amazing actress even though I've only seen her in 2 movies.

","When a critic can't find words to describe a movie, that's says a lot. Im not considering myself even amateur critic, so I'm even more speechless.<br/><br/>Jojo Moyes, brilliant script. Every aspect of the movie is create with perfection. There is 1 error tho- the shoes of Emilia Clarke were way too loud in order to hear all the conversation between the parents without getting detected by them.<br/><br/>Emilia Clarke, good as always. That eyebrows man, that eyebrows, perfect face muscle control. She can act every emotion perfectly!<br/><br/>Sam Claflin, he could be better, he need to develop his talent further.<br/><br/>As for support role i give my gold medal to Stephen Peacocke. His acting was without a doubt the best from the support crew.<br/><br/>Janet McTeer, she get my silver medal. Especially on the scene from the airport, when they returned from the vacation, brilliant act hands down."
"rogerdarlington","Null","2","3","11 February 2017"," Deserves to be seen
","I have not read the best-selling romantic novel ""Me Before You"" by English author Jojo Moyes but I have to assume that the film adaptation of the same name is faithful to the original story since the script was written by the author herself. Some might regard it as a female movie since, as well as a woman scriptwriter, we have Thea Sharrock in her debut role as a film director. Certainly there are elements of ""Bridget's Jones' Diary"" and ""Love Actually"", but ""Me Before You"" has a harder edge and a tearful ending.<br/><br/>It is a very British story in that in it is shot in some quintessentially British locations (most notably Pembroke Castle in Wales) and it involves class - Lou Clark (played by ""Games Of Thrones"" star Emilia Clark) is a young woman from a distinctly working class home with limited knowledge and experience, while Will Traynor (Sam Claflin) is from an upper middle class background and has had a stellar business career. But unusually it is a story about disability, since Will is a quadriplegic following a traffic accident and Lou is his carer. She is reluctant to take on a role for which she has no relevant experience and he is even more reluctant to have someone hired essentially to bath him in her huge smile.<br/><br/>The film has been criticised by disability campaign groups for what is claimed to be an unfair and unhelpful position on disability, but really Moyes is not presenting a moral stance on severe disability in general, but one possible outcome in one particular fictional story. The stars are very engaging (especially Clarke in Manic Pixie Dream Girl mode) and there is humour as well as sadness in a work that I feel deserves to be seen."
"Rawal_Afzal","7","2","3","24 January 2017"," The ending spoils a sweet, cheerful and funny film!
","I remember a few years ago having a discussion with a friend on the Bollywood film 'Guzaarish' (2010) - a film that holds 95% similarities to it. His opinion was that a film (or a film-maker to be precise) is under no moral obligation to show the right ""thing"", the right ending or showing something that matches the common standards of ""rightness"", and that a film is just a recording of a story - right or wrong doesn't even come into the picture.<br/><br/>Although he did make a very solid and thought-provoking point, the point remained in my view that this too depends on the gravity of the topic and how sensitive it is; and making a film about physically challenged people is a sensitive theme, just like rape is. I asked him whether he'll stick to his otherwise very intellectual point if someone were to make a film about a habitual rapists who and end the film on the note that he goes on to lead a very wonderful life full of happiness. He got stuck there, and this remained my standard to judge films: in short, the topic, its gravity and sensitivity is all that it depends on.<br/><br/>So that remains a problem with this film and I can fully understanding the reactions that it's getting from physically challenged people and such organisations. I'd still give it seven stars because it was otherwise a very, sweet, cheerful and funny film (I understand one isn't supposed to behave that rudely with anyone, but Will's witty replies were really hilarious!), and highly engaging too with its theme revolving around freedom and being yourself, being true to yourself. Despite a bad ending, the last scene with Louisa walking away with those striped socks was really heartening, and, again, despite that, I couldn't help praising the film because it was incredibly sweet.<br/><br/>I remember I blasted 'Guzaarish' back then, but the reason for that wasn't only the topic but also the fact that the film was dull and boring beyond words! So there's a difference between the two.<br/><br/>As a footnote, I thought Louisa's ex-boyfriend got a harsh treatment. He wasn't at fault too much and was neither a bad guy. Showing him as a the ""Other type of guy"" could've actually pressed more on the ""freedom"" angle, but alright. They didn't show something that isn't possible: falling in love with another guy/girl than your boyfriend/girlfriend. It happens, whether that is alright or not or whether it qualifies as cheating is a debate for another day and place.<br/><br/>*Most of what I've written in criticism of the film applies to the book too of course that it is based on.*"
"debbiesymanovich-50987","10","2","3","29 November 2016"," One of my favorite movies
","I loved this movie — so much so, that I've watched it five times so far!<br/><br/>I am usually very critical of movies, but not this one. It is a bit formulaic at times, but I think the director also shows a great deal of restraint. For example, Will Traynor's mother and father (Janet McTeer and Charles Dance) start out as caricatures of British aristocrats — stuffy, aloof, unfeeling, even a bit mean. But as the movie progresses, you see them more and more as human beings with deep feelings, and you see that they love each other and their son very much, and that they struggle to do the right thing by their son. They are also very kind to Louisa, and despite the class difference, they never betray the kind of snobbery you might expect to see in a less sophisticated treatment. <br/><br/>There seems to be some criticism of Louisa Clarke (Emilia Clarke) as a Bridget Jones-type character — kind of silly, offbeat, ""chatty,"" and so on. I find her utterly charming. (But then I also find Bridget Jones utterly charming.) Louisa is a believable character and not one dimensional.<br/><br/>I love the chemistry between Lou and Will Traynor (Sam Claflin). Will's transformation is not sudden. He actually is intrigued by Louisa from the get-go but doesn't realize it — he's too busy putting on his act and being sullen and angry and self-absorbed — so it's only when she snaps at him, that he begins to be pulled outside of his emotional bubble. It's actually shocking for him to see this other side of Lou — that she's not rigidly upbeat but is capable of anger — and so this moment triggers the start of a deeper connection. <br/><br/>I think all the characters are well done, and the only character I found a bit cartoonish is the boyfriend, Patrick (Matthew Lewis). <br/><br/>It's a beautiful movie, and I highly recommend it. Bring lots of tissues, and ignore the naysayers."

"jaylacastro","10","2","3","27 October 2016"," Me Before you says the truth about life events
","Me Before You says the truth about life events Romantic love movies tend to end with ""happily ever after's"", but this movie was far from that saying. Me Before you is a well written tragic-love movie from its characters to the director Thea Sharrock. Sam Claflin plays the role of William Traynor a rich 35 year-old, who is paralyzed after an accident years before. William decides after another six months he will commit suicide by Dignities. His newly preppy caregiver Louisa Clarke played by Emilia Clarke, tries to understand wills wishes to die, but instead takes him on a journey to understand life's worth living for. Over the period of their six-month journey Louisa and William fall in love. The movie ends with the tragedy of William deciding to die and leaving Louisa sad and alone. Sharrock decided to give the audience the real truth about life. We would want to hope for the best and think that there are such things as happily ever after's; but truthfully that isn't the case. Typically, in a romantic movie we are left to believe love can conquer all, but truly it's all false hope. Many critics would say this movie is terrible from its, false hope, and the sad ending. I beg to differ saying this movie is brilliant. In some point in life we must realize happily ever afters aren't real. Thea Sharrock presented a great film deserving 5 out of 5 stars for the idea of a romantic movie with the truth of reality."

And I told him of the adventures they had, the places they had gone, and the things I had seen that I had never expected to. I conjured for him electric skies and iridescent seas and evenings full of laughter and silly jokes.

","This was my first time ever to have seen Emila Clarke in a film. I still have to see Game of Thrones because she is such a brilliant actress! Also it was good to have seen Janet McTeer (Watched the Songcatcher recently), Matthew Lewis (Harry Potter) and Jenna Coleman (Doctor Who). You wouldn't suspect such a underrated cast like them would be appearing in this but, it was a great to know it actually happened! <br/><br/>Anyways onto the movie, it was very good and no, I didn't cry as I thought I would.I liked Clarke's and Sam Claflin's chemistry throughout the movie. Although, I would've rather if they made Clarke's character more sympathetic when Claflins character announced he wants to die legally to Switzerland as he doesn't want to spend the rest of his life being sick, and handicapped. I felt they gave Clarke's character too over the top, she should've been acting more caller. It's not Emila Clarke's fault but the way the character was developed, was a little bit ridiculous to be honest...<br/><br/>That's just only my criticism to this movie but other than that, it is really flattering to watch and even though it's sad, it gives you that feeling of hoping for the best with your own loved ones! Thats how I've seen it but other people may have a different opinion when they do get a chance to look at it! <br/><br/>I give this movie a 8/10 because of its good actors, story line, the settings and of course, giving you a great amount of emotions!"
"ozgenorman","10","2","3","3 July 2016"," Great movie but romance isn't well portrayed
","I didn't read the book before watching the film. I was glad that I didn't read it beforehand but now I'm eager to read the original novel, too. While watching the movie, I was thrilled and fascinated at the same time. Emilia Clarke as Lou Clark, makes the movie wonderful with her outstanding acting. All the eyebrow mimics she uses aren't too much but fit perfectly with her character. I am of the opinion that her role in this movie is precious and far better than her role in GOT. The clothes are carefully picked for Lou and her lovely, cheerful style. The landscape of the Wales, Switzerland, France is well pictured. Apart from the excellent visuals, I enjoyed the flow of the movie. Some people don't get the fact that in a movie not everybody has to act really well whether it is a side character or a man walking in the street. Acting, overall, was okay. One thing I didn't like about the movie is it was supposed to be a romantic comedy. Although there are some scenes that got to me, the all-too-sudden love isn't really convincing. The romance is fairly weak and sometimes awkward. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, this movie made me smile and cry, it is very well entertaining yet emotional. However, the ending was a bit obscure. There is a second book called ""Me After You"" so I'll be waiting for the second movie."
"giuliacypriano","10","2","3","10 June 2016"," Film doesn't do justice to the book
","I decided to read Me Before You as soon as I watched the first trailer of the film pop up on my news feed. I was excited. Boy, never had I been so eager to finish this book. It was simply marvelous. However, I can't say that the film made me feel the same way. Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin did a great job, don't get me wrong! They fit the characters perfectly and shared wonderful chemistry. Unfortunately, I thought they sugar coated some scenes way too much with light jokes and puns and in my opinion they took away so much of the tense drama build-up the book provided. It was more like a sweet romantic comedy with a twist of drama in the end rather than a straight-up romance, like the book. Please excuse the overload of metaphors that are to follow but they're important as I make my point. They invested so much in keeping it light-hearted and sweet, while keeping the worst part to the end. But the book doesn't work that way. The story is hauntingly real. It's a masterpiece but the film is far from a replica. It made me wonder how Harry Potter fans felt watching the movie distort the books and now I know how it's quite gut wrenching. I shed tears of course during the movie but the book broke my heart. It's devastating. It's an emotion that drowns you and makes you believe there's no way to safety. It takes you momentarily to sweet cotton candy like clouds. Just to break out in lightning and thunder and rain on your heart all over again. It's bittersweet. Yet life changing. The book gave me a certain purpose if you will... It made me FEEL. It brought out a type of sadness I had never even known to exist. To feel completely lost and miserable and confused and flabbergasted and simply torn apart. It ruined me in a good way I suppose. And I can't believe someone (author Jojo Moyes) could have that much power over thousands of women who read the book. The book is and forever will be the winner, any time of the day. Do yourself a favor, read the book beforehand. You won't regret it."
"day_of_redemption","3","10","28","13 June 2016"," Cringeworthy Movie Adaptation
","I saw this film without any premise of what the book was about. However, I did watch it with someone who had read the book and was able to compare and contrast the two mediums. Though the scenic locations and setting for the movie is iconic, this movie was so unbearable to watch based on the relationships alone.<br/><br/>Firstly, the whole movie pays so little attention to exactly how bad Lou's boyfriend is, that any sane person would take his side. Therefore, the entire film is about cheating, half-truths and seduction rather than romance. Lou's shallow character archetype of the ""quirky"" girl in bright tights serves only to reinforce the idea that she is naive and selfish. After being in a relationship for 6 years with her bf, - who at this point trusts Lou's support in his fitness dreams - Lou suddenly drops it all for a hidden love affair with a ""broken"" heart throb. The birthday scene alone was so unbelievable that she would pay so much attention to this mysterious man rather than her boyfriend across the table that it left me wandering how come no one warned her about what she was doing. Oh yes, her sister talked to her about it...but suggested arranging lap dances for her patient instead?! Doesn't her sister know she is already attached to her boyfriend Patrick? What lousy advice there!<br/><br/>No more than 20 minutes into the movie, every romantic scene turned into a scene of betrayal and hidden intentions. The book may have gone into more detail regarding exactly how much of a douche Lou's boyfriend Patrick really was, but this movie glazed over it so superficially that I ended up feeling sorry for the poor guy. He did not even lose his temper or have a big dramatic scene. His character was just swept under the rug for the conclusion of the movie to happen.<br/><br/>Horrible movie, unless you are a romantic sap who condones betraying those who care about you, or you are easily impressed with Emilia Clarke's go-to scrunched up 'sad' face and dancing eyebrows."

Will has next to no movement or feeling from roughly the chest down after an accident that affected his spinal column and is rude, cynical and dismissive. Slowly Clark's slightly crazy nature and view on life melts Will's cynical heart and after a trip they are well and truly in love. I will stop my description of the plot here for fear of spoiling how it all ends, but I understand why it went the way it did and I wish I didn't and it didn't. It touches on something I have personal experience with and I believe that is why it affected me as it did. Even so I figure people can puzzle out what happens (it's not THAT surprising) by me saying that, but at least I'm not saying anything outright. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie, both Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin play their parts both convincingly and beautifully and the story feels very much believable.

According to the story development of most romantic films, I thought that the following would be the ending of the perfect combination of love, warmth and influence of the heroine, and positive smile on the life of the hero. What I didn't expect is that the scriptwriter's setting of the ending actually separated the two people who love each other forever, and the hero finally chose to die in the way of euthanasia to leave the world. The heroine saw her beloved left, although the heart pain but also calmly accepted the fact. Because she knew in her heart will was not happy in this world, and though she was never loved, at least the one she loved was free. It's hard not to feel a little sad about the ending, but come to think of it, it's probably the best arrangement for both the leading man and the leading lady."

","How do you move on after losing the person you loved? The person that unconditionally started to mean everything to you? How do you build a life worth living?
Well, JOJO MOYES, the author, beautifully writes the answer.
ME BEFORE YOU is one of my favourite movie. The number of times I saw this movie, I had tears in my eyes. Literally, it's a must watch. Let's move on to the review.<br/><br/>LOU CLARK; the bumblebee leggings lover girl, knows many things. The footsteps between the bus stop to her home, the feeling of love, and all the sweet feelings she has. But what she doesn't know is that she might not love her boyfriend who is just self-concerned, and she lost her job and don't know what is coming to her in the near future. Where her life is taking her.
She is a determined, strong and caring girl with big dreams. When she lost her job, she saw an advertisement for nursing a patient who is paralyzed. LOU took this chance and made a funky entry in WILL's life. <3
What if the person in front of you was the person full of life, full of colours, full of joys? But the accident makes him a colourless, selfless person who is dependent on his Parents, and nurse. That is not the life he wanted. He did not want the life without his legs, he walks with. He LOVED his life. WILL Loved his life.<br/><br/>Will suffers a traffic accident that leaves him paralyzed in a wheelchair. Will has given up on ever living a fulfilling life again and wants his parents, Camilla and Steven Traynor, to allow him to go through with assisted suicide.<br/><br/>WILL is the character without hope, the accident made him so. His girlfriend left him and married his friend. But After LOU, life was not the same. not as before but better.<br/><br/>LOU, this character made me feel that one person can change your life and has the ability to make you realise that life is a gift. You have to celebrate each and every moment of life.
Life is not given to you to live like a normal person. I guess it demands some craziness, love, celebration, taking care, adventures & Thrill. To compete with your problem is it really courageous and brave and it is the real LIFE is all about.<br/><br/>I am going to add the last part of the letter, WILL wrote to LOU. And seriously, this letter has my heart and these words have given me hope and courage.<br/><br/>""You're going to feel uncomfortable in your new world for a bit. But I hope you feel a bit exhilarated too. Live boldly. Push yourself. Don't settle. Just live well. Just live. Love, Will.""<br/><br/>

","Although I 've read the novel before, I sneered at the bestseller-like setting in the middle of the movie. At the end of the movie, Will 's letter still made people cry.
As I said before, who can actually fall in love depends entirely on the point in time when God chooses to put you in the same cage with whom. If Will has never been trapped by accident, then he will never have the leisure to understand and love. Louise
At this time, fate is involved irrevocably, fate is a dangerous move, and those who are entangled will always meet.
So one of the great luck in life is just that the person he likes is unmarried and healthy, regardless of his age and when will he meet him?
I hope I can love you, I also hope that when I love you, I am still you, you are still you, I hope the word love is not a reason to bind each other, I hope you are more free than me
You do n't have to be miserable. You want to live better with my share. I just hope you can meet and be yourself, just like I 've been trying to become me before I met you.

Emilia Clarke does an amazing job playing Louisa Clark, almost as though she was made for it. But the biggest respect goes out to Sam Claflin, who seemed to effortlessly portrait the role of Will Traynor. Moving your arms around, or poses in general are quite a big thing when it comes to acting, but he could only move his head and still had to make sure that it was clear what he meant, using only his face. He deserves a lot more credit for that than he is getting. With this golden duo the movie can't be anything other than great. The only thing I would change is the ending. Compared to the rest of the movie it seems a bit rushed. Personally I think that even people who don't like romantic movies could really enjoy this one."

","Melodrama. A film adaptation of the novel of the same name by the famous English writer Giorgio Moyes, known for her love affairs, she also made the script here, which pleases. I am sure that there are differences from the book, but I will have no desire to familiarize myself with the original source, therefore I will consider the picture as an independent work. So, Emilia, for the sake of you, I decided to watch - and it was definitely worth it. And here is my brief opinion - touching love in difficult conditions. I want to note that I did not find any minuses in the picture, although I watched it very carefully, trying to notice every detail, therefore I intend to dwell on the advantages of this film adaptation and at one serious point that it raises.
So here they are:
1. Outfits of Emilia - this was told to me by a person who advised me on this picture (well, because of Emilia), so I was ready for anything - but the picture could surprise me. I thought that a red dress would be the height of the creators' ingenuity, but it was only a seed before the parade of dresses, swimwear, blouses and other things that awaited me when watching. Costumers really tried their best. The craziest ideas came to life on the screen - and that's good! I literally enjoyed every outfit of Emilia. However, what can a nearly thirty-year-old Russian guy living in the provinces know about fashion!
2. Love line - here it is the center around which history is formed. It would seem that everything is simple - a provincial girl becomes a servant of a young disabled person chained to a wheelchair. At first, there is antipathy between them, gradually turning into love, and the real one. I saw many love lines on the big screen, and in this regard it is very difficult to surprise me. This line was not surprising, but the actors really tried. Emilia and Sam did not portray love, but loved each other for real. There is no falsity between them. The actors did not care, and this is the most important thing! Viewers appreciated this, and a picture with a twenty-million budget was able to raise almost two hundred and ten million dollars worldwide. People cannot be fooled.
3. Music - it is calm, creates the right mood, namely, romantic, a little serene, but gradually it changes to hopeless, oppressive and sometimes desperate. There are no catchy melodies, but I will praise the composer for his good work.
4. Camera work - a castle, a small town, a luxurious house of a rich man, resorts and so on are shot at a high level. Sometimes I caught myself thinking that I admire the views more than I read the dialogues (I watched a picture in English with Russian subtitles in order to appreciate the original voices, which I'm very happy about).
5. Euthanasia - the picture raises this difficult topic and answers it herself. I do not pretend to be the ""chief moralist of All Russia"", but simply express my position on this matter. I perfectly understand both the supporters of this practice and its opponents. But, starting from my worldview and education, I believe that life is a gift from the Lord, and we have no right to interrupt it on our own, no matter how hard it is for us. The Lord knows when our time will come, but how we manage the time allotted to us is already on our conscience. The hero of the picture decided so, but it is his choice. By the way, it was precisely because of this that the picture was criticized at the time, saying that it was ""propaganda"" and everything that came out of here, both here and in the West. Let everyone determine their position on this issue independently. And yes, I judge the question from a philistine point of view, but I witnessed several heartbreaking events, which I will not discuss, for the memories are still very fresh.
A little about the main characters:
1. Louise Clark performed by Emilia Clark (sorry for the tautology, but I'm not to blame) - a simple modest girl, in view of the difficult financial situation, is a servant of a young disabled person chained to a stroller, not yet knowing how this will turn her life upside down. The difficulties that Louise is faced with are more relevant than ever, even now in Russia, apparently in the West, the situation is similar, therefore the heroine immediately attracts attention. Her modesty and decency are truly captivating, and her recklessness and sometimes easy pretense - fall in love. I already talked about outfits, but I repeat that they're not simply lovely! The acting is at a high level. I was glad that she didn't laugh wildly in the picture, otherwise I would just finish watching right at this moment. Emilia knows how to show off talent when she wants. Amy's whole pen!
2. William Trainor, played by Sam Klaflin, is a young man, the son of wealthy parents, whose life was suddenly overturned by a terrible catastrophe, as a result of which he became a wheelchair invalid, his former optimism and confidence disappeared somewhere, his taste for life lost its meaning until he Louise met, which made him feel alive again. Sam really pleased me, he showed a controversial hero fighting on the verge of life and death, love and despair, grief and happiness. I have not seen Sam in any picture, but he played just fine. Well done!
I was glad to see the powerful Charles Dance as the father of William.
As for the tearful moments, they exist, but they didn't make such a deep emotional impression on me as the picture ""Christmas for Two"" did. I can't do anything about it. I was open to this picture, there was no skepticism (unlike ""Voices from the stone"", where it turned out to be true) - but there is no effect. Of all three paintings, only ""Christmas for Two"" could knock out tears (and already three times in a row). Many wrote that the heroines of Emilia in both paintings are similar, I agree, but only half. ""See you"" I liked it, but I'm unlikely to review it. But I understand the audience, who simply adore her and love her - that's great.
As a result, we have an excellent melodrama about touching love in difficult conditions with wonderful acting by Emilia Clark and Sam Klaflin, atmospheric music and a raised, far ambiguous theme.
My rating is 8 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!"

","Sorry for my bad english
I think it's a nice movie. Personally i didn't expect much and while watching it i didn't thought they are promoting any kind of wrong message about disability maybe because I've seen Will's character as a person and not as a disable man. For me there are two diffrent personalities ""trappted"" in situations they don't want to and somehow they help each other to free themself. On one hand we have Will a guy who was always strong, confident, rich and handsome and because of these characteristics he refuses to accept his accident. By taking this decission he was able to have the control of his own life and get back his dignite. On the other hand we have Lou a nice, sweet and dreamy but timid girl who never refuses anything, who stays in a relasionship knowing that they have nothing in common, who always helps even if she has to set her dreams aside.Through their connection, she gave him the love and care that he might never had, so he left in peace and complete and he pushed her, as she is health and able, to chase her dreams and put herself first.
The movie is more about the feelings of the persons, the way they want to see themselves(she dresses in crazy outfits/ he cares more about his image to the world), the dreams they have( he had many but he's unable now/ she had few but she is scared) and how they accept whatever life brings.
To tell the truth if the end was different, it would have been very obvious, so love and money can't always bring the happiness the way we expect it."
"Hellmant","7","1","1","1 February 2017"," Will Traynor definitely has the wrong outlook on life,
","'ME BEFORE YOU': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>A rom-com/drama about a paralyzed former banker, that's planning to kill himself, who falls for his new caregiver. The movie stars Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin (as the two leads), and it costars Charles Dance, Janet McTeer, Steve Peacocke, Matthew Lewis, Brendan Coyle and Jenna Coleman. It was directed by first time feature filmmaker Thea Sharrock, and it was written by Jojo Moyes; adapted from her 2012 novel, of the same name. The film has received mixed reviews from critics, and some negative backlash from the disability rights movement (over what they perceive to be a very negative message about people with disabilities). Despite the negative controversy, the movie was a huge hit at the Box Office (making over $200 million worldwide). I do understand how some people could be offended by this film, but I also think it's a well made, and sometimes very touching, movie.<br/><br/>Louisa Clark (Clarke) had worked for a local café, for six years, when she's unexpectedly laid off from it. Desperate to find work, she responds to a caregiver job opening; working for a wealthy family named the Traynors. Will Traynor (Claflin) was a successful banker, before he was paralyzed (two years earlier) in a motorcycle accident. He's now very cynical, and he's not very welcoming of Louisa's assistance. After some time though, the two begin to get along quite well; despite the fact that Louisa has a boyfriend (Lewis). When Louisa learns that Will is planning to kill himself, she tries to come up with a list of things for him to do; in order to make him love life again. Will feels like he's too much of a burden on others though, to keep on living, despite his strong feelings for Louisa. <br/><br/>I definitely think that the Will Traynor character (in this film) has the wrong outlook on life; and his views definitely shouldn't be encouraged, or promoted (and it does seem like that's what the movie is kind of doing). So I understand why people are offended by this film; but if you look at it just as being the way that this specific character sees life though, than I think it's something that could possibly be overlooked. Despite this major flaw, the movie is very well made; the main characters (despite their flaws) are very likable, and the film is quite moving (at times). The two lead performances are both good, and it's great to see another strong female empowering role, like the one that Clarke plays, as the central character in a big movie like this. It's also nice to see both a talented woman director, as well as a gifted female screenwriter, behind a major film like this. It's just a shame that the movie has that one major flaw to it though.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_SLO5GYrmps"
"rebecca_sherwood544","Null","1","1","31 January 2017"," Me Before You - Review
","As a disabled person with CP, I kept putting off watching this film due to the backlash from the disabled community. However, I felt that given that the content of the film reflects my everyday experiences working with personal assistants (and also that I have a keen interest in the topic of euthanasia) I had spent too much time avoiding the issues that are explored in Me Before You.<br/><br/>Before watching this film, I was already aware of the fact that the character of Will was being played by able-bodied actor Sam Claflin. I can see why others have taken issue with this, for me it felt like it sent out the wrong message. I found it uncomfortable to see an able-bodied actor portraying a disabled character, because it would have been more genuine and relatable had they chosen one of the many talented disabled actors out there. For a start, it would have been beneficial for the disabled community to be put in the media spotlight in a positive sense. In addition to this, the content of the film would have been less negative because we ultimately watch Will choose to end his life. Whereas, if Will were played by someone with a disability, then we would benefit by celebrating disability through a successful public figure who has managed to overcome social barriers and has built a career as an actor. Sam Claflin in the role of Will reinforced the sad message of the film; that disabled lives aren't worth living. <br/><br/>I strongly disagree with the premise that living life with a disability is less valuable. It is a different way of a life, but not a meaningless one. Will's perspective was warped as he failed to embrace an alternative way of life and instead lived in the past. He focused upon the things that he could no longer do because of his quadriplegia. He wanted to live like he did prior to his accident, and therefore could not accept himself as a wheelchair user. This negative view reflects how society too often views people with disabilities; as incapable or a burden. Will's unchanging decision to go to Dignatas reinforces the incorrect view that the prospects are bleak if you become less physically able. I myself would dispute this narrow-minded outlook. <br/><br/>Despite my reservations about the overall impact of this film, I did enjoy watching the relationship between Will and Lou develop. In the beginning they were unable to relate to each other, as Will was uncooperative in allowing Lou to become a part of his daily life. Preventing Lou from becoming a real part of his routine was a form of denial, because allowing her in would make his current situation real. It seemed he was afraid of becoming co-dependant on anyone and wanted her to be merely an extension of his limited physical capabilities. The breakdown in communication was portrayed well by both Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, as the awkwardness was evident on screen. The dynamic changed when they started connecting with one another and understanding each other's lives in more depth. What was evident from the outset is that both characters had something that the other perceived as important in living a good life. For Will that was freedom, but for Lou this meant the financial stability that Will took for granted. Unfortunately there was nothing that convinced Will to choose his new life over euthanasia, not even now having Lou in his life. However I would suggest that spending so much time with her was in fact counter-productive, because she represented everything he could no longer do. Perhaps if Will had spent more time with other wheelchair users who had accepted and embraced their lifestyles, he could have achieved a more positive state of mind. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I would still recommend this film because it provides an insight (albeit exaggerated) into the motivations behind euthanasia, and opens the debate in popular culture. The are parts of Me Before You that I found inspiring and uplifting, which is more than I expected."
"Reno-Rangan","7","1","1","4 October 2016"," Changing one's fixed mind is not an easy task.
","Based on the novel of the same name, directed by a new lady filmmaker. This British film has two young sensation Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke in the important roles. The story of a young man who was paralysed recently meets his new caretaker. Initially they both won't fit for each other, but after some time everything changes when they together do some outdoor activities. While the film progress, it only gets more emotional. Besides, it's fun watching the first two acts, particularly the performances from both the lead strikes strongly.<br/><br/>After a very long time I watched a good tearjerker, but not that strong. It is a simple story, there's no big adventure or romance in it. That's right, it is not a romance film and if you decide to watch expecting one, you will be definitely disappointed. Also slightly it delivers a bad message like the negativity for being one seriously ill and alive. This issue is only on the humanity ground, but afterall everyone entitled to do what they want, because it's their life.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film avoids the usual cliché. Like there's no scene that you had seen in other similar theme repeats here. Deliberately avoided to make it a fresh piece. Basically, if you observe closely the both two lead characters, they had a different agenda about their life. Particularly the caretaker never ever tried anything seriously to accomplish her undertaking.<br/><br/>On the other hand, those parts were very realistic, but still gives us a cinematic experience due to the fancy screen presentation. Surely a good watch, I think everyone should watch it, because there's no drugs, sexes or nudes or even the strong kissing scenes. Only the main theme is something disturbing, particularly for the tender-hearted people. Other than that, I hope you watch it if you haven't yet.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Sorry but this movie has several problems. Story is about a paralyzed man who falls in love with a young local woman hired to be his companion/help mate. However he wants to commit suicide because of the pain and inability to live normally. The Trainers are supposedly the most prominent and wealthy local gentry family and yet they appear to have no servants at the manor house. Really? I mean people like them would have at least a few flunkies doing chores. It was laughable that Mrs. Trainor would answer the door herself to let the ""shop girl"" in to interview for the companion to her disabled son job. Normally when people are interviewing for a job like this with well to do people, a maid would let them in and allow them to be seated in the hallway and go in and tell the lady of the house she had a ""person"" to interview for the job. The local upper class upon calling would be shown into a sitting room and then the lady of the house informed of their presence. Also in a small village, the Trainers would likely have found someone by ""word of mouth"" and not gone through the employment office at all. Furthermore it was mentioned in passing that the disabled son had been a corporate raider in London prior to his accident and yet he shows no compassion nor remorse for the jobs he has cost working stiffs nor companies looted and destroyed.It is hard to feel sympathy for such an unrepentant sleaze ball. One last point: Was it really necessary to jet off to Switzerland for ""voluntary euthanasia""? In real life a hefty overdose of morphine or bottle of sleeping tablets and whiskey together would have done the job with much less fuss and trouble and trauma and upset for the parents. Apparently the handicapped young man really did put himself before and above everyone else."

"Danusha_Goska","6","4","11","26 June 2016"," Moving In Spite of Itself
","""Me Before You"" was made to appeal to the lowest common denominator. In spite of myself, though, I was moved by and I enjoyed this film. <br/><br/>""Me Before You"" is a romance between a perky, poor, not spectacularly beautiful girl and a rich, suicidal, model-handsome quadriplegic. You may have begun gagging already. I understand, and believe me, everything that you fear may be wrong with such a film is wrong with this film. It talks down to its audience. Its play with dangerous ideas is a child playing with matches. And yet, I cried. <br/><br/>I think two things save ""Me Before You"" in spite of all that's wrong with it. <br/><br/>Sam Claflin plays the part of Will Traynor, the rich, handsome, suicidal quadriplegic. Claflin is young, ripped, and handsome enough to be in a toothpaste commercial. He is really good. I believed everything he did. I was right there with him. I felt his pain and desperation. <br/><br/>Janet McTeer, a multiple-award-winning actress, is the soul of the film. She plays Will's mother. She is given very little to do, but she pops in and out regularly. There is an infinite sadness and terror in her eyes. I'm a former nurse's aide and I'm very familiar with dealing with family members of afflicted people. Janet McTeer is superb. She shows the exact strength, vulnerability, and hoping- against-hope of the loved ones of the wounded and doomed. <br/><br/>""Me Before You""'s plot doesn't do anything you wouldn't expect it to. If you go to the movies to be surprised or intrigued, stop right now. But you already knew that when you saw the movie poster of the perky girl sitting on the lap of the very handsome man in a wheelchair, as they gaze lovingly into each other's eyes. <br/><br/>""Me Before You"" takes place in the England that exists only in the imagination of fans of Masterpiece Theater, Jane Austen adaptations, and Merchant Ivory films. This is very much not the England of Sadiq Khan and Brexit or even of royal family scandals. <br/><br/>There are very rich people who also have good taste. There are poor people who are warm, simple-minded, and humble, not at all resentful or bitter about their place. Sort of like Hobbits. There is sweeping, green countryside defined by rambling stone walls and trout streams. There is a big, fat castle – yes, really – overlooking everything. <br/><br/>Weather? It's either blue skies, burgeoning lilacs and hydrangeas, or gently drifting snow outlining the castle battlements, or perfectly formed autumn leaves. Thomas Kinkade is the meteorologist. <br/><br/>Louisa ""Lou"" Clark is a cutie pie poor girl. Emilia Clarke, who plays Louisa, telegraphs how adorable Lou is in every scene. She is constantly dimpling her cheeks and wriggling her eyebrows as if they were migrating caterpillars looking for a leaf to pupate on. Look, if you wanted to smack Emilia Clarke during every scene of ""Me Before You,"" could you please send me a Facebook friend request? Does the word ""subtlety"" appear in Emilia Clarke's dictionary? Or ""teamwork""? In every scene she demands attention. Actors should never work with babies, animals, or Emilia Clarke. <br/><br/>Lou is supposed to be really poor. Lou never wears the same item of clothing twice. Her clothes are unique designer finds. Her shoes alone would go for a few hundred bucks. Oh, but she's this noble poor girl. Yeah, right. <br/><br/>The filmmakers here keyed their film to teenage girls who love clothes more than life itself and who have short attention spans. My utterly subjective estimate: no scene in the film lasts for more than ninety seconds. You think there's going to be a serious discussion, or even three consecutive lines of dialogue, about the issues at play here: can afflicted people live worthwhile lives? Is suicide ethical? Will this film encourage the handicapped to off themselves? But that never happens. <br/><br/>It's safe to guess that Will's quadriplegia is, to the filmmakers, merely a plot device. Tweener girls find guys attractive, but are anxious about real physical intimacy and all it entails. Also, tweener girls don't want to be obliterated by masculinity. They want to exist in a world where they are the center. And, tweener girls are anxious that they aren't pretty enough. <br/><br/>Thus, ""Me Before You"" gives tweener girls a very handsome, ripped hero who couldn't engage in physical intimacy even if he wanted to. And he is so needy and so isolated that the tweener girl's cuteness and spunkiness and fashion choices become the center of his world. And she doesn't have to be beautiful to be the center of the universe to this handsome guy who, if he were not a quadriplegic, would be the hottest date in town. <br/><br/>Yes, it is all pretty awful, right down to Lou's boyfriend, who is an endurance athlete obsessed with his physical performance, but insensitive to Lou's emotional needs – he is meant to contrast with the lovable quadriplegic. One man can run but can't feel. One man can feel but can't walk. Oh good grief. <br/><br/>And yet I cried while watching this film. In spite of everything, Claflin's and McTeer's performances opened my heart."

","I don´t like romantic films but this one inspired me. The film feature Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, who also starred in Games of Thrones. The film was an adaptation of a book written by Jojo Moyes with the exact same name, but i learned about the book after watching the movie.<br/><br/>It´s a story about love of a two different people from English countryside. Louisa Clark ( Emilia Clarke) works in a local bistro and dated with Patrick, whom she probably doesn´t love. After losing her job at a local cafe, she got a job in the household of Traynors. She was supposed to be a companion and a caretaker of Will Traynor. Will Traynor (Sam Claflin) is a successful, young man who loved his life, but it quickly changed after a heavy traffic accident. He becomes paralyzed. Will´s mother was desperate, because will got depressed, and she couldn´t do anything on her own, so she tried to find caretakers who would help him and persuade him that life is worth living. After a few months full of crazy activities, they became good friends until love arose.<br/><br/>Lou is funny, optimistic, kind and she wears crazy clothes. On the other side, Will´s character changed during the film. At the beginning of this story Will was depressed, cynical, but over time his character grow and he became really funny and sweet yet still calm and mysterious.<br/><br/>They were like sun and moon, different, but they were meant to be together.

When Will decided to die it broke my heart i cried for 5 straight minutes because my hopelessly romantic heart couldn't take it but after seeing Lou seemingly happy in Paris i realized Will left to escape his pain and regardless they still fell in love and cherished their time together. This really is a must see they may not end up married but they still loved each other till Will's end. After i stopped crying i was happy and content with the ending. The movie has wonderful actors, an amazing script, comedy, and romance, everything a movie with such emotions needs. Please check it out it's worth the watch."

","One of the movies you can't get over after one watch.Portrayed in the best possible way this story could be.You get every reason to judge Will for being a meek to opt for euthanasia instead of accepting the way his life was, but a lot more reasons not to, for this was not the life he planned .But he made sure he made Clark's life a better one. And through this he lived though he died at the end."
"cheer88","7","2","4","19 January 2018"," Not so cliche after all
","There were a series of romantic stories where I came from called three-room dramas, i.e. storylines following living, bedroom and dinning rooms. So I intentionally avoid watching such movies. However, this one stroked different tunes. I am not against it and actually enjoy it.<br/><br/>It is a Cinderella story which undoubtedly inhabits minds of young girls since the dawn of civilization but in a unconventional way. It typically starts with the wealthy, handsome young male meeting with a simple-minded, fairly good looking struggling female coincidentally. Of course, this white knight with shinning armors had to rescue the supposing Cinderella eventually. This one is no difference. Nevertheless, this white knight was not with her physically but spiritually in the end. Also, Cinderella indeed tried to rescue him instead but failed to prevail. The writer did so unorthodoxly instead the version of them getting married and living happily ever after which might be preferred by some audience. In my opinion, it indeed kept the integrity of Cinderella story cleverly . The white knight even in the wheel chair in this movie had to rescue the girl. That is the essence of Cinderella tale. <br/><br/>It's a warm and enjoyable movie. It also slightly touched the base of assistance suicide. I am not totally on board with it. However, we all can put some thought into it."
"CineMuseFilms","8","2","4","15 June 2016"," a beautifully sugar-coated but tragic story with a deep message that increasingly demands a societal response
","In movies, as in life, appearances can be deceptive. The trailer for Me Before You (2016) promises a sweet romantic comedy but the film is an emotionally challenging confrontation with the moral dilemmas of assisted dying. It is a beautifully sugar-coated but tragic story with a deep message that increasingly demands a societal response. Full of fairy-tale allusions, including a castle with a fallen prince and a poor girl in strange clothes, together with brilliant casting and tear-inducing imagery, the film is one of a growing number that address euthanasia themes.<br/><br/>The storyline is simple. Working class girl Louisa Clark (Emilia Clarke) takes a six-month contract to be a carer for quadriplegic Will Traynor (Sam Claflin). He is under the guardianship of his wealthy parents who want a fresh bright face for Will, and Louisa is delightfully quirky, chatty and absolutely zany in her dress sense. Despite a fractious beginning, they soon become deeply attached as she learns of his plan to end his life in a Swiss euthanasia clinic within six months. In the time they have left and within the constraints of his condition, they do many of the things that young lovers do, including a tropical island holiday. The most painful part of this film is the absolutely finite nature of its impending finale and the respectful resolution shown in particular by Will's parents and the transformative effect this has on Louisa.<br/><br/>Emilia Clarke's performance is the beating heart of this film. As Louisa, she is simply beyond gorgeous. Her face can speak volumes without opening her mouth while her eyebrows alone have a vocabulary spanning all human emotion. Will is her perfect match, with an expressiveness that glides seamlessly from brooding stoicism to irascible charm. No doubt many audiences will be happy to enjoy a bitter sweet love story told well, without dwelling on the deeper message of assisted dying. Others, however, will be struck by the force of three words that are repeated several times in the film, ""it's his choice"". They will grapple with how a person can reach such an unbearable point in their existence where they find absolutely no reason to live. As a tear-jerker rom-com, this film is right up there with the best of them but it is so much more than that. Sure, the narrative arc is laid bare right from the start, but sometimes you just have to let a movie have its way with you, as this one did with me."
"ctowyi","7","2","4","15 June 2016"," The Mother of Dragon's goofiness save the day
","Romantic dramedies of this sort rise or fall depending on the chemistry of the couple. It is a foregone conclusion they would fall in love but they will have to earn the right to fall into each other's arms. There is no need to give me new twists to the familiar turns; just sell the couple to me and hopefully make me tear up at the end. On that note, Me Before You scores beautifully. <br/><br/>I love watching Emilia Clarke, the Mother of Dragons. Her goofiness, all-out spunk, total honesty, awkward behavior and gaudy sense of fashion lift the chick flick slightly higher than it deserves. It took me 10 seconds and suddenly I don't see the Queen of Meereen, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, the Breaker of Chains and the Mother of Dragons. I couldn't take my eyes off her twitching eyebrows which have a life of their own. Sam Calflin plays his character with the right amount of sarcasm and levity; he is believable as a quadriplegic, a man who knows he couldn't ever be the same man again. Both of them turned in authentic performances. <br/><br/>The story goes through the usual paces and there really weren't any surprises, but who cares. The theme of euthanasia wasn't handled with a searing depth, but the theme of living life to the best of your ability rings true. Yeah... We cried but we weren't a mess like we were with The Fault in Our Stars. Me Before You isn't breaking new ground nor did it try to, but it just felt like good comfort food. Sometimes I long for that."

","If I said anymore in my subject, it would contain spoilers. So here it comes....<br/><br/>Another movie that has what I call unfulfilled love. For whatever reason (in this case, a man who decides to (with medical assistance and legally) end his own life), love that doesn't make it to the finish line. (Think Brief Encounter, Remains of the Day, The Fault in Our Stars) I see where some people think it is a terrible message to romanticize assisted suicide be cause this man's life just wasn't what he thought it should be. Did they see the same movie?? It is clearly stated that he is in pain all the time, and his health is so frail that he gets pneumonia quite frequently. He had plenty to live for with the exception of his declining health, so he was suffering and would only get worse. That said, this is a sweet movie that allows the stars to shine in the way they express the precious thing called time and how to use it, even finitely. Not the best movie ever made, but a true tear-jerker. That he thought to provide for her and her dreams after his death was a nice surprise - showing that love comes in all forms and can keep making memories no matter what."

","This movie offers us the perfect harmony of angst and joy. The story is not only dreamably beautiful but also realistic too.<br/><br/>Only those actors and actresses could portray the characters like this. They didn't just played their roles, they lived them! Let alone the quality and all, Sam Claflin's gestures alone are enough to make one watch this movie.<br/><br/>/spoiler alert<br/><br/>The main actress represents the minimalist lives of the lower class: she knows how to enjoy the life, even though she has not had the opportunity to taste many things in life and has not witnessed more than her own small surrounding. She is incompetent and clearly not quite a smart type.<br/><br/>The main actor represents the bourgeoisie class. Everything before the traffic accident was terrific in this man's life: he was gifted by a magnificent appearance (and therefore a magnificent genetic too), a financialy wealthy family, a beautiful girlfriend and a free life. He clearly is a very intelligent person. He tasted all kinds of beauty that the world has to offer. So that he thinks that it is pointless to live without freedom.<br/><br/>the main actress does try her best to keep him alive: she takes him to places where he can have fun, she thinks that by seeing the beauty of nature, he will realize that life is a beautiful and thus he will change his mind, but what the girl didnt take into account was that he have already been to all these places as a completely healthy person. The one who haven't been to these places was she herself.<br/><br/>There was a dialouge between them something like this: ""If you hadn't have that traffic accident, you wouldn't have been the one looking at my cleavage. Instead, I would've been one of the invisible waitresses and you would've been the man who is dancing with the blonde lady."" I think this summarizes the whole story."

","I saw this movie twice. The first time was in theatres when it came out. I remember I didn't like it at all, but that could have been because my aunt was sobbing next to me throughout the entire movie and I had to supply her with tissues.
I watched it again more recently after having read the book, and I have to say...it wasn't better.
I give it 3 stars because I like the fact that Jojo Moyes, who wrote the book, also wrote the script so the film stays mostly true to the novel. I also don't mind Sam Claflin's performance, and Emilia Clarke was casted perfectly. I did manage to laugh a handful of times at the beginning at some of the wittier lines.
That is all I have to say about the movie that's good. Otherwise, all of the acting seemed off and I spent more time watching Emilia Clarke's eyebrows than anything else. The soundtrack was absolutely awful, the music was overbearing and just didn't seem to fit the tone of the overall film. In comparison to the book, this was just too rushed. Everything happened so quickly, and the admirable aspects of the book were taken out of the film because it was either deemed unnecessary or too dark to include in an already pretty dark film, considering the end result.
As I said, there are a few chuckles early on, but it quickly gets boring. The best part is when Louisa asks wheelchair-ridden Will to dance with her and the first line of Ed Sheeran's ""Thinking Out Loud"" starts playing. (When your legs don't work like they used to before)"

","At around 1 hour and 30 minutes, the familiar ""Don't forget about me"" sounded, and the desolation and plot in the cloves sound perfectly matched. The choice and torment of the same kind-even if you love deeply, you must let it go, you may face it, even if you experience Completely copied, because the emotions are connected, the music can touch people's hearts and burst into tears. Clark looked out the window, and when he looked at Will, who was asleep, it was also the most beautiful time in the movie.
Me before you, I think it can be translated as before meeting you, after losing you.
Me before you is a different life for the two in the movie, the change of life trajectory may be good or bad, but grateful to meet, grateful for love.
Instead of changing with a perfect ending, it appears real, and there are not so many perfections and dreams in life. Helplessness and impermanence are more normal, and the experience and love in them make the seemingly meaningless life become meaningful, before or after."
"patey-03510","2","4","12","13 October 2016"," Me before poo!
","Okay, let me start with the positives. This firm is well acted and is, on one level, a reasonable, weepy romance. However, the relationship between the leading couple seems unrealistically intense because the actors are not given sufficient screen time or dialogue to develop it. That said, my biggest problem with this movie is it's message.<br/><br/>At this point I should briefly explain that I was born disabled and I am unable to walk. I will remain this way for the rest of my life. I cope with this in one very simple way, I focus on what I can do and not what I can't, what I have got, not what I have am without. So, I found the fact that the leading man in this film decided to take his own life due to a paralysing accident hard to accept. He had so much to live for, a supportive family, a great house that had been adapted to suit his needs, a specially adapted vehicle and loads of money! However, this was clearly not enough as he is still really unhappy and has a massive chip on his shoulder, as he waits, counting the days until he can end his own life! Then this gorgeous, kind, lovely young lady comes into his life, they fall in love, she practically begs him not to go through with it but to no avail. <br/><br/>This is such a negative message, which is offensive to people living happy lives with disabilities. It also serves to reinforce negative stereotypes surrounding disabilities. I wanted to see the ending in which she made him realise his life was worth living. Now that would have been living boldly!"

"dieloveyou","5","6","23","4 June 2016"," Forgettable
","Me Before You is a forgettable romantic comedy drama that really doesn't make its mark. Though it was a good attempt for a story like the fault in our stars, it doesn't quite stay with you nor stand with the success of its book. After so many skipped important scenes and dodgy actors for the mother and father of lou, i found myself feeling quite frustrated that the book was so lovely and Me Before You could not compete. Emelia clarke was such a true match for lou but unfortunately, will not so much. Me before you does have its perks. You will find yourself laughing here and then and you may even find a tear trying to escape heading towards the end. Overall, Me before you is enjoyable, but you probably wont find yourself falling inlove with it as much as you did with the novel by jojo moyes."

","For Full review<br/><br/>http://thatdisabledmom.<br/><br/>I do wish Me Before You story wasn't about him choosing to die, but choosing to live, but then, that isn't very romantic. Just like my real story isn't. But, maybe someone ( like one of us or someone who get us) can romanticize our stories and have us, I dunno, live?!* (*Awesome authors that tackle disability with romance: Kody Kepliner, Ava Jae, Leigh Bardugo & Francesca Lia Block)<br/><br/>I want more stories like mine out there. I want them made to be romantic without death or the old tropes! I think this can happen when we look at WHY the tropes that hurt us or offend us exist and then work on changing them!<br/><br/>So where does this lead this Me Before You, this rare glamorous and romantic depiction of what I, and others, live through with disability and chronic pain? <br/><br/>I dunno. Maybe Emilia Clarke will win an Oscar. (Hopefully, because you know, I hear she's so short and almost ugly. It was so nice of Hollywood to give her that role. Maybe they Hollywood can stop congratulating themselves for hiring ""non-supermodels"" and start hiring disabled actors, writers, directors and they really feel morally superior like the 90210 kids. ) <br/><br/>As for me I'll be watching Game of Thrones. This mama loves The Mother of Dragons. She is literally a guilty pleasure, this tiny blonde girl that mostly rescues brown people. I know there are people of color that hate this about Game of Thrones. They should. We all should keep challenging writers about the harmful tropes.<br/><br/>But, I will end with a Game of Thrones plot point: <br/><br/>Last week was probably the third The Queen of Dragons/ Khalessi burned rapists and demanded liberation for all women and slaves. I literally cry (like a girl at a romantic date movie) every time because I'm so moved."
"clargarrr","7","3","9","3 July 2016"," Realistic
","I did not read the book. When I saw the trailer, I thought the movie was going to be boring, but I was wrong. To regard it as ""one of the best romantic films of its time"" is a mistake, but to say that it is bad is not exactly right either. While there isn't something breathtakingly new about the film, I could, however, easily recommend it to someone who's tired of watching films with endings which only aim to satisfy most of the audience's desire.<br/><br/>One quirk of Emilia Clarke that kind of distracted me with her acting is her overly expressive eyebrows. She is beautiful and lovely, no doubt about that. But her eyebrows stole the show in some scenes from time to time. I'm not entirely sure either if it was meant to be that way, but the wardrobe they had for Lou (Emilia Clarke) was terrible. I mean I get that her choice of clothes was supposed to make a statement about her personality, yet I was hoping for them to achieve that without making the character look silly.<br/><br/>With regard to the ending, others find it ironic that Will (Sam Claflin) is instructing Lou to do something that he himself intends to defy. But what I think these people fail to realize is that Will and Lou's life conditions are not the same. The challenge Lou faces in her life is not on par with the difficulty being suffered by Will. I believe the lesson to be learned from Me Before You* is to do something significant with your life. And if you pay close attention to what happened in the ending, you will see that both characters were able to accomplish just that.<br/><br/>*Better than ""The Fault in Our Stars"""

","A fairly good story by Jojo Moyes gets deep-sixed by awful, awful, music cuts and transitions infesting scene shift after scene in what could've been a good albeit maudlin script of ""Me Before You"". Fault lies mostly with editors and director Thea Sharrock for completely over-indulging singing music cuts. Sorry Sharrock, in editing with film when it comes to music and audio, less is more. Kumbaya might be OK for campfires, but not for stories of paraplegics or cinema. MTV is its own category. There's a time and a place for it, but not in supposedly serious subject matter. Clarke and Claflin are not at fault and do a good job in this movie. Too bad directors and editors cannot fathom or recognize their own tacky and poor soundtrack editing. 5/10 cannot recommend."
"tom-43722","7","2","5","2 July 2016"," I had butterflies in my stomach and Emilia Clarke was not the woman who caused them
","I'm not a fan of Emilia Clarke or Sam Claflin. Don't get me wrong; they are talented performers, but I didn't watch the movie to see them. Jenna Coleman is the only woman, both in the acting world and in my own relatively boring life, who can make me feel scared, excited and nervous all at the same time. I think she had far too little screen time and Katrina's story was only very vaguely hinted at. Apparently, she has a son but they never explained who the father is or how she was coping and judging by how young Jenna looks (she's thirty but I think she looks at least five years younger), I wouldn't be surprised if Treena's son was the result of a teenage pregnancy. Assuming he actually was her son. Treena wanted to go back to college but that's only mentioned in one scene. Despite having too little screen time, Treena and Lou really did seem like sisters. It wasn't as good as Anna and Elsa's beautiful bond in Frozen but that was only because the story didn't give Treena enough attention.<br/><br/>The ending was sad but I knew Will was going to die before I even watched the movie. With that said, it does lead to questions about whether one should assist in a suicide and it was brave to tackle this controversial matter. Is it murder when one wants to die? I don't know and while Lou and Treena's mother stated that it basically was, that is just one woman's opinion. The film itself doesn't really say whether it's right or wrong. I also noticed something else, actually from a trailer before I even watched the film. Lou said she became a whole new person after meeting Will and her dad said that you can't change who people are. Some could see that as inconsistent writing, but when I think about it, I think it works because Lou and her dad are two different people with different points of view.<br/><br/>As someone who appreciates subtlety, I should also draw attention to the scene where Will's parents are discussing his condition while Lou is listening. Something about the way Charles Dance spoke and held himself told me that Will's dad knew that Lou was listening. Charles himself must have known that Emilia was there but I think he was implying that his character heard Lou approaching and was intentionally giving her information about the situation, hoping that she could change Will's mind. Of course, Lou was eavesdropping but I like that it's left to the viewers interpretation about whether Will's dad knew she was there or not.<br/><br/>While it's a good movie, the only reason I wanted to watch it was because Jenna's in it. If it weren't for her, I wouldn't have written this review. I've had similar feelings about Doctor Who ever since the casting of the talented but overrated Peter Capaldi. Now that Jenna's left, Doctor Who has lost most of its charm for me. With that said, I mistook Treena for Clara at one point because Jenna can disappear into her character when she's playing Clara to the point where, for a moment, I saw Clara playing Treena instead of Jenna playing her. It was like Jenna was playing two characters simultaneously. The problem is that Treena was only in a handful of scenes, so I never really got to know her. She's supportive, playful, a little inappropriate at times (""Katrina Clarke!"") and more intelligent than her sister but due to her lack of screen-time, I couldn't get to know her as intimately as I got to know Clara Oswald or Queen Victoria. I don't know what her quirks and flaws are. With that said, Jenna always has a powerful presence, despite her size. Heck, I think they should have switched her and Emilia's roles around because Jenna's the only reason I watched this movie in the first place. Also she's better at subtlety than Emilia but can still be happy, eccentric and energetic.<br/><br/>Despite this movies strengths, it also has weaknesses, the most notable one being that it's predictable and there are no real surprises. With that said, it's also passionate and heartfelt. Many movies are lazily put together these days - the film industry has been corrupted by money and seems more concerned about cash than making art - but this one actually had some effort put into it so it deserves to be acknowledged. Me Before You wasn't really my kind of movie but for what it was, it was good. If Jenna wasn't in it and I still watched it, I'd give it 6 but I'm giving it 7 because I freaking love her. And hate that I love her. And I'm driving myself mad over her."

Anyone noticed how the majority of the reviews in the first pages are written like paid professionals praising all the aspects of the movie? <br/><br/>It almost look like you have to start reading from the ending page of reviews to get a real review. I will be very curious to see if this review will even see the light of day and if not then I will never trust or even come to IMDb for movie reviews.<br/><br/>As for the movie... I had great expectations after seeing the trailer but was such a disappointment. First... there is no love story in this movie. The whole movie is about a rich paraplegic man who is so immersed in self pity about loosing his ""tremendous"" past life that is incapable of any emotions for the people around him. OK... and a girl who gets attached to him... but settles for some money reward for her broken heart. The movie is predictable, pathetic, has no real drama or message. The actors have potential but are not believable due to the lack of a true love story in the script. What a missed opportunity, I could close my eyes and imagine how this movie could have been written to be one of the best, a real dramatic struggle between love and physical pain, rich and poor, life and death."
"sweet_mya6","4","4","14","1 August 2016"," 'Overrated' is an understatement
","According to the average of more than forty thousand people on IMDb this movie got the rating 7.6? And for what? First, it's pathetic and that's not a quality. It plays cheap on peoples' emotions and that's not an artistic value or any value at all. I'm not the kind of person that likes only those movies which are artistic or make you think, I don't mind amusing cheap movies sometimes as well - but what is amusing about this one? <br/><br/>To me, this movie is like a perverted twist (but not in a good way) on Hollywood-style fairy tales and that's nothing new for the movie industry - making you feel good on the account of an unworthy but good spirited girl who in need of good money becomes a cheer-up doll for a prince in the castle who lived through tragedy, trying to give him reasons to live while being payed for it (because - why shouldn't that make him feel good about himself to be in a situation that parents have to buy him female companionship). And since the ending can not be too sad and 'god forbid' any different from all the rest of the Hollywood soapies at least someone has to have a gain at the end of the movie. Since it was too unrealistic for the writer himself that the guy in such a bad state of the body could still have a good spirit driving him forward to survive he still had to make at least somebody happy at the ending and so we get a princess out of the ashes. Congratulations on keeping your stereotypes up to date, successful and popular in the modern world, Hollywood."

","Jesus Christ this is terrible. <br/><br/>Point (1) Emilia Clarke is possibly the worst actress of all time, including in Game of Thrones. I get it, she's a lovely likable real girl from the real world, but she can't act and this needs to stop. Please.<br/><br/>Point (2) Another problem with this movie... the disabled character, is a 30 something year old man, who acts like a 12 year old boy, is filthy rich, completely spoiled, and <br/><br/>Point (3) makes the job of CARE GIVING look too easy. I think this movie is pretty much insulting towards the care giving profession."

","I get that the movie was supposed to portray something real and remind us that these things do happen (referring to the ending) but let's face it - the guy was a selfish prick. He had commodities others in similar situations would never have or would have to struggle to get. Not to mention he was surrounded by people who loved him and yet all he could focus on was himself and this vision of him as this grand failure because he's in a wheelchair. Sent out a pretty bad message, in my opinion. He didn't even bother to try a little bit more for his life. You tell me he's in a vegetative state or in this incredible agonizing pain 24/7 okay. I don't like to judge a person's reason for choosing such an option but I think people need to be reminded it's not the solution. This film seemed like it was condoning suicide. It makes you think he made the right decision in choosing himself and that he had that right to not be sad anymore."

","The whole story was a beautiful classic love story filled with happy memories for Will so he would find the value and beauty of his new life and not to take it for granted. first of all the whole story was brilliant and it could've been pictured in a way better scenario. Emilia Clarck was trying too hard to picture the Clark character and her making all those faces and playing with her eyebrows in every scene not only made it ridiculously unnatural but it also made the viewer confused about her face expression. by the end of the movie I was confused if she's sad for losing Will or happy or even so sad that she's smiling nervously to cover her pain.she had the wide smile with those funny wavy eyebrows. I'm not a professional but I found the direction very amateur. there could have been way more beautiful scenes where us.the viewers could actually feel the love is being build up between them. and at last the ending was not my favorite. I loved the tragic ending but it could have been finished in a more loving way. I've said all the negative points but there's no doubt that the love story was perfect and Sam Claflin did a marvelous job picturing Will's struggles and pain. nice job Sam ♥"
"tabjeep","5","2","6","16 August 2016"," Utterly blunt
","Well, sure it is a sweet loving and touching story but I was totally surprised by Clarke's performance. I found her giving a lot of effort to be a sweet/innocent/naive little girl/woman. During the film, she never stops smiling (sometimes it gets really awkward), her relationship with that other guy is far away from any other 7year old relationship according to her choices and generally how she deals with it.<br/><br/>Claflin is wandering from scene to scene and I truly found it difficult to feel his situation. He is also - oh yeah - smiling inexcusably throughout this film and I overall thing that this movie came to an end with a really immature way in a point that the film really underestimated any viewer's sense of logic.<br/><br/>Just give it a try on a Sunday evening but in my opinion it's inevitable for you to attach yourselves with these characters, feel any sympathy or a feeling for cry. Just a blunt mediocre film. Pity for Clarke. I was expecting far more from her."
"mother_of_popcorn","6","2","6","7 July 2016"," Nothing Special But Sweet Nonetheless
","Judging by the trailer for Me Before You, you already know the kind of ride you're in for. It's a tear-jerker about a quirky girl who takes up a job looking after a cynical paraplegic. It's not long before they fall in love with one another, despite their differences, and it either ends happily ever after or in tragedy.<br/><br/>I won't reveal which of these endings are true, however I must say that despite the predictability of this film, there are certain themes in the movie that I wasn't expecting to delve into. Without exposing too much, the issue of euthanasia crops up and whilst it's a polarising topic, I think the film deals with it in a very fair and two-sided way. Both sides of the coin are justified and it's a very complex theme that doesn't have a simple answer.<br/><br/>The acting is effortless and real between the two main characters. Lou Clark is played by GOT's mother of dragons Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin plays Will Traynor, who you might recognise from The Hunger Games franchise and Love, Rosie. The film is actually based on a New York Times bestseller by Jojo Moyes who also wrote the screenplay. I'm a big fan of novelists writing their own screenplay adaptations as I believe that no one knows their own story and vision like the person who wrote the original text.<br/><br/>This isn't a film that you can expect big things from, but it tells a sweet story that's funny, sad and inspiring in some ways too with many a lesson to be learned.<br/><br/>motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com"

","Let me start by saying this movie was good enough that it made me want to read the book. I don't think this movie would have been good if it didn't have the lovely Sam Claflin. His character saved the movie for me, relatable and loveable. He is an excellent actor and played his role equally well. The overall British theme of the movie was brilliant, I loved it. I like Emilia Clarke, but the character she portrays wasn't my favourite, just my opinion.
Louisa Clark seemed joyful, kind, extroverted, optimistic, and William was the opposite. He was sarcastic, dark and pessimistic. Opposites attract, but I am a person very like Will, and I would not fall for somebody like Lou. Again, that's just me. I love the couple. A few lines in this movie really made me laugh, for example:
Lou: 'I don't like superiority.' 
Will: 'You must hate me, then.'
The movie was enjoyable and kept me watching it, however, it was definitely predictable. I think everybody who has watched these kind of movies before can agree with me. I knew what the ending was going to be before I watched it. I definitely preferred the second half of the movie than the first, the comedic aspect quickly dropped. It was heartwarming and very sweet. It shows love is worth fighting for but some people cannot, or don't want to be, saved. I liked that. Some people are so sure of what they want, that nothing can change their minds. A nice movie."

","Thea Sharrock's production of Me Before You is getting mixed reviews, but I think that it is by far the best movie of the year and you need to see it. Me Before you is a romance that leaves most viewers in tears but still satisfies the watcher giving them that warm and satisfied feeling. <br/><br/>The acting by Emilia Clarke (Louisa Clarke aka ""Lou"") and Sam Claflin (Will Traynor). Louisa, is a hard worker who works many different jobs in order to help her family. When she loses her job at the local coffee shop she realizes that there is an opportunity for her to become a caretaker for Will. Will is a wealthy young banker who was recently paralyzed. Will's reaction to having a new caregiver is as expected he doesn't like her and ignores her existence. However, they begin to bond over little things and the adventures that they took on together. As they bond they fall for each other and their chemistry was real and they showing raw emotions.<br/><br/>Overall I thought the movie was spectacular. The acting was on-point, the plot was perfect, the setting was lovely and the soundtrack was amazing. I think that everyone needs to see this movie especially if you like romance movies.<br/><br/>Released in June 2016, the drama/romance film, Me Before You directed by Thea Sharrock, shows the audience the life of a paralyzed man who decides his state of living must end as he puts himself over the girl of his dreams."

The one factual thing in the movie was made a joke and that is Clarks boyfriend recommending exercise and rehab. It's not funny I'm worried folks with injuries will see this and relate to his negative attitude and that's unfortunate. It's hard but not impossible or even boring to live with spinal cord injury.

Focusing more than half of the running time in glib romance, there are some funny moments between the main characters that are enjoyable but the development of the plot has wasted several important thought provoking themes - controversy of the suffering between the disabled and the people around, struggle to live and find courage to regain confidence with physical impairment, sensitive subject on committing suicide and self willingness to survive as well as care, support and inspiration from a true love. Both Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin deliver their performance well while the choices of songs are pretty beautiful including the powerful scores composed by Craig Armstrong yet all these are unable to compensate the poor character and relationship developments. Perhaps the story should have reorganized by adding on more depth into the sufferings of the handicap, further converting into some positive inspirations rather than just steamrolling the value of life."

Someone with no qualifications in nursing, let alone CPR? Without the means to carry out a clever conversation with their son, who clearly comes from a very different world and background? So they hired her for her pretty face? Hoping he'd fall for her? What about his family, they never seem to keep him company, even though they begged him to stay with them.

The message of the film is sickening and every actor in the movie will not want this horrifying accidental comedy to be on their resume. I can only imagine that the 10 star reviews are from pre teen girls who some how think this is what a love story should be and as millennial smart phone addicts they have never seen any proper love story film made before they were born.

","I completely disappointed by the movie. I am really crazy about these types of movies with a heartbreaking love story. But as a fan of romantic movies, the message of this movie is so negative. There are two bad messages in the movie. <br/><br/>First, the movie is saying to people with real disability that it's better to die than to struggle in life problems and their disability!!! There are many examples of successful people such as Stephen Hawking and Paralympic winners even with a worse disability which proved the world that disability is not a limitation for them. I can't believe how they showed that a disabled person with a great love and very good social situation killed himself!!! <br/><br/>Second, another bad message is that money can buy love! They fall in love when they used lots of money and I think it is not reasonable as a pure love.<br/><br/>On the other hand, as a positive point, I can mention that the movie is well acted. Specially Emilia Clarke and her facial expressions were excellent and amazing."

This movie contained a strong message to all people as well, and the ending, although unexpected, was dedicated to the message of the movie. <br/><br/>Now the casting. I thought that Emilia Clarke tried too hard in this movie, and when she laugh or cry, it almost seems that it's fake. But her character is the most likable out of all in the film. Sam Claflin was decent as Will Traynor. Steve Peacocke was alright as Nathan, although his accent seemed hard to understand at first for myself and some viewers. The rest of the casting was not that important because it was basically revolved around those three characters. <br/><br/>Book Viewers. Honestly, this movie kept up with the book, although they missed out on a lot of things. They took out huge parts of the book, and that's why the movie doesn't care about characters such as Camilla, Thomas, and Katrina, etc. It's like they don't exist in the movie. Viewers who do not read the book will not know who Thomas is to the family and why Katrina is so important to Louisa's life. They also do not include Will's sister. Patrick was literally no one in the movie. He's Louisa's boyfriend in the movie and that's it. They didn't explain why Louisa dated him for years and how he was before he became that selfish prick. <br/><br/>So overall, the movie get a B- .

","Apart from movies, literature, and music my other great passion is theatre and around twenty years ago I saw Janet McTeer star as a memorable Beatrice opposite Mark Rylances' Benedek which is more or less one for the So What department except that in this movie she has a featured role as the mother of the male lead, which is yet more so what until we remember that Benedek and Beatrice were the prototypes for all the great movies in which a male and a female began by disliking each other and wind up as an item. That is not quite true of this movie; the man certainly begins by resenting the girl but then he resents most people; as for the girl, she is in it for the money. As she is something of a kook it's not to hard to see why he eventually falls for her - this is one of those parts that slightly off-beat actresses can score big in - think Audrey Tautao in Amelie - but then cannot really replicate, but it's more difficult to see what someone in a steady seven-year relationship should forget it virtually overnight and fall hook, line and sinker for a quadriplegic. Well again not quite, did I mention that not only is the guy very good looking but also seriously wealthy. Just once it would be refreshing, if not a tad more like the real world if the girl fell for someone who looked like Arthur Mullard and lived in a council flat and especially in a film like this that is addressing a serious subject, assisted suicide but trying to have it both ways by giving it gloss of a Doris Day-Rock Hudson rom-com of the 1950s. The two leads both turn in fine performances and the manipulative writing and direction does, in the majority of viewers, attract the hoped-for tears but it would have been nice if we could lose the chocolate-box elements and trust the audience to respond to the situation rather than the budget."

I was super excited for this movie, and I guess I had high expectations for it as well.

","This movie was initially promising. I'm cramping it's a cold winter evening and raining outside I want a feel good movie. So I find this and the trailer is quite promising. The scenery and landscape just beautiful. The main character's outfits colourful (I would actually wear all that). She was great her attitude, her personality and positive outlook on everything. Her smile is just stunning, I actually didn't mind the crazy eyebrows lol. I think she's a beautiful girl and she portayed the character in excellent fashion. Not much comment on the other actors, she certainly stood out to me the most because her personality was as colourful as her outfits. It was great to see her bring Will out of his funk.<br/><br/>Loved the location too like I said great scenery, the castle was just amazing especially aerial views of it. The whole small town/village feel made me almost want to live there as well despite it seeming constantly cold. It was great.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, although it was great to see Will transition from a miserable meh (excuse my lack of better terminology), it was irritating to have him keep referring back to his old life. Everything was better when I had full use of my limbs and I was in Paris seated at a cafe and all the ladies paid attention to me and only me. Now I can't do that and other rich boy activities with my snobby friends (who marry my ex girlfriend) so life can't go on. How dare he then allow this poor young lady to fall in love and make her see in him someone she wants to be with. She was willing to change her life for him and then the nerve of him to tell her to find someone better. YOU ARE THE SOMEONE BETTER DUH and you feel the same way about me. If you claim you are the happiest you've been in a while since meeting me why then must you live me in perpetual anguish of losing someone that didn't have to die but chose to die anyways because his circumstances changed. It's clear his parents would do anything to ensure his happiness and he would have been able to live a full life despite being a paraplegic. Sure there's difficulties and that's understandable, I couldn't imagine having my life change like that. Nevertheless, it doesn't mean that it becomes impossible to live. Clearly in all the acivities he did with her it was possible to live just in an adapted way. But NOOOOOO homeboy was too caught up in his ""James Bond"" past.<br/><br/>I was very infuriated at the end of it. ABSOLUTELY INFURIATED and will be forever INFURIATED.

","'Me before you' based on the great female author book, Jojo Moyes, has impacted millions of viewers worldwide. Directed by Thea Sharrock as her forth work after 'Call the Midwife', one can call the movie 'a pinch of Moyes's book'. There are numerous fascinating facts about this movie that we can point to such as: the professional author, performing cast and decoration and costume design and etc, however, it let down many readers as they expected a masterpiece. There were numerous deletions in the movie which can lead to misunderstandings and wrong judgements. For instance, while one is reading the book, s/he is constantly bothered by the way Patrick treats Lou. Many book sections are removed which was dedicated to the Pat and Lou's relationship which let the reader sympathize with Lou and give her the full right to break up, however, in the movie, Lou just breaks up with Pat to be with Will. That was absolutely not fair. Plus, Georgina, Will's sister is removed with traces. Not only the deletion is irritating, but also the whole picture of a depressed quadriplegic rich kid, falling in love with a poor lively girl is a teenage drama. The question is what if Will was poor?! Did the whole thing happened at all?! Now that Will has decided to end his life, does Lou help any other person with this condition just for the sake of it?! The hero and the heroine of the both film and the book lacked glorifying characteristics despite the director and authors attempts to show them unique. Although, Lou and Will were no supposed to be the role model of the world, they could broaden their horizons apart from their own small self. 
The traces of Moyes emotional style of writing can be vividly observed in the movie specially the way, awesome Ellie Clarke appears as Lou and handsome Sam Claflin as Will. While book is unable to present its readers with live images, movie makes it a piece of cake. The use of colors in the movie transmits the full sense of emotion which is provoked while reading the book. Lou's house is full of emotions, life and color while the Traynor's house is just a cold building which is later brighten up by Lou. The great costumes also represent Lou only through vision. However, no one can deny the fact that an author, in comparison to a director, has more time to elaborate on the story and break the limits and this justifies the claim that a film is weaker than a book despite the fact that technology is making it easy day by day to produce noble films."

","I recently saw ã€ŠMe before youã€‹by Thea Sharrock is a romantic drama film which was produced by New line Cinema/Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer/Sunswept Entertainment,and lasted 110 minutes. This movie is set in 2016 in the US.It tells the story of Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin,played by Steve Peacocke/Jenna Coleman/Janet Mcteer/Charles Dance/Mathew Lewis/Emilia Clarke/Sam Claflin.The Story begins of Will Traynor, an energetic young man from the U.K. Will is a man who lives to the extreme, going off to exotic places, climbing Mounts. However, one day he suffered an accident when a motorcycle hits him before he got into a taxi. The accident left him quadriplegic; for two years, Will had to endure countless doctors appointments and suffers from constant pain. The accident cost him his girlfriend, his home (since it was not wheelchair accessible), and his old life. Tired of the pain he's going through, Will tells his parents that he would like an appointment with a doctor in Switzerland that would ensure the end of his pain. At first their parents are horrified and against the decision their son has decided on, but when he decides to take his own life, they ultimately agreed, if he gave them six more months. He accepted. Later, his mother hires a second caregiver to take care of Will when their primary caregiver is unavailable. Louisa Clark, a recently unemployed twenty-six-year old interviews for this job. Louisa had no experience in the care giving field, but she is a pleasant quirky human being and Camilla Traynor hopes that she would change Will's mind.Louisa was never informed that her job was to make sure that Will didn't kill himself, but she finds out after overhearing a conversation. She was devastated and decided to quit her job, but Camilla begs Louisa to return. She accepts on the one condition that if she's going to change Will's mind that it would affect his own health. Louisa later began thinking of ways to help Will have a great life in the world considering that he's a quadriplegic. She began by taking Will off on short outings and they also went on vacation to Mauritius. During their vacation, Louisa confessed that she was in love with Will and that they could have a life together. He said no and he assured her that he wasn't changing his mind about visiting the doctor in Switzerland. Devistated, Louisa left Will by himself on the beach. Louisa went back home and spent days locked in her room, days later she decides to go to Switzerland before Will kills himself. There Will tells Louisa that the past six months were the best in his life, but it wouldn't change his mind. Louisa kisses him and later Will Traynor is dead. Sometime later, Louisa sits at a table in Paris, where she reads a letter from her sister and then she holds on a letter written by Will. The letter had instructions that she had to visit a Parfumeur and that he left her some money in which she could use to make her life better. He hopes that she lives well; Louisa cries and gets up to fulfill Will's final wish. I Personally think it's very poignant film and very good casting .

","Well I like the romcom genre and this started off looking good. <br/><br/>Clarkes big big grin and big big eyebrows did actually work in this poor girl takes a job to look after rich, handsome, throughly disabled and suicidal guy Will Traynor (Claflin) <br/><br/>The story had the potential for an lot of depth. Traynor plans to go to Switzerland to be euthanised but promised his parents to wait 6 months to see if his outlook on his life (such as it was) changes. Clarke is brought in as a minder/suicide watch person. <br/><br/>There are issues that the film could have covered, much much better, rich versus poor, euthanasia, disability etc <br/><br/>I couldn't help but wonder if the roles were reversed, i.e. the poor person was the wheel chair bound quadroplegic. ? But no that would be far too miserable. <br/><br/>Instead the makers chose to go for cheesy and safe mushy love story, where even the poor, aren't that poor, etc. A rather Disney wash on what could have been a serious but funny, tragic thought provoking movie. <br/><br/>The acting was OK but I could not say anyone stuck out as great. If I had to pick anyone, it was Stephen Peacock as the male nurse. He did give an air of gritty reality to what otherwise ends as Mills & Boon romantic slush. <br/><br/>Watch once, probably twice if you feel like a good old Mills & Boon boo hoo, don't forget your tissues."

An ordinary girl fell in love with a rich handsome paralyzed guy. <br/><br/>Rich guy, Will had a bad temper from his car accident paralyzed; an optimist girl became his home aid.

They experienced new things from each other, started wheelchair adventures, they were in love. <br/><br/>Then the story turned into the rich guy wanted a marcy killing. The marcy killing was his original plan because he couldn't find his life meaning after paralyzed. It is ironic, he wanted to die even after he said he is in love again.<br/><br/>He didn't want to live because of a paralyzed body. He born to be rich, grow to be handsome and tall, all these appearance gave him the confidence, and abilities to play around. He can't bear to live as a pitiful paralyzed patient in others eyes. He couldn't find his meaning to live, even 'true love' can't help. <br/><br/>I put a quotation marks on true love because I don't think Will was really in love with a normal girl, he probably just attracted to her energy body.<br/><br/>Anyway I don't like this dead end, so passive.

"estreet-eva","6","1","3","6 March 2017"," Enjoyable manipulative
","The weepy ""Me Before You"" stars Sam Clafin, an actor so photogenic had movies not been invented before his birth, they surely would have developed once he hit puberty just so he had some way of sharing how handsome he is. Thewestchestarian wonders how he didn't get the ""50 Shades of Grey"" lead ahead of dead-on-the-inside Jamie Dornan. Sam also brings a delightful ""English-ness"" to the role overshadowing the Campbell Scott original ""Dying Young"". Despite her London upbringing Emilia Clarke (please consider that final ""e"" when pronouncing her surname Americans) doesn't bring that same underlying seriousness and gravitas that English actors contribute. The two work well together although you can see Clafin dictating the relationship and Clarke reacting to him more than acting. The story they act in is a bit what you would expect. Will's life basically went from the top of human experience to some area below average although he remains very wealthy and can afford every accommodation a quadriplegic could ask for. He deals with justifiable anger and suicidal thoughts which ""Lou"" holds eases but ultimately doesn't relieve. Any interesting aspect of the story is the personal growth Lou undergoes through her association with Will and, perhaps to a greater degree, his upper crust wealthy family. The movie doesn't shy away from the obvious class differences in English society. In short, you largely know where the story is headed and much of the direction is aimed at jerking forth tears but it is worth the ride."
"thing4m4jig","6","1","3","5 March 2017"," Love conquers all - or does it?
","This film shook me quite a bit. <br/><br/>And I might be a chick, but usually I'm not one for chick flicks. They can be good to pass the time. At their worst they're flat out offensive, using serious themes to pretend they're more than they really are. Like the misery of the Third World - see 'Beyond Borders"". Or cancer, see ""The Fault In Our Stars"". <br/><br/>So when I hear of a chick flick dealing with war or death or sickness, that's what I fear. Flat, mindless characters that are there just to fall in love in spite of everything, because, you know, love conquers all. <br/><br/>But for one: for all you could say about Emilia Clarke, she's never flat. She's lovely. She's a top-notch actress, and I can't imagine anyone who would give this role this much warmth and steadiness. People like Lou - grown-up children, with both childlike innocence and more wisdom than the rest of us - are a rare breed, but they do exist, and she captured this perfectly. Her eyebrows are a gift from god. <br/><br/>She was the first good thing about ""Me Before You"". I still wouldn't remember much of it if it wasn't for the second one - the ending. I've read a couple of reviews for this film and people seem to get the ""live boldly"" slogan as its message. They miss the fact that it's also a movie that debates assisted suicide. And actually argues in favor of it. As a person who has gone through a debilitating illness, I appreciate the fact that it doesn't maintain that any life is worth living or something along those lines. This is something that only people who don't know the first thing about being sick can state - and that I see mainstream cinema argue much too often. <br/><br/>I still don't think it's a good movie. I give it a 6, because most of it is calculated just to repeat the success of ""The Fault In Our Stars"" and such. But there was something visceral in it that cracked through the Hollywood facade and that cracked me in turn, because I didn't expect it there. <br/><br/>Watch it, somehow it's worth it."
"robert-temple-1","10","1","3","13 November 2016"," Sensitive, uplifting and funny, but also heart-breaking
","This romantic film pulls all the heart-strings, and it is impossible not to respond enthusiastically to the overwhelming charm of the young actress Emilia Clarke, who infuses the entire film with her warmth, humour, and quirkiness. Apparently she is well known from GAME OF THRONES, but that kind of thing is 'not my scene' and I would never watch it. So for me this girl is one big delightful surprise. The film is a triumphant first feature film by director Thea Sharrock, best known for her affiliations with William Shakespeare and the wonderful Shakespeare's Globe Theatre in London. She certainly has a big cinematic career ahead of her, because she has made a film which is so finely directed, sensitive, and well-balanced that any producer with a grain of sense must be chasing her now. The film is also the first written by, as well as based on a novel by, a woman quaintly named Jojo Moyes. It is difficult to imagine a man either writing or directing a film like this, so we are fortunate that women took over and made the movie. Even the producers were women. Well done, gals! Actress Janet McTeer is also excellent, as usual, having now become very much a 'national treasure'. And then there is Sam Claflin (his surname Claflin being a truncated form of the original McLaughlin, abbreviated by a forebear in America, where everything gets shortened). I have already praised Sam Claflin before, for his brilliant performance as the young Logan in the wonderful TV series ANY HUMAN HEART (2010, see my review). Here he is once again brilliant. All that talent in someone who can barely move! Yes, Claflin plays a man who is paralyzed in all his limbs after he is struck by a motorbike in the street. Since this is based on a romantic novel, it is necessary for Claflin to live in a huge castle, which he obligingly does. And it is equally necessary for Emilia Clarke to being a Cinderella figure, which she certainly is, with gusto. She is hired by Claflin's mother, Janet McTeer, to look after Claflin and try to cheer him up, as he sits daily in his electric wheelchair which he can operate with his one hand which has some capability of movement. Meanwhile he has resolved to go to Dignitas in Switzerland and end his life by monitored suicide, and the question arises as to whether Emilia Clarke can stop this, for she eventually falls in love with him. This is where things get difficult for me, because a very dear friend of mine went to Dignitas and allowed his suicide to be filmed for television. He only had two weeks left before his motor neurone disease would render him unable to make the trip, having delayed as long as he dared. His wife sat beside him while he drank the poison. I made a speech at his memorial service. These events are very painful, and tragedies of this kind are nothing to treat lightly. In this film, the matter is handled with great sensitivity, which was not an easy thing to do. I shall not reveal what happens about this in the story because one is not supposed to for IMDb. Also appearing in the film as Claflin's father is Charles Dance, who is very good as usual. I can rarely watch him without wincing slightly at my recollections of his ex-wife at Crickleaze trying to knock me out during her boxing practise in the middle of their drawing room. One takes risks sometimes visiting people and trying to be an obliging guest. This film too involves some risk for viewers, who may need a 'safe space', because of its 'beautiful sadness'. But it is a marvellous success, and a very fine film indeed."
"Bored_Dragon","6","1","3","17 October 2016"," Enjoyable, if you do not think about what you see...
","I've heard so much glorification of this movie, that I was eager to watch it as soon as possible and enjoy its magnificence, but then... disappointment on many levels. To be clear, this movie is not a crap, but it's just slightly different from high budget South- American soap opera with Hollywood production.<br/><br/>Acting is satisfying, scenery and landscapes are sometimes breathtaking and production is on the level. That would be all I can commend.<br/><br/>Story... This movie doesn't have ""o"" of originality and it is predictable from opening scene to ending credits. There's no single surprise or twist. Everything in it has been already seen and thoroughly verified Hollywood clichÃ©s are carefully wrapped in decorative paper.<br/><br/>Will is successful businessman from wealthy family who ends up in wheelchair after traffic accident. On that fateful day he would go to work on motorbike, but his wealthy and beautiful blonde stops him. Same second he gave up on his motorbike I was sure what will happen next. While he was crossing the street on his foot he was hit by, you won't believe this, motorbike. Of course, in this type of story, the one in wheelchair is usually male and rich and he hires someone poor to care for him. At the beginning he is cold and grumpy, but in time he starts to show his warmer side. Am I the only one who saw ""The Intouchables"" ?! Slight touch of ""Beauty and the Beast"" maybe ?! Though here we have poor girl that gave up on higher education to take care of her family, instead of black petty criminal. She irresistibly reminds me of ""Ugly Betty""...<br/><br/>Wills relationship with his blonde falls apart after the accident and she marries his best friend. His new caretaker is seven years in relationship with egocentric sportsman until time with Will opens her eyes and she realizes she is not happy, so she falls in love with Will. Author is trying to catch us on cheap pathetic...<br/><br/>Characterization is lousy. We see two-dimensional characters who are not well developed, not even close. How did Will win her love ?! What is that she falls for ?! Fact that he is good looking and rich ?! I doubt author had intention to send that message, but except for his looks and money we see no other positive sides of Will. She gets money from his parents and organizes luxury dates and travels in attempt to awake desire to live in Will... or maybe she provides herself a chance to experience things she could only dream about before she got access to his money... I understand what author wanted to present, but also I can not stop myself from seeing what's obvious. I did not make up any of this. I just point out the obvious.<br/><br/>They go out, they travel exotic destinations, they fall in love. Will has good time with his new girl, she loves him unconditionally, he is offered to get back to his job, his family provides full support, and he is rich. But that's not worth living and he decides he should kill himself. Yes, he planned this way before he met her, but not even love of his life can change his decision. What message does it send to us ?!<br/><br/>That people with disabilities are useless, dead burden to their surroundings, that they have nothing to give, professionally or emotionally, that good job, supporting family and true love are not worth living for ?! Somehow Stephen Hawking pops up in my mind...<br/><br/>Sure, no one can stops you from killing yourself, but having health institution to help you ?! If you are in continuous unbearable pain and your life comes down just to pure survival in endless agony... then maybe.<br/><br/>But let's ignore moral dilemmas and stay in limits of this movie. If you already decided to kill yourself and nothing, not even true love, can make you change your mind, why the hell did you mislead innocent girl, give her false hope and broke her long term relationship, just to make her sucker at the end and leaver her emotionally destroyed... That seem selfish and cruel to me.<br/><br/>At wedding, on the dance floor, he openly admitted that before his accident he would never noticed girl like her, let alone fell in love with her. And after accident his life is so worthless that even their true love is not worth living. Somewhere I saw that perfectly put in one sentence. ""I cannot live and love you because I refuse to live and love as any other man than the man I was; however, if I were the man I was, I would not have loved you."" But she does not mind.<br/><br/>And so on, they fall in love, the time has come to go, she gives up her believing and needs and escorts him on last voyage. Movie ends with epilogue. He is dead and he left her with fat bank account (and she did not even had to get married) and a letter that sends her to Paris, his favorite place on Earth, with detailed instruction where to go and what to look for. ""P.S. I Love You""... anyone ?!<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, movie is more than watchable. After reading my review you would probably think that 6/10 is too high. But if you avoid to analyze, just grab your popcorn and sit comfortably in your sofa to watch the screen with half a brain, you will enjoy two hours of stereotyped Hollywood romance drama, and maybe it will even make you laugh or cry once or twice..."

I went out shocked about casting because I was used to see him as Finnick and she was something like -I've seen her before but not sure where..., won't tell you exactly because she has a great looked change after her previous work, specially her colorful role in this movie. The story itself, it's well a known one, with some modern notes that brings it close to our reality and I meant it because her boyfriend style of man, any similarity with someone you know it's on purpose, how she reacts to that leaves room for discussion undoubtedly. The sister paper is key to her decision making process, kind of a fairy role. Landscape and situations spots are a must have for the story as usual requirement of a love comedy, also completely covered the steps of such an illness and character reactions to it, technology is also a fundamental key on this part. I proudly say, I almost cried at some point, despite I knew I would and resisted to, and that's exactly why I recommend this movie."

The movies and art in general teach us the best of who we were meant to be in the first place. It is a sad movie if we take it from the perspective we are used to look at life. But, if we are able to get beyond all the ""happy ever after"" and understand that life is just a passage in the most truthful way it is supposed to be seen we understand that the very concept of the movie is showing us the best we can do with our lives. Everything is meant to last just for a while and we should do the best with what we have... That's all life is about. If there is something after it it's just an unexpected prize or incentive.

","Yes, this cruel and harsh review does contain spoilers, stop reading any further if you have not seen this movie. Otherwise proceed. <br/><br/>Look, I love romantic movies to end the way I like books to end, with that happy feel good ever after and together forever style. I stay away from movies and books that end otherwise, for me movies and books have always been a way for me to escape the real world. Real life doesn't always have happy endings that's why there are books and movies to offer escape from such times. <br/><br/>So how did I end up watching this particular film? My dad picked it out, he wanted to see what it was about. When I heard the word Switzerland come up I had this feeling in my stomach that it was going to be one of those movies where the hero and heroine weren't going to get their happily ever after. I looked it up online and sure enough I was right. I didn't spoil it for my dad and kept my mouth shut, but for me I was loathing the film from then on out. Why is Hollywood glamorizing suicide? It's a coward's way out. To think there is no other option, no possible hope for a better life. It's selfish, which makes the title appropriate, he was definitely thinking of himself before her and what she was willingly offering to him. To open yourself up to love like that is not always easy and to love someone the way she did, most people shy away from it because it does take a lot of work. William could have chosen a life with Lou, sure there would have been hard times, but like she said in the movie he wasn't even giving her a chance. What a way to say I love you, 'you're just not enough of a reason for me to live on.' Aces. <br/><br/>Sorry, but I'm not going to recommend this movie to others. Ball was dropped on what had so much potential for being a spectacular film with a tremendous love story."

I know, I know....films are never as good as the books....but WoW! This was shocking! There are lots that can't be put into a film that are in a book, but if you're going to go to the trouble and the expense to make a film, do the author justice. So much was left out of the film. Lou's sister played a large part in the books, but she was hardly present. Patrick, as annoying as he was in the books, was a complete arse in the film and it felt like that was done on purpose....I have no idea why...to make Will seem more likable? Bizarre! Large parts of the film would not have made sense without having read the book - .e.g the holiday of a lifetime that Lou had to cancel. There was NO mention of it at all!

The story tells of a young woman who struggles to find consistent employment to help her family and is employed by a wealthy son of an English family that was paralyzed after being struck by a motorbike in the street. Emilia Clarke continues to attempt to branch out from her starring role in the hit HBO series Game of Thrones and the failure of Terminator Genisys and plays Lou Clark.

She sports her natural brown hair in place of the Targaryen blonde in which she achieved her fame. Claflin is moody and sarcastic as he is upset with his circumstances. The supporting cast included Charles Dance who unfortunately will never encounter Emilia Clarke in the world of Westeros but runs on and off the screen for a few parts here as Will's father. Janet McTeer plays Will's mother who hires Lou to take care of her son.

I know what it's like to go through disabilities and chronic pain and different situations to where you want to end your life. At one time it was so bad in my early twenties, I did try to in my life. Thank God I did not succeed at it. Even today times are tough but I have a strong support system! I made a pact with my sisters, brother and my son that I would never try to take the easy way out of here again. And there's no way in hell my family, my mother especially would stand and let me say Mom after 6 months... Let me die! No way in hell that's happening. So I tried to watch this movie from everybody's perspective. And I understand why so many gave it at 10, I understand why so many gave it a one down to zero. I gave it a 5 because I like the movie half and half ! The love and caring that others had for this man was beautiful and yes I agree he was most selfish on his end, At the same time, I understand that is his choice and his right. Do I agree with his choice? NO I DO NOT. To me love conquers all. And I also agree it does send a message out ""unintentionally I'm sure"" that if you're disabled, or not as you used to be, your life isn't worth living. That is simply NOT TRUE! If that were the case, I would have been gone a long time ago. If you want to make movies like this, send better messages, especially to young viewers. People that are disabled are discriminated against enough. I even have a special needs son who's 22 and there's no way I will ever tell him he's not equal. There's nothing he can't do! Even if he has to do things different then so be it. Love life, live life! So many people wish they could have and could not. Bless all those who are disabled and feel like they don't want to go on at times. You can go on and you should!!

"Mike_Devine","4","1","4","4 July 2017"," Claflin and Clarke waste their talents in 'Me Before You'
","Schlocky, sappy romantic dramas are a dime a dozen nowadays, and most of them follow a similar story line, just swapping out a few elements, circumstances and characters. In 'Me Before You,' we get to know the story of a young man named Will Trainer who loses his sense of freedom due to an accident that leaves him paralyzed (Sam Claflin), and a young unemployed woman named Lou who gets a job as his caretaker (Emilia Clarke).<br/><br/>As expected, 'You' is as formulaic as they come. At the outset, Will and Lou are at odds with each other, but they soon begin to tolerate and then love each other, and then a wrench gets thrown into things before everything ends melodramatically. While that is the general flow of events, there is a hope that something about the film is differentiated from the rest of what we've seen before. Unfortunately, that is not the case.<br/><br/>As solid as Claflin and Clarke have been in other work, they come across as hollow, wooden and appear to be less skilled actors than we all know they are. There are some supporting performances from Janet McTeer and Charles Dance that are okay, but they are nothing to really write home about. So, when the plot is below average and the acting is forgettable, it's hard for a film to be enjoyable unless there is are amazing visual effects, soundtrack, etc. While the best element of 'You' is its soundtrack, this is not enough to carry the film.<br/><br/>If you like film adaptations of Nicholas Sparks novels (and this is not one of those, but it sure feels like one), then you will probably enjoy 'Me Before You.' If not, resist the temptation to give it a chance."

The movie banks on an unvarying jocular theme with witty conversations and gradually budding love. All of it tries hard to put romance in perspective. However, in its blithe tone Me Before You overlooks a fair chunk of gloom that necessitated a part of vantage that was crucial in nailing the bond between its characters.<br/><br/>CHOICE OF CHARACTERS <br/><br/>Sam Claflin fits like a glove into Will Traynor's character, and there is nothing that you don't like about his demeanor. Emilia Clarke, au contraire, beams so much that it sometimes becomes too much. Her face doesn't look concerned, rather oddly in sync with the mirthful theme of the movie. It leaves her as a slit open flaw. Her way too much expressive countenance does create a different character altogether, no doubt, but it leaves her scampered in a gravity-deficient world.<br/><br/>Me Before You belies despair and tries to wrap it all in the hilarity of Lou's life, when the truth is a lot more darker, meaner and horrible. It is good that we don't see the ending upfront from our pedestal. The culminating point of the movie is very plausible and that's what tries to help it get back onto the saddle again. It avoids hitting those shallow waters again.<br/><br/>PLOT OF ME BEFORE YOU (SPOILERS AHEAD) <br/><br/>The novel by Jojo Moyes finds Thea Sharrock to define it within boundaries of time. Though the screenplay is pushed more by humour, there is little that it feeds us on depth. A mishap leaves Will Traynor paralyzed that renders him useless. In another world Lou Clark struggles to find a job after her thread's cut. She lands one by chance, as the caretaker of the affluent Will. What gradually develops from thereon is written in happy feels, where she toils hard to bring Will back into the world of the living. But the pointlessness of it all nibbles at his soul, and despite all the good times he gets to live with Lou, he chooses euthanasia.<br/><br/>The score of the movie is abounding with songs. Aptly put at various intervals. But you begin to feel its banality when there are less thoughtful notes sputtered.<br/><br/>THE FINAL VERDICT <br/><br/>Me Before You's story remains a gorgeous one nevertheless. Putting yourself before someone selflessly is worth an ovation. The fact that love can happen at unusual places lets us have faith in it. That's what counts."
"SnoopyStyle","6","1","4","18 November 2016"," sappy romance
","Louisa ""Lou"" Clark (Emilia Clarke) makes a cup of tea to solve every problem. She's 26, living at home with her mother, unemployed father, senile grandpa, sister Treena (Jenna Coleman), and Treena's son Tom. She loses her waitress job and the family needs her to get another job. Her boyfriend Patrick is more interested in running than interested in her. The Traynors are the rich family in town and the former lords of the castle. Camilla Traynor (Janet McTeer) hires her for six months to assist her paralyzed son Will Traynor (Sam Claflin) who was run over by a motorcycle two years ago. Will is bitter at losing his globe-trotting outgoing lifestyle with his girlfriend Alicia and high-finance friends. He is cold to the quirky Lou at first. Alicia announces that she's getting married to his former best friend. Then Lou overhears Camilla arguing with her husband Stephen (Charles Dance) about Will's plan to get euthanized in Switzerland in six months. Lou struggles to give Will a reason for living as male nurse Nathan helps her to understand his pain.<br/><br/>This is a sappy romance. There's nothing wrong with that but it's really uninspired in its execution. The best thing in this movie is Emilia Clarke being allowed to be her natural goofy-grin self. This version of her is really charming and winning. The infuriating part is Will's refusal to live his new life. Nathan explains that Will really tried the first year and that he's hiding his painful existence from Lou. The movie does not do a good job portraying that idea and therefore leaves Will's reasoning bare-thread. They need a scene where Will is actively trying to hide his pain. His reason cannot be a lack of a James Bond lifestyle."

","Not a bad movie per se but a little too thin on depicting the more thorny aspects. I can see why some found reason to get annoyed about the aspect of the girl winning ""Big time"" from him having so much money and being able to help her (hey I used a DT adjective for those on the wrong side of the Atlantic). <br/><br/>Her choice of a rich paraplegic makes it too tidy. The burdens on the characters were conveniently just of a personal attachment dynamic. The truth is that for most paraplegics the carers are also often suffering a great deal and not just emotionally. They could be exhausted physically, emotionally, socially excluded and even financially depleted. <br/><br/>It could have more interesting if it had been realistically complex. One person may have selfish reasons for even wanting him to die. There could be many push-pull factors from both the paraplegic perspective and from the motive/emotions of their friends and family and even layers within this. The film is quite planar. So flat and uncomplicated that it really doesn't live up to the potential of a good thought provoking story.<br/><br/>What annoyed was how it sanitised, trivialised and glossed over the issues related to being paralysed. It was a bit too fluffy. I am not saying the director should have Ken Loach'd it and I am pretty sure the director didn't intend to preach, ""educate"" or takes sides but there were some obvious and probably deliberate omissions that if they had been included could have made the story more compelling.<br/><br/>It puzzles me why the director has so deliberately glossed over nearly the nitty gritty bits. The scene where Lou sees the bathroom commode chair and her body language says she is shocked by the implications of this equipment. This much rings true.<br/><br/>When she asks the nurse ""What if he needs to..???""(crap) she is rescued by the the male nurse who says ""no.. don't worry, your not here to do any of the physical stuff'.. almost like the director was copping-out of dealing with all those issues and telling us so at the beginning.<br/><br/>By not facing any of these issues in any depth the audience are never in the least enlightened about the plethora of ""little problems"" that add up to despair. The fact he is extremely rich and handsome enables the director to ""compartmentalise"" these issues and to shelve the more difficult subjects. For most carers there are very limited ""resources"". Carers, usually spouses, have to deal with everything from medication to changing diapers. What about if the genders were reversed and the person paralysed was a woman!<br/><br/>Paralysis and consequential heath issues. Anyone who has experience of being a carer will know that if you cannot move yourself it can lead to bedsores and other problems related to immobility. The nurse mentions some of the body's regulatory issues but not any of the other day to day stuff. <br/><br/>These issues could have been a very good counterpoint to her naive ""can I make tea"" question. Only once do you see her adjusting his pillow. I am sure his buttocks would have been much more sore than his neck! A paralysed person who can feel but not move their legs may need them to be moved constantly just as we constantly adjust ours when we are sitting.<br/><br/>Daily Routines <br/><br/>He is always seen in a bed or the wheelchair. What about cleaning his teeth, washing, eating, shitting, drinking, or just trying to get comfortable there is plenty of room for humour and depth in these subjects that could have added to portraying the suffering that a paralysed person faces.<br/><br/>Among the matters not portrayed is how hard it is to get dressed, to be washed, the complete lack of privacy in going to the toilet etc. Even the period of adjustment from the time of the injury to having no privacy at all and having to be washed and dressed by strangers or even worse by an exhausted and frustrated spouse. <br/><br/>Unhelpful Advice The was very lightly covered by the boyfriend offering advice on physiotherapy. Over the past 12 years I have had advice from so many well wishing people who have heard of a ""miracle"" cure, a relative who had a remarkable recovery from the ""same condition"", and so on and so on. Even I have done the same to others it is in our human nature to want to help but boy does it get depressing to be on the receiving end of often useless advice. One matter was dealt with subtly and quite well was the issue of people talking over the person in the wheelchair as though they were deaf or incapable of deciding anything for themselves.<br/><br/>Social Capital ""Mother, Please don't speak over me. I am can speak for myself"". This very lightly covers the issue of the potential for a vastly diminished social capital. Not being able to get out and about and contribute to any project or engage in activities with your able bodied friends slowly isolates you. This is hinted at by the issue of the previous girlfriend but again not dealt with in any depth.<br/><br/>Euthanasia, the ""right to choose? When you are dealing with a subject as sensitive and as unexplored in cinema as this, I think it comes with some sort of burden of responsibility. In this matter I think the film has missed many opportunities and almost trivialised the core subject in the process. The parents are very well educated and liberal too easy. What if he were married and had a religious wife? More complex alternative scenarios would have made this more thought provoking.<br/><br/>Overall it is a well manicured but very Hollywood no-brainer type movie which doesn't really do anything to educate or stimulate thoughtful discussion in the general able- bodied public."

","The film was not bad, but nor was it anything new. It was by the numbers, with a script that could just as well have been written in the 60s (and at times it felt so)<br/><br/>The biggest stars of the film are, of course, Emilia Clarke's eyebrows. I dare anyone to give me any other reason why they chose to see the movie. Either it was Khaleesi or maybe Dr. Who's companion that drew you to watch it. It certainly weren't the 5 seconds of screen time that Charles Dance had and it wasn't the age old story of the poor girl that falls in love with the quadriplegic prince.<br/><br/>While the film ends on a bitter sweet note, I didn't find it terribly entertaining, while the characters had an infantile morality that made me unable to relate to any of them.

","It's sappy, and forgettable. So much so, that I watched this movie about 10 days ago, and I am having a really really really hard time figuring out what the movie was about. That tells you how memorable it is (not). Me Before you is the story of a girl in a small town that forms an unlikely bond with a recently-paralyzed man she's taking care of. He is dreadful to deal with in the beginning, but the girl needs a salary and the guy is really well off. So she sticks it out, and surprisingly enough, the man opens up little by little to her. Soon they find themselves behaving as if they were inseparable. I again have to admit, I remember little more about it, so I give it a 5 due to indecisiveness."

","The concept of a caregiver forming an unlikely bond with a quadriplegic man who has suffered an accident. And in a wonderfully humorous and unsentimental way both the French ""Intouchables"" and ""Me before You"" give a warm peek into what can happen if the right caregiver accidentally (pardon the pun) comes along. And Emilia Clarke is absolutely disarmingly charming as the Bridget-Jones-clumsy girl with the funny clothes and the big heart. However, where Intouchables have a slightly dark undertone, which gives more facets to the plot, ""Me before You"" becomes a little too much of a banal love story (in spite of the subject of euthanasia). I was entertained, but the film certainly lacked some ""je ne sais quoi""."

","So Will looks nowhere near a real quad. Two years after the accident, he's still buff, healthy looking and wayyy to happy to be a depressed man who wants to go to Dignitas. They couldn't even bother to make him look less like a marathon man?<br/><br/>Clarke is just way too animated and silly most of the time, I'm really bummed out they didn't make more deep characters and challenged the actors. And she's supposed to be poor right? For a part of the book she's the sole provider of both her parents and granddad and she's still walking in really fancy detailed and hard to get outfits. Yes the book points out her colorful clothes, but these film makers appear to have no idea what you'd really look like if you're poor. or maybe they do and they're pressured into never making a chick flick that is realistic! Ugh makes me so pissed! It's like watching Sex and the City where they magically are just wealthy, because who wants to look at poor people?<br/><br/>The book delves pretty good into the miserable life of being depressed and paralyzed - but this book doesn't even scratch the surface.<br/><br/>It just feels like a money movie - to quickly go over all the events in the book and none of the actual emotion.<br/><br/>Urgh I'm so disappointed."
"soulshine-84507","1","1","5","25 July 2018"," Skip the movie and read the book.
","Not to sound cliche but the book is so much better than the movie. 
I've read the book twice; year's apart and I loved the emotion that it brought out in me both times. The first time reading it, I hated Will Traynor at the end because I thought he was some selfish prick who was accustomed to getting his way and couldn't see the beauty amongst the ugly. The second time reading it, I empathized with Will Traynor and realized I was being the selfish one.
The book makes you confront the right to die decision from the perspective of many characters and you feel for each one. I cried, laughed, felt anger and many other emotions. In my opinion that's a sign of a great book.<br/><br/>Too bad the movie didn't bring out the same emotions. The storyline was flat, the characters boring; with the actress playing Louisa Clark being downright annoying. It was as if she was forcing herself to be Lou Clark. Trust me, the Louisa Clark in the book isn't so cheesy. 
Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke also had no onscreen chemistry so you never get to feel the depths of how their relationship develops.
The movie also leaves out details from the book that are important for both the character(s) and story and adds scenes that are completely unnecessary.
In the book Louisa Clarks family isn't so cheery about their financial woes which is one reason why we see Louisa Clark not stray far from home so she can financially help her family. Another reason being the ""maze incident"", a scene the movie left out. <br/><br/>To wrap it up, if you want to really get the meaning of the book and a more in depth feel of the characters skip the movie and read the book."

It tried to be touching, but it wasn't whatsoever. and the soundtrack was bad, i love ed sheeran, but using such popular songs kind of ruins it, and ''photograph''didn't fit in that scene at all, and that romantic comedy type of music didn't help. Some of the camera work felt odd as well.

"yumitakuma","1","2","16","19 September 2016"," The worst romantic comedy drama movie I've ever seen!
","As a fan of romantic comedy drama movie, the story is way too predictable. It was like a typical genre of Asian films but without originality. The plot is way too simple. Add a script on how they met then you just add the sad part. The end. The story composition is too effortless, easy and plain. Also, the major problem in the whole movie was the acting of Emilia Clarke — it was way too cringey. I'm sorry but I think she needs more practice for being an adorable jolly clumsy gal. I literally skipped the part where she acts that way because I really can't take it or watch it. Her eyebrows won't make any difference, you know? Even my eyebrows were almost stuck together while watching her. That kind of appearance and attitude are so common in Japanese anime and manga; and Emilia Clarke has the worst impression. I wanted to ask the producers of this boring and uncomfortable movie: why did they picked Emilia Clarke to play Louisa Clark? Just because she's famous? How obtuse. The movie has good places, a nice atmosphere, the lighting was perfect, and the other casts are talented. They did an awesome job. Yet, on how the heroine portrays her role was so unadorned, undecorated and will really make you feel awkward or uneasy. I don't hate Emilia Clarke but I really love romcom movies. I love how romcom drama movies play my emotions. It made me laugh, giggle with cheesiness, fall in love with the characters and cry. But this movie is so terrible. I feel very sorry for Sam Claflin. Too bad, he was good."

","I wanted so badly to like this film, but Emilia Clarkes facial expressions ruined what could have been a lovely piece of cinema.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Jojo Moyes, Me Before You is a supposed ""unconventional love story"" about a wealthy paralysed man and his relationship with newly-employed carer, Louisa.<br/><br/>My first criticism about this is..eyebrows. Emilia Clarke is a poor actress who seems to only be able to convey any sort of emotion with her eyebrows and goofy smiles. In some scenes she is over-acting to the point of making me cringe. It meant that any realism of the film was totally ruined. In fact, the character of Louisa on the whole was unlikeable, unrealistic and un-relatable. She is supposedly from a working-class family and has little money. Though wears expensive looking clothes, lives in a beautiful area and is extremely eloquent. She came across as nothing more than a middle-class, ""woe-me, I'm so quirky and misunderstood"" girl.<br/><br/>Secondly is Will Traynor, Initially he is a cold character who treats Louisa with disrespect. But as the story unfolds he becomes warmer and more likable.<br/><br/>All in all, Me Before You isn't terrible, it has some lovely moments and has stunning scenery. It is worth watching but the poor cast sadly lets it down."
"kastellos","5","1","6","20 September 2016"," An over-rated old story
","This movie benefited by the ""halo effect"" of ""Game of Thrones"" (Clarke) and ""Hunger Games"" (Clafin) because it is not really a good movie. IMDb readers rated it a 7.5 but I don't understand why, so I assume it is because everyone loves ""Game of Thrones"" and ""Hunger Games"" and the actors in them (except for me). Ms Clarke is annoying; the movie is overly long, it is predictable, and I have little sympathy for any of the characters. Clarke does not stand up to her unemployed father and sister who wants Clarke to work to support the family so the sister can escape. And although Clafin is horribly injured and one should empathize with his plight, it is not easy to forget that he got injured soon after leaving his girl friend's bed and was hit by a motorcycle while absorbed by his smart phone while crossing the street. Moreover, he and his family have more money than Trump.<br/><br/>The story is an old one. Quirky young woman cares for person with physical problems. It was done much better in ""Dying Young,"" ""You're Not You"" and ""Passion Fish."" I recommend these three, especially the latter two and forget ""Me Before You."""

","I'm going to be cliché here and say as usual it's not as good as the book. <br/><br/>Emilia Clarke is a great actress but I just couldn't take her seriously with her crazy eyebrows. I understand in the book that she's a little over the top but it took any serious scenes away from what it should be focusing on. <br/><br/>The key element for me is that they left so much important information out. I know they have to cut it short but there is vital things that watchers should see. 1, There was no real pressure in the film from the parents to take the job as in the book the finances are so bad she has no option than to stick at it. 2, In the book, Will is very rude. Not just a little sarcastic as he is in the film, he is down right rude to Lou in the beginning and this should have been portrayed so you could see exactly how he changes and grows to love her. 3, it shows Will as being abit of a child pre accident with the daft video clip they played. In the book you grow to imagine him being somewhat of a Christian Grey sort of character... Very masculine and very important. He lived life to the brim and travelled the world. 4, it fails to mention that Will tried to kill himself prior to the agreement. It also fails to show Wills argument with reference to his decision. You begin to sympathise with him in the book as he has a vital argument. This doesn't shine through in the film. There is still so much anger with him in the book and this is lost. It totally skips when she reveals about the maze and when he opens up to tell her how scared he is of how his body will be. 5, Mrs Traynor doesn't take to Lou in the book. She's angry at Will. She's a soft character in the film and that's a shame. One of the reasons we take to Lou is that no matters what obstacles come in the situation she sticks with him. 6, finally, where the hell was the empathy in the Switzerland scene? This is meant to be the man she loves, but I couldn't see a single tear in the film. I bawled at the book because that love really shines through and how devastated she is that she has thrown her love at him and it still isn't enough. It could have been done with much more taste and got the viewers going a little more. <br/><br/>It's a bit of a shame as all the big names are there. And the book is great. Maybe it's the way it was directed or how it was written in the script. There was a lack of chemistry there for me with them both also which didn't help. I didn't feel like they were in love at all. <br/><br/>It's worth a watch if you haven't read the book,but if you have be prepared to be disappointed."

You should choose the way you want to live, even it' very hard to accept. I actually don't like any costumes for Emilia, except for a bee tight and mint glasses. A cameraman should be review himself how he destroyed that film by his stupid records, like while we need to see how characters feel each other, and thư viewer only can see their back.

","I don't usually write reviews, but I thought I would for this one. <br/><br/>My wife and I saw the trailer for this film months before it's release and were very excited to see it because the trailer makes it look like a very sweet love story. We were lied to.<br/><br/>I have not read the book and so I don't know how similar it is, nor do I know if this was based on a true story, but if the movie is representative of the book, I probably don't care to read it. <br/><br/>Why? Because this film is not a romance, nor is it a tragedy. It's a strange mix of both. The girl gets the guy, but not really. Here is what I mean: The story is all set up to be this cute romantic film where a girl comes to the rescue of a torn disabled man and they establish a relationship, fall in love, (sound like beauty and the beast?) and live happily ever after, right? WRONG! He has his mind set for killing himself because he lost the ability to do so much of what he loves. Instead of him fighting the odds and accepting his changes and living life the best he can, he gives up and ends his life and leaves the girl behind. WHAT THE F***?? Who does that?! I spent a long time as an aid for a disabled man and I had to feed him, dress him, brush his teeth, shower him and so forth, and I watched him go through a similar process. I don't know what it's like to live like that, and chances are, neither do you (the reader). However, I know what it's like to watch someone like that fall into a deep depression. I had to keep him from trying to kill himself every day. I get that it's hard. very hard. I get that it feels as though it would be better to die. But I do not believe that that is the answer. We love stories of hope and stories of triumph! They inspire us to beat the odds and to never give up. So if this was meant to be a true romance, I think he would have chosen to stay with her and have a wonderful life together. Let's say that they went with a true tragedy, then I think he outcome would have been different. <br/><br/>Anyway, I think it's a fun movie to watch, but it just ends in a terrible way. I think it would have been a huge improvement if they would have stayed together. Haters gunna hate, but that's just my opinion."

Me Before You is all about encouraging young adults to #LiveBoldly and share with the world what they value in life. Done in the fashion of The Fault in Our Stars and Paper Towns, this romantic book-to-film adaptation becomes this summer's great tearjerker.<br/><br/>It all starts with our male lead, 31-year-old William Traynor, played by Sam Claflin, who is living the great life of water skiing and high-diving. But then disaster strikes at the blink of an eye: he comes face to headlights with a motorcycle, and he becomes struck with a lifelong condition called Quadriplegia.<br/><br/>Quadriplegia is a condition that permanently paralyzes the spine, arms, and legs, causing all sorts of symptoms such as: Loss of bladder and bowel control Pressure sores Blood clots Respiratory problems Autonomic dysreflexia Muscle spasms. It is a very limiting condition that bounds you to a wheelchair and forces you to rely on others for aid in all the little things.<br/><br/>Here is when his new caretaker enters the picture. Will seems to be living fine in a wooden apartment with an assistant for his wheelchair, but he needs someone else to help with minor tasks such as eating and getting medications. Her name is Louisa Clark, played by Emilia Clarke. Louisa is 26 and desperate for work. This job requires no experience, so she is quick to accept the position.<br/><br/>Here is the film's greatest strength: the way the relationship between these two is developed. Both players are beyond exceptional in their roles. Emilia puts on the sweetest, most adorable facial expressions—watching her wide smile and nervous eyebrows will leave you tumbling in laughter. Sam isn't as strong as his co-lead, but he beautifully contrasts from her lively, exotic personality with his slow, Debbie downer attitude which gradually opens up more as he becomes more comfortable with his caretaker. Even when he's just staring at the castle outside his window like a senior citizen, he makes it so easy for you to connect with him.<br/><br/>Everything else that happens to these two is just pure sweetness: he talks her into watching a foreign film with him, she helps him to shave off his facial hair, she tells him about these ridiculous bumblebee tights she always wanted, she struggles to get his wheelchair out of mud, she attempts to get him into a high-class dining restaurant that he doesn't even like, and best of all, they get their moment to dance at a wedding. It's purely believable to see their relationship grow from distant to intimate over six months.<br/><br/>That being said, the story needed major alterations. The book's original author Jojo Moyes adapted Me Before You to the screen, and it's clear she doesn't know how the process of an adaptation to screen goes. Her intentions for the emotional aspects of the script are in their proper place, but many of the important moments, particularly in the beginning, are skimmed over and barely given any detail, and it shows more in the rather clumsy third act. In addition, the picture's editor, John Wilson, simply did not let various scenes last long enough to get the full emotional effect.<br/><br/>But that's not the worst part. No, the worst part of this film, and the book in that matter, is the message. Without spoiling anything for those of you who haven't read the book, the overall theme justifies suicide as a path to freedom from lifelong suffering. Suicide is often talked about as if it were a decision to live an alternate lifestyle, saying that if someone chooses to kill himself, you just have to let him do it. But how much truth is there to this?<br/><br/>Coming from my own experiences, my autism has been an enormous stumbling block, just like Will with Quadriplegia. But what I learned over time, is that what I thought was holding me back was actually setting me up for something better, such as my book on growing up autistic that currently has a 4.5-star rating on Amazon. But it doesn't end there. Do you think Stephen Hawking would have inspired others had he decided to end his life after losing his muscular capabilities? Do you think that Roger Ebert would still be remembered as a well-respected movie critic if he killed himself after losing his jaw? What about Abraham Lincoln? Would our nation still be a slave-free country if he chose to end it after meeting a failure on the job? The devastating thing is, this movie proves that people don't quite understand the value of a disability.<br/><br/>Now, Jojo Moyes is right about one thing: you can't change people or the decisions they make. If they choose something beyond the extreme, you're not responsible. But contrary to what Moyes is trying to say in her work, life is always worth living in the very end, even if certain things may momentarily make you feel otherwise. Thus I probably wouldn't recommend the book or the movie for this very reason. But you can go ahead and read and see each of these highly enjoyable works if my praise entices you. Just be aware that no matter what crap you may go through, life is always worth it!<br/><br/>Overall Grade: C+"
"nicolechan916","6","1","7","4 June 2016"," Great landscapes, but typical story
","Having read the book before knowing there was a movie coming out about it, I knew the whole plot. And knowing the whole plot made this film unexciting to watch for me. I just didn't feel like it was anything special. It might also be because of the story itself. I've outgrown romantic comedies, and though this does have a ending that isn't usually in romantic comedies, it still progressed as one. <br/><br/>The characters are typical and not that interesting. Though having said that, Clarke as Louisa does a good job of bringing out her character's quirky and bubbly personality. Clafin's character on the other hand, is your typical rich boy with lots of baggage, and it's up to the girl to make the boy whole again. Not my cup of tea. Also, movies like these perpetuate the idea that boys and girls cannot remain in a platonic relationship if they are in close proximity to each other. <br/><br/>While the characters are typical, the acting did the film justice enough. The characters were brought to life, and there is good chemistry between Clarke and Clafin, although it was somewhat awkward.<br/><br/>The cinematography is well done, as it does a good job of showing the landscapes in the area. The sweeping and aerial shots of the castle gives audiences the impression of how big the space actually is. Also, wide shots of cities like Paris, is nicely done. However, I did not like the many close-up shots of the characters. I felt too close and intrusive. <br/><br/>I'm not sure why people cried while watching this. OK, I mean I am quite detached from emotion when watching things, but I did not feel that there was much emotional buildup. Could have just been me. Overall, this is a well made film, but was a little boring to me."

","This was shaping up to be a realistic and powerful story, especially when Louisa told Will that killing himself was selfish. She was right. Then the film veered into the realm of fantasy, where Will was portrayed as finding peace in an act of utter selfishness. He threw away the gift of life and love. There can be no peace in that. There can be no peace for those who witness that. I am reminded of the young woman who wanted to kill herself because her mother had never loved her because she was a girl instead of a boy. Those who were so caught up in the culture of death though it was such a wonderful thing that she could be free to end her life. All that this woman needed was someone to affirm that her life was worth living. This film distorts reality and is a symptom of a narcissistic and individualistic culture that summed up in the title of this film: ""Me before you."""

","This movie is ablist trash and honestly I'm surprised that the author got away with never interviewing an actual person who has quadriplegia and main source of information on the subject cams from a family who helped their child with quadriplegia commit assisted suicide which wow is maybe a little bit biased no? This author is speaking on a subject as an able bodied person who wants to romantise other peoples realities and basically glorifies a handicapables suicide. If this story was about an able bodied man and his depression his suicide would be tragic, but because her leading man has quadraplegia his death is hailed as a necessary sacrifice for the people he loves. This movie is trash, the love story is trash, and Jojo whatever her name is uses degrading language both in the book and the movie, using terms like ""quads"" which news flash isn't how people with quadraplegia refer to themselves which she might know if she ever bothered to interview one. As someone who works in the medical field this movie is a nightmare and I would hate for any of the people I know who have similar medical needs to watch this movie and think that what Sam did was something they should do ""for the sake of their loved ones"". If I could rate it 0/10 I would have.

","Many times we have seen this in the past: A successful author teams up with inexperienced director, add some well-known faces and you are in for a insignificant piece of film making. The story for this one, I been told, is much more believable and interesting on the pages of the best seller book by the same author that wrote the script. And that's a bit confusing as why would a successful piece of literature would turn into a very sloppy, cheesy, inconsequential film. The main problem I have with it is, however, the amount of clichés that keep coming one after other. I found myself guessing all the time which cliché would be the next, which scene would show that this film was no more that a collage of clichés that murder the narrative. The scene when Luisa's boyfriend tells her about his plans for a holiday that include all his friends just sums it up. And then there's the characters - small town girl from working class parents that talks with a public school accent an has an infinite wardrobe. When I look at the characters I can only see the actors, and that's not good. In fact some of them (Charles Dance, Jenna Coleman, Joanna Lumley and Diane Morgan) seem to have been signed up only to add well known faces to the cast list - they add no value as actors to the film. And there's more that I could add that can explain the disappointment of watching these 109 minutes without feeling that you are wasting your time, but I leave it here. In summary - Sloppy story telling, questionable casting, poor acting, clichés, clichés and clichés. Avoid."

The story is great, it's based upon a book (which I haven't read yet) and the story line is great. It's about this small-town girl getting to know the world a little better, through the eyes of someone who has seen it all. But it's also about a young man who deems his life worthless and him getting to see the world through the eyes of someone who hasn't seen anything. <br/><br/>I thought the relationship between Lou and Patrick was acted out a bit over the top and I can not stress enough how much Emilia Clarke's eyebrows annoyed the frickity-frack out of me.

","I knew what this was about and how it was going to end. But I ill wanted to give it a try. I hoped that there could be showed different opinions, but instead I just watched movie based on emotions and egos.
The main thought of the story is that people need to repect other's decisions and just show love and support. And this idea isn't that bad. But the topic of illness is more serious than just a matter of choice.
I believe that every story gives viewers/readers ideas. Personally I like motivational stories that show road to success. While this story is quite depressing. I could compare ""Me before you"" with ""Million Dollar Baby"". Viewers remember how hard Hilary Swank tried her best that's why the ending was strong and touching. In ""Me before you"" I see no strength, only depression.
Because of that depresed main character it was also impossible for me to see romantic story here. He seems to be too deep inside his own world to show interest in others.
I think he wanted to return ""perfect"" himself. WHy do I think that there is no perfect life?
So, in the end, it's all a fiction story. Moreover, there is a sequal book. Just like 50 shades, right?
I read book based on REAL life.I recommend you to read Nich Vujicic books. No fiction there. Or watch Lorenzo's Oil

","The movie portrays two very different aspects of love through people in very different stages in life. Most of the movie plays out like a typical romantic comedy, but there is a depth added by how the characters view and learn/teach what it means to live. It addresses a controversial issue with grace, and broadens the perspective of the true value of one's life, and love- that life is not just about being, and love is not just about being together. Clarke and Claflin really make the movie - their emotions, gestures, expressions make the movie so memorable even when parts of the movie are more predictable.

Such arrangement of putting some annoying clowning figures in an actually quite serious movies in British movies is just stupid, annoying and out of place. Best example: ""Noting Hill (1999)"".

"TheMovieDiorama","6","0","3","2 March 2019"," Me Before You occasionally paralyses itself with romantic clichés but bravely tackles a controversial subject.
","As someone who does not actively seek out soppy romances (mostly because I like to live in solitude), I found this quirky British love story to be sweet and endearing. It frequently immobilises itself with eye rolling moments, however once the prickly subject of euthanasia takes hold of the script, it drives itself to the finish line (with a tear or two maybe...). Louisa, a young woman desperately looking for a job, becomes the carer of a stubborn quadriplegic. Initially a salty meanie who relishes in his own self-pity, her eccentric personality soon starts to win him over.<br/><br/>So, if you've ever seen 'The Untouchables', you'll notice this film plays out almost identically to start with. Two strangers from different backgrounds forming a close bond after spending plenty of time together. It's a rather predictable affair, with this script struggling to inject any sense of heart during the first half. Clarke was wobbly as she forces this eccentric personality by wearing odd fashion choices, constantly babbling and trying her hardest to come across as awkward. The consistent use of Ed Sheehan songs and other romantic pop tracks made the film feel cheap and disposable, appealing to the demographic of radio-listening mums.<br/><br/>But then something happened. About halfway through, it dawned on me that this may not have the happy ending I predicted. Euthanasia makes it way to the forefront and surprisingly packs an emotional punch. Clarke and Claflin begin to exhume believable chemistry and I found myself falling in love with them. Don't get me wrong, the script still has many stumbling blocks and overextends it's sentimentality, consequently leading to melodrama. However the film remains sweet throughout, and I appreciate the direction it took whilst adhering to its source material. You understand both Louisa and Will's perspectives on life, without the film forcing this upon you. Also shout out to Lumley who literally only has one minute of screen time (worth it!)."

The American and modern mindset of ""I'll do it my way or I won't do it all"" ends up being a self pitying bromide, that trivializes the real courage demanded to live any life at all, let alone the life of someone with quadriplegia. I personally am ambulatory, but I have worked more than 30 years with special needs individuals of all ages, shapes, and sizes. There is not one of them that I would have said, ""Gee,I think the world would've been way better without you"". We are faced daily with things we do not want in our lives. Please understand that I am not comparing breaking a shoelace or dropping my favorite teapot with an accident that leads one never to be independent in one's own care again. But no one is better off without these lives, unless you view life as important only when it is convenient and painless, which any fool can see is pretty rare. I am also not attacking those who decide, for whatever reasons, to end their own lives. But make no mistake, it is not dignified, it is not better. We are given the gift to live our lives, whatever lives we have been given. The protagonist got one thing absolutely right: we have one life. One. There is only one of each of us. One. With those odds, one out of billions, may each of us offer ourselves for others for the entire time we have been given."

","It's disappointing to watch this movie rush towards the end. It failed to capture the essence of novel, the energy and the situational seriousness. Louisa's character is made more of a joke, she is shown only as a laughing and smiling idiot, which is not the case in the novel. <br/><br/>The acting is forced and it looks as if someone has made a summarised recap of complete package. <br/><br/>Screenplay is the only part that justifies itself other then that, everything is just rushed to the finishing line.

"MonsieurMS","Null","0","2","7 July 2018"," Good to a point
","The most notable part of this movie is Emilia Clarke. It is always fun to watch fine actors in something besides their signature pieces that you knew them from. In the old days, John Wayne was always John Wayne. Here, you can barely recognize Emilia Clarke, a high compliment. She has nothing of the Game of Thrones' Queen. There is nothing of that character's confidence, arrogance and presence. She is wholly transformed. There are many other recognizable faces in the cast for fans of contemporary British acting--like one of Clarke's G.O.T. colleagues, Brenda Coyle from Downtown Abbey and Jenna Coleman from Doctor Who--but only Clarke becomes a completely different person. It is worth watching this just for that transformation. (For most of the movie, she even LOOKS puffier and plainer, not exactly the image presented in G.O.T., whether deliberate or not.) The movie...charming and bouncy at first, with a poignant and increasingly sappy overlay ultimately, is not as interesting as the cast, but it is well worth watching and nicely paced. To be sure, there is a certain inevitability as to where it is going, but for most of the movie the tone is light and it refrains from wallowing in despair. Until it does. Those last 20 minutes are the least successful, unless you just enjoy a good cry."

Still after watching the whole movie i was kind of disappointed. Okay, the makers wanted to give a tragic finale to the story but in the end what's the meaning of the movie? 1.The protagonist indeed suffers a lot cause he is paraplegic , but in my opinion that's not a reason for what he decided to do. Many people in a wheelchair out there continue fighting with the difficulties they face without losing their desire to live. 2. Perhaps it's cynical what i will say , but if you think it from the beginning of the movie the story is about a poor girl who is stacked with her life , that makes her paraplegic employer to fell in love with her - despite the fact she seemed to loved him back- and after he dies to leave her an amount of money... I can find many reasons to like the movie but the more i think about it i find equally enough reasons to dislike it.."

","I haven't read the novel this is based on, but as with anyone else, I could also tell where this was heading. It's not really hard to tell, so it's not about the finish line itself, rather than how we get there. And it's a pretty entertaining (while also sad) movie experience. If you let yourself into the romantic world, that is cliché ridden to quite some extent.<br/><br/>Also some paper thin characters and two people who desperately needed each other, even without knowing that (we knew, but you know I'm talking about). So while one has a partner, that does not seem to be a big obstacle. Especially when that person isn't the one. Ah, the simple structures hidden in very tragic events and personal stories. But this has a certain suave to it, because of the main actors who really do carry this, although it doesn't have too much to ride on.

These ratings would be justified purely on the basis of the acting (particularly the female lead who easily 'steals the show') (while the other main roles are also occupied well too) and the gorgeous location filming plus great sound track.

"huey2088","5","0","4","11 October 2016"," One man's wish
","I heard about the controversy about this movie before watching it so I was prepared for death with dignity propaganda. I then read what the one star reviewers wrote and they hated the movie because of the message it supposedly conveyed: disabled people are miserable, depressed and the male protagonist, Claflin's Will was selfish who had assisted suicide in a glorified death despite having wealth, loving parents and a carer.<br/><br/>This movie showed one man's wish to die because of his quadriplegia. It showed the life he had before where he was active and a thrill seeker. His disability took away his freedom and independence. He was also taking a list of drugs for his constant pain and depression. And it was also told that he had had four pneumonias in a two year span, the last one nearly killed him because of a severely weakened immune system. He also tried to kill himself.<br/><br/>Yet somehow, the haters managed to conclude that the director implied that Will's misery represents all or most disabled people. Or that anyone with an illness or disability who commits suicide is selfish. This is just one man's story and until critics step into his shoes and experience what he feels, they have no right to judge his wish to die. It's a personal decision and if there is no Dignitas, then loved ones would possibly have to do it as shown in 'Sister Cities' where Jackie Weaver begged one of her daughters to help her die. <br/><br/>It may have been filmed in colourful scenes, made by Clarke's Louisa whenever she walked into the room or with her clothes. But make no mistake, Will was suffering - there were scenes and dialogues that showed a bleak prognosis throughout the sunny days or lovely snowy nights. He may have had material wealth and love but he was trapped in a body that he could no longer control.<br/><br/>What bothered me about this movie was Clarke's acting. Her eyebrows as some have mentioned were very distracting. Her acting also seem very limited. Apart from her ever smiling and goofy eyebrows, she struggled to show other emotions especially towards the end where it mattered. Claflin did a decent job as did everyone else. <br/><br/>It also felt a little rushed towards the end and some scenes reminded me of BBC's Jane Eyre. The dialogue at the beach was similar to the scene where Rochester proposed to Eyre under the oak tree. The editing was also poor and unnecessary.<br/><br/>Overall it's a light movie about a controversial subject. Despite the good acting sans Clarke, there wasn't much chemistry. I sensed that the director didn't want the movie to be grim because of its core topic and she was right to do so because death doesn't have to be awful. It is the fear of it that makes people angry and confused, especially if it's suicide. However, it could have delved deeper and be a little more courageous rather than playing it safe."
"PetarNeo","6","0","2","2 September 2016"," There is something terribly wrong with Traynor
","Such a strong cast Clarke, Claflin and Dance and they did an amazing job. Throughout whole movie you have cheerful and funny scenes. As Louisa and Will get to know each other they start to feel very comfortable and tend to have a great time together, opposite at the beginning when Will treated her like sh*t. Then Louisa find out truth that he is only going to live certain period of time and then decided to take his life out. She keeps trying and loves him even more despite all that but his foolishness and selfishness is beyond every limit. We are humans and we tend to life no matter how hard it will be there so no human with right mind to kill himself because he can't do something and doesn't feel valuable anymore. And that is just unacceptable and probably all people need to agree with this and see that there is a problem with taking your own life. Only thing that will happen you will bring pain to other people. Twisted and disturbed thinking of individual like Will should not be accepted as right. Despite all that ending was somehow peaceful with mixed feeling that were tending to happiness. 2.5/4"

Lou loses her job in the coffee shop of the village, which puts her in a delicate matter, lack of money. Her only employment opportunity is to be caretaker of a 30-year-old man suffering paralysis of the shoulders down - owing to a motorcycle accident -, that handsome man with sense of black humor, sarcastic attitude, million euro in his bank account, hardened heart, and possessor of a perfect smile is Will Traynor (Sam Claflin has acuity to make to cry ( remember to Finnick Odair of ""The Hunger games""). With a black and white striped coat, dresses with butterflies and vegetables, psychedelic heels and other strangenesses of the fashion, Lou invades in the life of Will to superficially transform his thoughts, thoughts decided to practice his assisted suicide at a clinic in Switzerland. Striking, cloying and sentimental plot, dispenser of laughs, tears and doctrines do not focused.<br/><br/>""Me Before You"" does not get away of the habitual absurdities of a romance novel, perfect for lovers of the genre, but tedious and repetitive for the general public. Despite the exhausted use of romantic elements, Moyes, Neustadter and Weber know to place and represent every triviality harmoniously, the first kiss, Clark shaving to Will, a powerful storm behind the female lead role and even avoid some recurrences to innovate with own circumstances and phrases (Bumblebee Tights). Repeatedly, we have seen impossible loves owing the difference of social classes, and although the difference of status is present, the film is focused in another type of differences. The script fulfills the demands of any woman in love with chocolate and popcorn, nevertheless, objectively, it violates the real context with impossibilities and events of tales of fairy, hiding the suffering with the beauty, the reality with pink unicorns e hippopotamus, and until certain point is refreshing and requested for the genre, nevertheless, it is its sensitive subject in the ending, which be really affected by the strategy , and therefore, it affects the film in general.<br/><br/>Thea Sharrock - writer and film and English theater director - follows the story of the book to the letter, neglecting necessary and original ideas. Who do you wish to listen to Ed Sheeran, while you are on the verge of tears? Pop music atmosphere is profound and even memorable (Not Today by Imagine Dragons), unfortunately, these are located in incorrect times, destabilising the balance and the process of the scene. Furthermore of its youthful soundtrack, the performances hold firm progress of the story, Clarke does not exaggerate her character, and if she does, it has satisfactory effects and thanks to her beautiful and infectious laughter, development gets a decent progress. Caflin is a bit more discreet and without Clarke as Lou, it would have been a matter of seconds. Nevertheless, it is the swift development of a controversial issue which absorbs the negative criticisms. In the plot, Will is decided to die with dignity, (Spoiler: and he did it), the film portrays the life of disabled people as ""different"" and in certain part it is, nevertheless, the lightness with that they deal the ending is as necessary as negative. Necessary, because they do not turn to the romantic drama of the path towards death, but negative, because they insinuates that the days of a disabled person are useless and the best solution is suicide. ""Me Before You"" has the function of telling a love story, the film did not want to meddle in dangerous waters, but, unfortunately, it did it.<br/><br/>""Me Before You"" benefits from the chemistry of its protagonists, the idealized environments and some lines worthy of Spark, but the futility of euthanasia in the film, destroys the built and paves the way for finding some errors more.

"DavidLindahl","6","0","4","6 July 2016"," An emotional ride taking a serious subject a little too lightly
","I Went to the movies recently and saw Me Before You, the film based on the novel with the same name by the author Jojo Moyes. It is about the eccentric girl Louisa Clark who lives in an English village with her working class family. After getting fired from the small café she works in, she desperately accepts employment as a caretaker of the paralyzed young man Will Traynor. He is a wealthy ex business man who got paralyzed when he got hit by a motorcycle. Will is bitter and unpleasant towards everything and everyone around him. Me Before You is directed by the relatively unknown Thea Sharrock and this is her first feature film. Emilia Clarke, known from Game of Thrones plays Louisa and Sam Claflin, mostly known from The Hunger Games series, portrays the paralyzed Will.<br/><br/>First I want to say that Me Before You is really a British film. Working class meet upper class, they clash and break down social barriers. I also think that Louisa is a pretty typical British ""film girl"". She wears extremely colorful clothes, is constantly happy, a bit weird and often quite oblivious to the serious situations around her. When she meets Will it is at first very tense, he mostly ignores her and she desperately wants to get out of there. They of course soon become attracted to each other because they really are each other's opposites. She is fascinated by his world, his personally and also in my opinion a bit by his disability. She in turn for him becomes a happy, clumsy and carefree girl like no one he ever met before in his organized and sterile world.<br/><br/>The director Thea Sharrock relies very much on close-ups and reaction shots. This is good, and sometimes not so good. Too much close-ups on a face can easily remove the body language and also make us interpret every single facial expression as something very important. Sometimes we stay to long on Louisa's face. Her smile and her tilted gaze always seems to want to say something and I wonder if that really is what they were aiming for. However they succeed very well in a certain face shaving scene I consider as one of the best ones in the film.<br/><br/>Me Before You is a very heavy film and touches a very sensitive subject that shall remain unknown because it is a major spoiler. I do think that the filmmakers take this too lightly and offer a very simple answer that in reality should be a lot more complicated. Also, the film doesn't go all the way and actually chicken out during what I believe was a very defining moment. A bit weak actually. But the film and especially the author should have credit for daring to speak about it. The overall impression is that they actually manage to finish the film in the way they planned. Our entire emotional register is played out during these barely two hours. We laugh, we get angry, confused and we cry. Not a dry eye in the theater. But for me to become more involved and drawn to the story, it would require more focus on the sensitive subject. Offer no direct answers, ask us the audience questions and let us sit by the end of the film with our heads filled with thoughts. That would according to me have given the film more depth. Also the clichés and the music would have to be toned down. The music was at times very bombastic and tiresome.<br/><br/>David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se"

","The story that JoJo Moyes produced is certainly a unique one. I appreciated how truly realistic the situation was, that unfortunate things happen and not every love story is a fairy tale.<br/><br/>What I mostly enjoyed was how the love story between Louisa and Will took a backseat to their developing friendship and the hardships everyone had gone through within those six months. The relationships that Lou has with the other characters are also relatable.<br/><br/>I had binged the book before watching the movie, which, now that I think about it, I probably shouldn't have. (I'm one of those people that want to read the book first before watching movies.) Anyway, much like many book adaptations, huge chunks of the book were not included in the final cut. Knowing there were more in-depth scenes that would have further developed some of the characters took a little of the wonder from me. I'd gone from viewer to critic.<br/><br/>The build-up to the climax wasn't as dramatic or smooth like in the book. Admittedly, there were many tears shed. However, in the end, I felt that although both book and movie were executed beautifully in their own ways, Me Before You was really too over-hyped."

","Is it just me, or are we all sick of the rich, handsome guy always wooing the girl with his wily charms, his full head of hair and an allowance that exceeds most people's rent? Granted in the case of Me Before You, the man in question is Will Traynor (Claflin), a quadriplegic with a death wish. If the movie was in the hands of people who actually knew a thing or two beyond weepy romantic tropes and clichés, they could have come up with something worthwhile. Unfortunately makers of this film seem to think that simply replacing Hugh Grant with a younger faster model and reciting the hackneyed romantic dramedy formula for the umpteenth time, makes for a unique experience; umm...nope.<br/><br/>The film takes place in a quaint little country town in England and concerns the life Louisa Clark (Clarke). She's a bit of a flake but amiable enough to follow around for two hours, thus when she's left unemployed we feel her exhilaration when she manages to stumble into a job as a professional caretaker. She then meets Will, the local blue-blood who after a tragic accident is in no mood for friends and family, let alone a person who's pretty much hired to be his friend. Oh yeah, Will also has a nurse (Peacocke) thus guaranteeing that the messy realities of having to take care of a severely handicapped person is left off screen. After the first half-hour to forty-five minutes the pair grow acquainted all while the audience sits patiently, waiting for the actual plot to kick in.<br/><br/>When it finally does kick in, the story devolves from being harmlessly, predictably enjoyable to being a contrived travelogue/bucket list that feels less tethered to the story than an attempt by director Thea Sharrock to visit exotic locales. The message of the film: ""live boldly"" and ""follow your dreams"" are laudable ideas, thus the film repeats them either visually or comes right out and says them again and again just in case you missed them. Personally I found such lofty ambitions a little hard to swallow coming from a man who inherited a private jet. Meanwhile the personification of those same ideas; the obligatory rival played by Matthew Lewis is the dimwitted pack animal to the story's muleskinner.<br/><br/>For their efforts both Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke do a good job filling their roles as Lovebird #1 and Lovebird #2. Clarke especially has a certain way about her that can emit pure giddiness without trying too hard. Too bad her character is stripped for parts by the story and deprived of her very agency and character growth by virtue of an expense account. If anything, Me Before You is confirmation that the young ingénue can have a successful career beyond Game of Thrones (2011-Present).<br/><br/>For the sake of filling seats Claflin does well based solely on the power of his chiseled cleft chin and naturally toned physique. He's the dreamboat genre fans have been clamoring for ever since Dylan McDermott and Patrick Dempsey became too old to play leading men. But lest you think his casting decision is a shallow attempt to placate fans while undercutting the character's handicap, he does sport a beard and a nasty flop sweat on more than one occasion to insure he doesn't always look like Superman.<br/><br/>No matter how you slice it, Me Before You is a predictable and boring film that wears its cutesiness like a badge of honor in the hopes that no one notices our leading lady doesn't evolve and our leading man doesn't know how good he's got it. It adheres to an old formula with little regard for changing tastes and it's one attempt at uniqueness is treated more like a plot device than a genuine attempt at characterization. If that's what you're looking for in a movie, take a stab at Me Before You. Frankly I think it should have been titled Me Bore You."

Yep, a real tearjerker. Sam plays a banker from a wealthy family. He has a girlfriend-not Emilia-but looses her after he is hit by a motorcycle and is paralyzed from the neck down. I guess she was the shallow type, because she ends up marrying Sam's best friend. Emilia is hired by Sam's parents, Charles & Janet, to help take care of Sam; nothing too physical, just mostly to talk to him and keep him company. Emilia has a boyfriend but you can tell that they are not meant to be together and he won't be around at the end of the movie. Sam was real active physically before his accident so he is really depressed now. He even tries to kill himself-which is hard to do when you are a quadriplegic-and he tells his parents that he will go to Switzerland to do the job right, but he gets talked into waiting 6 months before saying his final goodbyes. That is where Emilia comes in. Emilia has a perky personality, always talking and she dresses in bright & outlandish styles of clothing, and she hopes to change Sam's mind about his death choice-when she eventually finds out about it. Like most romantic movies, they don't get along at first but soon..... It's rated ""PG-13"" for thematic elements and sexual content-no nudity- and has a running time of 1 hour & 50 minutes.

When Nathan told her about Will's condition, on the night he suffered in pain, she did not seem to mind. Worthy point, she needs to have a night with him overcome the pain, if she wanted him to continue living. She helped him to see that he still can participate in activities before, such as listening to concerts, to a party, watching horse racing, to a sea, ... This is wrong! Worth reason, she should give him clear his life was changed from 2 years ago, and he has many new choices. Will love with Lou. But he loved her enough to keep her life together. I wish his fingers stroked chances of her hair, her face. I have not read the novel. So when green leaves fall from the branches, I wanted to cry. Before this time, I still think there will be a good end. Do you think like me? Will I not object to the choice of death. I respect! But if I'm Lou, I'm going to Paris alone, follow the instructions of the Will. Then I'll jump into the Seine ..."
