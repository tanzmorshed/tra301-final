","Atop a hillside in Liberia overlooking an impending village massacre once the arms deal settles, Nicolas Cage's Yuri pleads to his conscience rattled brother Vitaly (Jared Leto), ""It is none of our business!"" Writer and Director Andrew Niccol's ""Lord of War"" is all about the big business of war, and the cost of selling one's soul. That lost soul is Yuri Orlov played masterfully by Nicolas Cage. Cage as Yuri also narrates the story. Niccol sets the warped and dark tone in the opening sequence of the manufacture of a bullet to its final destinationso to speak. Yuri comments that there is one firearm for every 12 people in the world. So the question is ""How do we arm the other eleven?"" Niccol's ""Lord of War"" is not so much a clever indictment of humanity, rather an acknowledgment of perhaps humanity's darker nature. In a poignant and chilling realization for Yuri (Cage) he says, ""They say that 'evil prevails when good men fail to act.' It should be 'evil prevails'."" I don't think this is cynicism on Niccol's part, rather only stating what is so given all of history and now. He certainly makes us think from the inside out.<br/><br/>Yuri Orlov (Cage) is from a Ukrainian family in Little Odessa, NY. As a young man he has an epiphany witnessing a Russian mafia hit. Being an arms dealer is the path to success. He finds that he also has an innate gift for his chosen profession. He enlists his brother Vitaly (Leto) into the business. ""Lord of War"" traces the Orlov brothers over the course of 20 yearsthrough the end of the Cold War to the advent of terrorist threats and dictatorships in third world countries. Yuri truly becomes the Lord of War supplying arms to anyone and any country for a profit. He also acts as an independent agent for undisclosed countries supplying arms to ""freedom fighters"". One gets the drift. Yuri eventually hits his stride and becomes very successful and very wealthy. He marries his trophy bride, supermodel Ava Fontaine (stunning Bridget Moynahan), has a son, and living in a luxury apartment in Manhattan. All the while he eludes the grasp of Interpol Agent Jack Valentine (very good Ethan Hawke), by keeping three steps ahead. Predictably Yuri's world comes crashing in upon him. In a powerful scene with Ava who purposely ignores what her husband really does for a living, Yuri has a conscience meltdown.<br/><br/>The actors in ""Lord of War"" are great. Nicolas Cage is such a powerful and versatile actor. I don't think any other actor than himself, could enroll sympathy as arms dealer Yuri. Cage gives Yuri a subtle detached edge and an expert in context. Cage knows he is in morally bankrupt position, and he uses his smarts and sense of humor to rationalize that he only supplies the weapons to men who do evil. Yuri is the ultimate poster child for ""Guns don't kill people. People kill people."" Jared Leto is surprising as the coke head brother, who eventually cops to the monster he has becomethe counterpoint to Yuri. Bridget Moynahan is deceivingly powerful as Ava, the former model aware that her asset of being pretty is fading, and closes her eyes to what her husband does until it is too late. Moynahan is stunningly beautiful and has distinctive grace and vulnerability. Ethan Hawke as Jack Valentine is the intrepid idealist saving the world from the likes of Yuri. Hawke is very strong and compelling.<br/><br/>Andrew Niccol's ""Lord of War"" ends and the world continues on. The echoes of Yuri voice, just ""evil prevails"" is a chilling and poignant reminder. Nicolas Cage is brilliant as the lost soul in ""The Lord of War"". ""The Lord of War"" is one the year's best."
"jdcorcor","8","112","130","5 October 2005"," Bite the bullet: Guns HAVE changed politics more than votes...
","Gulp. What stays with you long after seeing this movie, is the ""based on actual events"" caveat. Even if this has been Hollywoodized to the max, the core story  that of Yuri Orlov, Ukrainian immigrant boy who learns running guns is easy money and that he has a real knack for it, then grows up to be a conscience-free worldwide leader in arms dealing, etc.  is bone-chilling because grains of truth exist.<br/><br/>Writer/Director Andrew Niccol keeps ratcheting up his incisive view of the world, surgically cutting away our illusions, and his scalpel cuts deeper as his talents mature. On his journey from ""The Truman Show"" to ""Lord of War,"" Niccol has maintained his connection to individual people too often sacrificed at the altar of profit and exploitation. He has a profound ability to reveal the conscience and humanity of man subverted and supplanted by the coldness of commerce (or technology, as in his 1997 ""Gattaca""). More and more ""civilization,"" less and less civility. Barbarism dressing in Armani, the Wolf in Grandma's nightgown waiting patiently to devour us with the gusto of a gourmand.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage is perfect as Yuri. Goal-oriented, focused, determined to succeed. He is neither overtly cruel nor ruthless, just a businessman with utterly no remorse or self-recrimination about what he does for a living and how crushing and devastating it may be to the insignificant, disposable ""little guy."" Without a moral compass or conscience. In other words, an Enron executive. Or Tyco. Or Adelphia.<br/><br/>Case portrays Yuri as the epitome of a rationalizer He genuinely believes that he's only doing what someone else would do if he were no longer in the picture. Just a link in the chain. Simply the middleman. Think of all the clichés that those aiding and abetting evil in all its manifestations use to justify their role in the process. ""If not me, someone else will do it."" ""The law of supply and demand."" ""To the victor go the spoils."" ""I didn't pull the trigger"" Or whatever. From corporate greed that impoverishes the worker whose pension plan paid for their jets, jewels and vacations, to arms dealers whose stock in trade mows down third world children by the townful.<br/><br/>That is a far, far more deadly stone killer than an over-the-top fictionalized movie-made murdering weirdo, as this one could live next door to any one of us (in a very upscale neighborhood, of course). His toxic product is totally indifferent to age, race, gender, religion, nationality, economic status, or any other distinguishing characteristics of mankind. Just a tool, he would no doubt tell you as he glanced as his Rolex before dashing off in his Jaguar or Bentley. And he'll arm either side, both sides, any sideit's of no concern to him. Terrifying, I tell you.<br/><br/>Jared Leto, as Yuri's younger brother Vitaly, will break your heart. It's as if Vitaly is the sin-eater, absorbing all the guilt to which Yuri is impervious. He is a sponge, while Yuri is stainless steel. Unable and yes, unwilling, to break the bonds of brotherhood, Vitaly too aids and abets the evil that masquerades as business, just business.<br/><br/>Bridget Moynahan is fragile and wistful as Ava Fontaine, super model and Yuri's dream girl. Her vulnerability and gullibility feed one another, as she too becomes one of Yuri's goals in life. Well played by Moynahan, but the audience just doesn't buy her complete ingenuousness. 'Waaaaaay too much money there, Ava.<br/><br/>Dictators and despots fast become Yuri's close personal friends, and competing arms dealers his enemies. His threshold of tolerance for violence grows with his wealth, and you wait to see how long this can escalate, how much of a blind eye he can turn. There are arms fairs and shiploads of weapons, all of which pass beyond the control of agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke), much to his aggrieved frustration. You may find, as I did, that the Valentine character is fairly wasted and impotent throughout the movie, and that no doubt is intentional. The somewhat heavy-handed slap-you-upside-the-head message being that good is usually, thoroughly, stomped into the blood-soaked earth by evil. Perhaps the most telling line of dialog in this flick is when Simeon Weisz says, ""Governments are changed more often by bullets than votes."" This is a difficult movie to digest after you've seen it. While watching, you are knocked senseless by the violence, the inhumanity, the ugliness. Most of all by the fear of the reality that lies beneath its surface. But it is superbly done, as punishing as it may be. The dialog is inventive and original in most instances  brutally so -- but the lines are crafted in such a way as to BECOME the future axioms and thereafter clichés that will be repeated over and over in the context of war, politics, global violence, and the trappings of same.<br/><br/>Not an easy movie to watch, but perhaps every person on the planet should. Don't expect light entertainment: Just bite the bullet and watch. And learn."
"leilapostgrad","10","377","471","18 September 2005"," story-telling perfection
","A movie about a gunrunner who arms the dictators, tyrants, and genocide-perpetrators of the world should not be this deliciously funny. Lord of War is story-telling perfection. The opening scene depicts the life of a bullet, from its creation in the factory to the moment it blasts through the head of a poor African child. Nicolas Cage is Yuri Orlov, the son of Ukrainian immigrants, who becomes the world's most successful arms dealer. Writer/director Andrew Niccol took every major world conflict of the part 25 years and seamlessly incorporated them into a smart, funny, complex story about violence, corruption, and the essence of warfare. Lord of War has no clear-cut, black-or-white, good-or-evil ""moral of the story,"" but no intelligent observation ever does. It's just a fabulous film. ""I never sold to Osama Bin Laden,"" Yuri tells the audience. ""Not on moral grounds, but because his checks were always bouncing back then."""
"sirjonxo","9","223","281","16 September 2005"," The Truth About Guns & Wars
","Many people might walk away from this one not feeling ""entertained"" because it's not your typical Hollywood thriller. It's not a ""Feel Good"" movie you should take a date on in the hopes of coming away high on life and hand in hand. It's a movie that'll make you think and might disturb the uninformed viewer who knows little about the politics of war.<br/><br/>This is a movie based on actual events (that means it's a movie that has some truth to it). From what I heard the director made quite a bit of research of the gun running world when creating this movie.<br/><br/>This movie takes a look at the gun running business through the story of one particular trafficker played by Cage. It goes through two decades of wars & conflicts and how the business and politics of gun running works. Cage is the middle man in that world, who navigates through it very professionally and coolly. Cage's character is made to be likable, but not a hero by any means.<br/><br/>Many people may think that this movie depicts certain cultures and races in a bad light, but if you know anything about history and keep up to date with world events you'll understand the truth behind these portrayals.<br/><br/>The movie is interesting because it is as close as to a realistic look to arms trafficking as Hollywood could produce without making a documentary. It's refreshing because of this.<br/><br/>I hope people see this movie because it very much shows the truth behind how wars are supplied and how the richest nations in the world have done this for the ultimate prize that thing that makes the world go round  Money.<br/><br/>The movie as a whole is produced very well and the acting and cinematography is up to par with the type of film it is (as mentioned before, don't expect a big production Hollywood action flick).<br/><br/>Don't expect your typical Hollywood ending here either.<br/><br/>(I'd compare this movie with Buffalo Soldiers (2001) with Joaquin Phoenix)"

There are many scenes in this movie which stay with you long after the credits have rolled, the darkly funny ones as well as the truly horrific ones, and to me this is something only the best movies ever achieve.

"MovieManMenzel","9","278","369","16 September 2005"," Another powerful well-made political drama with an excellent story and a powerful performance by Nicolas Cage
","""Lord of War"" is about a man named Yuri (Nicolas Cage) who in the early 80's decides that he doesn't want to just work in a restaurant for the rest of his life and decides that instead he wants to be an arms dealer. Once he makes his first sale, Yuri is hooked on the feeling of making big money for selling firearms, and continues to sell the firearms but he wants more and more of a profit and more and more of a challenge. It's not until an Interpol agent (Ethan Hawke) is hot on Yuri's case that he begins to question the nature of his business and whether what he is doing for a living is moral and if he should be responsible for the hands these weapons get into and what they are used for. A powerful performance by Nicolas Cage, as well as a great thought-provoking movie ensues I love movies like this one for a few reasons. The main reason is that for the most part you can't predict what is going to happen next or where the film is going. Another reason I like movies like this is because it's powerful and its makes you think. And lastly I like a movie like this because it doesn't end in a typical way and actually leaves you feeling blown-away and surprised.<br/><br/>The filmed starred Nicolas Cage who lately has done of some the best work of his career. His performance here is top-notch and powerful. There are so many other people in the film including Jared Leto, Ian Holm, Ethan Hawke and Bridget Moynahan to name a few who are also very good at the roles they played. This film is written and directed by Andre Niccol the same man who wrote ""The Terminal"" and ""The Truman Show"" so I guess I shouldn't be so surprised by why I actually liked this film so much, it had a good lead actor and a good screenwriter.<br/><br/>I guess this movie all comes down to how open minded the movie-goers who see this are. I guess it also amounts to where you stand on the political fence. The film is not for those who don't have an open mind about things that are going on in the world today. The movie is based on true events so be warned that some of things shown in the film are happening in real life or did happen at one point in time. To be honest, I do believe what the film states in the end, it doesn't seem at all far fetched. It's like Yuri says in the film ""it's not our war and no matter what we do we can't stop it"" and that's true it's like smoking kills people every day but there are people who run cigarette companies everyday knowing that they are killing people every single day and getting people addicted to something that in the end will kill them. Is that moral? What can we do to stop it? These are questions this film asks and leaves it to the viewer to decide on.<br/><br/>So in the end, this movie isn't for everyone. In a sense this film is kind of like the movie ""Blow"" because it's about a man who feels his life isn't complete without selling something that is bad. He has everything he could ever want but still needs to sell the firearms. It's an amazing and powerful story which I feel really puts things in perspective as far as us Americans look at things. Nicolas Cage's performance is incredible as he seems to not care at all for the people's lives he puts at stake every day and when it comes to his own life he still seems unemotional and doesn't seem to worry. Personally I think this is one of the best film's of year and is in fact just as good as the other political drama currently released called ""The Constant Gardner"" so if you have an open mind about things and enjoy movies that will make you think, well check out ""Lord of War"" because it's well worth the price of admission at the theater.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Lord of War"" is a 9/10."
"wahzoh","Null","132","173","9 October 2005"," A Surprising Morality Tale
","I was really surprised that Hollywood was able to tackle a huge moral morass like the black market arms trade and leave the moral issues in the audience's lap. Yuri (played by Nicholas Cage) goes to work in a particularly ugly world. When he says that he's had a bad day at the office, you can be pretty sure that someone has been shot or blown up. At any event, what I liked about this picture was that although Yuri obviously has some moral issues to wrestle with, he does so on his own terms, and we are left to figure out the rights and the wrongs. Since most movie-goers don't like to leave a movie with food for thought, this picture may not play very broadly in theaters, but I hope it gets a good audience on video. I also though that Jared Leto was wonderful as Yuri's tragically addicted and unhappy brother."
"Silenttool","10","233","318","17 September 2005"," Lord of war: Great film seeming to receive bad reviews by dense critics
","I felt this movie & the actors/actresses did their parts at portraying the turmoils of a man unable to escape his addiction in a dog eat dog world. Nicholas Cage's role of a ""gunrunner"" sheds light to subjects otherwise not focused on by todays society. Too often do films dull down the truth of life. The term ""speechless"" comes to me when i think of what one word to describe this film. Cage does a wonderful job of keeping his guard up and showing how strong and selfless one must be to do what no one else will. Despite the graphic nature of the subject and reality behind how corrupt this world is; This movie is not the catalyst for out-lash. It's simply a great film. Blame the real world, not Hollywood."

","Yuri Orlov(Nicolas Cage) tells his humorous, disturbing, and tragic story of coming from nothing to becoming the greatest gun-runner in the world.<br/><br/>Lord of War could not have been made better. The narration by cage was not only hysterical but when needed to be, emotional. The acting was the best this year. Cage showed me that he could find a character that actually fit him and the supporting cast with Jared Leto and Bridget Moynahan was incredible. I have never seen a movie that was so funny and so dramatic since my viewing of American Beauty.<br/><br/>The writing was beautiful. There is nothing more to say about it. It was just B-e-a-t-i-f-u-l. The movie is also very entertaining which can't be said about most dramatic movies but then again this movie is more than just dramatic, it's in it's own category! The story is gripping and makes you want Cage to succeed in his illegal actions after you have seen the other side of his criminal lifestyle. It characterizes every day warlords to the point where you understand them and sympathize for them and maybe even blame the American government due to fact that it is based on actual events. Overall, the movie was incredible and honestly one of the best this year.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie."
"CalRhys","Null","34","44","26 September 2014"," A Testament To Good Storytelling
","'Lord of War' is a film that displays a vivid and detailed account into the criminal mind of an arms dealer played vigorously by Nicolas Cage as he confronts the morality of his work. An impressive and unbiased look at the arms trade that exhibits storytelling at it's finest, written perfectly by Oscar-nominated writer-director, Andrew Niccol. As a matter of opinion, the most impressive part of the film happens in the first five minutes, as the audience follows the lifespan of a single bullet to the folk vibe of Buffalo Springfield's ""For What It's Worth"", an extremely well-crafted introduction that immediately garners the attention of its viewers. Whilst the story is unnecessary, it provides the audience with a dark and partially satirical look into the deadly trade of gunrunning and acts as a testament to good storytelling and impressive acting ability."

","Lord of War is about an arms dealer named Yuri Orlov who confronts the morality of his work while being chased by an Interpol agent. This is a very interesting film brought by director and writer of the film, Andrew Niccol (Gattaca). This is another great film of his that will boost up his career even more. Nicolas Cage puts up another great performance of the year and although his acting is very ostentatious, his narrating just like in The Weather Man, which came out a couple months later, is perfect. The dialogue is very good and the script couldn't be any better. Most of all, I clearly gave respect to Andrew Niccol, because honestly, he deserves the most credit out of any one who worked on the film. My hat goes off for him. Overall, great film of 2005 and I'll be paying more attention to Andrew Niccol's movies. I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>Hedeen's Outlook: 8.5/10 ***+ B+"
"opencad2","9","223","357","16 September 2005"," Great Movie -- Similar to ""The Godfather""
","This was a great movie. Cage delivered on the ""anti-hero"" - a 21st century ""Corleone"". <br/><br/>The locations were cool and ""spectacular"". From a visual standpoint this movie really does take you around the world. New York, Russia, Libya, Libera, etc. This movie is shot very, very well.<br/><br/>The pacing of the movie is brisk, the scenes aren't morose. Like Platoon, this movie doesn't glamorize or demonize situations. A guy who sells weapons for a living meets some violent people in some violent places. The visual style is breathtaking . . . <br/><br/>What I like best is, no characters in the movie are ""romanticized"". There are no ""good guys"". One could make the case that there are no ""bad guys"" as well I suppose. There are people who do bad things for reasons you don't understand. There are people who do nothing when they should do something for reasons you don't understand. Its a pretty accurate depiction of real life :)<br/><br/>I think I might have rated the movie 8.5, if there were any other movies at all about this topic that were anywhere in its league. If you make a great ""Legally Blond"", that's nice. If you make a great movie about arms trading with a sold antihero and supporting characters, I figure you get ""extra credit"".<br/><br/>I think you're a fool if you miss this movie. Its not about Iraq. Its not particularly political. This movie could have been made under any president in the last 100 years and been just as accurate. Its not particularly anti-gun. Its just about this guy who sells guns. <br/><br/>On the other hand, don't take people to this movie if they can't handle violence or movies that aren't designed to make them ""feel good"" when they walk out. This is a good movie, its interesting, its intelligent, its important -- but its not Ferris Buellers Day Off or Spinal Tap."

","This was a very pleasant surprise, far better than I had ever hoped, filled with fabulous cinematography and riveting story about the life of arms dealer during the 1980s and '90s.<br/><br/>It was an interesting film, to say the least, and Nicholas Cage was terrific as the lead character, ""Yuri Orlov."" I loved his narration, too. How much of what he said is true, I have no idea, but it's fascinating stuff. Don't believe a lot of it, even when they tell you it is ""based"" on true events. Most of still can (and usually) is made up for dramatic purposes.<br/><br/>I felt those visuals, combined with the outstanding acting and always-interesting story made this a good film. It also proved you don't need action every two minutes to keep a film involving for the audience. This has just the right amount of drama, suspense, action, romance and, yes, even humor. <br/><br/>With all the political comments made here in the narration I was wondering if I was going to hear the typical Democrat whine and sure enough, late in the film a comment is made regarding the 2000 elections. The liberals still can't get over losing, fair and square. They just can't accept that. This is about the fifth time I've heard this in 2007 films although at least time, the guy making the absurd statement was the Liberian dictator.....but it really was the film maker, of course. Despite that, and the very pessimistic storyline that evil always wins in the world. According to Bible of ""Yuri,"" in the end, the meek won't inherit the earth; the arms dealers will and that evil rules, so why fight it and yourself over it. Wow, what uplifting words to live by. <br/><br/>Outside of Yuri's wife ""Ava"" (Bridget Moynahan) and the man who pursues him, ""Jack Valentine"" (Ethan Hawke) no one in here has much in the way of high-ground morals. At least they made the lawman an honest; that's rare in films today. <br/><br/>Jared Leto plays Cage's brother ""Vitaly"" and plays his standard slime-ball character. Wow, this guy is becoming the male Jennifer Jason Leigh, regarding sleazy roles. Everyone was solid in here, from the Americans to the Russians the Africans....and all intriguing people. Ian Holm as rival arms dealer ""Simeon Weisz"" deserves mention.<br/><br/>Amir Mokri is the cinematographer and Andrew Niccol, the director, who combined to make this movie look so stylish and beautiful to see. Looking at Mokri's resume, I see he's done a number of stylish films. Niccol hasn't directed much but what he has also offers interesting visuals.<br/><br/>Looking at the front and back cover of the DVD might make you think this is just another of these brainless action flicks, but it is not. This is solid film."

","This portrait of a big time arms dealer of Ukrainian origin, Yuri Orlov, starring Nicolas Cage (whose performance holds your attention throughout), has many schlocky Hollylwood elements, such as Yuri's druggie brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) and his trophy wife (Bridget Moynahan), his numerous sexy conquests along the way to megawealth, his ""friendship"" with the dramatic president of Liberia (Eamonn Walker), and the ridiculously relentless and steely Interpol agent who pursues him (Ethan Hawke). All these are colorful exhibits rather then people. The slickness of the decor and cinematography impress pointlessly. Cage's narration is full of tendentious declarations, like ""The problem with dating dream girls is that they have a tendency to become real."" Or ""I would tell you to go to hell, but I think you're already there."" Some of the zingers fall flat or are just obvious, like ""I sell to leftists, and I sell to rightists. I even sell to pacifists, but they're not the most regular customers,"" or ""There are two types of tragedies in life. One is not getting what you want, the other is getting it. "" There is more than enough of that, and you have to be pretty easily impressed to like it. The movie also sometimes revels in the evils it depicts. But it includes some significant home truths about world politics like the fact that the world's biggest arms dealers are the US, UK, France, Russia, and China, and they are also the permanent members of the UN Security Council. Some of the cynicism in this movie is pretty strong stuff. It certainly doesn't lull you."
"DannyBoy-17","7","16","25","2 October 2005"," Leaves you cold, but then maybe it ought to....
","I have been running ""Lord of War"" through my head; cinematically, it promises to be a more interesting film than it ends up being. The first shot of the path of the bullet from start to bloody finish promises a stark look at the gun-running industry, and to a degree, there is some truth to it. However, I also wonder how much of the film is Hollywoodized. I kept on thinking that it felt like a Hollywood story of corrupt power like that of Tony Montana or Johnny Depp in ""Blow.""<br/><br/>The strange thing about Cage's character is perhaps that he doesn't want to be a ""warlord;"" he doesn't want an empire. He wants to be a great provider for his wife and family; tragically, he's more in love with his product than any human being. Leto does an awesome job as Cage's brother, Natali, a man who is as loving as he is insecure.<br/><br/>The film is extremely well-written, and Cage does a great job of portraying his character sympathetically though certainly morally bankrupt. You do begin rooting for this guy to get away (well, at least I did) with his crimes. <br/><br/>I wish I had walked out of the film with a greater sense of anger or passion about preventing gun violence: instead, I walked out feeling I had been hit with a cynical, bitter look at gun violence that didn't motivate me at all.<br/><br/>There's a monologue I once read in college that talked about how ""the hand was made for the gun,"" and not the other way around. I suppose if the film had delved more into our natural tendency towards gun violence and less towards the morality of selling arms, it might have delivered a stronger punch for me."
"sbg-6","5","11","16","19 June 2010"," Well-meaning, but a lot too much.
","I'm amused by the reviewer who referred to Andrew Niccol as a 'new starter'. Not only is he of course a well-seasoned filmmaker, he has a reputation for exactly this kind of film. However, this is where Lord of War fails.<br/><br/>While there's much in this film to be applauded, both stylistically and in terms of its overall message, unfortunately with regard to the latter it's far too much of a blunt instrument. Where this doesn't compare favourably with Niccol's other notable moral tale, Gattacca, is the complete lack of emotional engagement with the characters.<br/><br/>A worthy and certainly purposeful moral is fine, but it's no good unless it comes to the screen through the experience of characters we care about. What engages the film viewer is the personal narrative, not the explanation, and this film is just full of explanation, with very little story. I'm always a little worried when a film begins with first-person narration, and in this instance my worry was justified. Cage's voice-over arises throughout, and despite a periodical nicely poetic turn, it never strays from the boringly pedagogic. We get it already, guns are bad, and the people who sell them sell their souls to ignore the effect they have. Would that this had been put much, much more succinctly and with greater dramatic effect.<br/><br/>Testament to this problem is the simple proportion of the story dedicated to the protagonist's family. His wife's eventual betrayal of him to the authorities packs no emotional punch whatsoever - it's just an inevitable outcome with no resonance for the character. His son is nothing more than a plot point, a foil for a throwaway comment about an African child of the same age who is butchered by soldiers while Uri seals an arms deal with them. Again, it packs no emotional punch, because we simply don't know his son.<br/><br/>If further evidence were needed of the story's shortcomings, the Ethan Hawke character, a morally upright lawman on Uri's case, personifies this. Again, there is no sense of any emotional purpose to the character. Why is he so obsessed with Uri? Why does he need to pursue this world of shady arms deals? What is his reason for despising this world of amoral jiggery-pokery so? His explanation when he has Uri sat in cuffs by his grounded freight plane is nothing more than trite, hollow statistics. It sounds like so many cold, numbers-driven political objections. They may be perfectly just, but they are not real, not, at least, when it comes to the motivation of someone so apparently obsessed with changing an evil practice like this. The reasons we do things are not the reasons why they are wrong, but the reasons why they matter TO US. None of it mattered to me, the viewer, a chronic shortcoming with something that so obviously matters.<br/><br/>While it would take an unusual individual to disagree with the general message of this film, it would also take someone especially unaware not to have grasped that message within about the first three minutes, indeed, by the end of the opening sequence. What we get, then, is another hundred minutes of making the same point. The power of drama, and perhaps of film especially, is in translating meaning, purpose, truth, through the filmmaker's skill, into an emotionally or comically engaging story, one that we care about by virtue of what it is, not the message it presents. The message is obvious enough - the benefit of film is its ability to make people care about the people involved. Lord of War critically fails to do this. So concerned is it with conveying a message that is untarnished and unmistakable, that it forgets that it is supposed to be about real people, strong characters, in real emotional, psychological and moral jeopardy. It's a shame that it didn't manage this.<br/><br/>Gattacca is one of the great films of our time, exactly because we do care about Vincent, and because his rebellion against an amoral world is intensely personal. The Truman Show stands out as a wonderful piece of modern questioning about our world, our perception, our view of who and what we are. But both of these films of Niccol's managed sufficiently to blend an earnest moral with succinct, colourful, emotionally dramatic and sometimes comical personal stories. They left room for the viewer to find the message, and to care about it all the more because it came through the medium of characters who mattered. This is left behind almost completely in Lord of War, and it fails far too obviously. It's a shame."

","You know how when you watch a regular American action movie and you think that the morals of the hero are stupid? Sometimes you even wish that the ""bad guy"" would win. Well, this movie meets half way. The main character, Yuri Orlov, is not a nice guy. He is an arms dealer who deals weapons illegally to war lords. As a matter of fact he IS the ""bad guy"" in the movie. Not the BADDEST guy. The real bad guys are, of course, the warlords(the warlord in Liberia is particularly nasty). You don't see much of the good guy in this movie. Anyway, the good guys name is Jack Valentine. His mission in life is to stop guys like Yuri. The best and most realistic aspect of this movie is that no one wins. I'm not going to offer any spoilers. Let's just leave it at that. In a way, you can say that the bad guy wins. But he is a REALLy bad guy; you don't want people like that winning anything. After seeing the movie I realized that it's probably one of the most important movies of the year. The movie disgusted me. Why? Because it is, as it says in the closing credits ""based on actual events""."

","It's not every day that Amnesty International endorses a movie.<br/><br/>Lord of War is a cynical and nihilistic look at the arms dealing industry. The film does meticulous work covering every aspect of the industry. No apologies made for any controversy portrayed.<br/><br/>The movie is well researched and the conflicts are all real. Some real-life names are different. but the details to smuggling methods and weapons smuggled were enlightening. Special commentary on the brutality of the trade was also eye-opening.<br/><br/>But, overambition did drag this Lord of Wardown a bit. This film seeks to cram too much information. Some plot points seem forced and the story changes flow often. But I'd rather have a film telling me too much than too little.<br/><br/>Also, another issue I had with Lord of War was that there were a few inaccuracies. The opening factory scene, for example, is not how real bullets are made. The beginning CGI was also a bit aged in some aspects. Some guns described were inaccurate. But these mistakes are forgivable since it didn't take too much away from the movie.<br/><br/>I'd rate this film a 4/5. Highly recommended and worth a revisiting.

","Lord of War, for all its radical and anti-establishment trappings, is about as comforting and safe a movie as you could possibly imagine. Its banal, elementary messages can be summed up as: Guns are bad. People who trade in them are bad. Many parts of Africa are messed-up. Nicolas Cage is wearing a hair piece. In an ever-decreasing circle of asinine clichés that would insult the intelligence of a seven-year-old child, Lord of War takes us into the terrible and frightening world of international gun-running. Cage plays an international gun-runner with weird hair and an indeterminate accent. He will sell to anyone, anywhere, as long as they cough up the cash. And what a lot of cash that turns out to be. He lives the high-life. He has everything: a loser little brother, a gorgeous but frustrated wife, stereotype parents, persistent FBI guy on his trail, the works. Keen-eyed viewers may well spot parallels between this film and Goodfellas. And Blow. And no doubt one or two other movies. In other words, we've seen it all before, and done a lot better. Andrew Niccol, the hack who gave Gattaca and Simone to a grateful public, may think he's dealing with heavy moral issues and opening our eyes to the way the world really is. In fact, all he's doing is dressing up a predictable ""rise-and-fall"" story with a bit of student politics. But no amount of moralising and politicising can disguise the total obviousness and predictability of the whole enterprise. At one point, Cage's wife, an aspiring but not over-talented painter sells her first painting. Guess who bought it? Then, Cage's brother, a drug-addled loser, gets clean, gets a girl-friend and states that his life is getting better all the time. Guess what happens to him? Later, Cage's uncle tells him how great everything is and then walks off to get into his car. Guess what happens then? And so on. Instead of being surprised by the movie, the audience is always at least one, if not fifteen steps ahead of it. The cast includes Ian Holm, Ethan Hawke, Eamonn Walker and Jared Leto (we name the guilty men!). These are all talented and intelligent performers, which only makes you wonder what on earth they are doing involved in this mess. As for Bridget Moynahan, let's just say she is well cast as a model who wants to get into acting but doesn't have the talent."

","A very enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours although over the space of twenty screen years nobody seems to age. The cinematography is fantastic,especially in Africa(some great open landscapes). The most jarring thing for me was a couple of (you can see them coming from a mile away)VERY obvious deaths. The first five minutes are superb, a mini-movie that could be called 'The life of a Bullet'. The soundtrack is also superior to your usual Hollywood movie. Strangely Nicholas Cage should be the 'Bad Guy' but isn't portrayed as such.By the same token Ethan Hawke is a fairly unsympathetic 'good guy'. And are they really his teeth?"
"mstomaso","5","20","39","10 June 2007"," Tries hard, but doesn't really make it's point (MILD SPOILER)
","A good cast, decent directing and good editing do not make up for a lack of content. This is especially so in the case of a film which pretends to educate about a very serious subject - such as the arms trade. And even more so when said film claims to be based on actual events.<br/><br/>Whatever actual events were sewn together to create Lord of War, their 'actuality' did little to help me suspend my disbelief. The nearly constant voice-over narration didn't help either. Like many other Andy Niccol films, Lord of War has an odd humor which seems to dwell just below the surface, but unlike The Truman Show, S1m0ne and the brilliant Gattaca, it does not work with the very serious and deadly themes in this film. Niccol has done some brilliant and near-brilliant work, but Lords of War is, IMO, his weakest effort thus far.<br/><br/>In Lords of War, Nicholas Cage plays Yuri - a completely merciless gun-runner, Jared Leto plays his cokehead brother, Ethan Hawke plays an Interpol Agent (why does Hollywood perpetuate this myth????) pursuing him, and Bridget Moynahan plays his completely in-the-dark wife. Cage is fairly convincing, but the script creates problems for his role. Leto and Hawke are outstanding.<br/><br/>The film chronicles Yuri's rise to power and the fulfillment of many of his dreams, falling victim to many clichés along the way, before yielding to an enormous cliché in the end.<br/><br/>While the film certainly spends a lot of time examining how guns are moved about illegally from place to place (and most of the scenarios are highly improbable), it really fails to make any profound points or provide any deep insight into the busine$$ of war. Anybody interested in seeing the film is very likely to know most of what this film tries to teach before they walk into the theater. It is difficult to imagine the film doing anything but preaching to its own choir.<br/><br/>So, if you think the business of selling arms is morally corrupt, and are entertained by seeing your own views illustrated in an exaggerated, propoagandistic and highly unrealistic manner, with a lot of voice-over in place of coherent visual narrative, then this might just be the film for you. O/W I can only recommend it for fans of the principal cast, whose performances outshine the story and the roles they were given."

","Cage stars as a rags to riches gunrunner whose lack of scruples leads him into interactions with civil war and unrest all around the world. Cage is there to profit off of all of them. But as his world starts to crumble around him, will Cage learn from his past? To be honest, I was a little shocked by the positive reviews from critics and audiences alike when I went onto the IMDb page after watching the movie. Was I watching the same film? There's not much going on here. The plot is glued together loosely by a series of wars throughout the world and the ever present Nick Cage. The editing in this movie left me scratching my head. Am I suppose to feel bad for Cage's wife and child I've seen for all of two minutes? I guess the message of this movie is we as a society need to focus more on stopping gun sales that help start civil wars and genocides but the film does a poor job of getting its point across.<br/><br/>The cinematography is fine but nothing spectacular. The constant voice over from Cage is unnecessary, made worst by the face that Cage was sleepy when read his lines. I was already rolling my eyes by the time the intro of the bullet was over.

"the_JX3","10","5","7","20 March 2011"," Great pacing, great stylistic choices, great story
","This is probably my favourite movie of all time, which is odd as I absolutely hate Nicolas Cage and the first time I saw the movie was only after five years of its release. I'm not a professional at this, but here's the down to earth reasons I can give.<br/><br/>To start of, I like the setting. The scenery is always great, were it a hilly view from Africa or a grey and misty military base from Ukraine. It's interesting how they've decided to emphasize different settings. New York is so grey and cold when Africa, where a lot of the movie is situated, is so warm and colorful, yet that is the place where the evil bidding is happening. It does support the moral conclusion of the movie, which tries to imply that Africa isn't the start and end of arms trafficking.<br/><br/>It's very fitting for the movie to be told from the first person and Cage has a pretty good voice for that. It gives the movie some character and allows you to step into the world of Yuri. The pacing is also really well done, it's exiting enough to not let you out of it's grip. I rarely get glued to the screen, but this movie did it to me.<br/><br/>I think Cage's tired smoky voice was perfect. He is very American and doesn't act or sound international nor Russian. I think it was the only part of his performance where he could've done better - maybe someone else would've been a better choice overall.<br/><br/>I don't like giving bonuses for doing something relating to moral questions, but I also like the plot and what the movie is about. I guess it's the little anarchist in me that likes to see how a Westener (like myself) think better of our leaders than we should - a lot is kept in the dark from us. The ending is as really good and it succeeds to be surprising. It conveys that evil ""won"", but the viewer can feel that in reality it wasn't a victory at all, more of a punishment. It's surprising and it reveals the basic of human nature, where greed often rises above anything else.<br/><br/>He married the perfect woman just to divorce her, got a son just to never see him again, drove his brother to drug addiction and finally to his death. His parents abandoned him. Whatever he gets from doing what he does, he is paying a hefty price and there's no end in sight."

","If this movie was three hours long and had a few more secondary characters it would have been the greatest movie of the decade. The story is a capturing tragedy, there are some brilliant ideas (the opening scene, the father pretending to be Jewish, the one night disappearing of the cargo, the lined up tanks shoot, Orlov's being a patron of the arts, the gasp after the encounter with the two prostitutes), the director had already showed his skills in setting up detailed and visually perfect representations (Gattaca), actors fit, lines are sharp, there's humor, but the whole thing looks like Niccol was in a hurry. And, maybe, a little too naive. Since when millionaire illegal arm dealers cruise all over the world without twenty fierce bodyguards? And, correct me if I'm wrong, Interpol has so many men, equipments and dollars at its disposal? Anyway, does it actually exist? And do lovely parents like those arrive at their son's marriage party after all the others? Weren't they at church? And what a coincidence having an uncle who is a colonel in the soviet army! And can a white guy in a suit survive more than five minutes alone in an African slum at night? And that blonde child! Didn't really Yuri suspect at all about his wife's loyalty? Too many shortcuts, imprecisions and anachronisms (for God's sake, couldn't they provide appropriate clothes for the seventies at least?). It's no big deal, all right, but they are distractions, they are the same of grammar mistakes in a book: they break your imagination and make you say -Hey, it's not real, I'm only watching a movie!- And that's the most anti movie thing that you can find in a movie. Worse if the movie is good."

About the only thing it did 'demonstrate', was that the world is not being supplied from gun shows. He makes is first arms contact at a Synagogue? I suppose the - 'lets take away all the sharp objects and drug everyone into submission' - crowd will get some mileage out of this movie. I'd say it is up there with 'Wag The Dog'. Interesting, but nothing new. Although Wag The Dog had more of a story content to it.<br/><br/>There were some scenes that were so bad, they were funny. When they changed the name of the ship. The ships name is on the bow too (the pointed end). Then when his, bimbo, wife comes to the 'realization' that her only value, in life, is her looks and that is fading. Lots of them around too.<br/><br/>Following the bullet? Yeah OK. Made for good drama, I guess, if you're looking for something to cry over. I think this movie is to superficial, to be informative. Following the money would have made more of a story, and would have been more 'educational'. But that wouldn't be a good career move, would it. Focusing on guns, is always good for a few bucks eh? Based on actual events? I expected to see something, at the end, to explain this. I guess it is up to the audience to go find out what 'events' this was based on. If this movie comes as a big shock to people, then they need to get out more.<br/><br/>I like Nicolas Cage, he is a good actor (this is the only reason I gave it a score at all). But even he couldn't help this movie. The color tone was terrible, when is Hollywood going to get some people in the editing room that know what they are doing? I wouldn't say this movie is a stinker, but I wouldn't waste the money to see it a theater either - it's rather boring. Wait for it to come out on DVD."

He goes on to become the biggest arms dealer in the world, with the law (Ethan Hawke) on his trail, constantly trying to get something on him. Yuri has everything - money, the woman of his dreams (Moynahan), a son, and a thriving business. But as he says himself, ""There are two types of tragedies in life. One is not getting what you want, the other is getting it."" The main character is based on a real-life arms dealer, Viktor Bout, who was finally arrested in 2008 during a sting operation and convicted in Manhattan in 2011 of conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens.<br/><br/>Despite its chilling subject matter, ""Lord of War"" manages to be funny at times, with brilliant dialogue -- and no easy answers. Narrated by the main character, we see the violence, the terror, the politics, and the corruption all around war and arms deals. Yuri tells us, ""I never sold to Osama Bin Laden. Not on moral grounds, it's just that his checks kept bouncing back then."" How it's possible to make any part of this film funny, I don't know, but Niccol gives us some great lines to remember. The humor is mostly in the beginning; later on, the film becomes deadly serious, almost like Yuri himself. It starts with selling a gun in his room for extra money; later, he's sitting with heads of countries.<br/><br/>As the cynical Yuri, Nicholas Cage is fabulous and makes you like him despite his profession and the fact that he starts down a slippery slope and keeps sliding. Jared Leto does a fantastic job as his coked-up brother and partner Vitaly, who, when faced with the reality of what they're doing, has feelings about it not entertained by Yuri.

He and Leto supposedly grew up in Brooklyn, but were devoid of even a hint of NY attitude, accents, or mannerisms. I don't even think they believed in the characters.

"powerfull_jedi","1","21","45","16 May 2006"," Does evil prevail? If people actually enjoyed this film, then probably the answer is yes...
","Why does this movie fail? Here's why: because it's ultimately superficial and you can't connect with the characters at all. Lord of War is about a Ukrainian man(Nicolas Cage) living in the US, who decides to become a gun smuggler after witnessing a heist and he also tries to win the love of his live, who is a talentless actress, in the process(I'm not making this up, honest). He starts small time(don't ask me how) with second hand guns and also invites his drug-addicted «brother» along, but being a gun smuggler doesn't sound easy. The movie chronicles his rise to becoming a gun smuggler and several encounters with buyers and occasionally trying to outmaneuver an Interpol agent in some of the most bizarre sequences I've ever seen. All through the movie, Nicolas Cage provides the voice over to the whole movie and I seriously wished he didn't. Obviously it's about gun smuggling and the movie tries to draw well-though(not really) ironies about this particular market and, as it's becoming more and more common, the role of the US in all of this(the United States of America as the root of all the problems in the world,of course, what do you expect?). It reminds me of Crash for the very same aspect: like racism, it thinks it's saying something new and revealing some overwhelming truth about gun smuggling. The movie pretends to be deep but it's message is nothing more complex then: Guns are bad; only innocent people get shot or are affected by the market(we all know this is true***sarcasm***);both legal gun sellers and black market dealers are evil(though the movie never explains this); owning guns automatically turns you into a crazy murderer(who needs facts? The scriptwriters think it's enough to show a struggling African country to make their point) ; if we didn't have any guns, people wouldn't kill each other(yes, true and deep); oh, and the US uses a corrupt court to fix the elections(I seriously laughed my butt off when they mentioned this in the movie) and is entirely responsible for everything mentioned above. Let's start with the characters, Nicolas Cage plays a Ukrainian gun smuggler who looks nothing like an Ukrainian, doesn't act like one and doesn't talk like one, not to mention he was a lifeless character, and his rants and monologue just drag the film and bores you to death. Jared Leto does no better and both act as if they're acquaintances rather then brothers or at least not any brothers I know of. The actress who plays Yuri's wife just stalls and the biggest offender is Ethan Hawke, the Interpol agent who has a «deep» sense of morality and wants to stop Yuri(Cage) at all cost, too bad he's barely a character, and his sense of morality is about as deep as a puddle of water,especially in moments where he could have given a lesson of morality to Yuri, he spills out something that seems more appropriate to cheesy action movies then a though-provoking thriller like this. In short you will feel no sympathy for any of the characters nor will you connect with them. If you already hate guns and will buy anything to support the cause,you'll like it, everybody else won't be convinced. One last thing:having the words ""based on true events"" in a fictional movie means absolutely nothing..."

A disgruntled employee tries to be the number-one global weapons dealer, selling weapons all around the world (from Africa to Latin America and the Middle East).

","The movie is so deep and really talks about a relevant issue in today's world. It's not like other brainless action movies out there that has the good guys that use guns blasting away bad guys. Director Andrew Nicol is a genius indeed. Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is not the hero nor the villain in this movie, he sell guns both to the good guys and the bad guys because it's good for business. It's a balancing act for the film, trying not to be too preaching, but also to be entertaining enough to be a really informative groundbreaking movie about the morality issues of having guns. The whole movie borderlines the saying 's It True That A Man Who Has Everything Has Nothing' with it's main character, Yuri. Nicolas Cage was great as always but his character was a little bit selfish & arrogant. Some people may hate his character too much to care about his story. Throughout the movie, everyone he loves is either dead by guns or he is dead to them. The only ""friends"" he has now are his vile customers and his shadowy benefactors from the bigger more vulnerable merchants of death. Like the amazing life of the bullet opening of the movie, we see Yuri as a fast bullet type businessman going through piercing the heart of both his love ones such as his brother Vitaly Orlov (Jared Leto) and wife (Bridget Moynahan) and those trying to destroy him like rival arm dealer Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm) and Interpol agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke). Jared Leto is great as Vitaly, a Jimmy Cricket's like character who serves as Yuri's conscience while suffering from yet another social issue: drugs. Bridget Moynahan gives her own, and delivers in what key scene in the buff no less. Ian Holm is chilling as the rival willing to do anything to be the top dog. Ethan Hawke is great as the pursuing boy scout with a code of honor to eliminate guns being sold. It was also funny how Yuri finds more elaborate ways of outwitting Jack Valentine throughout the film. The interrogation scene is one of the best. Key a eye on it, when watching. Still the image of the Interpol as an acting security agency is entirely fictional. Inspired by a true story, the movie go into great insight of world history with facts, by allow us the audiences to learn the in and outs of back-rooming arm-dealing during war conflicts. The locations were breath taking, and the strength of this film is the message its not just about guns, but also the fact we are a sad planet full of greedy homicidal people and if we don't change were going to become extinct. The ending is shocking, and I think it's importation for people to at less 'know that'. You might not like it, but the statement is true. Harsh critics of the movie will come to this point and find a way to ignored that fact due to feeling insulted. I find this habit of denial perhaps the most disturbing of humanity's flaws. It gets even scarier when you realize that you, yourself are guilty of it as a audience member cause you like watching violence movies. Humans are controlled by either greed or fear, and the movie shows that having firearms as inherently 'evil'. They have both given rise to oppression and birth to freedom. I guarantee you that people would still kill each other regardless if firearms exist or not. With that logic, sadly peace is really impossible. There will always be war and conflict as long as there is greed. Throughout the history of mankind its been this way. It's in man's nature to attempt to rule over one another, and by the end of Nicolas Cage little speech in the end. You would have to agree."
"pemeja","2","20","44","16 September 2005"," Bad action movie with pretensions
","This is a seemingly committed movie that, at first glance, has good intentions and pretends to say a lot; however, in the end, it is a flat and profoundly dishonest crowd-pleaser for action-movie goers, who might like guns, this (alas!) necessary evil, but who also have a nice bleeding heartfor arms dealers. <br/><br/>The Lord of War is Yuri an American of Ukrainian descent that decides to escape the bleak looking prospects of a life in Little Odessa for a lucrative business: arms dealing. Niccol tells all the Trivial Pursuit information concerning arms dealing through the cynical and tireless main protagonist's off voice, or through any of the nice characters that happen to be there when Niccol feels like being engagé and transcendent. His indignation seems sincere but he had trouble canalizing it in a story. Once we know the ""facts"" (startling if you have never opened a newspaper), he can focus on the story, or rather on the action. The movie wants so much to follow the different conflicts of the last twenty years that it races through diverse exotic locations and leaves little time to tell us a story and something about the characters. Yuri tells us his lucid view on the greed and cruelty that rule the world, on the ambiguity and ambivalence of international relations and armed conflicts, and yet, the characters that surround him in the story are the fairytale one-dimensional loving parents, wife, brother, kid and even an Ukranian general. All the characters are flat and embarrassingly cliché: the emigrants to the US are nice people with accent, the Russian mob is crazy, Ukranian generals are drunkards, but good-hearted, the beautiful girl, naïve and angelical, the Interpol agent, innocent and idealistic, and Africans are very bad or very good depending on whether they have guns or not. Curiously, only the Liberian dictator seems real. The weakest character is Yuri himself. His motivation to go into the dirty business remains obscure. Paradoxically, he is a bland and passive character, who seems to have entered the risky trade by chance, and who can change jobs overnight, when his wife manifests a much delayed indignation. It can be argued that since it is Yuri that tells his own story, he is seeking the audience's sympathy. But he tries too hard, and we cannot help thinking that he does so with the connivance of Niccol. We are shown a likable character, not because an aseptic Niccol wants to look as lucid and cynical as his protagonist, but because, in the end, Niccol like Yuri wants to please too many people. By leaving the story in the hands of his protagonist, he can appeal to a very demanding and highly ironic and smart public as well as to a wider male audience of American action-movie goers who, like Yuri, like guns, hot dumb chicks and subtle displays of humour and profound international knowledge about Russian cars and suicidal novelists, Aids in Africa, cocaine in South America. There is an unresolved contrast between the discourse and the story, between what the movie courageously says and what it cowardly shows. One scene epitomizes the movie fundamental dishonesty: when Yuri's plane loaded with arms lands on an African road full of people, not a single crushed body is shown, only a little baby miraculously saved as the huge wheel of the plane stops in front of him. In the end, the movie tells a story that we have seen a thousand times, and more harshly told, about the double life of a mobster with a dirty job but with a nice loving family. ""Lord of War"" is nothing more than a bad action movie with pretensions. The worst part is that ultimately it leaves us, the intended Western audience of pampered pop corn gobblers who have never (but seem to wish they had) smelled the nice perfume of napalm in the morning, with the same complacent and cynical attitude of the protagonist towards violence, gun trafficking and world-wide corruption."

","The story of an amoral arms dealer from New York could be made into an interesting movie, but this isn't it. ""Lord of War"" is a paint-by-numbers, preachy, finger-pointing, ""oh, isn't the arms trade so unethical and it kills kittens and puppies too"" piece of Hollywood garbage. Whatever happened to characters, stories and dialog? The big studios wonder why box office numbers keep declining, well its because of crap like this.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage stars and narrates the entire movie, as Yuri, the arms dealer, who with help of his brother, becomes an arms dealing kingpin. This movie takes you from his start, in Little Odessa, to his time at the top. It was a boring story with boring characters, where nothing happened. I couldn't sit through the entire thing."
"winopaul","1","22","50","7 March 2006"," Didactic = bad
","I hope Wal-Mart takes this back. It sucks on so many levels it is hard to detail them all. Even the commentary was unwatchable. It reminded me of bad software documentation. Load accumulator with AX. Move AX to ACC. No kidding? I can see what you shot--- how about something a little more interesting? (See Walk the Line commentary for greatness.) Now I didn't decide to take it back just because it sucks. I decided to take it back because of the lame-a$$ anti-gun screed complete with fake ""gun manufacturers"" included in the special features. I agree with Peter Tosh. ""Ain't gonna be no peace till man get equal rights and justice."" If people are not killing themselves with guns then they will use rocks. Or famine, the most popular tool of oppression. But give 30 Jews in the Warsaw ghetto guns and they can hold off an entire Nazi division for a month. That's why Hitler agreed with the creators of this movie-- first you take everybody's guns away.<br/><br/>But I digress. Anytime you have huge sections of voice-over narration it is a pretty good sign the scriptwriter can't tell a story. The story spins from one improbable scenario to another. If you know anything about guns, history or politics you will dwell on the errors and not pay attention to the (bad) story-telling. The African dictator was the only sympathetic character-- which says a lot about the other characters.<br/><br/>This rivals the badness of Dungeons and Dragons, the movie one perceptive commenter said: ""This is what happens when the director's mother owns a production company."" Yes, that bad. It is so pathetic hearing the creator's talk about their limited budget. Fifty million dollars is limiting? Look what Tarantino did with 1.2 in Reservoir Dogs. I guess when your purpose is proselytizing and not entertainment there is not enough money in the world to allow narcissists the tools to make everybody believe just what they believe.<br/><br/>Do not buy. Do not rent. Do not torrent. Do not watch.<br/><br/>If Wal-Mart won't take it back I am going to reverse shop-lift it onto their shelf just so the next poor guy can be disappointed without making any more money for the creators of this abomination."
"kennyr73","5","13","27","22 September 2005"," Nothing that great
","Not sure what all the hype was about. This movie, as most, states ""Based on Actual Events."" That's about like saying that Capricorn One is based on actual events. Arms dealing is serious problem, but the movie tried to glorify the gangsta vision of guns while appealing to the anti-gunners. Can't say that this is an excellent movie. Not epic. Not original. Some decent panoramic views, but nothing outstanding. Story was slow, over simplified and very fashion-oriented. I suppose if you are an NYC holier-than-though, posh and perfect actor, maybe you would appreciate this movie. Overall it was weak, and giving it a 5 was too generous."
"Joxerlives","10","5","8","10 December 2012"," Brilliant, entertaining and thought provoking film
","One of the few films in recent years where I walked out of the cinema and said to myself 'I'm going to buy that on DVD' then and there. Cannot praise it highly enough, great acting, an all time wonderful performance from Nic Cage eclipsing even 'Wild at Heart' and stellar supporting cast especially Eamon Walker. Great dialogue and such an intelligent film, so well written, you don't know whether to root for Yuri or Valentine. The final revelation about the UN in-security council had the audience both gasping and laughing at the same time. Surprisingly funny at times too and a quick scan of the newspapers reveals very true to life (would the US government use Yuri to supply the Syrian rebels whilst still having plausible deniability?). I love the gag where Yuri tells us that he never sold to Osama Bin Laden because he bounced cheques. <br/><br/>All told, the sort of film that you go to the cinema to see and how it didn't win an Oscar is frankly beyond me."
"bob-rutzel","7","5","8","23 January 2006"," Good Outline
","Uri Orlov (Cage) is an arms dealer who has no conscience and he does this work, why? Because he is good at it. And, if he didn't do it, someone else would. Pays pretty good too.<br/><br/>This is a good outline of someone who is an arms dealer. I say outline because it assumes we know a lot of things: how does he pay for the arms; where are the arms stored; how do they get from one location to another? I am sure there are more questions but you get the idea. Do we really need to know all the details? Probably not, but I say they should be addressed and not have the movie jump all around to show that he deals in the mid-East as well as Russia and Africa. If one instance was completely shown in the movie I think we can make a leap as to what the other deals involved. And, the movie does jump all around. Probably by design to keep us from getting the popcorn we craved when we first sat down.<br/><br/>However, I like Nicolas Cage and this is still a good movie despite too much jumping around from one location to another. He is an excellent actor and we do get the idea what this movie is all about. Where the movie could have saved itself more would have been to add more suspense and tension. There wasn't enough. It's entertaining and there are some very good lines in here or if you prefer, witticisms or truths may be an even better word.<br/><br/>The ending is somewhat of a shocker, but when you think about it, maybe not."
"mhajs","10","8","15","3 November 2005"," One Of Cage's best movies!
","**** out of ****<br/><br/>Let me tell you that this movie is one of the best I've seen this year. Nicolas Cage is a great actor and he's the type of performer who for me is one of the best: just the ones who can act expressing themselves in a very convincing way, not only by facial expressions or body language, but also by very strong lines throughout the entire movie. His narration is amazing. He plays Yuri Orlov, an arms dealer, who although risks his life very often (he travels to many distant and dangerous places including many locations from the east lands and even finds himself locked up in a room with two hookers, with no rubber and in a country where 25% of the people is infected with AIDS), is lucky at being good at it, since he gains money, has a beautiful wife and a son.<br/><br/>Like said before, most of the film is narrated by Cage. Even by paying attention to the self limit, it's not possible to absorb all of the great lines in this movie, and I must say I need to watch it again, however I won't pay to go to the theaters again, I'll wait it on DVD... The movie is about the life of an arms dealer, the difficulties of it, the advantages of a life like his own, consequences, and most important thing of all: not only a visionary movie about weapons, wars, injustice and etc., but, at the same time, a masterpiece of a protest, like a slap on the faces of the government people, or even, as the beginning of the movie suggests, a bullet in the head. <br/><br/>The cast includes actors like Jared Leto, who plays Orlov's brother, who, although is not an arms dealer like his older brother, do other acts in the movie that helps us see another point of view, which is very interesting, since we don't get bored just with the main plot of the movie. Bridget Moynahan plays Cage's wife in a much better role than hers in I, Robot (not that it means it was bad, not at all) and Ian Holm, who I admire since the good old times of Alien. <br/><br/>For people who didn't like the movie (like I checked on the IMDb's forum, this movie is for people who pay attention, have good tastes in movies' genres, not for people who aren't grown enough to see this movie's qualities yet)."
"simpletonistic","8","8","15","14 October 2005"," Warlord With Half a Heart
","Nicholas Cage plays Yuri Orlov, a displaced Ukranian who grew up in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, NY. In his early 40s, Yuri is a major player in black-market international arms dealing. We learn this via his narration, which is reminiscent of Ray Liotta's voice-over in ""Good Fellas."" The two men survive similar experiences: rapid success, daunting adventure, cocaine abuse, and, inherent in their chosen fields of endeavor, much trouble. Unlike Liotta's character's quest to become a ""made"" player in the Mafia, Yuri doesn't seem to have any goal in mind other than doing what he does best: deal. In fact, via his narration he ponders quitting and then tells us why he decided to stay in the arms-dealing game, ""I was good at it."" He's like an accomplished master chef who decides not to toss off his apron for to take a seat with patrons in the dining room. Instead, with the knowledge that it's hotter than hell in the kitchen, he stays put, knowing deep down that it is in the heat that he feels most alive.<br/><br/>Throughout his dealings Yuri is pursued by a straight-laced Interpol agent played by a scruffy-faced Ethan Hawke. Though the agent is on the right track in believing Yuri to be the arms-dealer he is, the agent is too tied to making the perfect collar--with all evidence 100% in order--to bring Yuri down. Hawke's main job in the movie seems to be to voice the liberal, anti-gun, human rights point-of-view. He does so, though one gets the feeling that he resorts to such rhetoric to abstain from his real goal: bringing Yuri down.<br/><br/>At one point in Yuri's career he decides to quit. Perhaps because of the agent's constant presence or perhaps due to the evolution of his heart. (Mind you, he gets out of the arms-running business into a lucrative business exploiting developing countries in other ways.) Naturally, this option to stay out is undermined when one of his former clients, the gun-crazed dictator of Liberia, strong-arms him into making one last killer deal.<br/><br/>If you dig Nicholas Cage, like I do, you'll like this movie. And, beware, you kind of have to like him because this is a very insular movie with not much to do with anyone else but Yuri. It does not have the emotional resonance of ""Constant Gardener"" but then again that movie suffered from knocking one over the head with its messages. <br/><br/>This movie avoids the knee-jerking, opting to let us judge for ourselves what's right and whose wrong."

","Lord of War Impressive performances, fascinating info-bytes and pertinent editorial, it feels too much like an illustrated lecture. Lord Of War drops the hammer slowly, laying out the fascinating parameters of Cage's world before opening up its argument in an astonishing denouement. Carefully choreographed devil's dance in which Nicolas Cage finds fleet-footed rejuvenation as a man aware evil can't exist without good, but that evil often wins. This uniquely unsympathetic, world-weary film earns the right to fling that truth. owe-red by a righteous anger, it is also very funny, stylish and daring. The morbidly fascinating subject and Cage's reptilian performance hold our interest. Unlike most Hollywood movies being made today, Lord of War actually has something to say.This film entertained me throughout, but it also provided me with a truly insightful look at the amoral world of trading man-killers."
"Alex-Tsander","1","16","37","23 August 2008"," An allegory wrapped up in lies passed off in a deception.
","The Lord of War.<br/><br/>This movie seems on the face of it intended to be ""read"" literally. On reflection, it ma\y have been intended as a metaphor. The reason being the beginning to end litany of wild factual errors and blatant un-truths. Indeed, some of these are of such magnitude that they even render the production's perspective invalid as a metaphor, let alone something that can be taken literally. Moreover, there are few ""cues"" to indicate to the unwitting that this is not meant to be taken at face value as a depiction of anything in reality.<br/><br/>This is illustrated by the way that the Cage character is shown being pursued around the globe by Ethan Hawkes ""Interpol agent"" and his gun toting team. There is no such thing in the real world as an ""Interpol agent"". Interpol is an information and liaison exchange, it does not employ investigators or field officers of any kind, let alone ones armed to the teeth whizzing into foreign territories around the globe. The ""Interpol agent"" and his team could, however, be interpreted as a metaphor for the real life pursuit of arms-traders which is an office-based, data-chasing operation by that agency. But there is nothing to indicate to anyone unaware of these facts that the gung-ho ""Interpol agent"" and his gang are not based in any reality. Therefore, far from operating in the realms of metaphor, it simply becomes a lie.<br/><br/>Similarly, the Cage character tells us that his trade is based in the plentiful availability of the AK47. We are told that it was the standard weapon of the Soviet Union up until the collapse of the USSR. Wrong: The standard weapon of the Soviet Union became the AK74M twenty years before the U.S.S.R collapsed. A weapon based on the same design but in a much smaller calibre and quite different to the older 7.62mm weapon encountered around the world today. The Cage character was shown buying up large quantities of AK47 at the end of the Cold War from Russian units that had long before ceased to posses that weapon. It was on the basis of such deals that we were told that the AK47 ended up in the ""wrong"" hands all over the world today. In fact, quite the opposite is true: that it was the Soviet Union that exported the AK47 in immense quantities to virtually any government or terrorist organisation that could be relied upon to make trouble for the West and our allies. They did so on such terms that they were virtually given away free, to states and thugs all over the world from Cuba to Cambodia. This is easily verified by anyone who stops to consider how long the AK47 has been in use in every region, decades before the collapse of the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>Of course, there are new AK47's but these are marketed by both the Russian state and the U.S. government. They obtain theirs from a factory in the Ukraine which has recently been in a patent dispute over this with the original manufacturer, Izshmash Baikal.<br/><br/>The entire thrust of this movie is predictably an attempt to portray the plentiful and easy availability of weapons in the Third World as being the responsibility of irresponsible American or Anglo-Saxon capitalists. It isn't. The facts show it. Even that hoary old chestnut about Britain and the U.S having supplied Saddam Hussein with his weapons is a myth: his main armourer was the Soviet Union, second to which being France, whose opposition to the 2003 invasion may have been not unconnected to the fact that they were hoping to claim billions of Dollars back-payments for weapons already supplied. They still are seeking this money from the present Iraqi government.<br/><br/>By the way, the AK47 is a copy of a WW2 German design, the MP44. Mr Kalashnikov merely reverse-engineered it to suit low grade Soviet manufacturing standards and ill-educated peasant soldiery. If you want to pin that evil products bloody legacy on anyone, it is his responsibility!"

It took me several days and I had to watch it in chunks.<br/><br/>The characters are two dimensional and I didn't care about any of them; I didn't believe the relationships--ever. The acting, writing, directing-- mediocre at best. Any more, Nick Cage frankly looks strange; it is like he is always trying to look like a movie star (thin, tan, and shiny smile) rather than the characters he portrays. Jared Leto was irritating--it looked like he was auditioning for a bigger part in which he could chew all the scenery all the time. Ethan Hawke was not convincing as a tough government agent ( I don't why he keeps playing cops; he comes off way too wimpy), and the woman who played the wife was the most mediocre of all.

In the name of realism it is unabashedly violent at points.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage as the gun runner himself, is often affected by the moral conundrums of his stock and trade. The real conflict in the story is how he resolves these anomalies.<br/><br/>At the same time, the film does not glamorize the gun trade at all. At no point does it say that gun runners are actually really decent guys.

"bob the moo","Null","5","9","30 October 2006"," Despite the weaknesses inherent in the delivery and approach, this is an engaging and slick film on an important and depressing issue
","As a boy in Brighton Beach, Yuri Orlov realises that, while some people open restaurants because all men will need to eat, other men sell guys becomes man will always want to kill. Starting out in a grubby hotel room selling a single gun, Yuri uses his local connections to increase his trade. The end of the Cold War opened up huge stocks of weapons to be illegally skimmed off and sold abroad and soon all of Yuri's dreams are coming true  even his childhood infatuation with Ava Fontaine. However as his reputation and sales grow he comes under pressure form two forces closing in on him; one is a determined government agent Jack Valentine, the other is the morality of the business he has made his own.<br/><br/>Whether or not it is based on a true story or not, the truth inherent in the material to make it an impacting and engaging story. The opening credits tell the whole story and it is shame that it never gets as good as the moments where we follow a bullet from the factory to the skull of a child somewhere in Africa. However the reason it doesn't is because the gun trade isn't as simple as evil men doing evil things  it is a business and it is a business that my own elected officials in the UK are a major part of. So although it makes for a weaker film in some ways, it deserves credit for not offering any easy answers (or indeed any answers) and offers up this world in a way that is sickeningly convincing and yet realistic. The plot relies heavily on the slick delivery that is told from Yuri's point of view and totally in flashback. It does fragment the film and prevent the development of characters and depth but it does keep things moving well and allows Niccol to make his points well. As a result some of the narrative threads are dull (Yuri's relationship with his wife is weak) but it does achieve what it sets out to achieve, which is a fast ride through the world illegal arms trading.<br/><br/>Those who have caught Mark Thomas' shows will know that there are sharper vehicles that this subject has been handled in and indeed the film could have been more impact, funnier and darker but for a Hollywood film I can forgive it because it does tackle an unusual subject. This buys it some leeway but not all the weaknesses can be overlooked and some viewers may tire of the pace and delivery of the film before it is over. The cast are mostly caught up in the film rather than playing it because they are not allowed the time to develop or emote. As the story is his, Cage does dominate. It isn't a great performance but it works and he pitches his character well neither moral or immoral, just doing business and earning money just like everyone else. Moynahan does well with what little she is given but Leto is asked a lot of and cannot deliver it convincingly. Holm and Hawke deserve credit for adding their names to this ""issue"" film but other than that they don't add a great deal. Walker is a solid presence as Baptiste even if he is a bit one dimensional a character.<br/><br/>This is not a perfect film then, mainly because the flow and stylish delivery means that points are made in a sweeping rather than targeted fashion, while depth and character development are left to one side. However it is engaging because the subject is an emotive one and it is hard to be disinterested. Mark Thomas has done it better (and will do it better) but it is praiseworthy for a Hollywood film with such clout to raise awareness of the issue and it is a good film even if it does have these problems throughout."
"spooly_montana","10","5","9","11 April 2006"," Arms Dealing 101
","I can compare LORD OF WAR in a sense to another movie based on actual events, the movie 'Blow' with Johnny Depp. Showing a person in a ""hero"" role, doing some illegal moving of products for profit/thrill, and then the downside of that trade. This movie concentrates on the characters behind arms dealing. The redeeming quality of the movie is the mostly inner turmoil shown in the lead character played by Nicolas Cage. Look into those descriptive eyes of his as he sells a load of weapons and you see a myriad of emotions portrayed. I have actually spoken with people who do not like Cage as an actor, who liked this movie a lot. The opening credits show a bullet being made, and its point of view down the manufacturing line and into a box shipped to some far off land, and then its final destination: some victim in a firing squad in Africa. War is a very big and lucrative business. For every bullet fired, money goes into someone's pocket, and that someone needs war for the paycheck. That is satirically shown in one scene when a man fires an AK-47 along with a cash register ring timed with every shot. Cage plays Yuri Orlov, who grew up in a Ukrainian family in Little Odessa, New York. Instead of opting to go into the restaurant business, he becomes an arms dealer. He talks his brother Vitaly (wonderfully played by Jared Leto), into helping him in this new career venture. Yuri turns out to be especially gifted in this chosen profession, and excels at every turn, gaining larger and larger clientele and business in the competitive world of dealing arms. Interpol agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) is hot on Yuri and Vitaly's trail as they negotiate deals in everything from guns to tanks with some of the world's dictators and aggressors. Yuri stuffs any scruples he might have about the nature of the trade. But as the business gets bigger, the stakes get higher. Yuri marries his beautiful fantasy woman, model Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan), and has a son, setting up a very nice apartment in Manhattan for them all. His wife is virtually in the dark, wanting to know what her husband Yuri does, but choosing instead to be trusting and optimistic. This movie traces the years in the beginning (1980s), up to the present. The Cold War and countless dictatorships are just ""dates on the calendar"" for Yuri, as he minimizes the human tragedy of it all. This movie explores the moral implications of the trade, but does not tell you how to feel per se. You will laugh at some things which you should not laugh at, come face to face with the world's wars in a different way, and appreciate the gravity of the human conflicts occurring constantly all around the world. This movie is very entertaining, and very well done. I really enjoyed the great edgy visual style, with wonderful narration by Cage, who is on fire and leaps off the screen in this role. Jared Leto plays the coked out brother who wrestles with what they are doing. Ethan Hawke is the idealistic agent who wants to get out there and catch the bad guy. Nobody is perfect. That is the reality of life. This movie is rated R, which is no surprise due to the violence and subject matter."

","I 100% agree with those who believe that only Nicholas Cage is the only actor who can make us not-hating Yuri and even feel sympathy for him. Though a gun-seller who earns, let's say his living and not his millions, out of death selling, Cage convinced us that he is trading in no more than a double-faced merchandise. As he says arms can be killing no more, if not less than, cigarettes or cars can. Both kill if used heavily, rashly, or badly. The privilege in his merchandise, arms, is that it has a safety tool that hinders the trigger while cigarettes, cars, and alcoholics do not have similar security tool !! I am convinced with his logic or even his justification. <br/><br/>The feeling for admiration and sympathy did not faint from me, at lest, for Yuri till the end of the movie. Though he is selling death with a cold blooded heart I have never missed tenderness in his eyes and acts with his wife and kid and more strongly with his brother. I believe that Cage deserves to win the Oscar for his marvellous performance in the scene when his dear brother, who was felt as a son to him, was brutally shot by the very weapons he is barging. The way he tried to save him, the strained tears in his angry eyes, and the way he continued dealing with the killers of his brother are all fertile lessons for any acting learner or fan. <br/><br/>Any other actor may act the character of Yuri; however, it will, definitely, end by hating Yuri and his death-business. Cage made us rethink more than once in the whole philosophy of gun-market and its inevitable necessity without losing our sympathy and admiration for Yuri/Cage. <br/><br/>The narrative voice of Cage all over the proceedings of the film, sorry for using ""proceedings"" as I work in the Law field, made a homey human background that lessened some violent scenes. Though some Cinema watcher may not like it; I find it indispensable as many sciences and behaviors can never be felt and understood if it is removed. It was like an echo or mirror of Yuri's deep conscience which he wishes and pretends not to have though it is still lurking and paralleling his actual conduct. I felt the same with the narrative voice in ""National Treasure"" as the voice only, even without his appearance embodies and recalls visions and feelings not written in the script.<br/><br/>I can not end without respecting the daring implications and condemnation conveyed to Machiavelli political attitudes in the US and in the third world. <br/><br/>Good work Cage and all movie Crew who entertained us courteously, thank you all.

","Nicholas Cage and this movie should have been nominated for an Academy Award. If you are a Cage fan, then this is him at his best. His character is that of an amoral (not immoral) international arms dealer. He portrays a man who is driven, not by avarice, but by his ""addiction"" to the high he gets from ""making a deal"". On a micro- level truly is a movie about an addiction which feeds upon its main character. On a macro- level it really is about the global societal impact of the international arms trade. There are no dull moments, no questions about what is going on, and really no give aways about how this movie will end. I think is is Cage's best (after Leaving Las Vegas). The sets and attention to detail are impressive. The movie really was a ""global"" adventure.<br/><br/>Even the lead into the movie (where the title and initial credits are given) is a well choreographed visual and musical production by itself. I could watch it again and again. The pace and the rhythm of the lead-in is maintained throughout the entire movie."

""Man"", his obsession with money, power, greed, and war that consumes the innocents of man kind as well as our very existence. How can a man have family values, but at the same time kill families and sleep at night? The evil that is in man's inner sole is running wild openly through out our world. Is this meant for just blacks to kill themselves. This film also showed black on black crime in Africa. Here in America, the same evil exist. They portrayed blacks as raw savages.

","Sold as a black comedy--in which the laughs are the main point, it's really a satire or satirical drama/tragedy. This is more along the lines of films like UNDER FIRE and SALVADOR than DEAL OF THE CENTURY. And all the better for it. Easily the best film from this writer/director. It's free of the irritating trendy jump cutty style of the day but is very stylish and evocative. It's I suppose a comedy of the absurd and of the inescapable in this (the film's and our's to a great extent) war happy world.<br/><br/>But the tone is perfect throughout and there is nice use of songs in the film and a fascinating scene where poor people take apart an airplane--it's like watching ants eat a dead animal, leaving only the skeleton.<br/><br/>It feels like an honest movie about the greed and wheeling and dealing of selling guns. It's fun to watch someone succeed and that keeps your interest even as you and the character realizes the horror of what it's really all about. You may say, of so it has a preachy or mock heroic ending. No it doesn't go that way either. A perfectly made movie about the commerce of war and that's the element that this film argues drives the whole thing. Cage's character says once, ""I'd rather they fire my guns and miss as long as they fire my guns."" I won't go on and on and tell you it's an important movie, but it is very involving entertainment. Not amusement. Entertainment, it's about something without feeling like a sermon. Forget the bad ad campaign and give it a chance. In years to come this film may well be remembered long after the ""hits"" of this rather weak movie year have faded."
"art25","10","5","9","18 October 2005"," A film based on exploring two fundamental contradictions. Superb.
","I notice that this film has suffered some rather harsh reviews from critics. Many have argued that the film is incapable of dealing with the need to entertain and the need to inform. Yet most of these reviews seem to have missed the point. On one level the film is an exploration of how a seemingly rational and loving man (towards his family) could become one of the world's most successful arms dealers. On another level the film is a critique of how we, as the audience, want to view this man. Should we be entertained? Or should be be shocked - by the information that is given to us? Returning to the first aim of the film - an exploration of a man becoming an 'Angel of Death' (as he is referred to at one point), it is clear that in part he actually (rather worryingly, it would seem) enjoys his work. Sure it can get rather nasty at times, but as he informs his wife, he can't stop selling arms because he knows he is really good at it. The same can be said for the audience. We 'want' to be entertained by what we see. Yet at the same time we know our enjoyment comes from watching innocents suffer - horribly. How can we, as the passive audience, attempt to reconcile these two factions within us? Should be become as detached as Nic Cage? Or should we hold a higher moral authority? If we do hold that authority, what point is there is even trying to enjoy the movie? This is the contradiction the director seems intent to explore. Just like his earlier films, SimOne and The Truman Show, he is interested in our own ability to want to be entertained, and need to be entertained at all costs - even to the extent of deluding ourselves. What right do we have to criticize Nic Cage's character in the film when we actually are rather happy to go along for the ride and watch lots of sh*t blowing up?"

","This was directed by Andrew Niccol, who directed one of my favorite films Gattaca, and also a really crappy one called Simone. This movie starts out with Nicolas Cage and his family moving from the Ukraine to New York City and they open a restaurant that isn't doing too well. There a lot of Russian gangsters in the area and Cage gets the idea to become an arms dealer after witnessing a murder. Cage and his brother, played by Jared Leto, become partners but things start out slow. It's the early 80's and they slowly work there way up to the top. Leto becomes addicted to cocaine and by the time the soviet union comes apart, Cage has become one of the top arms dealers. Ethan Hawke plays an agent who really wants to bring Cage down but he just has too many connections. It's a great film and i hope this movie is a big hit."

","Combined with the recent release of ""The Constant Gardiner"", September 2005 is shaping up to be a good month for films concerning, even in part, Africa. While both films use the tried and true device of having white protagonists through which the (one assumes) white audience can relate (do you ever think that white people will ever be allowed to see black people as fully human?), ""The Lord of War"" seeks to comment on how Western arms dealers, and their client manufacturers and nations, cause misery and strife on a global scale.<br/><br/>Director Andrew Niccol helps Nick Cage deliver a relatively understated performance in a film that teeters on farce, but never quite goes over the edge. Niccol directs his actors in a uniformly believable manner. The script, director and actors all appear to have taken this project on as their moral statement. Like ""Gardiner"" ""The Lord of War"" gives a damn.<br/><br/>Some of the situations depicted are far too gruesome to make light of. Cage portrays an American arms merchant who travels the world to enrich himself, and to accumulate the accouterments of success. His character arc is that of an individual debating the morality of what he does, even as he is confronted with the immoral results. The purveyor of death, though, is hardly allowed to have the ""good life"". Can he emerge at the end of the film redeemed or punished? Or, is there another dramatic outcome? The film is as close to as perfectly constructed as one could hope: the domestic scenes counterpoint the globe-trotting and worldly events, as well as contradicts them: can one who contributes so much social disruption be allowed to have a 'normal' life? The cinematography provides some beautifully constructed shots. The locations are authentic (Czech Republic and South Africa). The music spans cultures and accentuates the drama, rather than trying to sell soundtrack albums. Producer Nick Cage appears to have put his ego aside to develop a film that is entertaining while at the same time preachy and didactic. Cage is definitely part of a greater whole, that whole being one of the best films of the year, and required viewing for people who give a damn."

Col. Oliver North clone is known as Col. Oliver Southern and played at least once by Donald Sutherland, a noted Republican backer (detractor?). He wears a Marine Officer's hat in at least one scene but I am never going to buy the DVD or go back to see it again to check out the uniform stuff. Of course he is the CIA agent that has Orlov run guns for him, acts as his ""get out of jail free"" card and intercedes with Interpol. Oh, yeah, Interpol. Interpol is a clearing house of information - there are not roving bands of SWATesque Interpol agents intercepting shipping, rousting people on the docks and detaining folks in NYC. And if Liberia has handfuls of Blood Diamonds, why do they need a schmuck middleman from Long Island when a dozen countries would gladly (and covertly) sell him the guns and ammo? This movie debuted between Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the fall of 2005 and the scene where Orlov is talking about hurricanes coming out of no where and another when locals are stripping an airplane both got laughs. During the latter some theatre patrons were heard to joke, ""Looks like they landed in New Orleans"". Orlov comments that trying to get ahead legally is hard work - well, welcome to the United States. The constant references to the US being the largest arms dealer, the US having a kangaroo court to fix the 2000 elections, the US turning a blind eye to crime the government commits, the US supporting rebels, the US police unable to catch Orlov but giving the Liberian President a motorcycle escort got to be too much. In reality, Orlov would have been gotten by the IRS for ""lifestyle"". And if indeed Orlov did get in the way of established arms dealers, he would not still be alive. The ""R"" was for the F-words and not the marginal nudity. Perhaps the greatest stumbling block for me was Cage. Nicholas Cage, gifted actor no doubt, but so much more believable as the inept lover in Moonstruck or the first time burglar in National Treasure. He was just not believable as an Italian Officer in Capt. Correlli's Mandolin (whatever) and I just can't see him as a smooth international dealer - Ian Holm, yes, but not Cage. If you like seeing Reagan, Bush 41 and Bush 43 bashed, plus the CIA, Supreme Court and American military structure all derided, then this film will have some extras for you. ******* Spoilers be ahead******* Suspension of disbelief required for a powered landing by a four engine turboprop (Soviet variant of C-130) to be silent and with all the people scrambling for a last minute avoidance of the plane that no one gets beheaded by the props?!?!?!

","Lord of War (2005) Directed by Andrew Niccol Starting Nicholas Cage, Bridget Moynahan, Jared Leto, Ethan Hawke<br/><br/>Lord of War follows the career of Yuri Orlov, a poor immigrant from the Ukraine who eventually becomes the world's leading arms dealer. The nature of selling and buying weapons and how arms deals are worked out is explained through Orlov's many interactions with his clients, from Russian generals to African war mongers. According to Orlov, he ""has sold guns to every army except the salvation army."" From the interesting opening montage which follows the life of a bullet, the movie both informs and entertains, exposing to the audience the details of arms trafficking without becoming preachy. The script is superb, as the dialogue is sharp and witty, and delivered well by the cast. Nicholas Cage, manages to play Orlov as a morally and emotionally detached person, yet we understand why he does what he does. Cage is perfect as Orlov, as we never sympathize with him, nor detest him, we simply see him and his actions, and are allowed to form our own opinion. Bridget Moynahan plays the wife who doesn't ask Orlov the important questions, because she doesn't want to hear the answers, and when she finally does, it's too late. Jared Leto plays the little brother, who cannot detach himself from the industry as easy as his big brother. Finally, Interpol agent Jack Valentine is played by Ethan Hawke, who's the strong-willed yet naive cop, whose morals never waiver. (very similar to his role in Training Day) When he has the chance to kill Orlov and stop the flow of guns into the hands of murderous guerrilla armies, he doesn't. ""Who would know?"" his fellow agent asks him, ""people disappear all the time around these parts"", to which Valentine answers, ""We will."" Valentine's deep convictions and moral standards is an interesting contrast to Orlov's moral detachment. In a critical scene, Valetine tells Orlov that ""you get rich by giving the poorest people on the planet the means to continue killing each other nine out of ten war victims today are killed with assault rifles and small arms. Like yours. Those nuclear missiles, they're sitting in their silos. Your AK-47, that is the real weapon of mass destruction."" However, Orlov responds by citing the statistics which reveal that more people are killed by cigarettes and alcohol related problems per year than firearms. Lord of War achieves what Bowling for Columbine (the controversial Michael Moore documentary on gun control) aimed for but failed, to give information and raise awareness about the issues of guns and weapons, all while being an entertaining movie. We are given information on the situation and left to ponder the question, do guns kill people or do people kill people?<br/><br/>9/10"

Things that, in some dark recess of our consciousness, we know very well exist, but somehow make us feel uneasy to contemplate in the light of day. Also, I think LORD appeals to fans of films that require the use of gray matter and applied consciousness.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, it is clearly a striking example that reality is often far stranger than fiction. Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is a Ukrainian- American who walks aimlessly through life. When he witnesses a failed kidnapping attempt at a Ukrainian restaurant in Little Odessa, resulting in the death of the two murderers, Orlov has a kind of demonic epiphany: People simply cannot live without weapons to kill their neighbors! <br/><br/>Andrew Niccol (The Terminal, The Truman Show, Gattaca) in addition to serving as director, has written and produced ""LORD"" ... quite a versatile man, most definitely! Like his compatriot, Peter Jackson, Niccol is an example of the growing influence of New-Zealanders in Hollywood. And here, he shows us a film that is in no way easy to catalog! Protagonist Orlov is a man whose entire life is a lie, and like many who lead a double life, Yuri Orlov ends up believing totally the myth in which he has enveloped himself! <br/><br/>So as to reveal no more than necessary, suffice to say that in its last half hour, there are some interesting surprises. Nicolas Cage deserves special recognition, not only for his excellent work here, but for the maturity he has shown recently in his choice of subject matter and tone! After several years of appearing predominately in action-flavored movies, it seems Cage has opted to change course a little.

The film is told with a serious tone (as it deserves) but there are elements of black humour in there and it never gets bogged down in the politics or morality.<br/><br/>Lord of War tells the story of Yuri Orlov, a Ukrainian immigrant who eventually becomes a major player in the international arms trade. As well as dealing with his business and the moral issues faced it also shows the impact his occupation has on the rest of his life, most tellingly his brother.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent all round, there is not a performance that could be criticised. Cage plays his morally dubious character perfectly, managing to inspire sympathy without ever letting you forget that all his devils are his own creation.<br/><br/>The opening scene showing the 'life' of a bullet is an excellent opener and, stylistically, the highlight of the film.

The story chronicles the life of a Ukranian immigrant who eventually decides to sell guns internationally. The story tracks every progression he makes until ultimately becoming the most well known gun runner in the world. The main message of the movie is that war is fact, that war will always be, and therefore so will people willing to support war.

"MrVibrating","10","4","7","27 June 2006"," Good-looking and important.
","The subject of gun-running is very political, very heavy and very unpleasant. Still, Niccol manages to turn this grave theme into a slick, sometimes funny, often emotional and very involving biopic.<br/><br/>The story of Yuri Orlov, the Ukrainian immigrant who builds his gun-running empire from nothing, is intertwined with gun-running 101, the wars and conflicts of the 20th century, and corruption in the worlds largest governments. At points it reached the level of political-ism that can be called preachy, but steers off at the right time.<br/><br/>Some scenes are very gripping. Some scenes make you shake your head since they are so absurd but still true. Example:(MILD SPOILER)""The AK47... It's so easy, even a child can use it; and they do."" Some scenes are very darkly humorous. There's even a romantic relationship, and it's more realistic than many in movies.<br/><br/>The camera-work is super. It doesn't succumb to any modern fads, like shaky camera JJ Abrams-style, or other silly techniques that ruin movies these days. Instead, we get crisp, sharp and colourful scenes. Russia is cold, dark, gray-green, Liberia is dusty, colour-rich and warm. Watching Lord of War is a treat.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage redeems himself after National Treasure. This is not his best performance, but a good one. Bridget Moynahan is boring as usual. That's just a personal annoyance though. Jared Leto works well as Yuri's crazed brother, and Hawke is good as the Interpol agent.<br/><br/>One of the best performances comes from Eamonn Walker, as the sadistic Charles Tailor/André Baptiste. He and his son are both cruel to the point of silliness, which is exactly what you can say about African dictators.<br/><br/>Lord of War is one of the better movies of 2005. It's important, it's well-crafted(the intro sequence is awesome), it's well-acted and well worth the money."

Great music. The writing is really snappy, reminds one a lot of Raymond Chandler.

","Lord of WAR, what can be said about this amazingly dynamic drama that has been crafted, except for ""WONDERFUL"" Lord of WAR tells us the ugly truth of the life of an Arms Dealer (Yuri Oralv, played by Cage) as he struggles through becoming the best at what he does. Yuri goes from being a small time no one to an all around bad ass and 'walking genocide' Lord of WAR displays amazing acting and is a rivetingly dramatic film that will entertain the high brow audience who care more for story and depth rather than senseless violence and action. If you thought like me, that Lord of WAR would be an action movie you thought wrong. However I wasn't disappointed in the least at the movie for what it was. Lord of WAR will enthrall and entertain you from start to finish with its unique originality and directing.<br/><br/>All in all Lord of WAR in my opinion is a great movie that Drama seekers and Cage fans should go see and enjoy.

","In my opinion this movie is a masterpiece. The suspense, the black humor and tension are extremely well mixed in this one. I think this is one of the best movies with Nicholas Cage as a primary character. This is a realistic movie with characters resembling real ones. They act very unpredictable, as in real life, adding to the tension as you can't guess what the next step will be. There are no bad or good guys, there is no black or white there are just shades of Gray, as the main character himself notices. Althrough the CIA guy, which represents somehow the good side (if such side exists) in the world of violence seemed to be also corrupted by violence. Through the movie we take notice of the old saying ""He who draws the sword will die by the sword"". It strikes from the beginning that the main character is a very complex and well depicted one. Is not your regular mobster with a gun at people's head. Somehow he has a sense of justice buried deep inside him, who is hunting him down in his depressions. Highly adaptable, is learning quick from his friends or foes alike. In a word he's a survivor, outwitting the competition and everything that stands in his way. Somehow his reasons are uncertain even for him as he discovers that he has no real motive for doing it, money being out of the question. A masterpiece movie in my opinion, which i give a ten out of ten. A must see for every people who still thinks violence is the way to do things. The movie gives a warning to all democratic states of the globe to understand the danger and consequences of global inequality, poverty and violence."

"eme-9","5","5","10","13 March 2006"," A String of Anecdotes Rigged to Make the Author Look Good
","I cannot understand how those TV critics gave this film two thumbs ""way"" up. This is the season of overrated movies maybe.<br/><br/>Voice-over narrators are not inherently bad. In SMALL doses they work well, say, in detective stories, and movies where the main character--not the author or biographed person being portrayed by an actor--but a fictional CHARACTER--is doing the narration, for example, in the fabulous Kind Hearts and Coronets, or in Lolita. A narration, whether it's purpose is to ""cover"" events of 20 years, or to manipulate the audience into thinking/feeling a certain way--a la TV's Desperate Housewives--is not a substitute for a plot, and the necessary UNITY a good plot must evince in order to produce an emotional reaction in the audience to the events the main character undergoes. That unity cannot be glued on by a voice-over narration. A good plot must show--you've heard this term--an ""arc"". This is what produces catharsis--why YOU watch movies, or read novels. People, that is, consumers, are most often concerned with ""what is the movie about?"" But subject matter is only part of a story. The same subject matter in Lords of War can be seen on TV news and tabloid shows, and even Frontline. I seek something more from movies and books. I seek magic, escape, satisfaction.<br/><br/>It takes guts to set yourself free from ""what happened"" and turn real events--by selecting some, and eliminating others--into a real story. Telling ""true"" stories is most often a straight jacket on artistic story-telling. ""But it didn't happen that way,"" squawks the person whose precious story is being told. The collaborating writer shrugs and rewrites the scene, removing material which might have helped create a better STORY. An example of an excellent, compelling movie ""based on true events"" was Shattered Glass. Lord of War is a mediocre movie, at best ""watchable"", but unsatisfying. <br/><br/>Just because it contains the obligatory moral-of-the-story doesn't make it good. Message movies never get out of their own way. Actually, the moral of Lord of War is curious and a bit too facile--Uri justifies his profession because the U.S government is the world's largest arms dealer, so what right does the U.S. gov have to persecute/condemn him? <br/><br/>It's EASY to get a rise out of people by depicting gore--bullets smashing into heads, etc. It is much harder to bring the audience to satisfaction by telling a great story with great characters."
"Animus","8","5","10","18 September 2005"," An interesting, if somewhat unfocused, movie...
","I liked the movie, but over all it seems to become less than the sum of it's parts. Acting-wise its put together seamlessly. While Nicholas Cage has not always chosen wisely in his acting roles, he does an admirable in his portrayal of the lead in Lord of War. In fact most of the actors seem well suited to their roles. The script seems solid enough and well written. It is in the focus of the movie seems to be missing. Lord of War starts out as a sort of black comedy then becomes a morality tale and ends more as political statement, the movie cant seem to decide if it wants to be entertaining, thought provoking, or just prompt political and moral outrage in the audience. A good film, if a bit confusing on that note."
"spam-me-punk","9","5","10","17 September 2005"," Engrossing film, an excellent look at an ironic situation
","Personally I found this film to be quite thought-provoking. When you see a war taking place on the news you never really stop to think, I wonder who is profiting from this? This film really brings this into light and highlights this issue that we normally prefer to ignore. Cage, who plays the main character, finds himself struggling between whether what he is doing is right or not and continuing the ""one thing he is good at"". I really felt all the actors did a superb job of bringing there characters to life. I especially like the style of the movie, the monologue by cage's character fits in very well with the overall purpose of the film and the movie itself has a very raw feel to it. Overall, I hope that others will look past this film as being simply 2 hours of entertainment and really consider the ideas that are brought up this film, is it right that the five biggest arms-dealing countries are also the leaders of the United Nations? It is definitely food for thought."
"citizenchris","4","10","25","17 September 2005"," Beware of Dog!
","I used to think Andrew Niccol was a promising new director...that is until this film. In a word it is bad, for more reasons than I am willing to name in this space. I had a bad feeling early in the film when Jared Letto's character gives his brief but gut wrenching explanation of the ""beware of dog"" sign in his kitchen. It felt like a 14 yr old trying to be poignant. Which in many ways is what the entire film feels like. The film is primarily a poorly written yet sincerely acted drama...a bad combination. The worst part is when the film tries to be a dark comedy. Not because the comedy doesn't work but because it does. For various fleeting moments through out the films two hours (or so) it shines as a witty satirical take on the state of gun running. But unfortunately before you know it these moments are gone and its back to cardboard flat characterizations of pointless clichés that pass as characters. ""Gattaca"" was brilliant, ""The Truman Show"" (as written by Mr. Niccol) was amazing, ""Simone"" was misunderstood but ultimately flawed (perhaps the studios fault?). But no studio can be blamed for this waste of my hard earned $$"
"Antagonisten","3","6","13","27 February 2006"," One thought
","One thought went through my mind as the overblown starting credits to this movie rolled over the screen: MTV. Without MTV we wouldn't have movies like this one. I remember seeing a sort of AIDS-themed weekend on MTV once, and this movie is like that weekend only here we are dealing with guns. So if MTV ever chose to do an ""MTV: Gun Weekend"" it would be something like this movie.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage (looking more or less constantly bored) is the hotshot arms dealer in this movie. A Ukrainian American starting out with small deals on UZI:s and ending up selling half the Ukrainian Soviet arsenal to third world countries at war. And all the while, not a single emotion shown in any of the characters. Except perhaps from the perpetually depressed dope-head brother of Cage, played by Jared Leto.<br/><br/>I don't demand much from movies like this one. Sure a pop-culture styled drama about guns could work. But here we have a movie that also wants to portray a person that should at least be halfway believable and who is supposed to be an amalgam of a bunch of real arms-dealers. And yet, with all those personalities in him we don't get a schizophrenic person, rather we get a cardboard character. A person completely bereft of any humanity. He just walks through life doing things like a machine, never saying ""why"". He doesn't seem to enjoy his work, his wife or his money. So what is his motivation? Apparently nothing.<br/><br/>Beside the shallowness of the character this movie is a true believer in the thesis ""style over substance"". It seems more like an experiment in style and special effects than a real movie with a real message. Message? Well, when you make a drama like this one asking so many questions about guns and the morality of selling them one could actually expect a message. I would have settled for something like ""decide for yourself whether the arms-dealer is evil"", but we don't even get that. This is a waste of time."

"nturner","10","3","5","8 November 2008"," Grip the Mind and Conscience
","The rise to power of an international arms dealer is the subject of Lord of War. The film follows Yuri Orlov from his youth on the streets of New York, where he first gets the idea of going into arms's sales, through a career of accumulating wealth, winning the woman of his dreams, and gaining the power to bend governments to his will. The story is said to be based upon actual events with the character of Yuri representing five major arms dealers.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage is the star of Lord of War, and I cannot think of many other living actors who could have taken this part and made it their own. He has an uncanny ability to portray a man without affectation yet exude powerful emotions of love, lust, guilt, and remorse. Cage narrates the film with his unique sardonic tone, and that narration is a perfect rendering of the message of the film: this is business -- big business -- and a few million innocent lives should never interfere with profit.<br/><br/>That special tone in Cage's voice is so very effective in such lines as:<br/><br/>""There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation. That's one firearm for every twelve people on the planet. The only question is: How do we arm the other 11?""<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>""I sell to leftists, and I sell to rightists. I even sell to pacifists, but they're not the most regular customers.""<br/><br/>Lines of this character and some humorous situations may cause viewers to see this as black comedy; however, the suffering caused by war depicted here is so graphic that humor has little standing. Nevertheless, movies are made to entertain, and this film's dark wit creates superior entertainment.<br/><br/>Jared Leto, as Yuri's brother, effectively represents the decay that infects a person of conscience who becomes involved in the business of human destruction. He provides an interesting contrast to Yuri who is seemingly without emotion or conscience.<br/><br/>Yuri's wife, beautifully played by Bridget Moynahan, shows us the love that might have been available to a man whose emotions had not shut him off from mankind.<br/><br/>For the depiction of pure evil and avarice, Eamonn Walker and Sammi Rotibi are notable for their portrayals of an African despot and his son. Rotibi especially chills with a manner of a man who has, from birth, absolute power over the life and death of anyone within his range.<br/><br/>Andrew Niccol's writing and direction have provided us with words that grip the mind and conscience and images that evoke both gentleness and horror. Lord of War should engage the interest and concern of a wide audience."

Personally it is the mix of the outstanding performance by Nicolas Cage and his supporting cast, script, soundtrack and production of the movie. <br/><br/>Nicolas Cage fits the role very well and portraits a character that has very much depth and that is one of the best roles of his career(still wondering why he didn't receive a Oscar for this). The movie at the end leaves you in an uneasy mindset (the last sentence of Nicolas Cage, says it all I think). <br/><br/>Also recognition should be given to Eamonn Walker who gives a flamboyant performance as Andre Baptiste Sr. (I know where Andrew Whitaker (last king of Scotland) got his inspiration from).<br/><br/>combine that further with beautiful shots from Africa, and you have a movie that is watchable over and over again and is entertaining and educational at the same time.<br/><br/>This is definitely a must see!"

","The ""Lord of War"" (LOW) is a simple story about a man who tried to earn a living by selling arms. The problem, as the French saying goes, ""all arguments in life are about taste and tasting, ""and does his story leave a smooth honey taste in the mouth to cover up the toxic poison just tasted. There are so many twists and turns, ups and downs in this movie that my short review will not do it justice. I highly recommend this thought-provoking movie that is based on true events. <br/><br/>There are several characters that the LOW revolves around:<br/><br/>Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage): A pragmatic nihilistic ""It is none of our business!"" gunrunner/narrator. Over twenty-five years, Yuri meets powerful people from presidents to the scum of the earth while selling his wares during every war being waged in the world. A few of Yuri's quotations sum it all up:<br/><br/>""There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation. That's one firearm for every twelve people on the planet. The only question is: How do we arm the other 11?"" <br/><br/>""I sell to leftists, and rightists. I sell to pacifists, but they're not the most regular customers.""<br/><br/>""They say, ""Evil prevails when good men fail to act."" What they ought to say is, ""Evil prevails.""""<br/><br/>""I sell guns to every army but the Salvation Army.""<br/><br/>""I never sold to Osama Bin Laden, not on moral grounds, but because his checks were always bouncing back then.""<br/><br/>""it's not our war and no matter what we do, we can't stop it ""<br/><br/>Vitaly Orlov (Jared Leto): Yuri's conscience plagued brother/ business partner, who after a while cannot look the other way, and uses drugs to escape what he has done. <br/><br/>Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan): Yuri's trophy bride and super model, who after many years, discovers Yuri is not into ""transportation"" when the cops show up asking questions.<br/><br/>Interpol Agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke), Doggedly hounds Yuri for years until Yuri's business and family life starts to fall apart. Only to find out from Yuri, at Jack's moment of triumph, that reality is not black/white or good/evil. He in a retort tells Yuri, ""I would tell you to go to hell, but I think you're already there.""<br/><br/>Simeon Weisz (Ian Holmes): A big league rival arms dealer who says, ""Bullets change governments far surer than votes."" He sees his services as beneficial to the world.<br/><br/>Normally, I do not think Nicolas Cage was a good fit in several of his movies, but LOW is the sparkling exception. I can not think of any actor, other than Cage, that could effectively pull off the role as a detached arms dealer who makes the audience feel sorry for his dilemmas. The rest of the cast are also very well matched.<br/><br/>The film is also eerily bright, clean, and colorful. One minute you are seeing clean ordered city life, then the next minute you are in a quiet third world country with bright red blood being splattered everywhere. No matter the location, Yuri is always in an expensive suit, looking clean, and strangely out of place (Deus Ex Machina). This greatly adds to his ""Lord of War"" aura."

I don't know if I should do a review, but just to say that the devil, as we know, is in details, and the details are not at all Niccol's strong point. There is not such a thing as Interpol agents (contrary to the popular myth perpetuated by Hollywood and Ethan Hawke) - Interpol is an information clearing house located in Lyon, France, staffed with international bureaucrats and directed by a former NYU law professor. Soviet (Ukrainian) Jews on Brighton Beach couldn't care less about Ukraine - the cradle of East European anti- Semitism (as Yuri Orlov's younger drug addict brother who nostalgically makes the map of Ukraine out of cocaine), and Orlov is not a Jewish name. In fact, Yuri Orlov is the name of the Soviet dissident, founder of the Moscow Helsinki group in the 1970s.

""The question is,"" he intones dryly, ""how to we arm the other three."" <br/><br/>The story begins in the Little Odessa section of Brooklyn in 1982, when Orlov, the son of Ukrainian immigrants (the father pretends to be Jewish  so much so, he opens a deli and attends temple every week), makes his first deal, selling an Israeli-made Uzi to some drug dealers.<br/><br/>Going into the ""business"" with his brother, Vitali (Jared Leto, ""Panic Room,"" ""Alexander""), Yuri discovers that with a charming smile and a quick mind, he can actually make a living at this trade. Though not in the same league as other arms traders, such as snooty Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm, ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""Alien""), he is still getting richer by the year.<br/><br/>For Yuri, the bigger the war (or conflict) the better. Cage's voice-overs take us through disturbances in the Middle East, South America, Asia and other global hot-spots where he has growing power and influence through his sale of arms and ammunition.<br/><br/>When the Soviet Union breaks up, he shouts and cries tears of joy  not because his beloved Ukraine is finally free from the grasp of totalitarian Communism  but because the coming nationalist battles between the breakaway republics means much more business for him and his brother.<br/><br/>While all of this is going on, the pair is being doggedly pursued by incorruptible ATF agent, Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke, ""Assualt On Precinct 13,"" ""Training Day""), who chases them from one end of the globe to the other.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Vitali, who is supposed to be the conscience of the film (as well as of his brother), goes on a coke jag and is rendered pretty much ineffectual for the rest of his life.<br/><br/>Forced to go it alone, Yuri soon woos and marries his longtime idol, model Ava Fontaine (Bridgette Moynahan, I Robot), and begins dealing with Liberian dictator, Andre Baptiste, Sr. (a great performance by Eamonn Walker, ""Unbreakable,"" ""Tears of the Sun"") and his crazed son (Sammi Robbi, ""Tears of the Sun"").<br/><br/>Through this unholy alliance, Yuri begins to lose all control of his life  which proceeds the breakup of his marriage, dis-ownership by his parents, and, finally, his arrest.<br/><br/>Film makes the point that what Yuri, as sort of a freelancer, is doing is not that bad, compared the arms sales of such governments as the US, Great Britain, Russia, Israel, China and others. This is like saying that it's okay to beat someone up  just as long as you did not kill the person.<br/><br/>Director Andrew Niccol (""Gattaca"") attempts to make Yuri's exploits tongue-in-cheek, yet we are inundated with reminders that he trades in death (the results of his work). Yuri excuses this reality by claiming he is allowing countries to defend themselves.<br/><br/>It's pretty hollow, and Niccol's attempts to sanctify Orlov seem just as empty. Likewise, when Valentine finally takes Yuri into custody, he does so spouting statistics about how bad firearms and the dealing in them are. Thanks for the sledgehammer, Andrew, we get it.<br/><br/>And while humorous in spots, it is not a comedy; and while violent in other areas, it's not an action film. So, we are caught somewhere in between, with an interesting story to tell, but an uninteresting way of telling it."

","Lord of War did something not many movies do. It surprised me. After watching the trailer I was expecting something fun, maybe a little gun-play and Mr. Cage talking his way out of trouble. What I got however was an entirely different animal. This was a smart, well written film that hit all the buttons it needed to. Family, love, honesty, commitment, guns, satire, more guns... Without giving anything away this film made me think of some of the issues from the last two decades, and really brings home the fact that many of the skeletons in America's closet have come back to haunt us all. The soundtrack was fun, the film was well shot and well paced, and the opening scene was perfect. All in all a movie that is well worth seeing."
"bzett","6","5","11","26 October 2005"," Everybody loves ""Lord Nicolas""...I don't
","First of all, I liked many things about this movie: the photography, the acting (especially Bridget Moynahan and Jared Leto), some scenes and details (the airplane scene in the African desert or the container where Orlov stores the picture he bought from his wife) and its courage to be poetic and satirical. What I also appreciated was the fact that Cage's character wasn't presented as the bad guy. What I missed was the ""space"" for the character of Yuri Orlov. The movie rushes through his personal development and doesn't really take the time to take a closer look at the person. Some scenes give an idea of how multi-faceted this Orlov is (e.g. when he takes the toy-gun from his son, talks to his new wife at their marriage, buys her picture), but these scenes remain unconnected with the rest of the story. There would have been much potential to make a real epic out of this by taking in more political relations and private conflicts (with wife, brother or parents). In my eyes the film just stays too much on the surface and seems a little incomplete."
"dj_bassett","Null","5","11","26 September 2005"," Lacks Courage
","Saga of an arms dealer who gains the world but loses his soul. The movie is attempting, I think, a black comedy along the lines of THREE KINGS, but this is far less tonally controlled: I never once believed that the sardonic narrator was the same Cage as the rationalizing protagonist, nor did I believe the man we were seeing would ever surround himself with the wounded ducklings Cage did. (More irritatingly, these wounded ducklings  Cage's beautiful, hapless wife Bridget Moynihan and drug-addicted brother/sometimes partner Leto  are there just to preach the message that Arms Dealing is Bad. As though there's anyone out there who thinks Arms Dealing is Good.) This is a movie that fundamentally lacks courage, that is so intent on moralisms that it betrays it's own source material. A truly serious movie about arms dealers would no doubt be the blackest of black comedies: perhaps Hollywood isn't the place to look for that.<br/><br/>Some good moments, a knockout opening title sequence, and a good performance from Cage make this watchable, but I wouldn't make a special trip."
"hohumdedum2","6","5","11","24 September 2005"," Reality through the eyes of Hollywood
","Lord of War certainly has an agenda, but in a snarky sort of way. It concerns the illegal arms trade. Nicolas Cage once again seems to reprise a roll that we've seen a million times since Face Off, and it becomes quite annoying after a while. I rolled my eyes a few times, and the ending was rather predictable. But why the 6? The reason is that this film tells it like it is: bad things DO happen to good people ALL THE TIME, and people make money off of it and really don't care. In this crazy time it's just another affirmation that we live in a world that is run by corruption and there's nothing the righteous can do at the moment. Skip the theater though, and wait for a rental, or if you're bored catch Lord of War at the budget cinema when it gets there."

","OK everybody, this was a nice movie with some interesting insight and commentary on the subject. The best part was Cage's performance, as mostly everything else is ripped off from a thirty years old Italian film called ""Finche' c'e' guerra c'e' speranza"" (While There's War There's Hope) with Alberto Sordi. Obviously 99.9 percent of the viewing public in the US ignores it and thinks ""wow, how do they come up with these ideas in Hollywood?"", well, that's how, they take an old European or Asian movie and they copy every aspect of it (aside of the FX and fancy camera work) and they sell it as brand new, without giving the original any credit. Way to go Andrew Niccol, this guy has been ripping off other's ideas since Gattaca, with ""Lord of war"" he has outdone himself."

","Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is an Ukrainian immigrant living Little Odessa in New York. Vitaly (Jared Leto) is his brother. His dream girl is the neighborhood beauty queen Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan). After witnessing a gangland hit, he decides to start selling weapons along with his brother. Meanwhile, he's being hounded by incorruptible Interpol agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) and fellow gunrunner Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm).<br/><br/>I love the matter-of-factness to Cage's narration. The story is fascinating and spans the world. But it's Cage that sells it. He still has the charm. Before you realize it, you're rooting for an amoral death dealer, a Lord of War. Jared Leto is terrific as the drugged out brother who's struggling with more than his addiction. This is one of the better black comedies with an anti-gun message."
"brandythefox","8","1","1","27 December 2018"," Wow, surprisingly good
","So first we have Nicholas Cage, who hasn't shown much judiciousness in picking scripts and overacts regularly. Then we have Niccol, who's got an essay writer's penchant for making workable film premises a real chore. Somehow, both of them dialed back their tendencies, and nailed it.<br/><br/>Let's start with Cage. I kept expecting him to break out into some over-the-top emoting, or overplay cool (so that it was uncool), but if you are looking for evidence that the man can act, this is exhibit A. As Orlov (guess that's a nod to Nosferatu), he makes an utterly believable sophist who can compartmentalise good and evil. Everything with him is a little caricaturish, but the character he conveys has enough cracks in the facade to make it relatable.<br/><br/>Then there's Niccol. I was surprised to see his name on it. If you've ever watched Gattaca or the Truman show, his movies have h""igh ground"" content but ate often stilted and poorly delivered coming over as set pieces. This one though, has enough grit and grime, and enough dimension to lift it out of film school.<br/><br/>Many will react to the social message of the film and I guess that was the point, but looking at it as a film, it is good.<br/><br/>It compares with War Dogs (2016) and War Dogs is much better made but this film does a lot more.<br/><br/>Go watch it.

You love him and hate him, cheer him, and root against him for the path he chooses. His choice to become an arms dealer comes as a kind of destiny he feels he was born to fulfill.<br/><br/>I like how his character always manages to stay one step ahead of the law while juggling his family life. His choices are not always morally correct, yet he is aware and makes no apologies.<br/><br/>Please see this movie if you have a chance. After you watch it, watch it with director's commentary.

","A really intense and exciting movie. I was thoroughly caught in the moment. Once I pushed the play button, I wanted it to play till the end. I think it's going to be almost with everyone. Because this one here is totally something different. Director Andrew Niccol is a newcomer and he has come with a bang. Terrific script and unique story. I mean, this is quality stuff. Highly recommended. Guys find it more interesting though. I can even say that you are not a guy if this one leaves you with nothing.<br/><br/>A great cast is another big plus of LOW. Nicolas Cage has done many stupid films, but in this, he really is who we are used to see on the screen. A good-talking, confident and skillful guy. Very good supporting roles from the great Jared Leto and Ethan Hawke. Bridget Moynahan as Ava Fontaine gives us something extremely beautiful to see. So it's not only guns and bullets, there's a very good-looking woman too on the screen.<br/><br/>Although it is not a true story, there is material in which this picture has got some key points.

"contact-447","8","1","1","9 August 2007"," Funny and disturbing in equal measure
","Surprisingly effective black comedy about the arms trade that manages to be laugh out loud funny one moment and disturbing as hell the next. Yes, the film owes a lot to Goodfellas, from the decade spanning story to the constant voice overs. But it does a good job of sucking you in and entertaining you while at the same time showing you how the arms trade works, all without coming across as overly preachy.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage puts in a solid performance as the arms dealer at the center of the story. It's not a sympathetic character, but he's so open and audacious in his evil-doing, and Cage is so amiable in the role, that it's hard not to like him. All too often Cage's acting is either over-the-top or wooden as a plank, but here he gets the balance just right and carries the film pretty much single-handed, with constant monologues and more screen time than most of the rest of the cast combined.<br/><br/>Jared Leto's also effective as the troubled younger brother who has the misfortune of developing a conscience (never a good thing for a gun runner), and Ian Holm has a nice little cameo as a rival arms dealer. But it's Eamonn Walker's turn as the psychotic African dictator Andre Baptiste which really steals the show.<br/><br/>Despite being a 'message' film, Lord of War is also slick and highly entertaining. Whether or not you're interested in the politics behind it, it's well worth a watch."

","I expected far, far better from the director of Gattaca.<br/><br/>The script was so bad it was laughable.<br/><br/>And it was incredibly racist. Apparently all (black) Africans are mindlessly stupid and are the only ones in the world who like dirty little wars (as opposed to whites who prefer dirty big wars).<br/><br/>Strangely, there was no mention at all of any of Americas wars (well there wasn't before I walked out).<br/><br/>What was Ethan Hawke thinking of? I walked out at the point where he suddenly appears in the middle on nowhere co-piloting a FIGHTER JET.<br/><br/>And exactly why was Ethan Hawke pursuing Cage in the first place? I don't believe that arms dealing is illegal. And if it is, why wasn't he out arresting the directors of Boeing? And WHAT was that ridiculous subplot involving his wife the model - were we really meant to believe that she married a man whom she knew nothing about? Possibly one of the worst films I've seen."
"JediKnightLV0213","10","7","18","14 September 2005"," Excellent movie
","I was able to see Lord of War in an advanced screening on 9/13 and I have to say it totally took me by surprise; it was refreshing to watch this movie during a period of bad movies with plots we've all seen before.<br/><br/>I anticipated seeing Lord of War based on the trailers on TV and it didn't disappoint. The movie had a great plot, cast and was accurate when it came to the technical aspects and employment of firearms. Awesome special effects and showed the grim reality of what a firearm can do and is more real than Hollywood. Lord of War was extremely detailed and at times you'd think you were in a class on ""Gun Running 101."" Although at the end of the movie there is a somewhat ""semi-moral"" or political statement it is not overbearing and I see the movie as NOT anti-gun but rather helps put things in a larger perspective that you would not think about everyday.<br/><br/>Nic Cage's performance is on par with that of ""The Rock"" yet he has more balls and shows what a player he can be as he romances Ava Fontaine aka Bridget Moynahan. Bridget Moynahan looks more beautiful than ever and SPOILER ---> sex scene in the shower. Ethan Hawke makes a good INTERPOL agent reminiscent of ""Training Day"" and the re-make of ""Assault on Precinct 13."" The cast was kept small and plot simple which made a great movie and although I thought I had a good idea on how the movie would climax and finally end I was taken by complete surprise and found myself wrong.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Great movie! Again it's NOT anti-gun and not over-politicized."
"binhthuy71","5","5","12","1 October 2005"," A movie in search of a script
","Much as I hate to go against the tide here, the best part of the movie was for me the opening which depicted the life of a bullet. Breathtaking in the simple way that it showed how the mundane, anonymous business of manufacturing weapons can end. The cinematography here and throughout the movie is breathtaking. ""Wow!"" I thought, ""this is going to bee a helluva movie."" Then began Nicolas Cage's relentless voice-over. Other characters appear; Cage's brother, his parents, his dream girl. None of them have more than the most rudimentary character arcs. Relationships are presented rather than developed. The denouement is heartbreakingly predictable and largely senseless. Mayhap the point of the movie was that arms trafficking has become banal and everyday. If so, it made it in such a low key, bloodless way that even that was lost."
"leppakt","6","4","9","22 September 2005"," mediocre writing and uninspiring ending
","The Dialogue in many places is annoyingly unimaginative. The pacing is uneven, and the story seems at times too big for the medium. Some creative technical work is eclipsed by melodramatic content, and sophomoric shots i.e. a very dramatic and creative landing of a cargo plane landing on a highway stops only inches from a pre toddler aged child who is sitting there oblivious to the massive machine as it approaches her. Obviously the plane is superimposed onto the image of the child- there is a disconnect between the two activities. But, the shot is so belabored and excessive that it seems to mock suspense rather than heighten the reality and the emotion of the moment. <br/><br/>Although there is quality acting in this film, Hawke gives the best performance, a supremely deft performance that skillfully intertwine subtlety, intensity and passion, the actors too often take a backseat to the cumbersomely managed exposition. <br/><br/>The story is told through the eyes of an international weapons dealer played by Nicholas Caige, whose distorted sense of morality warps the perspective of the focus of the movie. Since this is a vehicle for Cage, the motivations and struggles of the other characters are subverted to the telling of his character's story. And, at the end when the result is to see the weapons dealer prevail and hail the greatness of the doctrine of resignation in the face of seemingly overwhelming immorality and destruction, there is no counter balancing message of hope and instead reinforces a message of futility.<br/><br/>A generally very well shot movie with very good actors was unfortunately undermined by unimaginative direction and an uninspiring script. I give 2 1/2 stars."

There are a few funny one liners, but most of those are used in the ad. The film is steeped in sarcasm, which is sometimes funny, but in the end the film is kind of depressing and tries to make a serious point about the world's munitions distribution.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage plays a munitions supplier with a personality of a door to door salesman. He has no morals and justifies his profession by saying that ""somebody has to do it."" The only likable character in the film is the Interpol agent played by Ethan Hawke, but he is only in the film for about 10 minutes.<br/><br/>I would have liked this film a lot more if the lead character was more sympathetic. Because of that, it was hard to really care what happened to him. Still, this is not a bad film and it does have wit and sarcasm on a serious issue."

Lets forget that the United States of America is the world largest manufacturer (and the world largest consumer) of weaponry... That 200 millions of privately-owned firearms (out of total 500 millions mentioned by Nicolas Cage's character) are owned by the US citizens...

","SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>Well i think it is sort of a modern Godfather, at least there are some similarities such as the movie tries to give a complex picture of a figure who we would normally perceive as an evil person just based on his ""profession"" and the movie tries to explain us that it's not just black and white but more like a grey area (obviously in terms of good- bad). Other then that obviously it mostly based around violence just a more modern form and the hero does not actively take part in it, but does encourage it and makes a business out it. And on a side note that actually fact that the hero does not take part in the violence is actually not really a purely good thing it also represents him to be coward to some extent. And lastly, a very strong motive in both movies is how it is not really about an achievement, there is no END to this activity and the main hero even if he sometimes says so or acts so does not believe that this only a temporary solution for him, but instead he will continue it even if it means sacrificing anything, even his family.<br/><br/>That being said obviously not as great dialog as in Godfather, not as good acting, not as good story and mainly the action is sort of like in Godfather 3, some interesting scenes but huge part of it actually becomes boring.<br/><br/>I didn't like the ending either, due to the plot his family realizing that he is a liar (which they probably already knew just couldn't face it until they see it.) and leaving him completely makes sense, but when watching the movie it just seems ridiculous that his wife just follows him, he leaves stuff open and everything just happens too easily for a veteran leader warlord of a shady business.

","First of all when you have to resort to narration to explain your movie, you don't have a movie. Just because you have a really good actor playing the main role doesn't make it a good movie either. Yes there is a message - don't sell guns. They hurt people. Duh. You can have a guy in a clown suit come out and show that message on a sign. Are we really supposed to be impressed with a character who is rich enough to rent his own jet but not buy it? The six lines the woman gets to say in her role do not construct a character. ""I've been pretty all my life and that's all I do"" pretty much explains what she's doing there.<br/><br/>To me this movie is a cross between ""Blow"" with Johnny Depp and ""Road to Perdition"" with Tom Hanks except without any depth or craftsmanship. Add to that a depressing story that ends tragically and you have a complete waste of time and money. If you want to see an exciting story about the egregious violence in Africa that makes sense and is well done see ""The Interpreter"" with Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn."
"emdoub","3","6","16","22 March 2006"," Absolutely Amazing!
","Folks - this movie is phenomenal. It does things that shouldn't, really, be possible - and does them well.<br/><br/>First is the intro CGI sequence - in which we see the life cycle of a cartridge, from manufacture to the the bullet ending up in the skull of an African child. It set the tone for the movie, and gave me that warm glow - knowing that the bullet ended up ending the life of an innocent, as most bullets are destined to.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, it's taken as a given - people who sell guns are EVIL - though it never really explains why. After all, no explanation should be necessary. Guns are evil, and anyone who has anything to do with them must, by definition, be evil as well - even if they're played by Nicholas Cage with his usual skill and style.<br/><br/>The part when the younger brother (Played by Jared Leto) redeems his wasted life by destroying half of a shipment of guns in a suicidal/homicidal rush was tremendous, because he was sacrificing himself to save a refugee camp. That it didn't work was irrelevant, really. That he'd seen their senseless slaughter before the guns were in use had nothing to do with it - if the guns hadn't been available, they'd have been safe - never mind the part where he saw an innocent child slaughtered with machetes - the evil oppressors would have had to go home unfulfilled without that gun shipment.<br/><br/>The part where Baptiste, the Evil African Dictator, justifies election fraud by pointing to the Bush/Gore debacle is wonderful - the scriptwriters claim moral victory there without ever lowering themselves to referencing an actual fact - because we all know that how you *feel* about an event is much more important than the facts about that event.<br/><br/>Great movie, if you're convinced that guns are evil, and the people who sell them are evil, and want some very emotional scenes to bulwark those opinions. Less good if you're just looking for an interesting story - because, as story, this one falls a tad flat.<br/><br/>A somewhat pedestrian story would be forgivable, of course - the acting is solid throughout, and there are some spectacular performances - Eamonn Walker does a stellar job representing Baptiste, the Evil Dictator and steadfast customer. But, if you're not tremendously behind this message, the movie may leave you cold - because the message is what it's all about.<br/><br/>As propaganda, it's excellent. As entertainment, it really helps to already believe the propaganda."
"quiksilverhg","3","7","20","18 September 2005"," Political overtone and weak action spoils movie
","I went into this movie expecting what I saw on the trailer, a good action movie with plenty of shoot 'em up and explosions. It turns out I was deceived. The movie starts out with Cage standing in the middle of a sea of shells talking about how there's enough guns to arm 1 in 12 people on the planet (as you saw on the trailer). Fine, that's a good kickoff to a movie about guns and war. Then immediately on the next scene they go into their political rampage. You start by seeing a bullet being stamped out on an assembly line (actually very fascinating) and you see it go from a factory, to a box, to a general, then to a warlord in Africa. Finally they show the bullet being loaded into an AK-47 and being used to shoot a pre-teenage African boy.<br/><br/>OK, at this point I immediately became skeptical about the rest of the movie, but decided I could tough it out for the action promised in the trailer. Well I was deceived again; the rest of the movie plays out like a documentary with Cage doing a running commentary as he grows up from a humble beginning and becomes this arms dealer. The action throughout the movie is very light, and the plot does not involve anything other than the greed of this man in specific and all gun manufacturers/dealers in general.<br/><br/>On top of the fact that there is little action in the movie the writers seem to be preoccupied with the idea that guns in and of themselves are the source of all evil in the world. They go through many scenes where guns are used to commit genocide against people and to prop up evil dictators.<br/><br/>The movie finishes by saying that this is based on real events (yeah right) and that the largest manufacturers and exporters of weapons in the world are the US and other western nations. While also implying the fact that the US is one of the countries that supplies arms to these genocidal dictators. If I wanted to see a movie about how evil guns and the US are I could watch a Michael Moore movie; I was looking for a good action movie without any political overtones.

Apparently the film is based on actual events.<br/><br/>The film starts off as a monologue for the first twenty minutes or so with Uri Orlov talking about his life and how he got into the arms business. Eventually dialogue starts but throughout the film Uri also acts as storyteller.<br/><br/>If the film is trying to make a point it does so only partly: The Arms trade is bad and the people fueling the various global/local conflicts are bad but not nearly as bad as the major arms dealers: USA, UK etc. Yes we know that, what's new? The film is quite graphic and while it does show the horror war at the local level, fails to offer a solution - assuming there is one. The only solution would be a global ban on sales of any weapons that may be used in any conflict. Probably about as achievable as proving the existence of God. As Uri states; ""If I don't do it somebody else will"". His rival, when asked why he supplied both sides in the Iran/Iraq war replied: ""Maybe I wanted them both to lose."" Of all the conflicts covered, Liberia & Sierra Leone show the hopelessness of collapsed states run by powermad bloodthirsty lunatics. Until the Western powers stop dealing with and supplying weapons to the murderous leaders the conflicts will continue.<br/><br/>Not an enjoyable film or a particularly good documentary."

","Andrew Niccol, while clearly an intelligent person (and occasionally filmmaker), takes his second misstep after ""Simeone."" While the movie's pace is cleverly orchestrated, it lacks firm decisions tonally - it's an activist movie without a thesis.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage delivers an enthusiastic, if somewhat uneven performance, but is hampered endlessly by his own narration (which dominates the film, often spoiling the plot in advance). In the end, the film is predictable, stilted, uneven, and indecisive. It's not dramatic when it intends to be, and the humor is too held back by whatever dramatic aspirations Niccol was after.<br/><br/>But hey, nice photography."

","From the unbelievable casting of Leto and Cage as brothers, through to the inane plot set up and disjointed story telling this film was terrible. It lost me five minutes in. First we're in the 80s, then the 90s, yet everyone looks exactly the same! And the premise behind Cage's character 'meeting' his future wife is so unbelievable, even within the context of this film, it's laughable. However I must say the one redeeming feature was Ethan Hawke. From what I could sit through of this film, his performance is commendable. This film could have been done so much better. With some proper casting, improved continuity and of course, some major script doctoring it could have been decent. What a disappointment!"

","Lord of War is a tale of a gunrunner exploiting global conflicts for his own monetary gain.<br/><br/>SPOILERS.<br/><br/>Nicols deserves admiration for bringing this story (based on truth) to the big screen. Morality of greed, exploitation, relationships and the value of life is questioned, the film is superbly shot, with terrific detail and use of location, however, much of the script is woefully cliché, much of the dialogue amongst the family relationships is pure soap opera, and some obvious realities are let down- the leads do not age a day in 20 years, the costume never changes (Cage travels the world with small briefcase and a similar suit throughout - possibly a deliberate tool to illustrate his 'just business'attitude however, ludicrous attire when worn in both West Africa and Eastern Block). There are just points made, with humour, unfortunately let down by the attempt to humanise the central character. Worth a watch, but falls flat upon leaving the theatre..."

Very well done.<br/><br/>Performances by all the primaries were good, with Jared Leto being the standout as Nick Cage's younger brother. He should get an Oscar nod for the performance.

","Watched this film in two sittings as I fell asleep during the first one and wanted to see if it got any better. It doesn't. Trite dialogue not helped by Cage acting for his pay cheque and nothing more, leaving the audience without even the slightest trace of empathy for the character. Some of the quotes from the film are laugh out loud funny without meaning to be, is the first rule of gun running, 'not to get shot by your own merchandise' surely it's just 'not to get shot'. There could have been an acceptable, maybe even interesting film but was shockingly pulled off. The only redeeming feature to this film is watching a whole plane get dismantled and trying to work out if anyone on the film actually saw a reason for doing it."

","This film is reminiscent of films like Traffic and The Goodfellas. It's narrated by Nicholas Cage's character throughout. I was impressed by the opening sequence in the film - this alone is worth seeing the film. The dialogue was strong but the sub-plot seemed cliché and overly predictable at times. Definitely one of Cage's better performances. It offers some interesting perspectives on all issues related to guns, however, I found myself wishing there was more to it than what was on the surface. This film definitely gets you thinking but it fails to really one perspective. I applaud the director for making the movie though as I don't think it's going to be very successful - it's not a downer but you're not going to walk out of the theater feeling any better than when you sat down. I recommend this film, otherwise. My vote: 9/10. 1 point off because the story line and characters could have been better developed and I would have liked to have had more substantial background of the character played by Cage."
"skepticskeptical","4","3","7","10 August 2010"," Translation of GOODFELLAS to arms trade context
","I am surprised that IMDb.com reviewers have not noted (or at least none whose reviews I've read) that LORD OF WAR is a complete copy, in both structure and form, mutatis mutandis, of GOODFELLAS (1990, dir. Scorsese). Here Ray Liotta has become Nicolas Cage, but the story, mode of presentation, structure, and ""moral of the story"" or ""bottom line"" are all identical: We are to sympathize with this ""average Joe,"" an otherwise quite likable guy, who gets mixed up in organized crime. Both films feature narration by the ""average Joe"" of his experiences, which is supposed to show not that he is evil, but that he is not. Instead of the loose cannon character Tommie (played by Joe Pesci), who blows people away at the slightest provocation because he has such low self-esteem and is totally insecure, here we have the president of Liberia, who, too, is powerful because and only because he totes a gun and is willing and able to kill without blinking an eye. Cocaine finds its way into both films, because, well, I guess it always does when the context is organized crime.<br/><br/>There is no originality here at all. Not a single point or twist. The wives are similarly clueless, the ""average Joe"" is supposed to be someone who might just as easily have been the viewer, and we are to believe that he himself never willed the death of anyone, much less pulled the trigger. In GOODFELLAS, the repeated claim that Henry Hill never whacked anyone during his long mafia career stretched credulity beyond its breaking point, and the same holds true here as well. We see lots of violence, but total denial of complicity in murder on the part of the protagonist in cahoots with the ""real"" criminals.<br/><br/>The redeeming feature of this rehash (or is it just plagiarism?) is that it may open a few people's eyes to the reality of the arms trade and how we ""average Joes"" fund the slaughter of people abroad, essentially arming the would-be killers no less than does Yuri in the film. We are to sympathize with him, indeed, because we, too, continue to claim ""it's not our fight"" while writing our annual tax checks to the feds. <br/><br/>As a film, however, LORD OF WAR is a serious ""been there, done that."" This is an inferior copy, at best."

","Andrew Niccol must be applauded for this masterpiece, not only for its entertainment value, but also its message, especially considering the lack of media interest on the topic of arms dealing. <br/><br/>After having for some reason watched recently his appalling work in Snake Eyes, where he was conceivably running after a hopefully large career-damaging paycheck, this movie should also strengthen/build Nicolas Cage's reputation as a serious lead man. He is throughout this feature on cue, and convincingly delivers Niccol's polished, urgent text. Moynahan and Hawke also deliver strong performances. Special mentions must be made for Leto and Walker, who both carry their ambiguous supportive roles, with distinction, and who were both less well known to me.<br/><br/>This is neither a date, nor a family movie, but for friends. It is definitely worth being seen at the theater, and should become one of those essential components of any respectable DVD collection, in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage (Yuri Orlov) 8/10 - Very good performance, but hard to believe his supposedly Ukrainian origin.<br/><br/>Bridget Moynahan (Ava Fontaine) 8/10 - Gorgeous, just gorgeous.<br/><br/>Jared Leto (Vitaly Orlov) 9/10 - Scene stealer.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke (Jack Valentine) 7/10 - Good performance, but rather one-dimensional character to play in the first place.<br/><br/>Eamonn Walker (Andre Baptiste Sr.) 9/10 - Scene stealer.<br/><br/>Andrew Niccol 10/10"
"allegory46","6","3","7","18 September 2005"," Difficult political climate
","I think that this is a good story and well acted. I think the idea that it is a political movie is not appropriate. An individual viewer may hope that it follows his or her political ideas, but that is not the point of a movie. I find it is difficult in this climate to make a movie that is not ""politically correct."" The one failing of this movie is that it was probably watered down to make it more soothing to the American Pshyche. So,I don't find the movie that daring. What would you do in your personal work life if you finally came to the conclusion that your work was something really morally corrupt. I see millions of people who seem able to go to work every day without an active morality. So, this is one man's tale. It was not ""American World Police 2"" cinema. If it had been a bit more original or edgier I would have voted higher for it. I reserve those numbers 7 and up for movies that set the standard for comparison for the future generation."
"tghoneyc","8","3","7","17 September 2005"," A necessary evil...
","The master of film allegories, Andrew Niccol, has created a much more topical story than in his previous films, and one that deals with the problems of today, rather than the trials of tomorrow, and he has done it with just as much flare for character dilemma.<br/><br/>During the opening credits, we are treated to the life of a single bullet in an AK-47. From its manufactuing in a Soviet factory, until it is loaded into an assault rifle and fired into the forehead of a Liberian preteen. From that point on we are treated to the inner-workings of the illegal weapons trade, and the violence that results from it, though seen primarily through the eyes of our protagonist, Yuri Orlov.<br/><br/>The cast is stellar. Nicolas Cage dominates the screen as a man without a country who goes from the mean streets of New York's Little Odessa to become a leading exporter of guns. Told in first-person, we are forced to identify with him, despite his decidedly amoral business. Jared Leto lends great support as his wayward brother and one-time partner, whose sense of right and wrong become his ultimate undoing. Ethan Hawke is also in top form as Interpol agent Jack Valentine, who is only prevented from catching Yuri by his strong belief in upholding international law. Ian Holm adds another creepy character to his resume as Simeon Weisz, Yuri's nemesis in the world of arms trade. Bridget Moynihan, as Yuri's dream girl-turned-wife is also quite good.<br/><br/>The synopsis talks about a gun-runner at the top of his game being attacked by his conscience. This is true, but it's never as simple as all that. The movie makes its point by largely avoiding it. We hear the shots, we see the victims, but only once are we treated to a lecture on the evils of arms dealing. We've heard it all before. We know it's bad. We don't need to hear any more than we are given. By converting the facts of gun running into ""wrong"" or ""evil,"" Niccol avoids being preachy. While ""The Constant Gardner"" succeeded by preaching the evils of the pharmaceutical industry, ""Lord of War"" succeeds because we already know why the gun running is wrong.<br/><br/>This movie ends on a cynical note, that in the world of today there will always be war, and there will always be someone needed to supply the guns. And sometimes, in cases of conflicts sponsored by other countries, it helps to have someone on the outside."
"SWZwick","1","7","23","31 October 2006"," What a waste
","The budding screenwriter in me admires the craftsmanship of the story and the direction, editing, and acting -- but the journalist in me spent the whole time cringing. Despite claims of authenticity, this story mixes gun-running and arms-dealing -- blending those who operate legally, albeit in a moral gray zone, with those who simply sell guns to child soldiers. I'm not sure about the claim that the US simply leaves its guns behind because it is cheaper than to take them with -- that does not ring true, but I would not be surprised to find an element of truth in it. If so, then it certainly should be exposed -- but the real crime in the arms trade is one that exists in this film, but is not properly explored: namely, that that arms travel through loopholes all over the world. There are no raids on arms dealers the way there are on gun runners. Arms dealers are clean and above the fray. And the problem isn't a conspiracy from the top down, but rather a failure to cooperate multilaterally. Interpol, far from being a solution, is part of the problem -- it does not exist the way portrayed in this film. There are no James Bond-like Interpol agents, because that treads on issues of national sovereignty. All Interpol can really do is pass information on from one agency to another. The real stuff gets done by agents of governments working with each other in a legal gray zone that is truly fascinating to explore. My experience with intelligence agents, by the way, is that most of them are conscientious, truth-obsessed, and and professional. That reality is actually quite fascinating, because it contradicts our preconceptions. This film, on the other hand, plays up to them. This film tries to portray incidents like the Iran-Contra Affair as being the rule rather than the exception. The film works dramatically because they chose to over-simplify reality -- but that is an artistic cop-out. I'm giving it a much lower rating that it should get if I were basing it just on its technical merits, but because the film pretends to be revealing a disturbing reality to us, it has taken on a degree of difficulty that it comes nowhere near achieving -- and judging by the comments from other people, it has done a disservice rather than a service."
"jdesando","Null","14","57","12 September 2005"," A necessary evil.
","Nicholas Cage's Yuri Orlav is the embodiment of the situationally ethical arms dealer who justifies his profession with such specious arguments as supplying arms to countries for their ""defense"" or because someone will take his place if he leaves--unsatisfactory justifications for families of slaughtered African refugees and bloody poor excuses for the US government.<br/><br/>Director Andrew Nicol takes too long in Lord of War to establish the flawed Yuri through a series of expected scenarios leading him into the rarefied position as top gunrunner in the world, with powerful and dangerous leaders willing to give him money and protection in exchange for arms. Only after Ukrainian Yuri has become comfortable with his moral ambiguity and his family remains ignorant of his trade does the director/writer introduce the tensions between Yuri's better angel and greedy devil. This conflict is also couched in the most general and clichéd ways to the extent that his flawed reasoning remains intact (his brother, Vitali, played by Jared Leto, provides the alter ego of slacking but morally outraged pretty boy) but is counterweighted by his concern for his wife and child. His relationship with a brutal Liberian general pits Yuri's ethical life against his family life.<br/><br/>Yuri's voice-over narration takes a few shortcuts to his character while exposing the essentially conflicted nature of a trade where he is so good at what he does that he is reluctant to leave. ""I am a necessary evil"" is the closest he comes to recognizing his corruption. Nicol layers enough wisecracking comments from Yuri to help mitigate the overwhelming sense of Yuri's moral decline.<br/><br/>The contribution of this character to modern fictional reality is that politicians and business people are faced with the same dilemma of wishing an end to the conflict in Iraq for reasons of honor but hoping for continuation for pragmatic reasons such as profit (as usual Halliburton and Cheney come to mind). When the closing credits remind us that the US and Russia are among the top arms dealers in the world, Nicol's allegorical subtext rises like fat to the surface. Too late to make it a great action film; too didactic to make it great art.<br/><br/>As for the endurance of evil, Hawthorne also had the insight in ""Young Goodman Brown"": ""Evil is the nature of Mankind."""

","I remember seeing ""Lord of War"" once, but the temptation to go back and look at the scenes and the action was just too hard to resist not seeing it again. The acting by the cast and the direction by Andrew Niccol was pretty good I would've given ""Lord of War"" a higher grade, but there were some minor hiccups that lowered my expectations that this is a masterpiece of classic drama. <br/><br/>The casting overall was excellent all around. But the real weak link in the movie has to go to the leading actor. Nicolas Cage. Cage lacks in panache and drive for us to get a better comprehension to the character of Ukrainian weapons dealer Yuri Orolov. His accent was not very accurate and no Ukrainian was even spoken. Russian was utilized in the movie, but the on-and -off accent by Cage will miff you when Cage's weak attempt at a Ukrainian accent makes you unconvinced that he is of Ukrainian extraction. <br/><br/>Another flaw that shrugged me was that director Andrew Niccol who has impressively reverted back to the trials and tribulations of Russian Cold War dramas, but there is no real Russian language used in the movie as they speak very sporadically in terms of words only to more frequently speak English with a very strong undecipherable Russian accent. Therefore, the culture of the story is not very convincing in spite of the user friendly intentions. <br/><br/>The casting was wonderful overall. The one I was impressed with the most was Eamonn Walker's portrayal of Andre Baptiste which is a homage to Liberian Charels Taylor his semi psychotic presence was so chilling it will leave a lasting impression for a long time to come. One of the best props I have ever seen was his son's car which is made of pure gold and has a Kalichnikov. The film's locations and globe hopping in the style of Bond, Bourne and Hunt are so amazing, it gives you the feeling you're being dragged in for the ride. <br/><br/>To summarize, ""Lord of War"" was an excellent movie that will entertain you very immensely. Sure it wasn't perfect and at times some editing needed some work, but that could easily be forgiven. Even if you're not a action guru, you'll be impressed with memorable acting from the ensemble that deserve our applaud."

So, it's same like I sell cigg, not responsible for cancer, I open a casino, not responsible for the people who addict gambling bankrupted. it's their free will. It is lead to a deepen question, do we have the responsibility for what we do, directly and relatively. we don't , that's the correct answer, but in practice, it's so complex, we are animals, we do things by our instinct most time. we find the happiness in some specific thing, gunrunners like running guns,it's so obvious, right. they just don't think, it's just business, nothing else, I'm so sad after watching the film, because i KNOW everyday, we lose life by other basic animal instinct.maybe it's the way god mades us.whatsoever we have gun or not, we kill others."

In ""Lord of War"", that is what happens to Yuri Orlov. He started running guns as a small side business, and eventually, was pursued by the United States government.<br/><br/>In the film, Orlov has four rules of gun running, and each are appropriately useful. While useful, these rules are also somewhat amusing. ""Don't get shot with your own merchandise. Always have a way to get paid. Never pick up a gun and join in. Never go to war, especially with yourself."" Of course, running guns is a very dangerous profession, and can lead to more dangerous transactions. In the film, Yuri's brother learned this the hard way. As he started using cocaine, he became disillusioned about the business his brother had chosen. Towards the end of the film, Yuri's brother is killed by none other than gunfire, after he blows an ammunitions truck up that Yuri is selling.<br/><br/>It is a fascinating movie, and anyone into action or thriller movies will thoroughly enjoy."

","Early on in this film,you know exactly who and what Yuri Orlov(Nicolas Cage,brilliant as actor and narrator)is. It's the how and where that he's about to show you.<br/><br/>Yuri is an arms dealer. An independent one at that. When he started in the business as a dealer in the early-to-middle eighties,he is very much a small-timer,a little fish in an ocean that is populated by mostly large nations and rogue militaries. He still manages to find stashes and sell,but usually to fringe groups and drug-dealers. Whne the fall of the Soviet Union occurs(over a period of time spanning 1989 to 1992),this opens up business for Yuri. Now,with huge stashes of guns,grenades,bombs,aircraft and tanks left behind from the Cold War,provided by family connections in his family's home country of Ukraine,he becomes a highly coveted deal broker in weapons,coveted by governments large and small.<br/><br/>He is also a tragic figure:a little man who felt insignificant growing up in Little Odessa in New York. He worked at his family's restaurant along with his wild,irrepressible younger brother Vitaly(Jared Leto,melding his musician instincts into this character) before witnessing a mob hit which impressed upon him the belief that the world is always looking for someone to supply them weapons,hence his career path. He is also smitten with the most popular girl from the neighborhood(Bridget Moynahan,beautiful and just a hint oblivious)who goes off to become a model. Once his biz takes off,he is able to put his family up,get his brother in on the business and sweep the girl of his dreams off her feet,marry her and start a family.<br/><br/>Naturally,when someone deals in unholy alliances,the Devil comes back for his pay,and Yuri is about to slowly but surely pay that price.<br/><br/>Smartly written and never underestimating the intelligence of its audience,this movie,penned and directed by Andrew Niccol,gives you a picture that is rarely(if ever)pretty and quite damning by its path. Interwoven in this story are(among others) the incorruptible Interpol agent(Ehtan HAwke),the rare independent gun-runner(Ian Holm)whose business clashes with Yuri's and the Liberian dictator(Eamonn Walker,very strong here)who has somehow managed to get into Yuri's head and knows how to push his buttons. The film traces Yuri's path from confident,cool and self-deluding businessman to a soul-challenged interloper who leads a double-life on borrowed time. Cage's voice is perfect as narrator,and director Niccol intersperses the tale being told with a few choice narrative cut-aways,lending a sort of surreal sense of the story.<br/><br/>It is a story of violence and moral weakness,and judging from the people who've backed and/or put their names on this film(among them Cage himself co-produces and the show is endorsed by,among others,Amnesty International)there is a sense of conviction behind it. The commitment here really shows,and that is why it works."

","I really felt this movie transcended political and social issues and began to focus on the metaphysical. It, obviously, still delivered it's socio-political message, but it wasn't the focus of the movie. Yuri (Nicholas Cage) really did become the ""Lord"" of war, sin itself, trapped in his own personal hell. Able to depict the laws and needs of man he rises above law and becomes a sort of demigod, as is shown during his trampings across west Africa where the armed men are unable to kill him and the hyenas confront him (""I felt cursed with invincibility"").<br/><br/>Cage, Bridget Moynahan, and Eamonn Walker all deliver amazing performances. Eamonn Walker really stole the show in a lot of ways, he played his role perfectly. Ethan Hawke is solid too, but I could have stood a few more scenes with him (like getting authorization to shoot at his plane over Africa). Despite the other reviews, Jared Leto's character was really the only down point of the movie. His overly dramatic final scene was hog wash, but Cage and the ""Freedom Fighter"" did finish the scene well at the bargaining table. (Honestly, that scene was the only reason Leto and the guy who played Andre Jr. were even in the movie, they were fluff characters who were there only to die) At any rate, I thought Lord of War was a great movie worth many viewings. Even if you don't make as much out of the movie as I did, it's worth it for the scene where Yuri has his plane land on the African highway... ""It's like parking your car in certain parts of the Bronx, you just don't do it."""

","Through out the first viewing of the film, I felt sorry for how Nicholas Cage has to make such an effort to be portrayed as a slightly better thing than the ultimate manifestation of evil. In truth I don't believe its the arms dealers that cause murder, but the way we are and its just easier to point your finger and say that this is the bad guy.<br/><br/>On the other hand I am glad this film came out at a time when Hollywood is seriously running out of interesting or not so cheesy scripts. Funny thing is we need people like arms dealers to feel good about ourselves. Nicholas Cage's performance was great and the issues touched by this film are all part of reality that people don't like to familiarize themselves with. The Hallelujah; song by Jeff Buckley is one of my favorites and the musics of the film are generally great."

","More than the quality, it was the message of this film that struck me. I believe it is very courageous of this filmmaker to take a stand on the subject of arm proliferation, showing how it affects humans and society by instantaneous death and worst, by latent, yet even more massive killings. Getting AIDS (""which can kill you in 10 years"") in an arm-infested country becomes such an insignificant risk! Most of Andrew Niccol's works are very powerful. This one is inspired from a crude reality. I remember reading an article about a Ukrainian arm-dealer a few years ago. The ""character"" and situations in that article resemble so much the ones in this film. And it touches much more than arms: ethnic identity, family matters, addictions (of all sorts) etc. It is not an ""action"" movie... although some people may see it like that. The acting is very good. Highly, highly, recommended, although it'll leave you aching. And, after all, it may not help change anything, which is another point in the movie: ""... if I stop, another one will take my place next day"". It left me with the cynical thought that it may all be just about human's nature, at whatever evolution stage it is at this point."

","Lord of War is truly a movie that will repulse some movie goers in the same way that Munich will repulse some others. But this does not mean that either movie is bad or morally wrong- merely a view of what has been going on in the case of Munich and what is going on in the case of Lord of War.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage plays Yuri Orlov- a Ukranian who from the ground up manages to build up his gunrunning business to the point where it can decide wars. He justifies his business transactions the same way as a man who runs a diner- claiming that it is a basic human function that humans will kill each other and that you may as well make a buck out of it. It's this sort of amoral pragmatism that seems to stick by him throughout his life, despite the horrendous atrocities he witnesses and commits, including the death of his main rival in Sir Ian Holm. However as the police, headed by Ethan Hawke, hone in on his private life, he finds the complex amount of lies he has spun beginning to unravel.<br/><br/>Lord of War is another movie that focuses on some of the problems in our society, by handing us basic figures through Cage's character as well as looking at various dodges, and corrupt sequences that show that no matter what you try to do, money talks, and in arms dealing, it seems to scream.<br/><br/>Cage gives a fantastic performance as Orlov, reminding one of Johnny Depp's Agent Sands in Once Upon a Time in Mexico with his pragmatic dialogue. Holm is also great as his rival, giving a concealed menace to his role. Hawke however, seems to want to play the role like a boy scout and so doesn't quite come across as genuinely smart enough to catch someone as slick as Orlov. Other than that though, this movie is truly an eye-opener and should be seen by everyone who has an interest in world affairs, if only for Cage's speech to Hawke in the interview room."
"tgincurtin","9","2","4","23 February 2006"," And the meaning is
","This is another weighty film from a writer who seems determined that audiences should question what is going on around them. So it's not commercial and not, strictly, entertaining. It's probably not as good a script as Gataca or Truman. But it still really packs a punch and it does have a dramatic arc that really satisfies. I think a lot of people will find it unsettling to confront the lead character justifying his actions. It is hard at times not to see ourselves trying to ignore the existence of the arms trade as many of the other characters do in this film. It's interesting that younger viewers rate the film more highly on IMDb. One has to wonder if their denial capabilities have yet to mature and for that reason they found it more compelling.<br/><br/>If this movie makes some people angry or better informed then it succeeds. That such venal people can use their ambition to trade in so much death and destruction is something that should matter a lot more than it does."
"Alieniloquium","6","2","4","2 February 2006"," A bold if rudimentary satire, ""Lord of War"" is a satisfying crime drama
","This film is, much like its granddaddy ""Scarface,"" a guilty pleasure. Andrew Niccol's ""Lord of War"" is in many ways a standard crime lord rise-to-power saga, but manages to shine through the myriad of imitators with a number of daring and refreshing moves. While the plot is perfectly predictable (with a few exceptions), the cinematography is excellent and the subject matter of gun running leaves the possibility of some gutsy satire. Don't expect cinematic genius or a film that will become a cult treasure; just expect to be satisfied for two hours.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage plays Yuri Orlov, a Ukranian-American who has taken to gunrunning to make his living. I must admit that at first, the name made me cringe and chuckle at the same time, but after a while I was used to it. In his pursuit is the enjoyable but entirely flat Interpol Agent Valentine (Ethan Hawke). The story follows Yuri's rise to power, his marriage to hometown beauty Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan), his struggle to defeat veteran gunrunner Simeon Weisz (Iam Holm), and his evasion of Agent Valentine's painfully by-the-book pursuits. The plot can be predicted almost entirely by supplanting the standard near-misses with the law, desires to go legit, compromises of morality, and inevitable downfall. What is most impressive about this film is not the story but its sheer irreverence for moralization.<br/><br/>Most poignant is the introduction and opening credits. Cage's disembodied voice relates some statistics about guns that you might hear from ""Bowling for Columbine."" There is one gun for every twelve people in the world. We then see Yuri and he says, ""The only question is: How do we arm the other eleven?"" After a pause for a guilty snicker, we follow a plate of metal from factor to firearm in an impressively well created (though cartoonish) point-of-view crash course in gun trafficking. The final image in the sequence is the bullet being fired from an AK-47 into the head of an all-too-young African ""soldier."" This seems cruel and overly graphic, but it is done in such a way that it is detached and satiric, setting the tone for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The relentless clip at which the film moves helps it avoid plunging into soap box mode. We see Yuri's clearly immoral and illegal acts rapidly enough that we haven't the time to consider them wrong. Niccol's script gives Cage's narration wit and craft that makes us cheer for Yuri's slights of hand. Yuri is clever enough that we entirely forget that he is selling guns to genocidal dictators. On top of the dialog are subtle stabs at American foreign policy and philosophical hypocrisy with quips like ""I sell to leftists, and I sell to rightists. I even sell to pacifists, but they're not the most regular customers."" Blood splatters onto blue and white windows to make less-than-subtle patriotic images. When the dictator of Liberia rigs an election and Yuri chastises him, the dictator flashes a newspaper showing the Supreme Court intervention in the U.S. Election of 2000. While not subtle, these tactics help steer the film from being preachy for the first half of the film.<br/><br/>When Yuri hits his requisite moment of moral decline, the film comes to a complete halt. Nicolas Cage enters melodramatic mode and looks like he might fall asleep as he tries to portray Yuri's descent into hell (which according to the movie is Africa). The palace of the brutal, but likable, dictator is replaced by the shacks of AIDS-infected hookers. Instead of laughing at the wake of destruction left by Yuri's trade, we are left to wallow in shock-value atrocities just in case we couldn't tell the film was a satire. It is unfortunate that the film reverted to such hackneyed tactics, as it is otherwise a well crafted criticism.<br/><br/>Thankfully the film picks up itself up with a witty ending and more scathing remarks. It also departs from the standard crime saga with one final stab at US foreign policy and at our expectations in an ending that makes up for most the film's faults. What this film lacks in originality it makes up for in the guts to deal with such touchy subjects with comedy. ""Lord of War"" is appealing and satisfying enough to be worth the time."

","Yuri Orlov argues that his products kill fewer people than tobacco and alcohol. He has a point, but it's more fun and takes longer to die that way. There are few pleasures to be had from an AK-47 bullet to the brain, and no time to enjoy them. Yuri is an international arms dealer who has ""done business with every army but the Salvation Army."" He cheerfully tours the world's flashpoints, a war-to-war salesman in a dark suit and tie.<br/><br/>""Lord of War"" is a bleak comedy, funny in a Catch-22 sort of way, and at the same time an angry outcry against the gun traffic that turns 12-year-olds into killers and cheapens human life to the point where might makes not only right, but everything else. Yuri is played by Nicolas Cage in another of those performances you cannot easily imagine anyone else doing; he plays an immigrant from Ukraine who has the cocky self-assurance, the snaky surface charm, the breezy intellectual justification for the most indefensible acts. He will sell to anyone, anytime, he tells us during his narration, which confides the secrets of his trade: He never sold to Osama bin Laden, because ""he was always bouncing checks.""<br/><br/>Yuri's world is a small one. He has few competitors and a short but frequently updated list of clients. The world's leading arms dealer when Yuri goes into business is Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm), who prefers not to do business with people he thinks are evil, although his definition of evil is extremely flexible. Yuri asks Simeon to let him team up, an offer Simeon rejects; he'll eventually lose a lot of business by that decision.<br/><br/>The clients come from all over. There is a moment in the film when Yuri gets some bad news: Peace talks have started in a particularly promising market. He shifts his focus to the Bosnian arena. When they say they're having a war, ""they keep their word.""<br/><br/>He also finds two good customers in Africa: The Liberian dictator Baptiste Senior (Eamonn Walker) and his son Baptiste Junior (Sammi Rotibi). Senior is capable of shooting people dead without notice just in a fit of pique. During a meeting with Yuri, he kills an inattentive aide, and seems ready to shoot Yuri next, but Yuri grabs the gun back and says, ""Now you'll have to buy it, because it's a used gun."" It's the kind of joke that appeals to Senior. Yuri's life and even his fortune are saved.<br/><br/>Yuri lives in Manhattan luxury with the former model Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan), who believes him, or pretends to believe him, when he says he's in the international shipping business. That business takes a turn for the better with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the sudden appearance on the black market of enormous caches of weapons. Luckily, Yuri is related to a now-retired general in Ukraine, and they do business.<br/><br/>The movie, directed by Andrew Niccol (""The Truman Show,"" ""Gattaca"") has some of the same stylistic aggressiveness as David O. Russell's ""Three Kings."" Consider a brilliant early montage that takes a bullet's-eye-view as it moves from ore to the assembly line to finishing, packaging, distribution, sale and eventual use; the montage ends with the bullet passing through the brain of a young man. It makes the point that at every step along the way, arms manufacturers are producing death as their end product.<br/><br/>That doesn't much bother Yuri, who believes that wars will be fought whether or not he sells arms. In that he is correct. There is the disagreement, however, of a stubborn Interpol agent named Valentine (Ethan Hawke), who thinks he could save some lives by putting Yuri out of business. Some of their encounters resemble the ""Spy vs. Spy"" feature in Mad magazine, as when Valentine chases a ship filled with arms, and Yuri is able to repaint its name and disguise it before the law gets close enough.<br/><br/>Helping Yuri at first, and then a distinct problem for him, is his younger brother Vitaly (Jared Leto). When they're desperately disguising the ship and need a Dutch flag they do not have, it is Vitaly's lateral thinking that suggests a French flag flown sideways looks like a Dutch flag.<br/><br/>After movies like ""Hotel Rwanda,"" ""Before the Rain"" and ""Welcome to Sarajevo,"" the cold cynicism of ""Lord of War,"" plays like a deadly footnote. People are killed because guns are available; wars lower the average age of soldiers until in some places they are fought by children with no idea of their original cause. It's hypnotic, like the gaze of a poisonous snake, how Yuri stares into the face of this horror and counts his profits. Will fate and justice eventually catch up with him? Maybe, unless money is the answer. In Yuri's experience, it usually is.<br/><br/>S."
"kastrino","8","0","0","15 May 2020"," American Nightmare
","I'm a big fan of Nick Cage and I admit he was the main reason for me to watch this as true stories of these type are not my cup of tea in movies. Having said that, LORD OF WAR is a fascinating take on the American Dream that may (at best) make some people that actively try to make big money at any cost to the planet or their fellow human beings think twice. At worst, shortsighted people will no doubt idolise the character of Yuri Orlov, a poor immigrant hitting big bucks when he starts trading guns, mainly in fascist, poor and war stricken countries, at the expense of the local populations.
The obvious effects of such a practice are well documented in the film that has great pace and high interest throughout, but for me the most important lesson is that the way the Western civilization views success is dead wrong. The constant hunt for the big life that the American dream dictates will always and surely lead to disaster for everyone concerned. And if the Yuri Orlovs (or Pablo Escobars or any money hungry entrepreneurs that profit from destroying the environment) of this world may very well go to hell for all I care, the problem is that during their trip there they take with them huge populations, countries and even the whole planet if that meant a few more dollars for them. And this tendency has more than doubled in our days of global warming, pandemias and other man- made disasters due to the constant hunt for the elusive ""big life"""

","Scary process to follow a lord of war and see all the external forces that keep him immune from all the legal boundaries. Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) dreams of power and wealth were, ultimately, accomplished, but like most mobster or crime stories the verdict is one of blood, tragedy, and destitution. For Yuri the American government was protecting its interests, so they released him and exonerated him from any legal charge, but he lost all emotional stability. He said it himself: ""My family has disowned me. My wife and son have left me. My brother's dead. I fully appreciate the seriousness of my situation.<br/><br/>This is an ominous subject now having 1.2 billion arms in the world in 2020, but the movie left a clear message. Any person that ventures into the lifestyle of immorality and illegality will, ultimately, endure catastrophic consequences. The movie in the initial scenes offers the viewer a perspective of a bullet going through the entire production, distribution, and application process: a stark symbol of the global nature of this problem. Due to the complicated and multi-dimensional nature of the production of firearms and bullets, the main manufacturers and benefactors clean their hands from the consequences, as Yuri was doing it with different rationalization during the movie; the movie helps the viewer consolidate all these factors and understand it holistically.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage outdid himself with his performance. He exudes so many different emotions throughout the movie that it is difficult to hate him, knowing what he had gone through, and his background in Little Odessa. He was always ""attempting"" to take care of his family; the family values did not elude him even as he committed multiple criminality and put his brother repeatedly in danger. His reaction to pulling the trigger and committing his first kill was consistent with a person that was in denial and rationalized his entire operation with weak logic and ambiguous statements.<br/><br/>The viewer gets so much information on gun multinational affairs that it is continually interesting to watch the narrative. He lived quadruple lives or had multiple identities being an equal opportunity merchant of death. At the peak of his enterprise we see him get embroiled with the president of Ethiopia. This is when his morality gets put to the test and reaches his threshold of depravity. The dialogue also adds memorable phrases that add flavor to the narrative and his rationality: ""Bullets change governments faster than votes""; ""I supply everyone but the Salvation Army""; ""Evil prevails when good men fail to act, what it ought to say is evil prevails"". As ominous as the dialogue is it helps us understand the mind of a person that is relentlessly searching for success in the industry of death and destruction.<br/><br/>The movie might send a morbid message but it's a real one: the gun industry seems to be above the law and the highest players are pulling the strings and committing genocide in a global scale."

","Nick Cage is one of the stranger actors in Hollywood. His name associates with a cult following in memes and low-budget films. In fact, the more I write this, the more I'm unsure if he was the best choice for the casting of this film (he's not bad in this movie, but it's hard to say he added value to the script). The merits of Cage aside, the story of this film is wonderfully well fleshed out. The opening sequence of Cage's Yuri Orlov musing on the ""undersaturated state"" of global firearms followed by a quick and brutal montage of the life of a bullet from production to a child soldier's head sets up both Cage's character and the tone of the movie well in an impactful and concise manner. It's one of the best opening sequences in film and something that really sets expectations for the movie.<br/><br/>The strongest aspect of the movie is far and away the writing. The movie is speckled with gems like ""They say, 'Evil prevails when good men fail to act.' What they oughta say is, 'Evil prevails.'"" as it trots along in it's unfortunately realistic sense of pessimistic narration. For the most part, the writing is enough to hold your attention and redirect it from the immersive and superfluous dramatization of INTERPOL agents, women, and Yuri's ""melodramatic"" wife, but these parts didn't contribute positively to the narrative of the overall movie.<br/><br/>In all, Lord of War is a good movie that executes on it's themes and narrative well but could improve with several revisions in casting and dramatic portrayal.<br/><br/>7.8/10"

"Svenstadt","8","0","0","14 December 2019"," Good entertainment for a change with an interesting actors / characters.
","Almost everything about this movie is good. If you're a fan of political dramas, this is it for you. Jared Leto plays Nick Cage's right-hand wingman and brother. They are illegal arms dealers, and spend the movie running surplus guns after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and in the process are responsible for some of the worst wars and mass killings in 3rd world countries around the world. The only problem is, Jared Leto is the weak conscientious person, and ultimately his anxiety leads to his demise. I found it difficult to ponder why Nick Cage's character, at the point where his own brother gets shot by the guns he supplied to the warlord, even then does not develop a conscience?? That was surprising. Then you have the very annoying and one-dimensional Ethan Hawke's character, who plays the overly zealous Federal Agent who can never seem to get enough evidence to throw Nick Cage in jail. Even in the end, no one grows into anything better than what they started out as.
The reason I didn't give this a 10 or 9 is because it feels a little too long, even though it might not seem that way. Also, it does not hold up to repeated viewing, for some reason. You don't really feel redeemed by having watched this. This is an artistic work, but it lacks any sort of message in the end. Nick Cage, I guess, does a good job doing what he does (ie playing the dry wit of the movie). Therein lies another problem: Nick Cage has about 2 characters that he re-hashes: he is either Cameron Poe from Con-Air, or he is the guy from The Rock.
Ultimately, this movie is very materialist-centered, and at points it feels more like it is a rap video rather than a drama."

","It is indeed quite easy to poke fun at some of the cages more laughably bad roles that he has taken as of late. However, all the memes and the like should never take away from the fact that he can actually be a good actor sometimes, hell, even a damn great one, like he is in this.<br/><br/>This film follows the life of a Ukrainian man who sells guns to various dictators and militants and eventually becomes the main financier of bloodshed and combat in many warring countries. Knowing that it is easy to see his character as irredeemably evil. He sells these weapons with full knowledge innocent people will likely die because of it and does it anyway, he sees it as a business. That's what makes him that much more of an interesting character. He sees the prospect of arms dealing as a pure money making affair, with no attached desire to get involved with any of the conflict that makes his business necessary. He goes from country to country, getting all down in the nit and grit of the monstrosities and genocides committed, and still leaves with the cash and returns home to great riches and a loving family.<br/><br/>This is a pure character study of a film. It takes us through the eyes of cages character, who also narrated the film. We see his many complexes on how he believes arms dealers may be the only thing keeping a sort balance. How they may be more genuine then some prompted legal businesses. It has a good deal of violence and depravity to it, but also intrigue. This all comes down to cages brilliant performance, all the levels of cleverness and precision that make him fun to watch, and the rest of the movie, right along with all the uncomfortable states it outs you in and the questions it makes you ask there."

"bowmanblue","7","0","0","12 February 2019"," Uber-restrained Cage
","Nicolas Cage has had an up and down career over the ages - well, mainly 'down' these day, but, back when he could still headline a movie that wasn't released straight-to-DVD, he did 'Lord of War.' It's mainly a drama, but there are certainly elements of satire and almost black comedy sprinkled liberally here and there. Cage plays your average lovable international arms dealer who's happily selling weapons of mass destruction around the world while enjoying the fruits of his efforts (much to the disapproval of a long-suffering Interpol agent, played by Ethan Hawke, who's constantly hot on his trail).<br/><br/>There's a reason Nicolas Cage won an Oscar and could prop up even the weakest of scripts with his acting ability and here it shines through. It's definitely one of his last (best) films where the whole show lies upon his shoulders. Granted, he's got a bit of a reputation of - how best to put this - going a little 'over the top' with his acting performances, however, here he's actually pretty restrained compared to some of he previous output.<br/><br/>Even though it's Nic's show through and through, there is a pretty decent cast around him. Besides the already-mentioned Ethan Hawke (who's not in it as much as he probably should be), there's also Jared Leto and Ian Holm, both who put in good performances considered the amount of screen-time they're afforded. Cage's on-screen wife is played by Bridget Moynahan who has little to do but look hard done by due to her husband's dodgy lifestyle choices.<br/><br/>It's full of social satire and statements about the way we (as Western nations, I guess) live and run our countries, plus the impact the arms trade (whether it be legal, or Nicolas Cage's way of doing it) has on the countries such weapons end up in the hands of. It's also pretty dark in places and doesn't pull any punches. Just because the majority of the violence caused by such weapons is cleverly edited out, we can get the full horror of the regimes who desire to buy illegal weapons such as machine guns and grenades.<br/><br/>It's hardly an uplifting film, but Cage does what he does best and makes it worth a re-watch or two with his charming portrayal of someone who deliberately blinds himself to the horrors of what he's doing, simply to further his own lavish lifestyle - hardly a heroic protagonist, but then I guess that's what the film's trying to say."

","This is the best film Nicolas Cage has ever made. It is in my top 100 films of all time; and it is not easy to get on that list. The acting, direction, production values, and writing for this film are top of the line. There is not one flaw in the film. I can count on two hands the films I have give ratings of 10; it is not a rating I give often. Every scene is perfectly shot. Every sequence is more astounding than the next. Every character is eminently believable. America loves its guns. It makes, uses and distributes more guns in the world than the next TWENTY countries combined. Americans love their guns more than their children; and this is not an exaggeration. When faced with protecting their children or the second amendment to protect gun owners, Americans consistently take action for the latter. They can say they love their children more than their guns, but their actions prove otherwise. Of course, there are millions of Americans who do love their children more than guns (and I am one of them), but it would appear as if they are in the minority, OR the gun lobby and forces that we see at work in this film are far more powerful than the majority of Americans who live in the country. Even the character portrayed by Cage throws away a toy gun that his son has. At some level, he does not want his son to be like him. Our children are bombarded with toy guns from toddler age, TV gun violence, movie gun violence, and actual gun use in communities until guns become second nature to them. I was ecstatic when I qualified for Expert in Basic Training during the Vietnam War. I loved going to the rifle range because I was very good at it. I had been conditioned to feel that way from the time I was a small child and had my Hopalong Cassidy six-shooters in my side holsters. After the Vietnam War, I knew better. And forty years after the Vietnam War, I still know better. Guns are instruments of death. My favorite line in the film is when a little girl who is an amputee asks the white man from the US ""Will my arm grow back again?"" No, it won't. It would be nice if we protected children instead of guns."

","Nicolas Cage stars in more movies than any actor I've ever known, and occasionally he makes a good one. This would be amongst those: a devastating indictment of the international arms market as supported by corrupt governments, and a searing picture of one man slowing sinking into the abyss of evil which he creates himself. If you like Yuri's flippantly wicked attitude at the start, you certainly won't by the end... unless, you want Darth Vader to win all along.
Ethan Hawke provides good support as a by-the-book Interpol agent, and Bridget Monynahan is effective as Yuri's unsuspecting wife, in fact the whole cast from crazy African despots to impoverished townspeople is great. The only thing I would say is that some of the dialogue is a bit too 'on the nose' in terms of the ongoing battle of good vs evil, and sometimes the plot feels more like a sequence of events instead of having a cohesive narrative.
But these are just minor gripes. Most people will come away from this feeling just a little less safe than they were before, and a bit more depressed at the state of the world we live in. And, guess what? These are exactly the emotions the film strives for. Bravo. 7/10"

","Lord of War plays itself as an action-drama, when really the action of the successes of an illegal arms dealer is shadowed by the meditative performance as a period piece.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage plays a Ukrainian-American transplant Yuri Orlov who strikingly resembles the infamous international arms dealer Viktor Bout. Just as infamously, Nicholas Cage does not disappoint viewers with his melodramatic ""bout"" of overreactions and mistimed lines. This is in addition to the general feel of 122 minutes of Cage playing a character that he, for a lack of a better analysis, is not. Strength and determination is needed for a rags to riches story in the deadliest black market, and Cage simply does not meet the demands for such a performance. Poor casting, however, should not deter viewers from the commendable nature of this film.<br/><br/>Plot is very tight and carries the viewer along Orlov's journey, both geographically and temporally. Director Andrew Niccol achieves this arching dynamic with the highs in Orlov's private jet (with a beautiful and rich performance by Bridget Moynahan as Ava Fontaine) to the lows of snorting cocaine cut with gun powder (as an aside, the blue overtones in that scene were a bit overboard).<br/><br/>SPOILER ENDING Orlov loses everything. His brother dies, his parents disown him, and his wife leaves with his child. The story is then immediately cut short when Orlov magically continues what he is best at: gun-running. Lord of War is a good example at how a perfectly healthy plot line can fall apart in a matter of one scene.<br/><br/>Perhaps Director Niccol wants to stay true to the similarities to real-life Viktor Bout, but regardless, Orlov is kept alive and well. With so much personal loss in his life, he does not stop, hesitate, or even flinch at the idea that his job has killed him as much as it has the victims of his customers. In fact, Cage's performance suggests that Orlov could care less about his family, where the dialogue says otherwise. Orlov escapes to his bull market of Africa with a smile on his face, and a bribe in his hand.<br/><br/>Aside from the emotionally bewildering ending and Cage's equally bewildering performance, Lord of War gives us a crash course in gun-running in an entertaining way. If you're anything like me, you will want your own personal AK-47 by the end of it."

","'Lord of War', the word which the African dictator used to describe himself in the movie, was adopted as the title, instead of the word warlord, which is more idiomatic in the eyes of native English speakers that Yuri tried hard to correct him a few times repeatedly. <br/><br/>This does not come with no reason. This movie leads its audience to reevaluate who is the ultimate warlord while we are pointing fingers to those dictators for their cruelty and the bloodshed provoked. <br/><br/>From the dialogue in which the dictator spoke to Yuri, the throne of 'lord of war' should, indeed, be crowned to men like Yuri who could smuggle whatever arms he needed under the surveillance of Interpol and world power.<br/><br/>However, more surprisingly, from Yuri's perspective, it's ultimately those mighty world leaders, who have been, de facto, permitting illicit trading and smuggling of arms under their eyes for self-interest. <br/><br/>Therefore, I speculate the writer wants us to reevaluate who, some hypocritical world leaders or the tyrants, should bear a greater responsibility for the bloodbath happening around us. Who, Warlord or Lord of War, is the more sinful?<br/><br/>After watching the movie, I start to doubt if we have the right to flame on those tyrants when our mother countries actually manipulate, empower and live on them. Perhaps, it's why the dictators were not heavily criticized in the movie but the world leaders and gunrunner businessmen.<br/><br/>P.S. kinda sad to see Yuri did not respond to Vitaly's 'Ukrainian Brothers In Arms' at last, that's also the pivotal point Yuri became a professional yet emotionless gunrunner on his own."

","The Lord of War though not very convincing, draws attention to some subtle truths and the lessons it portrays are worth reflecting upon. <br/><br/>It is the story of a simple man who chances upon an idea of making it big by selling weapons to warring factions and nations. The double life he leads where in loves someone and his family but is willing to let thousands of innocent people die under the pretext of 'this is not my war' is quite chilling. The sudden change and remorse of his younger brother towards the end of the movie, when he refuses to do business, knowing well that the weapons being sold would be used upon the refugees gathered right in front of him, is quite touching. He dies a martyr in an attempt to sabotage the weapons deal. <br/><br/>The conclusion leaves one in a bit of a dilemma: does the movie justify the arms deal by an individual as a camouflage for the official/'legal' weapons trade by politicians? When his wife comes of know of his 'business' and questions him, as to how he could cope with the guilt, his plain answer: ""I'm good at it.""<br/><br/>In this conflict between the personal moral stand and the professional ethics, the latter apparently emerges the winner... but with a heavy toll. I'm prone to believe that the fate of Yuri, the arms dealer would be the same as that of Simon, the other arms dealer who tries to cross paths with Yuri.<br/><br/>The scene where a whole jumbo plane is dismantled and carried away in pieces by the locals in a remote part of Africa, overnight, is very dramatic.<br/><br/>http://www.vcastilino.blogspot.in/"

","This is one of Nick Cage's better movies of late Cage plays Yuri Orlov, an immigrant who, bored of his small-town existence, decides to pursue a career as a gun-runner as a means of getting out of his otherwise dull lifestyle. What's more, he finds he is rather good at it and so begins the tale of his adventures on the shadier shade of life.<br/><br/>Orlov is an inherently unlikeable man. He traffics in guns, no doubt causing the deaths (indirectly) of countless thousands of people. He smokes, does drugs, marries a girl primarily because of an infatuation (not love), uses his brother whenever it suits him and is generally full of unpleasant moral leanings. In short, he should be a character we could care less about and, in fact, might hope to be brought to justice.<br/><br/>Yet, in spite of this and thanks in great measure to clever writing and Cage's performance, Orlov grows on you very quickly. You find yourself watching his antics (narrated by Cage himself throughout the movie) with amusement and even, in some ways, admiration.<br/><br/>Of course, if this were a typical Hollywood movie, you might expect that, in the end, Orlov's empire would come crashing down around his ears and he would end up in jail. But this is not a typical movie.<br/><br/>Instead, the final revelation of the film is one that, perhaps, we all know deep down. That, behind every bad man is another man, one step removed from the dirty-hands of the man below him and wielding more power. And behind him yet another, and so on, all the way to the top of the power tree. In short, the movie tells us that power is corrupt and that, no matter how good your intentions, there is always someone more powerful than you who is not so scrupulous.<br/><br/>Of course, Cage's character does lose much in the course of his career - wife, family, brother etc. But in the end, thanks to ""the man above him"" he walks free."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","0","0","10 January 2012"," Unique and unusually entertaining take on a dark subject matter
","Nicolas Cage outranks all others under the column heading ""schizophrenic actor,"" but when he hits, he hits. Playing characters such as lovably deplorable gun-runner Yuri Orlov fans the flames of the public's love-hate relationship with the big-screen veteran, reminding us of how much great work he could do if he had any semblance of screenplay taste buds (or fewer problems paying his taxes).<br/><br/>Andrew Niccol's ""Lord of War"" fits Cage scarily well. The film creates an fictional arms dealer and imagines what his life would look like throughout the years from the Cold War to the many African civil wars. It then focuses inward on what kind of a person could possibly live with themselves dealing tools of power and genocide. <br/><br/>Cage thrives with the opportunity to be slick and clever yet off-kilter and morally troublesome. Niccol's snappy writing, especially the voice-over narration, gives the film some edginess. What could be a darker and more dramatic tale of a man who deals guns to some of the most despicable people on the planet has a comedic tone that further muddles how we should feel about the main character.<br/><br/>Orlov immigrated from Soviet Ukraine as a child and grew up pretending to be Jewish in Brighton Beach. In awe of the power that guns had, he quickly made his way from gang supply to arming full-on wars. He stuck with it because he was good at it, and it made him rich. He had enough money to contrive an entire scenario that would allow him to meet and woo his dream girl, a model named Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan). She grows wise to the fact that he's not what he says he is, but takes no issue with the extravagant lifestyle.<br/><br/>A counterpoint to Yuri is his brother, Vitaly (Jared Leto), who begins as Yuri's partner but caves to the moral pressure of the job and develops a fierce cocaine addiction. So while he's the screw-up, he still has his moral compass in check, and we're left wondering which is the better of the two evils.<br/><br/>Compared to Niccol's previous work (""Gattaca,"" ""The Truman Show""), ""Lord of War"" seems like a much more grounded and gritty affair, but the New Zealander filmmaker employs levity throughout and gives the story some Hollywood-y or fantasy-like characteristics. As Yuri begins to have run-ins with an Interpol agent played by Ethan Hunt, their relationship feels very cat-and-mouse in the truly archetypal sense. It's evidence that Niccol wants to make an entertaining film on a topic that some would probably regard as being too sensitive for such a treatment. <br/><br/>Yet the tone of ""Lord of War"" is consistent throughout. As shocking as some of the violence can be and as much as you'll think about what a horrible thing he does for a living, there's a riskiness to the film that echoes the volatile nature of Yuri's line of work. You might be having a ball living it up one moment and find your life in danger the next, just as any moment in the film could flip around entirely.<br/><br/>""Lord of War"" doesn't condone Yuri's choices or suggest you should be rooting for him, which is one of the film's biggest strengths. Niccol wants you to ask yourself why this happens; why someone can get filthy rich off selling guns. The answer might leave you a little sick inside, but it's true. Rather than asking the audience to assess Yuri's character, the credits roll on ""Lord of War"" with much bigger questions on the table.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

He narrates his own tale giving you an insightful look into his illegal activities.<br/><br/>The story is well written and dramatic, as Yuri, with an interpol agent hot on his case, begins to question the morality of what he does in this thought provoking film that deals with the dark realm of reality.<br/><br/>Altogether not what you would call an entertaining film (as thats not what it is meant to be) but rather thoughtful in how it deals with the morality of the issue. That doesn't mean its boring, its good film, but not for those looking for a mindless thrill ride."

","This movie tells a story about something that everyone should think about: morality. It says that there isn't a de facto difference between illegal and immoral but law sanctions the first and life itself the second. That's not comfort, of course, but leaves a certain amount of hope.<br/><br/>Cage , Moynahan and Leto are excellent. Hawke's part is not that big but matches the others. Directing, editing and camera also. Everything about this movie is in place and it was a pleasant and fulfilling experience to watch it. No, it is not an action movie and not meant to be ""entertaining"", and it keeps you involved from the first scene to the last. Highly recommended."

","We all want to make quick bucks, especially if you got the talent for it. You're young, underprivileged, and there's nothing going for you in life - so you've got nothing to lose. <br/><br/>This was the situation Ukrainian immigrant Yuri (Nick Cage) was in. He latched on to one of the most lucrative trade business in the world - arms dealing. This sort of thing has a way of catching up to you, and eventually it does. There's a point where you've made enough money that price of taking short cuts are no longer worth it, but unfortunately, life won't let us go so easily. What do we do then ?<br/><br/>This has to be one of the top three movies Nicholas Cage has starred in. He's great as the main character. His portrayal of Yuri is so spot on. The highs of out smarting the justice, getting your dream girl, are all portrayed in a stylish way I've rarely seen in recent movies. Of course there's price to pay for all this, and he's paying it. In the end I felt that he wasn't as bad as the justice department that was after him. There are bigger evil in this world, and compared to them who runs the system, guys like Yuri is small fry. He was just after his fortune.<br/><br/>I loved this movie, and I highly recommend it for viewing."

","The film starts as a comedy-crime then gradually blends into a noir- drama. The poster may seem deceiving here since the movie doesn't belong to the war genre. That's interesting, because that probably makes this the best anti-war film you'll see with no battlefield action.<br/><br/>Probably what's more fascinating than the movie itself is it's lack of accolades. You may agree that it demanded at least one, the best writing award. Yet the film goes unmentioned at the Oscar's. I suspect that this has to do with the political theme of the film; the ruthless condemnation of western administrations and the affair between the ""Security Council"" and the ""Freedom Fighters"".<br/><br/>You will never see a weak moment in its entire runtime and the performances are excellent. Nicholas Cage does require a special mention. Andrew Nicole proves that he's no amateur (or was he ever!) and the best at what he does.<br/><br/>So go ahead grab a copy, sit back and let the narration run accompanied by outstanding cinematography and the bone chilling background score."

","The protagonist, Nicholas Cage (nee Nicholas Coppola), grows up with his younger brother, Jared Leto, in an immigrant community in Brooklyn in the 1980s. Crime and shootings are all around. Soon, the street-savvy Cage latches on to a way to make some money out of the deal. ""It's not white and it's not black. It's the way I like it, gray."" Cage narrates the movie in a cool and ironic way, explaining things to us like a tourist guide.<br/><br/>His working-class parents are morally upright but Cage and his brother begin selling weapons small time. The ambitious Cage begins to make higher-echelon friends and graduates to a larger scale enterprise, with phony passports, international sales trips, bribery, networking his relatives in the Ukraine, and whatnot. His chief product is the AK 47, which is cheap, reliable, and simple to operate.<br/><br/>And the work itself is surprisingly easy. Okay. You have a few dozen attack helicopters you want to ship from one point to another but it's against the law to ship armed helicopters. It's not against the law to ship the weapons and the ammunition, just the craft themselves. No problem. You just unship the weapons and transport them separately. If anyone objects to the helicopters, you tell them they are now rescue craft. The bribery helps smooth over complicated transactions.<br/><br/>Usually, the transactions are even simpler. After the collapse of the USSR, the Ukraine was without a functioning government but had stores of AK 47s. If the inventory says there are, say, 41,000 such automatic weapons, Cage points out to the officer in charge that that ""4"" looks like a ""1"" to him. The bribery smooths things over.<br/><br/>Cage acquires as a wife a slinky model whose photos he's always salivated over, though he tells her nothing about his business. He leaves his brother behind, as he climbs the ladder, pursued now by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms as well as Interpol.<br/><br/>Now he's fabulously wealthy. His stretch limousine purrs as it swooshes him through the streets of Manhattan. There are women on the side, of course, although he has to be careful in Africa -- too many cases of AIDS and too few condoms. And that ten-ton car? He has to watch it sometimes because it's being tracked by the occasional helicopter. Then, too, once in a while one of his cars explodes when someone tries to start it.<br/><br/>The ending has Cage trying to reform but being forced by one of his clients into a last deal. It's trickier than he thought, and he loses his brother. Then his wife finds out what he's been up to and she takes their child and leaves him flat.<br/><br/>Cage is arrested by his nemesis, Ethan Hawke, but is released by an officer of high rank in the U.S. Army. The government finds Cage's services sometimes valuable. Sometimes the government wants arms to reach a certain group without the government itself having been involved. Private enterprise, you know, solves a lot of problems. Cage regrets his losses but shrugs them off and goes back to what he does so well, selling illegal arms on the international market. He doesn't say, ""Why mess with a good thing?"", but he might as well have.<br/><br/>Now -- who directed it? WRONG. It's not Michael Scorsese. It's Andrew Nicol, who also wrote it.<br/><br/>You can tell it's not Scorsese because, though it may end in resignation and acceptance, the film clearly disapproves of the events that play out on the screen. There is a rather lengthy epilogue and a fantasy shot of millions of empty cartridges in case we haven't gotten the point yet.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage is reliable as the narrator and protagonist. He's always reliable, no matter how shabby the part, and this part isn't shabby. Of course the subject could hardly be more important. Nukes are nothing compared to the dangers presented by a sea of Kalashnikov 47s, which have killed millions and are now represented on one African country's coin and another's national flag.<br/><br/>Nice photography. Nice production values. When a scene is supposed to take place in Sudan, we can believe it's the Sudan. And Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, looks thoroughly dilapidated and ratty.<br/><br/>There are times when the film's joints creak as it reaches out to instruct the more naive among us -- that final shot of a carpet of empty brass, and the narrator's comment that every warlord's group has some fancy name like ""Democratic Freedom Fighters."" Well, you know, if we haven't slept through this century so far, we probably already know that.<br/><br/>None of this criticism should prevent anyone from watching the movie. It alternates pedagogy with brutality in the manner of Scorsese's better works."

","Be advised contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Lord of War is a movie done in 2005 that is the story of Yuri Orlov played by Nicolas Cage. The movie is set in the 1980's to the 1990's. The movie starts out with Yuri watching a Mob hit and sees that he can become an arms dealer as way out of his family's restaurant. He then realizes that he has a knack for languages and is good at it.<br/><br/>He then recruits his brother Vitaly played by Jared Leto to help him with his growing arms dealing business (Lord of War, 2005). Yuri never has a problem selling to warlords or evil people to him it is just business and that he personally isn't responsible for anyone being killed with the weapons. His business keeps growing and his goal is to be the best arms dealer in the world.<br/><br/>He then meets Ava Fontaine played by Bridget Moynahan and becomes obsessed with her (Lord of War, 2005). He then finds her at a hotel and ends up renting out the whole hotel to make it seem like they are the only people staying there. He does this as an excuse to get a chance to talk to her they then start dating and eventually get married. He never discusses what he does for a living during this time.<br/><br/>The recurring theme during this whole movie is how morally bankrupt he is. He never cares about who he sells to and the consequences for what he sells. His brother so consumed by guilt for what he is doing becomes a drug addict and ends up dying because he can't handle it.<br/><br/>When he is finally caught by Jack Valentine played by Ethan Hawke he loses his family (Lord of War, 2005). His wife then divorces him and takes his son and she is done with him. He then is released from Valentines Custody due to him being important to the United States government.<br/><br/>The whole recurring theme of the movie is how he puts his business above everything. After he loses his brother to what his choice of profession is he still doesn't stop he keeps on going. The end of the movie even after he loses his family he still keeps on doing his profession and has no plans to stop. This movie is extremely well done and Nicolas Cage plays his role perfectly"
"KineticSeoul","8","0","0","26 February 2011"," Very intriguing and entertaining film about a gunrunner
","From just the intro I could tell this was going to be a interesting movie. And for the most part it did and most aspects of this film is very well executed. For the most part the dialogue and the narration by Nicholas Cage's character clever and sharp for the most part. The plot is about a very good business man and has talent for being a very good sales man, but what he sells is weapons to different nations and regions. So basically he is a arms dealer who would trade with anyone as long as he got the big bucks for it. He is also sleazy at times and knows how to use people and just throw them away. So basically he is someone almost everyone would hate especially when he says stuff like ""there's nothing more expensive for an arms dealer than peace"". But you can't help but have slight respect for this character because of the way he accomplishes his tasks, it's just very sharp and entertaining to watch, also witty at times. This is one of those movies with the protagonist narrating almost everything through his success and failures. But is very well crafted to the point it got my attention for the most part. The timing and luck of this arms dealer can sort of take out of it's believability, but it's thrilling from the beginning to end. And how the greed of this arms dealer consumes him as the film progresses had my attention and kept my interest. Also Nicholas Cages performance wasn't just intriguing but conspicuous. Ethan Hawke has been good with the cop roles he has been getting and in this his performance is very well done as well playing Jack Valentine. A Interpol agent who is a clean and straight by the book type and doesn't take bribes no matter what. Basically one of the main problem for the main arms dealer in this movie.<br/><br/>8.4/10"

Now that is exactly what he did in this one as well.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage is an arms dealer who has an obsession with selling arms and he is damn good at it. While doing his monkey business he encounters various problems from the interpol as well as from his conscience. The morality keeps on nibbling at his soul, however he never gets exhausted. Things mess up pretty badly for him as he fails to justify his veracity in front of his wife. It costs him a lot eventually. Ethan Hawke plays the guy from Interpol who is on a hunt to catch him. Andrew Niccol wrote a brilliant story about war and politics.

But, at the peak of his prowess, he discovers his customers might demand more than he can give and those he's trying to protect could become deadly liabilities,"" according to the film's official synopsis. <br/><br/>It may be a matter of personal taste, but this film could have done without half of the narration - some of the images have a better effect with musical soundtrack and incidental dialogue only. Pointing out that the film's anti-hero didn't sell arms to Osama bin Laden because his checks bounced, for example, comes across as a pre-calculated, half-hearted apology. Let's leave him out? The film is better when Mr. Cage's ""Yuri"" marries Bridget Moynahan (as Ava Fontaine), with relatively little narrative fanfare. <br/><br/>Ultimately, however, writer/director Andrew Niccol does create a captivating film statement about gun-running, and its human cost - both literal (Vitaly's body) and figurative (Yuri's soul). There are some outstandingly imagined sequences, beginning with the opening ""credits"". Weaving Rufus Wainwright's singing of Leonard Cohen's broken ""Hallelujah"" into the film works very well.

"winner55","7","0","0","21 February 2009"," brilliant but problematic
","One important point to get out of the way - the use of Interpol in this film is indeed completely fictional, but it has been a conventional fiction in films, especially action films, since the late 1960s, so I am willing to pardon its use here. However, I should also note that this is not an action film, it is not technically even a ""thriller,"" and part of the difficulty assessing the film is in trying to determine precisely what it is.<br/><br/>This is in many ways a brilliant film, both visually and in its dialog, and both a thoughtful and thought-provoking expose of the contemporary arms industry. Yet it has two difficulties in its structure that make it difficult to recommend without qualification. Both have been noted in previous reviews: first, we don't get to see the development of gun-runner Orlov's business, from his first sale to his appearance at an arms-sales convention, where he is already well-known, albeit only as 'an amateur.' How does he get from Brooklyn to there with limited funds? There's actually only one probable answer - major loans - but this is only hinted at when he remarks about using credit cards to pay off credit cards. And even this doesn't explain how he adapted to the culture of illegal arms sales when he first entered it. That's important because obviously that introduction would have gone into the worlds of, first, street gangs, then mobs, then international crime cartels - we know this is true, since we do get the one glimpse of a major sale to a South American drug dealer. But surely this would only be the tip of the iceberg.<br/><br/>The other problem in the structure is more difficult to address, because it is also part of the film's strength. The first two thirds of the movie are presented as high-irony satire on the international arms market. It is only as the final third unfolds that we begin to realize that Orlov, as voice-over narrator, is not speaking ironically, he actually means every word he says. The tone of the film then shifts dramatically into tragedy.<br/><br/>The strength of this movement is that we at last discover Orlov to be a cold-blooded socio-path, even able to disregard the death of his brother, since it doesn't entirely impede the arms deal he is engaged in at the time. This is a man who has only one reason to live, to develop a successful illegal arms trading business. Nothing else matters to him, and because of that he is actually more wretched than the murderous thugs he deals with - they, at least, enjoy what they do, he is merely obsessed with his profession.<br/><br/>That's a powerful statement, to be sure. The question is whether this dramatic shift in tone really works, or have we been, as more than one reviewer expressed it, deceived by the comedic beginning into buying a kind of numbed sociological drama? One reviewer compared this film to Scorcese's ""Goodfellows,"" but Scorcese affects the shift from ironic commentary on Mafia culture to actual gangster film drama in a gradual convolution punctuated by moments of intense violence that point out the moral degradation we should have been admitting all along. ""Lord of War"" reads as pure satire until the moment it isn't amusing at all, and that is very disturbing. It's hard to say yet whether that is a good thing, or whether it is asking too much from its audience.<br/><br/>Otherwise, as noted, much of the film-making is actually brilliant - in the script and the visuals; and the editing holding these elements together is solid. The acting is quite good, although I found Cage lacking focus occasionally - but this may have to do with the shift in tone noted above. And the film's topic is certainly important enough to consider.<br/><br/>But it's not clear whether a film can go down this path without surrendering some important clarity. I had the same sense with the sudden shift in tone towards the end of ""No Country for Old Men;"" and as with ""No Country,"" at the end of this film, one is left with an uneasy sense of helplessness. I'm not sure that's where the director wanted to leave us, and I'm not sure whether I like, or even accept, being there."

I think Jared Leto had a better performance but I am a bigger fan of his work then Nicholas Cage. I respect Nicholas Cage because he is related to Francis Ford Coppola but didn't want that to be the reason for his success so he changed his name when he went into acting. And one of his first films also owes success to Coppola as Cage was casted in Rumble Fish as ""Smokey"". Nicholas Cage is a poor actor which has luckily been casted in some good films. I never expect too much from his acting and I liked Lord of War as much as Snake Eyes. Mr. Cage, stick to action movies!"
"info-11400","8","0","0","6 December 2007"," Political satire, and still a very good movie
","The best thing about Lord of war: It doesn't take itself too serious.<br/><br/>It is very political and deep inside pretty moralistic, but it always has a more or less cynical point of view. And that is to my mind the only way to do a film about a theme like arms trade.<br/><br/>The alternative would be to take things serious. And show the audience the consequences. But one cannot do that! One cannot display the horrors of real life, of real war, of real genocide. That would be worse than any splatter movie. A documentary could do it. But not a feature film.<br/><br/>Being a cynical satire the characters in ""Lord of War"" lack some depth. The main character Orlov for example does not really develop into an arms dealer, he just decides to be one. Or take the sub-plot of his wife. This could have been a deep psychological study. Fortunately ""Lord of War"" does not really care for psychology.<br/><br/>The film just tells us a story about a very nice arms dealer. A man who never thinks too deep. A man who is just making money by indirectly killing thousands. He knows he may not care too much about this.<br/><br/>And yet one gets a very clear idea about his guilt. His relation to Baptiste (dictator and war lord) is the pivotal aspect of the story. Baptiste is dangerous, is a killer, and yet a perfect business partner. And Orlov treats him like one would with any business partner. And everyone including Orlov knows that Baptiste is a monster. One has to have a very special view of the world in order to deal with persons like Baptiste. Frightening how easy this can be achieved.<br/><br/>And that is what makes the whole story. How easy moral can be overrun by business.<br/><br/>A message presented in a laid back manner. And that is why it reaches the audience."

","There seems to have been relatively few high-profile films made recently about the business of arms trading, which is quite surprising really when you consider the potential for development in the action thriller genre. This attempt to shed some light on the shady goings-on in the trade seeks to be more of a study of the mechanics of the business with the usual soapy trimmings regarding the conflict between the protagonist's business and family life, than a thriller and, in this respect, it succeeds very well. Having said that, the glimpse we are given into a world that would otherwise be closed to us, is a strangely sanitised one. Little insight  other than the manipulations of one particular West African despot  is given into the life-threatening, nerve-jangling danger into which an arms dealer must step every time he tries to sell his wares.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage plays Yuri Orlov, the son of Ukrainian immigrants (the film fights shy of having its protagonist being a true American. The writer would probably have us believe Orlov's background is instrumental to the direction he takes in life, but the cynic in me can't help thinking that the producers were probably a little worried that the cash tills wouldn't ring so loud if the main character, who after all, profits from the misery and death of others, were home-grown). Cage is not a great actor, and he struggles here which, in a way, testifies to the strength of the script in that it can overcome the usual deficiencies in Cage's performance. A better actor would have had more success in subtly communicating through expression and gesture the personal hell which Orlov  through choice  endures. Everything about him is fake: he lies about his name, and he lies to his family and his trophy wife about what it is that he does for a living. He even seduces his wife with a lie then secretly becomes the only buyer of her ordinary painting when she becomes an artist. There is a rich vein to explore here, but unfortunately Cage muffs it.<br/><br/>To survive in his business, Yuri can't afford a conscience so he has one provided for him in the form of his younger brother, ably played by Jared Leto. His conscience, who was once his partner, snorts copious amounts of drugs and has copious amounts of sex with women with names like Candy, and his fate is as predictable as the source of Yuri's eventual 'downfall.' Where this predictability is a (perhaps unavoidable) weakness, the repercussions (or eventual lack of them) is the key to what the whole film is about, and has a veracity about it that is rarely found in mainstream movies. It sums Yuri up more succinctly than the previous 90 minutes of heavily-narrated exposition, and goes some way to explaining the bland, suited disguise behind which he hides."

Growing up in the violence of Hell's Kitchen, he decides to becomes an illegal gun salesman for the local thugs. Hoping to expand his business, he and his brother work to enter the world stage.<br/><br/>Selling guns illegally is akin to selling any illegal product, from drugs to being a mobster like in ""The Sopranos."" But there's no sense of Cage's character being a mobster. His disconnect from what his product is used for and his responsibility of that use is interesting but probably a very foreign concept to 99.9% of the population.<br/><br/>He is so calculating and cavalier through-out the movie, it's difficult to develop a sense of empathy towards him. However, his character is presented in such an entertaining fashion, it's difficult to despise him for what he does. There are efforts made to suggest that he had a sense of morals, but truthfully, it comes across more as him just being a spineless worm.<br/><br/>The film takes a very dark turn in its final reel as his world begins to fall apart.

","Lord of War attempts to say something meaningful about the global arms trade however it's trapped by the two cardinal rules of big budget Hollywood action movies. Firstly, the star must be likable, even if his actions have evil consequences. Secondly big budget action films must be lively and entertaining and that means lots of violence. Although the film shows some of Africa's problems and implies that selling guns to psychotic leaders is bad it also uses violence to make the film more exciting.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage is excellent as Yuri Orlov, a Ukrainian immigrant living in New York. Yuri finds working in his parents' restaurant unfulfilling so he decides to become an arms dealer. He starts off selling guns to local thugs. He expands internationally, does well, acquires a trophy wife (Bridget Moynahan) and becomes an instrument of U.S. foreign policy. Cage narrates the story and like Aaron Eckhart's character in Thank You for Smoking, Yuri refuses to accept any moral responsibility for the guns he sells. He convinces himself that the resulting mayhem is not his responsibility  he's just a businessman providing a product. He also really enjoys his job.<br/><br/>There are some aspects of the film that are pure Hollywood invention. Ethan Hawke plays an Interpol agent with unlimited resources who follows Yuri to the Ukraine, New York, Colombia and Africa. In the real world Interpol can't arrest anyone and doesn't have a global SWAT team or own fighter jets in Sierra Leone. Yuri travels to dangerous locations either on his own or with his coke head brother. He doesn't have a bodyguard, which makes him seem more vulnerable, but it's not really believable. The film is good fun if you don't take it too seriously. Writer / Director Andrew Niccol also wrote The Truman Show and Gattaca."

Its look into the worldwide arms trade acquires the authentic feel of a documentary while remaining an exciting ride. Cage has been hit-or-miss in recent roles but is excellent here as brutally cold arms dealer Yuri Orlov. Jared Leto likewise excels as his guilt-ridden and drug-addicted brother, perhaps drawing on his previous experience in Requiem for a Dream. Bridget Moynahan serves as Cage's romantic interest in the film but is not given all that much to do.

","This movie is hard to swallow. And maybe for some people to much to bear. I'm pretty sure that some will misunderstand it.

Which isn't true ...<br/><br/>Yes Nicolas Cage plays wonderful and engaging as (almost) always. But that doesn't mean that people should want to be like him. On the contrary, he is cold to a point were he reaches the point of being emotionless. His brother is killed and he doesn't really care. A human being is shot in front of him and he thinks about how he can sell the gun, now that it has been used (which is btw. so politically incorrect, that I just love this scene!).<br/><br/>In other words: Human life means nothing to/for him! OK he is rich and yeah he has a beautiful wife (although you can see that an end to this is in sight), but does that make him a happy person? I don't think so! And still I had mixed feelings at the ending. Because the movie ""made"" me route for him! On the other hand I wanted him to get caught. But that is what I was talking about.

"andres_canella","7","0","0","12 February 2007"," Niccol Trucks On With Another Good Film
","In an industry that has been brimming with socialistic enthusiasm and leftist political ideology, it takes a relative unknown to release a smart film that proves to be an entertaining watch whilst delivering a provocative message to the viewer. Directed by Andrew Niccol (Gattaca, S1m0ne), Lord of War tells the story of Ukrainian-born Yuri (Nicholas Cage) who eagerly tries to escape the slums of Little Odessa and, in doing so, joins the thriving arms business. The film jumps from America to the crumbling U.S.S.R. to the African state of Liberia. While the obvious direction for a film depicting rich merchants suppyling arms to the third world would be an emotionally-stricken drama filled with grief and fury, Niccol takes a surprisingly fresh turn by delivering a semi-satirical film that paints Cage's character as a different kind of monster: a brilliant entrepeneur.<br/><br/>While the constant narration may grate some viewers, Cage's monotone voice matches his performance on screen. He's like a used car salesmen; cool and persuasive, manipulating the strings from his icy exterior. Proving to be valuable foils to Cage's largely emotionless performance, his unstable brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) and the Liberian ""lord of war"", Andre Baptiste (Eamonn Walker) even out Yuri's virtues and vices. The other performances, however, are secondary to Cage's solid performance. As an actor who never impressed me in the past, his recent films, including Adaptation and even National Treasure have proved him to be a more quirky, if not more versatile, actor.<br/><br/>The film itself is of the slow variety. As in Ted Demme's Blow, the film progresses in a linear fashion, demonstrating Yuri's growing business from year to year. The opening scenes of the film are among its most powerful; we see Nicholas Cage standing amidst a sea of bullet casings, and as a fly on a wall, we are placed on the back of one bullet, tracing its path from his warehouse, being traded and carried across the seas and ending up in a firefight in Africa, until it is shot into the skull of a young boy. Swallowing the relative slow pace of the rest of the film after this heavily stylistic intro is made an easier task due to the satirical nature of each scene, similar to Three Kings. One particular scene has Yuri evading a persistent Ethan Hawke and dumping his weapons cache into the arms of enthusiastic African peoples; the image parallels the UN food deliveries in the third world, and is one of the greatest examples of satire in the film. Despite a tone that mimics the sombre figure of Cage, Niccol manages to include a few moving images that highlight the reality of third world living (following the weapon drop, a brilliant fast-forward scene depicts an entire cargo plane scavenged for parts). There are also enough twists and betrayals to keep any viewer glued to their screens. Lord of War will not go down in history as one of the greatest films of 2005, but any film enthusiast would be amiss to give it a pass. (7/10 Good)"

"Buddy-51","8","0","0","12 January 2007"," incisive black comedy
","""Lord of War"" is a genuine cinematic rarity: a mainstream black comedy that doesn't soften its material or compromise its vision to cater to audience sensibilities. Nicholas Cage plays the world's foremost private small arms dealer, whose key to success lies in the fact that he never chooses sides in any armed conflict, opting instead to be an equal opportunity ""merchant of death"" to all. For Yuri Orlov, peace is the only real enemy, and if innocent people have to die to keep him in clover, well, hell, he didn't make this world, and there's no reason why he shouldn't get his if everybody else is getting theirs.<br/><br/>Like a master chef working his way to the heart of an artichoke, writer/director Andrew Niccol peels back the layers of his story to reveal the truths of the international gunrunning trade. Yuri is a chilling and disturbing character precisely because he is so utterly ordinary and difficult to read. Niccol does not portray him as evil incarnate, but, rather, as a reasonably well-adapted family man who just happens to be good at what he does and has the requisite capacity for self-rationalization that allows him to do his job and still live with himself. To his own way of thinking, Yuri is really no different from the man who sells tobacco or automobiles - both products, he explains, that actually result in the deaths of more people than firearms - then goes home to the love and adoration of his wife and kids. Yuri doesn't sell arms because he had an unhappy childhood or out of any sense of entitlement because he feels the world has treated him badly. He simply knows that if he weren't doing business with these murderous dictators - or as they like to call themselves ""freedom fighters"" - around the world, somebody else would be.<br/><br/>Most of the dark humor of the film comes from the detached, flippant and unemotional commentary Yuri provides as the film's narrator. He is quick to point out the ironies and absurdities inherent in so much of the arms business, and it is only the gruesome seriousness of the consequences that makes us catch our throats as we laugh. And Niccol certainly makes it clear that Yuri is only small potatoes compared to the governments who put far more weaponry into the hands of thugs and mercenaries than Yuri ever does. That little detail, snuck into a title card in the final moments, is the ultimate depressing reality Niccol uses to bring down the curtain on his film. In fact, Niccol bravely refuses to ""redeem"" his character at the end. Yuri loses just about everything and everyone he cares about at the end thanks to his activities, but the world goes on and he's decided he's going to go right on along with it. And why in the world not? Selling arms is ""just what he does."" In a very nuanced and balanced performance, Cage conveys just the right note of dispassionate detachment without ever becoming either too callous or too maudlin. Yuri seems to genuinely like people and obviously loves his parents, his drug addict brother, his wife and his young son. That only makes his ability to compartmentalize his morality that much more frightening. Ethan Hawke gives a strong performance as the Javert-like Interpol agent obsessed with bringing Yuri to international justice, and Bridget Moynihan is stoic and sweet as the beautiful young wife who is willing to turn a blind eye to Yuri's activities for only so long before finally confronting her husband.<br/><br/>Funny as well as chilling, ""Lord of War"" will give you a whole new terrifying perspective on how the world actually works."

","The ""Lord of War"" offers us a powerful depiction of the dark world of the global weapons-smuggling. It follows the story of Yuri Orlov (Cage), a poor Ukrainian immigrant, who one day decides to sell guns for a living. Starting as a small fry, and derided by his ""competitors"" such as the powerful dealer Simeon Weisz (Holm), Orlov soon discovers that he has a talent for this job, and he takes full advantage of it. His brother Vitaly who had started along with him soon realizes that he cannot follow his brother's fast and steady ascendancy, and Yuri goes all way towards the top alone; even his beautiful and beloved wife Ava (Moynahan) is not aware of her husband's business activities. Yuri Orlov seems unassailable, and only Agent Jack Valentine (Hawke) looks determined to stop him...<br/><br/>Apart from the top-notch performances and the exciting plot, the film offers us something far beyond that: It serves as a resourceful documentary regarding the weapons trade, giving us insight on the machinations, back-room deals, and style of the people involved in this ugly business.<br/><br/>What is interesting, is that Orlov is not portrayed as an evil man: He is simply portrayed as someone completely amoral and detached from the evil activity he is engaged in. This approach to be very realistic and persuasive to the viewer, as it avoids the clichés that a typical ""bad guy"" would produce.<br/><br/>Director A.

","This film can be taken as a quite enjoyable cocktail of irreverence and cynicism, vilifying human nonsensical inclination to auto-destruction. What can on the other hand be irritating if not disappointing, is that it sometimes awkwardly (and dangerously) oscillates on the edge of becoming moralistic, and that I mean in the nauseous way of typical Hollywoodian productions.<br/><br/>It tells the relentless ascension of a remorseless and gifted arms dealer (Nicolas Cage). Which goes from the early 80's, in cold war, to the first years of the 21st century, through the collapse of the Soviet Union and the changes that it implied in the global geopolitical deal. Only, this parcel of history is here seen from the point of view of the weapon-selling business, and the end of USSR merely means its abandon in headless and lawless ex-satellite countries of the gigantic stock of weapons accumulated for a war that had never been to happen, and the shifting of the main market for weapons from the borders between American and Soviet zones of influence, to the unstable countries of Africa. Thus the opportunity offered by the former in regard to the latter greatly helps the main character in making a fortune. But in his way towards this questionable professional success, he loses his wife and son, brings his young brother (Jared Leto) to his death, is disowned by its parents, and almost put in jail by a interpol cop who has chased him for years (Ethan Hawke)... without changing his intention of selling death as long as men will be ready to pay so generously the means to kill other men.<br/><br/>Hence an interesting screenplay. My attention was all the more attracted when I saw that it was written and directed by Andrew Niccol, who also made the excellent Gattaca. I quite enjoyed the first hour or so, during which I mainly appreciated the depicting of the total absence of moral restraints in the greediness of the main character, his cynicism as well as that displayed in the telling of his story. And conversely I was equally infuriated when the whole took a despicable moralistic tone, by showing the same character confronted to his conscience, facing the ""horrible"" consequences of his activity, like a little Liberian girl with a severed arm asking him, ""the white man"", if her hand will grow back. In at least as bad taste the attempts to explain the conflicts in African countries (if such a generalisation is possible) by simplistic considerations, or the absurd character of a weapons dealer who ""takes sides"". It almost reminded me the asinine ""Blood Diamond"", at that point, and I was desperately hoping that it does not end in the same kind of braindead cloying absurdities, apparently so much appreciated by US audience. Happily it didn't, and the last 10 minutes were quite in tune with the beginning. Andrew Niccol even chose to finish with the same somewhat apocalyptic scene that had started the film, which was very inspired.<br/><br/>Besides the direction is globally good. I much liked the scenes accompanying the credits, at the beginning, showing the lifecycle of a bullet. The zones of conflicts and stocks of weapons, throughout the film, are extremely realistic, with sets more real than the real thing (according to the trivia, they are actually the real thing, sometimes) and lights very finely worked. There are nonetheless a number of defects and criticisable choices: some little elaborated twists in the plot (for example when Cage escapes a fighter in a cargo plane), a tendency to too easily and unnecessarily introduce sex scenes, the use of the same actors without any make-up throughout a chronology that covers 20 years, the chronologically little plausible fact that Yuri marries a woman who was already a glamour icon when he was ten, etc.<br/><br/>Concerning the actors, Nicolas Cage is good in the leading role. Jared Leto as well, although his part is quite limited. Even thinner are those of Bridget Moynahan (Cage's wife), or Ian Holm. The role of the idealistic police officer was well suited to Ethan Hawke, with its angel face, and he personified it with conviction. But I was mainly touched by the Charles-Taylor-like character of André Baptiste, which enthused me, with his mix of bloody cruelty and calm cynicism. The performance of Eamonn Walker is really dazzling, and in addition served by great lines. The one about the ""kangaroos"" made me hilarious. He is in fact the perfect complement to Cage's character: if Yuri can sell weapons without the smallest concern about their use, provided that he gets richer, Baptiste can use them without the smallest concern about the cost, provided that it serves his thirst for power. The rest is none of their business."

For example, the first time Jared Leto appears on screen, it is clear who will be plagued by pangs of conscience and get shot in a deal gone awry. Same thing with wife (gorgeous) and child of Nicholas Cage. The visual and narrative style are somewhat ironical, seemingly cynical at times. I guess in the end morally thinking people will never be able to really understand how there can be people like the anti-hero of the film, and possibly that is the reason why this movie ultimately fails to draw you in on a personal level.

","Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) is a Ukrainian immigrant bored of his insignificant life in the Brooklyn neighbourhood of Little Odessa, a small community dominated by guns, sleaze and mafia rivalry. When Yuri witnesses his first violent act he finds his calling; as long as there are people wanting to kill each other there will always be a market for guns. The story follows Yuri's rise from petty gun dealer to international arms baron, as he discovers he has quite the gift for the business. Money, girls, trophy wife, warlords at his beck and call  Yuri has them all. Ethics and morals  Yuri does not. As the danger escalates Yuri must confront his lawlessness. Does he still have the conscience to redeem himself? Niccol's imaginative visual style is evident from the start. A panning shot across a carpet of spent bullet casings focuses on the back of its main character. Yuri turns and narrates a beautifully crafted introduction, leaving you in no doubt as to the sort of man he is: ""There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation. That's one firearm for every twelve people on the planet. The only question is: How do we arm the other 11?"" A spectacular introductory credits sequence charts the journey of a single bullet from manufacture to shipment to its final short, sharp, sickening flight into a child's head.<br/><br/>The anti-gun, anti-war message makes this film one of the most important in the market today. Few directors have Niccol's ability to present a provocative and controversial subject matter without succumbing to political slander and anecdotal references.<br/><br/>The casting of Nicholas Cage as Yuri is perfection, producing a confident and mature performance combined with a unique air of coolness that is Cage at his best, creating a character capable of attracting sympathy and revulsion in equal measure. There is never a moment that glorifies or glamorises his violent and unforgiving lifestyle; instead the film portrays an atmosphere of distaste and horror and you always see Yuri for the cold, heartless person that he truly his. Is it possible a normal human being could empathise with Yuri Orlov? This really is Cage's film but, as with any mesmerising performance, there usually lies a host of decent supporting actors to bring it home. Of these, most notable is Leto, who shines as Yuri's misguided younger brother bringing a much needed lighter atmosphere. The locations are magnificent and the direction is solid. If there is a flaw its that the first half, as Yuri picks up the skills of his trade and moves to the big time, is far more enjoyable than the second half, even if the ending is unexpectedly compelling.<br/><br/>Lord of War is a rare film. It is a film that is well told, acted and directed that leaves its audience pondering its gut-wrenching central theme: there will always be people making money from other people's misfortunes. The difference between this film and the majority that reach the screen these days is its directness. Lord of War delivers its message like a smack in the mouth. Guns and violence are big business. It is not gun-runners like Yuri but the great powers of the world, the US, UK, France and China who are responsible for the worldwide supply of arms. Lord of War stays clear from the front lines of battle; as Yuri puts it, ""it's none of our business"". But by sitting on the sidelines and showing us a different angle on where the blame for war might lie, it invites us to consider the moral ambiguities of arms production."

It follows the challenges he faces on the job (including some rather violent mobsters and jealous rivals), the cost of his lifestyle (usually paid in the lives of his family), and ultimately, the unpredictability of said lifestyle.<br/><br/>The movie maintains a build-up of suspense from the start which culminates in its conclusion, leaving Yuri friendless and very much alone in a hostile world.

A real hang over after seeing and hearing so many clichés on a part of world politics in one hour, not to mention the good guys (wonder where from?) and the bad guys (Europe, the Middle East and Africa). A total waste of the maker's opportunity and of the time of people who watched this movie."

","I think this film warrants much higher than a 2. It was not what the viewer might expect from the previews however. This film seems like a documentary about guns with some story rather than the other way around. Others have complained about violence in the film but then again, this is an R-rated movie, so it was nothing I did not expect. More shocking than the violence may have been the (gratuitous) nudity and drug use. All in all the movie was interesting, but more of a documentary or docu-drama than an action or suspense movie. Furthermore, I think the minimum of 10 lines for a review is unneeded as good writing should be concise."

","The only reason I gave this movie a 2 (rather than a 1 for awful) was because it reminded me of ""Blow"" (the writer/director should have consulted this movie before proceeding to make this disaster). ""Lord of War"" was devoid of plot, human characters - especially Nicolas Cage's character, and generally lacked any real entertainment value. From the beginning, Nicolas Cage's mournful narration keeps the viewer lulled into a sleepy sense of restlessness and anxiousness for the plot to begin. I saw the potential for where the movie could go and where possibly the writer wanted it to go. It alluded to the harmful effects of gun violence worldwide, and seemed to foreshadow Cage's downfall. In the end though, despite his brother's death, his wife and son leaving him, and being disowned by his parents, he was free to continue to reek havoc on the world by mass distribution of artillery to poor desperate people. The writing was bad and reminded me that Hollywood can and does make movies just for the sake of making them - to Hollywood, it seems that any idea is legitimate no matter how meaningless."

But there are some things that should be best left to documentaries.

It does not try to tell a story but rather it tries to make a point. The point was simple and shallow did not even try to imagine the complexities of the modern world. So much more could have been done. I watch movies to be entertained not to be preached at. One of it's worst points is how easy Cage's character went from working in his fathers restaurant to being a big time arms dealer with no more cleverness than to hand someone a envelope of cash.<br/><br/>It has high ratings and a lot of people liked it but I can't imagine why."

"LadyLiberty","7","3","9","18 September 2005"," Lord of War combines political commentary with entertainment and does it well
","Based on that premise that this movie was anti-gun, I really wrestled with my conscience: But I couldn't urge a boycott without knowing more about the movie, so I reluctantly bought my ticket.<br/><br/>Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is the man destined to become the titular Lord of War. But in his early years, he's searching for a mission. Yuri and his family immigrated from Ukraine and settled in Brighton. Yuri isn't satisfied. Neither his is younger brother, Vitaly (Jared Leto).<br/><br/>In his early 20's, Yuri remains uncommitted until the day he witnesses a hit by the Russian mafia and is stricken with the notion that people open restaurants because other people will always need to eat, and that people buy guns because people will always want or need to kill.<br/><br/>As his business grows, Yuri brings Vitaly into the venture. Vitaly soon finds himself addicted to drugs, while Yuri, has another obsession: Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan), a beautiful model he's worshipped for years.<br/><br/>Interpol agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) isn't fooled by Yuri's pretenses. Unfortunately, he can't back up what he knows with the evidence to prove it. Yuri's business grows until the Soviet Union falls and offers him the biggest windfall he's ever had. Yuri is able to entice the bloodthirsty president of Liberia, Andre Baptiste (Eamonn Walker), with a buffet of weaponry.<br/><br/>Yuri's wealth grows by leaps and bounds as does his reputation; but he stands to lose much as his lifestyle grows more dangerous both to himself and to those around him.<br/><br/>Although the main characters and storyline are fiction, director and screenwriter, Andrew Niccol points out that almost all of the events depicted in the film have actual real life precedents, and Yuri is a composite of five arms dealers. The civil wars and violence in Liberia that extend from 1980 to the present are real. So, obviously, is the fall of the Soviet Union and subsequent looting of weapons (some $32 billion on arms from Ukraine alone are estimated to have been stolen from 1982 to 1992). Although there are moments when Niccol's script does get preachy, it's based in truth and conveys that truth in a realistic and impactful way.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage is never less than very, very good; Jared Leto, too, is good. Bridget Moynahan is,well cast as the beautiful and naive Ava, and Eamonn Walker is positively menacing as the capricious Baptiste. Ethan Hawke has little screen time, but is just fine, and Ian Holm once again brings his considerable experience to bear as a genteel and yet ruthless international arms dealer.<br/><br/>Lord of War is violent, to be sure, and virtually all of that violence involves guns. But in fairness, virtually all of the violence in countries such as Afghanistan and Liberia does involve firearms. The commentary offered by the film as a whole is far less anti-gun than it is against the immorality  or worse, the amorality  of those who would sell to all comers even knowing the end result will involve massacres rather than defense, and genocide instead of any noble cause. And the movie is honest enough to place blame on those legitimate political regimes that export weapons of war even as it highlights the culpability of individual arms dealers whose very business is death.<br/><br/>The production values are superb (filmed on location in New York City, South Africa, and the Czech Republic, the backgrounds add considerably to the reality of the film); the direction and editing are good (pay particular attention to the opening sequence of the movie involving the life of a bullet from manufacture to gunshot, all depicted from the point of the bullet). The script is dramatic, but with surprising moments of genuine humor (it has a few moments where the writer is obviously trying much too hard, but thankfully they truly are few). Better still, while entertaining, Lord of War offers some educational value I've not seen available anywhere else. As such, I'm pleasantly surprised to find I'm recommending you see the movie rather than suggesting any boycotts.<br/><br/>POLITICAL NOTES: Given its storyline, the political implications of Lord of War are many.<br/><br/>In the least sense, there are two moments in the film that seem to address some anti-gun sentiment directly. But these two moments  one of them regrettable in its naivité  aren't enough to warrant a boycott.<br/><br/>On a much larger scale, the political machinations behind many of these supposedly independent gun runners is shocking. Remember that the penultimate scene in the movie is based on a true. It's also ironic to note the fact that the world's five biggest arms dealers are nations, not individuals and that (here's the ironic part) those five are the five members of the UN Security Council (as an aside, does that begin to illustrate to you just what a farce the UN really is?).<br/><br/>Those who most violate the humanity of others with their guns would do so if they had to use sticks and stones (or the machetes we see in one particularly horrifying scene). The bottom line is that getting rid of the guns would do nothing to stop the fighting. To pretend that eliminating guns will eliminate the problem is both naive and entirely ignorant of the facts; worse, getting rid of the guns would make any defense against the bad guys impossible.<br/><br/>FAMILY SUITABILITY: Lord of War is rated R for ""strong violence, drug use, language and sexuality."" Some of the violence is graphic, as is the drug use. I wouldn't recommend Lord of War for those under 16. But the mature, Lord of War offers much to talk about. Frankly, talking a little more about political realities like these couldn't hurt anybody, and might actually improve in some small way some of the awful circumstances found around the world."
"wallyworm","7","3","9","17 September 2005"," Was this produced by Michael Moore?
","First off, I liked this film. I like Nicholas Cage, and the story was entertaining, even if it is more a morality play than anything else. The reason I ask if it was a Michael Moore production is this:<br/><br/>**MAJOR SPOILER ALERT** the story takes us up to 2001. Prominently featured is a newspaper headline regarding the Supreme Court decision on the Bush/Gore election. The movie deals with real countries and historical events, not with phony countries as often happens in movies involving Africa. At the end of the movie it states, ""Based on actual events."" Not, ""Based on a true story,"" so it's questionable what exactly they are saying, but it does imply that the story is true. So, toward the end, when Nicholas Cage is in custody, and talking to agent Ethan Hawke, he tells him that he is going to walk free. The reason, he says, is that highly placed people don't want him in jail. Specifically, he says that the president has his fingerprints on his (Cage's) gunrunning actions. The president in 2001, of course, was George W. Bush. So, the movie specifically accuses our current sitting president with being complicit in illegal arms trafficking AND obstruction of justice. And it doesn't even purport to be a ""documentary"" like Moore's piece of cr*p. So it seems Hollywood has given a ""pass"" to anyone wanting to accuse GWB."

","I like Nicholas Cage enough to have suffered through some of his worst films. While this is not the worst one, it is also not the best. The film makers here are trying to tell a true story. They just forget that to tell a true story, you need to tell the truth & make it in a documentary style. This comes close, but does not achieve that level.<br/><br/>Cage plays a gun runner who is one of the biggest ones on the International Arms dealer stage. Trouble is between his narration & interruptions in the story, very few people get too act much. The best acting job scary as it might seem goes to the actor who plays the President (Dictator) of Liberia.<br/><br/>There is a fair amount of realism & story telling here. There are points where Cage narration contains elements of facts. The question is considering the subject matter- where have the film makers been allowed to tell the truth & where did they have to lie. It is hard for me as a viewer to tell because the looking glass we are being taken through is a gray & shadowy world with little public knowledge that a viewer can relate too.<br/><br/>I give them credit for trying."

It seems not be too dramatic for a documentary; it is too plainly told to be a drama; there is too little action to be a testosterone fuelled movie; and there is not enough suspense to be a thriller.

","Lord of War is a genre-mixing political semi-satirical drama. It features many lines of quotable dialogue, a story packed with bloodshed and morality, and sex and drugs. But after the credits role, it's not the quality that will stick in mind, it's the flaws.<br/><br/>First among those, there's not much of a story. The film follows an arms dealer from his first backdoor dealings to international war supplier. The first hour feels like exposition without plot, and so does much of the second. The movie is too undecided whether it wants to be a cat-and-mouse game, a serious drama, a political satire, or a love story / family epic, or even an action film. In the end, there's too little of every theme for any of them to grab the audience.<br/><br/>The hero is a psychopath (in terms of being completely incapable of feeling compassion or emotion, and being a terribly dispassionate, wily character). Which means Nicolas Cage is terribly miscast, as he-of-the-sad-eyes is entirely unconvincing for the role, and spends too much time trying to be sympathetic to the audience, while spouting unsympathetic lines and doing unsympathetic actions. It's almost as if his face is on a different script from his mouth and hands.<br/><br/>In the end, Lord of War is a movie that was too ambitious, and failed to work. The humour needed better delivery (no Nicolas Cage), the preachiness is too obvious, the narration is too corny, the drama is too uninvolving, the suspense is too watered down... It's like Syriana, only less well executed."

Why arms? How did he get his first contact? His first customer? These questions that are just shoved aside. Too bad. After we skip the first steps of the dealer's career, the movie gets into gear with images full of meaning (the gun which fires but makes the sound of a cashing machine). The clash between the two different generations of arms dealers isn't presented at all, just noticed. Maybe it's a bit too much to ask from a movie but ... all this would've done better justice. The ending is probably the best part, even though the part where he faces his conscience (the agent) is quite mild and not very intense. Overall a good and insightful movie which could've been done better. Very good camera work and very good acting (Leto, Hawke and Cage .. even though the latter manages to overdo some scenes)."

The industrialized world manufactures the bulk of weapons, and happily shares it with the world.

If one is expecting to see the self-delusional, self-medicating, feel-good mental mas...tion that one usually get from Hollywood escapism, one should look elsewhere.<br/><br/>Lord of war makes one look the dark recesses of our foreign policies, which most of us chooses ignore. For some of the film critics this might be too much reality. One of the reviewers from the village voice, I think, kept insisting that Ukraine is the same country as Russia. Mind you that a master's degree in eastern European geopolitics is in no way required to enjoy this movie, knowing things like that the soviet union has dissolved over 10-years ago (with it's unavoidable consequences) does help in parsing the fast-paced narratives of this story. I can see how someone can get lost into snoozeland if he gets surprised if you told him that: ""hey Ukraine is a country too, and they use to have nukes!""<br/><br/>This is not to say that this movie had been filmed as a documentary. Not at ALL. It tells a story of a man who deals arms rather than the arms deals themselves. And I think that is an important distinction to draw. Our antihero, Yuri Orlov, is a ordinary man, under extraordinary circumstances. Although his actions are deplorable to say the least. One can easily see how any one of us may justify these actions and turn an apathetic eye towards the moral outrages that are his actions. In fact, the much more subtle message (which Andrew Niccol did not beat you over your head with) is that we are as nation states doing exactly what Yuri Orlov is doing as an individual!<br/><br/>There is also plenty of humor in this movie. If black humor is your cup of tea than you would find yourself chuckling your ironic chuckles through out this movie. It is simply the best in edutainment I've found in movies in years.

","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br/><br/>A film charting the rise and fall of Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) an arms dealer, from his early days in the early 1980s in Little Odessa selling weapons to local mobsters through to his ascension through the decade of excess and indulgence to selling guns on a global scale. The film also charts his relationship through the years with younger brother Vitaly (Jared Leto), his marriage to perfume model Ava (Bridget Moynahan), his pursuit by determined but moralistic federal agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) and his business transactions with a powerful African warlord (Eeamon Walker) and his psychotic son (Sammi Rotibi) that finally make him start to really question the morality of his work.<br/><br/>Cage is the lead star of this film, and as so is ultimately the driving force behind it. And that's great, because it's hard to imagine anyone but him in the lead role. His snazzy, edgy, downbeatenly charismatic persona fuels the film perfectly. It's even better that his character is such an interesting and thought-provoking one. The film paints an earnest examination of him, a man sub-consciously aware through-out of the wrongfulness of what he does, but also always on hand with a quick-fire justification of it. Whether or not these are really genuine or just him trying to cover up for the high-flying, money driven guy he is only the viewer can decide but this is what will make the film so engaging to some. It's also interesting how the film doesn't simply zoom in on him in a current storyline, but charts his rise from nothing up to when he was really somebody then to crashing down again in the years from 1982-2001. The 80s was, of course, the decade of excess, greed and indulgence where everybody wanted to be a success and wanted to have lots of money and material wealth, so in many ways as a character study it's very similar to Al Pacino in Scarface, as both are men who come from nothing but, in that decade, dream of the wealth and success that everyone else seems to have and are prepared to do anything to get it themselves, even by breaking the law.<br/><br/>Cage may be the man running the show, but everyone in the supporting cast is also flawless. Moynahan is fine as the kindly wife receiving the sudden shock to the system of what her husband really does, as is Leto as Cage's weary, coke-addled little brother (maybe even his best role ever!) Walker and Rotibi as the father/son psychotic African tyrants also played their roles well (amazing, since there seems to be so little of a real age gap between them) but really the best out of all of them is Hawke, who has a very well-written/conceived role as the federal agent determined to stick by his morals even when the best option would really seem to be to step over them.<br/><br/>In seven years of directing, this is actually the first film from director Andrew Niccol I've actually seen. Maybe I need a bit of time to get used to his style but this has certainly been one of the best films I've seen all year, a great character examination and a definite, eccentric Cage movie. *****"

Perhaps if the lead character had some passion for his wife, brother, or son the movie would have come across better.<br/><br/>Although there was an underlying message to the movie, I don't feel it was worth watching for this alone.

"Screen_Blitz","7","1","2","30 April 2017"," Although Lord of War propels with a somewhat uneven testament on international arms dealing, it is a compelling piece of work
","""There are 550 million firearms manufactured in a world circulation, that is one firearm for every twelve people on the planet"" says Nicholas Cage's character in the opening scene. This political thriller boasting Andrew Niccol in the director's chair offers a significant, but somewhat convoluted testament on the tragic repurcussions of illegal arms dealing. The central figure in the story of a seemingly ordinary man who finds himself way over his head when he gets involved in a contraband arms dealing industry. As what many may know from reading the newspapers, arms dealing is a dirty business, and this film sheds some fair light on it. Although Niccol appears to show slightly more interest in pushing for a political agenda than telling a stimulating story, the story serves not as an angry condescension against arms dealing but a bold character study of a man wrestling with his inner demons as a result of his amoral business. Set in the 1980s during the final stretch of the Cold War, this film stars Nicolas Cage as Yuri Orlov, an Ukrainian native who makes a shot for the big bucks when he starts an contraband arms dealing business, selling a mass production of firearms to various international warzones around the globe. Bringing his cocaine addicted brother Vitaly (played by Jared Leto) along, Yuri quickly rises up the financial ladder with his selling, but soon must confront his morality when he finds himself in the crossfire of Interpol agent Jack Valentin (played by Ethan Hawke) who's pursuing after him. <br/><br/>This movie tackles the area of the Cold War most films of the genre often neglect, and that is the politics that went outside the United States when many countries in the eastern hemisphere were at war and one of the major conflict dealt with exchange of international firearms. While the arms exchanging duty did lead to a helping hand for international defense, it also opened doors to tragedies that caused the lives of countless lives including children. This film focuses on the lead character's struggle against his morality when we witnesses the violent tragedies of countries at war, while experiencing a bold uproar in the law enforcement. Andrew Niccol does a fairly successful job at portraying the rise and fall of the lead character's dirty business, effectively exhibiting the violent consequences of arms dealing that puts him and his family in danger. But it is not the final half of the film when the story splashes into a somewhat uneven fiasco. There is a fair amount of substance and political commentary sprinkled throughout the two-hour picture, but perhaps it doesn't help that the narrative occasionally teeters towards the brink of uncertainty. The story ends on a rather ambiguous note that has a good capacity to leaving viewers with more questions about Yuri's morally dubious choices than answers.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage, Academy Award winner for his harrowing role in 'Leaving Las Vegas', does a pleasant job of showing his acting muscles in the lead role. His performance is solidly pleasant and shines a strong light on his talent. While his character may not fall in line with the category of a villain, there is no doubt that this role will provoke outrage for his ill morality that eventually leads to tragic consequences. Adding pinches of levity to the film's dark tone is Jared Leto who hops into the role of the lead character's younger brother Vitaly. Leto shines with a dose of humor nearly minute he is on screen, with his flamboyant behavior resulting from his compulsive cocaine addiction. While his comedic portrayal eventually overstays its welcome, Leto proves himself as a competent actor. Bridget Moynahan, suiting the role of Yuri's sexy lover and eventual wife, exhibits a decent performance for her time on screen. Then there is Ethan Hawke who takes on the role of an Interpol agent who rides on Yuri's tale upon discovering his unlawful business. His performance is quite strong and effectively shows his acting chops, nothing more nothing less. <br/><br/>Lord of War is far from standing a cinematic masterpiece, but it is smart, if slightly flawed testament on illegal arms dealing. It is an ambitious picture that is bound spark plenty of interests and discussions long after its conclusion, at least for some who get the invested in its bleak subject matter. It is a dark picture, but it is an intriguing nonetheless. Best of all, it marks the spot of one of Nicolas Cage's best endeavors."
"sharky_55","6","1","2","2 October 2016"," How do we arm the other 11?
","There are grander and more complex ideas in the opening and close of Lord of War than in any of the minutes that are sandwiched by them. They posit that Yuri Orlov is like any other toiler of their trade, merely a tiny cog in a finely oiled machine that will chug on no matter who is delivering the goods or pulling the trigger. It's a sobering and frightening thought, although for Yuri he is less tiny than he might like to think. The role asks for a master of deflection and thin justifications. Cage has a logical answer for any challenge, a tight-lipped smile for any moral quandary, although in the end it is again about money. Would he be a more interesting character if there was more to this motivation? It is structured like certain Scorsese films, with the man perched high on his domain, flaunting his wealth and influence directly to the audience via narration, flashing luxury and excess until we are also somewhat entranced. But Niccol ultimately resists this direction, and the result is a rather muddled moral tale that lacks spine. <br/><br/>He goes in the more serious direction. He could have posed Yuri as a Henry Hill or a Jordan Belfort, have him go out guns blazing into a satire at full tilt. And indeed there are flashes of this potential; the stirring strings of Ride of the Valkyries at a military show, how the giving away of guns is handled like children flocking to a free ice-cream truck, and the way Yuri covets the end of the Russian communist state, not because of any political idealism, but because of how much guns and tanks he can now resell for a fat profit. Could any other actor besides Nicholas Cage pull off kissing Gorbachev like he does? Coincidentally he is a man of many talents, and can also play the opposite, the straight man with a vein of dark humour running through him. He is a showmanship through and through, which means he is in the right business, at least until the mundane trappings of domesticity come for him. <br/><br/>War may be the ultimate business to Yuri, but even guns cannot be his first love. Using the tools and deceptions of his trade he woos his childhood crush, and eventually finds some semblance of settling down. It is here that Niccol tries to craft a conflict; most men wouldn't be flying around the world dealing with firearms if they had Bridget Moynahan to come home to, but of course Yuri isn't most men. Running guns is supposed to consume him, but the problem is that there isn't much to consume in the first place. Ava is, as she herself admits, nothing more than a pretty face, and the extended family is neatly tucked away someplace where only a occasion phone call can reach. <br/><br/>The other quandary is the moral one, which cannot be ignored in such a macabre affair. Though Yuri might attempt to distance himself from the consequences of his trade by way of clumsy metaphor (gun-running is compared to everything from losing your virginity to peddling vacuum cleaners) at the end of the day he must still confront what his guns are doing. Two figures are played off the coldness of Yuri; his brother, a coke-head who nevertheless sees things a little clearer than his older brother (as in, not just in dollar signs), and the rugged Interpol agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke woefully miscast as the righteous, lawful type, and with a terrible name to boot). But the film tales the easy sentimental route, showing us nothing new. We already know that Yuri is fooling no one with his talks of ""I'm not the one pointing the gun"". His one-liners (""At least mine have a safety switch"") might have a brief zeal but in the end we aren't charmed by this equal opportunity merchant of death. Yuri, at the start and by the end, has already convinced himself of no wrongdoing, but can he convince the viewer? Well, he certainly gives it a good shot."

","A standard Sicilian wise guys' narrative packaged in a firearms mafia background and a very superficial attempt at that.<br/><br/>Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) gets fascinated with gun business (rather unconvincingly) when he witnesses a mafia hit in his neighborhood. Convinced that illegal international gun trade is the way to go after a failed attempt to go legal, he partners with his brother Vitaly Orlov (Jared Leto) and embarks on a country hopping mission to arm every warlord he could contact with. Along the journey, he marries his high school sweetheart Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan), gets his brother addicted to cocaine, gets a righteous ATF officer Jack Valentine (Ethen Hawke) on his tail and keeps fighting his consciousness. Being a smooth operator he greases enough palms to stay ahead of the pursuit and competition, what happens when it gets personal is the rest of the story.<br/><br/>While it is an interesting view of how the illegal international gun trade is run, what affects the overall experience is the lack of clarity. The director doesn't seem to make up his mind whether to present it as a biopic, a documentary or as a work of fiction – leaving it inconsistent and underdeveloped. Apart from the presentation, even the core script seems to be confused whether it should be a dark comedy, a satire or an honest serious view of the gun trade. Also there isn't enough research to surprise the viewer with facts that they wouldn't know of already – considering it was attempting the documentary approach for a moment. With its runtime over 2 hours, I remember looking at the clock quite a few times, however the pace picks up in the third act of the movie even though it walks a very familiar path. Nicolas Cage gives a decent performance as the smooth talking bootlegger and the rest of the cast does their best rallying around this weak script. <br/><br/>Lack of clarity in terms of presentation, a very weak and superficial script does not do justice to a very sensitive and timely subject."

But there are several scenes where what was going to happen played out in my head just before it did on the screen. The movie pulls low punches on your conscience and sometimes it backfires. It does when at the end the way this story is told makes you think ""nonsense, it's not really like this"". And there are several parts when it does. I expected more.

","This film is rather hard to classify. Is it a black comedy? A pseudo documentary? A war film? A drama that studies a really cold-blooded character who does what he does ""because he does it best?"" I finally settled on Mockumentary.<br/><br/>Yet Nicholas Cage pulls it off. He is the most cold-blooded SOB one can imagine: the combination to the container filled with weapons to kill thousands is the birth date of his son. In the end, his brother rebels while they deliver arms, after he sees soldiers hack a woman and child to death with machetes. When the soldiers negotiating the arms deal mow Cage's brother down with machine guns, Cage continues negotiating: why get himself killed, too?<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine someone like that can exist, but after all, Cage is just a bigger version of the machete-wielders. And according to the film, just poppycocks compared to the presidents of the US, Russia, France etc, who deal in arms and destruction on a yet greater scale.<br/><br/>Indeed at the end of the film, just like these leaders of entire countries, Cage is ""too big to fail."" He laughs in the face of the justice department agent who captured him with solid evidence in hand, and wants to put Cage behind bars for good. Cage explains to him with a smile what is really going to happen once he leaves the room, and so it does.<br/><br/>At which point we return to Cage as the narrator, full circle with the beginning of the film, except now we get to see what makes the crunching sound under his shoes: millions of bullets, just like the one that we followed from manufacture to the skull of a child in the opening credits.<br/><br/>The film certainly preaches, but in a way so absurd, matter-of-fact and darkly comedic that it does not appear heavy-handed, merely unbelievable. And yet we know all too well that the events we see in the film, the useless maiming and killing of millions, happened. And the arms to do the deed did come from somewhere.<br/><br/>The film sometimes descends into mocking itself, at other times the pieces fall into place too conveniently, so it remains merely very good. But well worth watching, even if you're not into conspiracy theories."

But I don't think I'm missing anything, I think the movie is. It is essentially contrived. The characters are unimaginative, as are the moral conundrums they face. Cage's wife is a stock character, there only to highlight Cage's spiral down into decadence.<br/><br/>Besides feeling decidedly forced, the movie is frequently at odds with itself in tone and style. At first it seems to be a light action-centric biopic with the occasional sombre note. The humour is always teetering on the edge of being funny, but never quite comes to fruition. You couldn't pick the action scenes out from a crowd - they're all as generic and boring as hell. And the ending to the film - well boy I won't 'ruin' it, but Cage breaks down the fourth wall and attempts some sort of lame profundity with a statistic we all knew anyway. The makers of this film obviously thought they'd induce some sort of revelation in the viewers - the pomposity and self-righteousness of this assumption really shows on screen.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - I don't mind the message of the film, but its stunted, inarticulate, out of the blue delivery at the climax of the story really doesn't work. Most of all this film failed in entertaining me - the characters were boring and the narrative predictable. The film is too light to be affecting; too dark to be funny; and far, far too predictable to be engaging. Predictable story, predictable character arcs. The only unpredictable element of the whole experience is the tone, that blundering beast that bumbles all over the place for the whole film, before finally flopping over dead.<br/><br/>Might I add - the cinematography is not all that great.

","Andrew Niccol's film 'Lord of War' is in places amusing, and its heart is in the right place, but fundamentally it's a somewhat pointless satire about the arms trade. Not dissimilarly to 'Thank You For Smoking', it suggests that in a bad world, everybody's compromised but some worse than others; however, it's the worst guys who have more fun. The problem is that this message is both everything and nothing; holding people to account for general badness (but partially forgiving them because of the state of the world) lacks the impact of a specific charge. The use of the song 'Alleluia' on the soundtrack, surely the most over-used music in contemporary film, typifies the blandness of the film's vision. But the corrupt world of gun-running is portrayed here cartoonishly, so we don't really care when people get massacred, and the flimsy treatment can't really bear the belated attempt to add moral weight."
"Vishal_s_kumar","9","1","2","4 October 2009"," I was an equal opportunity merchant of death. I supplied every army but the Salvation Army.
","Remember the cocaine factory scene in Robocop where everyone has the barrel of a gun in their face and Clarence Boddicker (played by Kurtwood Smith) says ""guns guns guns!""? That quote is Lord of War in a nutshell. This is a movie all about guns. It's about illegal sales involving quantities of military-style firearms on the black market, the peaks and valleys of those who deal in them, and the power of guns, including the deadly force they employ and the sense of empowerment they give to those who wield them. It's a story of survival, not from the barrel of a gun, necessarily, but of surviving one of the deadliest games in the world, where your best customers are the most unscrupulous scum bags on the planet with more blood on their hands than many a headline-making dictators while the most ardent of crime fighters hunts you down day and night, and where cunning and, in some cases, the law are the only defenses you have.<br/><br/>Since the end of the Cold War, the Kalashankov has become the Russian people's greatest export. After that comes vodka, caviar, and suicidal novelists. One thing's for sure, no one was lining up to buy their cars.<br/><br/>In one of the better performances of his career, Nicolas Cage portrays Yuri, a man who builds an empire of illegal arms dealings from humble beginnings, selling a couple of punks two Uzis in a cheap hotel room. He and his drug addicted brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) sell to anyone and everyone (except for Osama Bin Laden, not on any moral ground, but because he has a habit of writing checks that bounce), from the post-Soviet Russians to the African dictator Andre Baptiste (a brilliant Eamonn Walker), and even covertly to the U.S. military. Yuri's 20-year journey will see him rise and fall in power and prominence, gain new allies, find himself in competition with fellow arms dealer Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm), marry the girl of his dreams, Ava (Bridget Moynahan), and deal with a determined and incorruptible INTERPOL agent, Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke).<br/><br/>Evil prevails.<br/><br/>The most fascinating segment of the film, and one of the most original I have seen, is to be found at the open of the film. We become witnesses to the birth, life, and death of a single 7.62x39mm bullet (those used in your everyday AK-47 rifles). We witness its production in a factory, its shipment to a war-torn African battleground, its loading into a magazine, and its final destination, the forehead of a child soldier. The bullet's journey, from the factory to the target, looks rather gimmicky on the surface, but the segment's power is undeniable when taken in context of the story that presents itself over the next two hours. Not only does the opening scenes show us what Yuri deals in, how his weapons work, and what they are capable of, but it is a representative of the various themes found in the movie, too. What we see in the opening minutes tells the story of the movie in a condensed, metaphorical sense.<br/><br/>Lord of War is also a smartly written drama that is well-directed (by Andrew Niccol) and performed to a high level of professionalism by all the actors involved. I was most impressed with Eamonn Walker's performance as the African warlord (or ""Lord of War"" as he is known) Andre Baptiste. His character is oddly likable thanks to the bigger-than-life smile he wears, but that is just a veneer for the cruel person he is underneath and the massive bloodshed brought about by his ongoing war efforts. His is a character hard to define. At the end of the day, we'd feel no remorse were he put down by a shot to the head (as he so easily guns down a character late in the film), but the way Walker portrays the character we cannot help but enjoy his presence in the movie and his scenes prove to be the best in the film. Nicolas Cage is, well, Nicolas Cage. He brings the same attitude and vocal inflections we've seen and heard in countless other film's he's starred in, but as always, he manages to meld his personality just so to capture the essence of the character he portrays."

And I'll tell you what the reason is; it is that they deal with the same issue: War; and I put it in capital letters because it is definitely a big one.<br/><br/>Let me recapitulate: ""Hotel Rwanda"" tells the story of a massacre because of a big Civil War; ""Blood Diamond"" goes through the 'conflict diamond' smuggling among the War in Sierra Leone; ""Lord of War"" pretty much explains itself: it's the life of a Warlord. Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is a man who does the only thing he is good at: dealing with guns. If he cares about it of if this makes him a good or a bad man lies in the plot for you to discover.<br/><br/>Though this 'job' has given him enough money to get the woman of his dreams (Bridget Moynahan) and support treatment for his drug-addict brother (Jared Leto), who used to help him but couldn't take it. I forgot about another film, ""The Constant Gardener"". When it comes to dealing with real-life issues, that film was better than ""Children of Men"", but not better than ""Blood Diamond"". However, ""Lord of War"" is above all of them; because it treats the issue right, almost perfectly: and that's its blessing.<br/><br/>Courtesy of dynamic writer Andrew Niccol, the screenplay of the movie has the main character telling us his story in the first person, which is a different and appealing narrative structure. This way, we don't miss anything and the script becomes automatically the driving force of the film; explaining everything in careful detail and providing a documentary feeling in the way it gives information; however never loosing the movie style.<br/><br/>This style is also supervised by Niccol, who wears the director's hat once again, but this time in a way that accompanies the fast pace of his writing. Achieving a better balance than in his last directing effort (""Simone""), Niccol's work is figuratively a gunshot, beginning with a wonderfully constructed first scene which follows a bullet that ends; of course, in a gunshot. But the screenplay is so intelligent and well based that it concludes in a film that escapes some conventionalisms ""Blood Diamond"" sadly had to take.<br/><br/>Everything feels true because it actually is, and that makes it less predictable and more of a pleasure to watch and follow. We get the experience of Nicolas Cage to make it all more worth it. Cage, and actor who apparently doesn't take supporting roles anymore is as well cast in this as he is in ""National Treasure"" or ""The Rock"" and in a romantic journey like ""City of Angels"". Here, he was also a producer of the film.<br/><br/>The cast also includes Eamonn Walker, putting in another great performance, you'll realize; Ethan Hawke is flawless as the good cop who can never get to Cage's character; Jared Leto is more than good as the loyal brother; and it is so nice to see Moynahan again: she is such a convincing actress. And ""Lord of War"" is the most convincing of films like the ones I've talked about yet.<br/><br/>""Every faction in Africa calls themselves by these noble names, like Freedom Fighters; I guess they can't own up to what they usually are"". That's' one of the great phrases in Niccol's script. I suppose that what he means is they are just killers; and that it's a big word, WarStill."
"dooglesdead","8","1","2","8 October 2006"," 'Lord Of War has much more to offer than many other conflict-based Hollywood productions'
","In Lord Of War, Andrew Niccol is superbly artistic in his presentation of the international arms trade. He combines clever personalities and a witty script with a number of deeply gripping and powerfully realistic scenes. In watching the movie I was entertained, educated, shocked, and above all, drawn in. Because of this, I feel that the movie has much more to offer than many other conflict-based Hollywood productions, many of which provide only a non-controversial piece of historical escapism that has little to do with current issues. <br/><br/>One of my favourite aspects of Lord of War is that, although effective simply as a good bit of entertainment, it does demand a certain element of thought to fully understand the point that the director- Niccol- tries to put across about the state of the modern arms trade and the lives of both those who live off its profits, and those who are dedicated to stopping it. On top of this it, he effectively explores the moral dilemmas experienced by Nicolas Cage's character (Yuri Orliv) and his wife and brother.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a movie that provides everything needed to create excellent entertainment, whilst exploring real-to-life moral issues in such a way as to make the audience think more about the world in which we live and why these things are allowed to exist."
"stonecoldmark","8","1","2","6 July 2006"," Really Good Overlooked Film
","I just rented this the other day. I have to say I really enjoyed this movie. The story was thought provoking, interesting and about something that speaks to these times. It seems that all to often films don't want to deal with the real world, because the ""PC POLICE"" will come out after them. This film takes a pretty good look at how one's actions can basically affect the world. ""Lord of War"" had a really strong message. I think the directing was amazing Andrew Niccol did a more than credible job. Too bad this movie didn't fare well at the box office. I think people would be pleasantly surprised. But then again, since it wasn't overloaded with CGI, based on an old TV show or comic book it's no wonder the general public never sought this out."
"mentalcritic","9","1","2","17 June 2006"," Cage's easy charm makes the film work
","Since being cast in one of his uncle's lesser-known works in the early 1980s, Nicolas Cage has appeared in a steady stream of titles ranging from the blockbuster to the way-out-there alternative piece. Much like Tom Cruise or Jack Nicholson, when Cage does appear in a film, you pretty much know from the beginning how he is going to play his character. A combination of smooth, quiet, easy-going charm mixed with intense, furious outbursts gives him nuances that are more in the realm of Nicholson than Cruise's bland, unidimensional self-worship. Which, I am not hesitant about saying, is exactly what the role of a successful arms dealer requires. Were this film being made thirty or forty years ago, Nicholson would be in the lead, and apart from the depictions of some very tragic violence, little else would change. As much as Lord Of War takes advantage of its modernity, it is also a piece as timeless story that will be just as relevant when wars are fought with energy-based projectiles as they are now when we're fighting with lead.<br/><br/>The publicity materials claim the film is based on facts, and aside from one moment where the characters get a little too simplistic in their effort to put one over on the authorities, this really is the kind of stuff you could not make up if you tried. I must confess to being just slightly disappointed at the traditional structure, where our hero (if you want to call him that) begins with an idea, rides it to triumph, has a personal crisis, and then goes into a downfall before recovering somewhat. I would have liked to see the wife embrace the husband's business (it certainly pays well), or the villain remain unrepentant to the end because he has no reason to be otherwise. That, after all, is what generally happens in the lovely land of reality. Rather than emphasising the title character's personal conflict about his business to the point where it gets stale, the film explores the real-world effects.<br/><br/>The support cast is in great shape, too. Bridget Moynahan scores major points for her understated performance as the model Yuri goes to absurd lengths to woo. Her slow conversion from an uninformed believer to a horrified and informed critic is handled amazingly well in her limited screen time. Shake Tukhmanyan and Jean-Pierre Nshanian only get a small handful of scenes as the parents of Yuri, but they get one moment in which to deliver the most poignant yet simple dialogue, and they deliver it brilliantly. Ian Holm also gets a brief but compelling turn as one of Yuri's more scrupulous rivals. After he exits stage left, one is left wishing that he had more time to influence the story. The real surprise here, however, is Jared Leto as Vitaly, Yuri's younger brother. Leto has already proved his salt in left-of-centre films such as Fight Club, or taut thrillers like Panic Room, but here he proves that he is a versatile actor capable of playing nearly anything. You can see in this film how Cage benefits from the presence of an actor who may rival and even exceed his own skill.<br/><br/>One other criticism I have of the film is that it does not seem to quite understand the reality that drives the global arms market. Yes, it is terrible that African nations with no money for food (but plenty for guns and tanks, of course) send fourteen year olds to fight battles. And it is terrible that we have men from foreign lands ready to supply them with the weaponry so long as the price is right. But much like the cocaine market, our police services attack in exactly the wrong manner. Supply results from demand, not the other way around, and if the five largest arms suppliers in the world were to stop exporting tomorrow, the nations so ravaged by the supply would knuckle down and build their weapons locally. That is, after all, how the AK-47 featured so prominently in this film came to be one of the most popular assault rifles on the market. Nobody would supply the Russians for fear that the Russians would turn their product upon them, so the Russians began to build the guns themselves. Necessity being the mother of invention and all, so the attempt to moralise does sour the film just a little.<br/><br/>But, like I said, Cage's everyman charm is more than enough to overcome this small flaw. He has good support from Andrew Niccol's direction (no shaky-cam here) and clever screenplay, as well as a haunting score from Antonio Pinto. The strings and acoustic guitar heard towards the end of the story and through the ending credits will remain in one's memory long after the film itself has finished. It is one of the few pieces of film scoring I would hold up as worthy of comparison to some of the bands in my music collection, in fact. Which makes it all the more amazing that no American studio would back this film, as it is truly a piece of modern art that will come to be called a classic ten to twenty years from now. Sadly, because Hollywood chose to treat it as a leper, it barely made any money, and thus less people in the system will be inclined to take this kind of risk. That is a tragedy right on the level of those shown in the film (well, not quite, but you get my meaning).<br/><br/>Because of the deductions I mentioned above, I gave Lord Of War a nine out of ten. If you are a fan of Nicolas Cage, this is one of his best performances. Jared Leto fans will also find much to celebrate here. Those who prefer their cinema as non-mainstream as possible will also find something to like here. It has been overlooked, but Lord Of War may well be the most daring film of 2005."
"bourenkov","6","1","2","23 May 2006"," Standards of propaganda are falling
","This action movie is very professionally done. The actors are pretty, the acting is quite convincing.<br/><br/>However, this movie is a piece of anti-war propaganda and should be, in my opinion, treated as such. From this point of view, I am compelled to say, it does not achieve a high standard which can be expected from a movie which should force people to believe that the world arms trade and the illegal smuggling of weapons are evil. I have seen Soviet propaganda films ten times more convincing that this one. One scene, only a minute long, in the film Underground by Emir Kusturica shows the ugliness of profiting from selling weapons better than the whole 122 min of the Lord of War. Instead of standing on the shoulders of giants, the producers of this movie put themselves into a trench of a very predictable action flick containing a ""moral story"".<br/><br/>And don't get me started on a political correctness angle :> It seems that the producers tried not to upset anyone except ""certified"" villains. Oh no, they don't want controversy. Ha! A good propaganda movie should be provocative, not a baby milk formula like this movie."
"yoshida82","8","1","2","1 May 2006"," Great movie. Leaves you in shock&awe while rocking and rollin'.
","Lord of War starts off as a biography. Quicker than you can say 'Abraham Lincoln', it pulls you into a world where morals are just in the way of making a huge buck and where that money is to be made because of other nation's wars. Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) plays a decent Ukrainian immigrant who runs guns with his brother. He comes face to face with some of the world's most brutal dictators, and sells kalashnikovs by the thousand knowing they'll be operated by children. The moral issue goes down as easily as Yuri's career into the world of guntrafficing. It hits you like a bucket of cold water unexpectedly thrown over your head, and contains moral questions like in 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' and 'Old Boy'. This time it's not up to the viewer to judge. You just sit back and enjoy the ride, in the end being left with more questions than answers.<br/><br/>This is a great movie for everyone who takes all the wrongs in this world as a given. If you consider yourself to be naive, think twice before you put that shiny disc into your DVD player. Else, sit back and enjoy the bloodbath."
"Robert_duder","7","1","2","14 April 2006"," Remarkable potential left slightly under utilized
","Lord of War is a rather interesting film about an arms dealer named Yuri Orlov. I have never seen a film like this, it's unique and such an interesting concept. There is no ""good guy,"" only a sort of mock-umentary which feels so real about a horrible human being who is an arms dealer from the beginning of his career and creation forward. The story and scenes are disturbing and very moving and yet amidst all this I think Lord Of War could have been downright brilliant, but was not made to it's full potential.<br/><br/>All right it's true for some odd reason I can't bring myself to fully like or appreciate star Nicholas Cage. So, so many of his films I have loved and yet I find him sub-par in the acting genre. I think he's brilliant at choosing the right scripts but I find his acting range very limited. Although he was adequate as the Lord of War himself Orlov, I think someone...I don't know who...could have really done some Oscar worthy performing out of the character. Still Cage is watchable and he does do a pretty good job at showing a complete and utter lack of compassion for the people he sells these weapons to. Bridget Moynahan plays Orlov's soul mate, dream girl and wife Ava Fontaine Orlov. Despite her slightly smaller role she does a great job as being completely naive to her husband's business. Jared Leto is truly the stand out performance in this film as Yuri's strung out, seriously misguided brother Vitaly Orlov. Every scene is different for his character and for him and despite also having a small role he makes the best of every scene and is absolutely the scene stealer. I suppose it might be worth mentioned that Ethan Hawke plays Orlov's adversary Jack Valentine desperately trying to capture and bring down the arms dealer to no avail or success. His role is small and he doesn't really do anything spectacular with the role. In fact he's almost too aggressive and you never really feel the intensity between the two men the way I think you should have.<br/><br/>The problem with the film that stops it from being completely brilliant is not that the cast is bad by any means but that they are just simply adequate. They aren't brilliant and that holds back what this film could have been. It's truly a remarkable bio about an arms dealer, a side of the world we rarely see in film or otherwise. This is a man who started out just wanting to make a mark on the world and literally ends up losing his soul. You see a complete lack of caring in his eyes and although he only kills one man barely by his own will he is moved and terrified by it but turns a blind eye to others doing it. Andrew Niccol does set up a terrific film but it simply falls short of full potential due to the sub standard cast and it just feels like not enough heart, time or effort was put into it...it's unfortunate but still interesting enough to make it worth while. 7/10"
"DonFishies","7","1","2","1 April 2006"," Flawed, but fascinating
","It's not necessarily a bad film, but a flawed one that could have been improved easily.<br/><br/>The entire premise of the film, following a gunrunner through his trade, and the constant narration by Nicolas Cage is absolutely riveting. You can't get enough of his character, Yuri Orlav. He's a very bad guy, but you watch the dissection of his character, from young guy growing up in Brooklyn slums, to a witty SOB selling guns to people who would shoot him in an instant, and it's all excellent. His performance on screen proves that there still is acting talent in Hollywood, and it's no wonder why Cage won an Oscar and is still pulling in crowds (albeit, not as huge as back in the day).<br/><br/>But the problem with the film is not Cage. Or even his co-stars. Even though it's Cage-centric, Jared Leto, Bridget Moynahan, Ian Holm, Eamonn Walker, and even Ethan Hawke all pull in some very good performances, even though some of them are barely in it. Leto is really starting to seem more than a pretty face (maybe an Oscar nom for Chapter 27?).<br/><br/>It's not the visuals either. From the fabulous opening sequence involving the creation, shipment and final resting place of a machine gun bullet, to the fast editing techniques throughout the film, it never lets up. The cinematography is particularly a standout, and the scenes in Africa come later in the film, be prepared for some really beautiful sequences. While The Constant Gardener may have nailed the life in Africa to beyond an art, this film still brings outstanding beauty to the landscape. The way that some of the shots are set up, even when not in Africa, are pure genius.<br/><br/>No, the problem is the story. After the initial narration, and the setup of the film, it just falls apart. Yuri sells gun, Yuri gets in trouble with Valentine, Yuri continues selling guns. For 2 hours, it's the same thing. Even with significant plot points flying around, the cycle continues on and on. While the movie begs to be interesting, it just falls apart at the seams, and can't get back up on performances alone. Even though you can't stop watching, you know deep down that the movie has fallen into boredom territory. It's a real shame too.<br/><br/>While the life of a gunrunner is an interesting concept, it could have been pulled off much smoother in its translation from script to screen. A polish of the script could have helped this film greatly, and made this underrated film even more appreciated, and seen during its initial run.<br/><br/>7.5/10."
"das417","9","1","2","17 February 2006"," The morality of gun running
","What happens when an 'everyday' American decides to leave his boring existence for something more interesting, exciting, and profitable? Well, he becomes a gun runner of course! This is the story of Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) who, if we are to believe him, is just a man doing his job like anyone else. Supplying guns to the world's dictators, tyrants, and rebel armies without the blink of an eye as if he were selling cars instead of weapons. An everyday job that he assures us that someone else would be doing if he weren't doing it. A point that he stresses throughout the movie and one that becomes the main moral point of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Through their operations in Europe, the Middle East, Afganistan and other such places, Yuri and his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) find fortune and even infamy. However, while Vitaly drugs himself out due to what is most likely a guilty conscience over the fact that he has aided in the deaths of countless people, Yuri finds himself drawn more into the world that smuggling and profit. It becomes him and soon he has nothing but the 'business' that he runs.<br/><br/>This changes when he has the chance to finally seduce the woman of his dreams, Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan). Having the money, the power, and the connections that he has, he has is able to convince her that he has the fortune that supposedly someone her of caliber deserves. Earning her love and marriage even though she later admits that she would 'rather not know' about what it is he really does to make his money. In a sense, she does what Vitaly does without the drugs. Ava would rather ignore the truth that the comfortable life she now knows is built on lies, deception, and possibly worse. <br/><br/>Things begin to go wrong when Yuri becomes involved with Andre Baptiste Sr. (Eamonn Walker) of Sierre Leone. Also, the determination of young Interpool Agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) brings in extra pressure which finally leads to the explanation of what Yuri really does to his then 'ignorant' wife Ava. The death of Vitaly at the hands of men loyal to Baptiste, and the loss of Ava, his son, and even his parents signals the near end of a life Yuri has struggled to maintain for decades. Only a sudden burst of 'support' from a unknown Pentagon official, who Yuri 'knows' through past dealings, is able to free Yuri from a life in prison for countless crimes ranging from smuggling to murder. Allowing him to continue his business of supplying weapons to those desire them in spite all that has happened to him. <br/><br/>And here is where the moral of the story comes in. Even after everything he has witnessed, experienced, and lost, Yuri believes with all his heart that he has done nothing wrong. He is a businessman and nothing more. No thoughts of blood on his hands, or of those whom he has helped murder. And this is the point of Lord Of War. That is, there are those who really have no concept of wrong and right. <br/><br/>Even when they have lost everything. <br/><br/>9 out of 10"

","Lord of War is a fun, often hilarious, and uncompromising look at the life of a gun runner named Yuri Urlsov. He narrates his tale from his late teens to late forties. He starts out a amateur gunrunner who just sells to the punks and the mob in his area of Brooklyn. It takes him several years but before long he is selling bigger guns to bigger people, and by the late eighties he is on a first name basis with all the major warlords(Or Lords of War) in the world. He doesn't take sides and will not just sell weapons to two people who are killing each other but will sell them to people planning to attack his own country. He has Interpol agent who knows he is doing something wrong but can't prove it so follows him attempting to catch him red-handed. His name is Jack Valentine and is played wonderfully by Ethan Hawke. Speaking of performances Nicolas Cage is wonderful. He manages to make you believe he is all the age's he goes through in the film without a pile of make up to make him really look it. Jared Lito on the other hand is horrible and it is impossible for you to believe he is one of the age's much less all of them. The direction is very good as is the screenplay and visual effects. A very good film that is both hilarious and disturbing."

","This is a movie about Nicholas Cage being a weapon merchant. He is doing business with the most atrocious dictators and tyrants in the world and he has no regrets, because he is actually good at it. As a technical guy, I can relate to that. Ethan Hawke makes a remarkably small role in this movie as the idealistic Interpol agent.<br/><br/>What is nice about Lord of War is that it shows that a man can do wrong things without actually meaning harm as well as doing harm without doing the wrong things. What is not nice is that is shows a birds eye view of something that is anything but comfy and something to feel good about. It's similar to that scene in Syriana where the rookie Intelligence officer is destroying a car with a missile by using a joystick in the CIA headquarters. Is that the world view of Americans, I wonder?<br/><br/>In rest, it is a well done movie, worth seeing, and maybe even able to start some discussions about the nature of morality."

Nicholas Cage does yet another bang up job as Yuri and is very convincing as an international gun runner. The plot is thick and the directing is nicely done. It never hides from its agenda and never runs from its message. It stays on point and doesn't lose focus on our warlord Yuri. The ending sequences are powerful and there are more guns in this movie than Rambo ever dreamed. The only pet peeve I have about this one is the lack of explanation of how he conquered to much. How he could fly through international air in some scenes with ATF hot on his tail and a few other small things. Then again I suppose they weren't trying to make a 3 hour movie.

"gradyharp","8","1","2","21 January 2006"," Business as Usual: A Peek at the Weapons Trafficking World
","Director/writer Andrew Niccol makes films with layers of meaning, the kind that find us laughing at inappropriate moments because contemporary life is like that: what on the surface seems like an entertaining story has very dark roots. His previous strange films include 'The Terminal', 'The Truman Show', 'S1m0ne 'and 'Gattaca' and now LORD OF WAR takes its place in that arena of black comedy. Niccol really releases his last spear when at the end of the film there is a statement 'Based on Actual Facts' and at that point the film takes on an altogether new significance.<br/><br/>Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) and his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) immigrate to the US to Little Odessa with their parents (Shake Tukhmanyan and Jean-Pierre Nshanian) who have posed as Jews to escape the Ukraine in 1980 - before Glasnost. Yuri is bright and sees gunrunning as a lucrative business and after his first tiny success in the gang infested Little Odessa, he convinces his dreamy-eyed brother to be his partner. The business grows exponentially as Yuri discovers his best customers are countries at war: in time he is wealthy, has married his dream sweetheart Ava (Bridget Moynahan) and settles in as one of the more successful gunrunners in the world. He buys weapons from stockpiled American ordnances after the US has 'finished' a war and sells them to Eastern European, African and South American revolutionaries. He is tracked/stalked by Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) who in his role as a government agent is determined to stop Yuri's dispersal of deadly weapons that result in needless deaths when disseminated to countries in the throes of political change.<br/><br/>Though Yuri is first for business, he does care deeply about his wife and child, and about Vitaly whose entry into the world of wealth is soon squandered on a cocaine addiction requiring frequent detox. Yuri is not a mean spirited man: he sees his business as just that, salesmanship of items for which there is a huge demand and he does not see himself as the perpetrator of violence. His life has moments of compassion, many moments of financial success, moments of pride in being the gifted gun-runner he has become, and moments of introspection. He hobnobs with dictators, revolutionaries, fellow gunrunners and the law. The resolution of the story is not an end but merely a tapering off.<br/><br/>The film is narrated by Yuri and for the first part sounds almost comedic - until the visual depiction of the killings are on screen. Niccol appears to be showing us a factual business that is legal in the eyes of the government ('Washington encourages gunrunners to take care of aspects of world control they can't be seen as condoning') and it is his gift to drive his message home about how human lives are wasted for the sake of business and weapons proliferation. The film is painful to absorb on this level.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage gives a powerful performance as the opportunistic Yuri and the criminally under-used Jared Leto once again proves his fine-honed acting skills as the drugged addled innocent Vitaly. Likewise Bridget Moynahan is excellent as the wife who elects not to question her source of wealth. Key cameos are keenly provided by Ian Holms and Eaamonn Walker. The film is rapid-fire paced, the cinematography is excellent, and the impact of the film is powerful. It is unusual for a director to take on topics this controversial and end up with a film this entertaining. Recommended. Grady Harp"

","Edgy, moving, and strangely inspiring, Lord of War is probably in my opinion, one of the best movies I've watched this year. Nicholas Cage's dreary persona compliments Yuri's discreet character very well. And though it's hard to imagine Jared Leto (who's come a long way since My So-Called Life) as Nicholas Cages' brother, both actors do an extraordinary job in their portrayal.<br/><br/>The story lines spins out from Yuri's sudden discovery in the fact that he'd been blind to see what could make him a powerful cash crop was right in front of his face. Living in a neighborhood in which the obituaries should be fives pages long, Yuri set out with his capricious flighty brother to sell illegal firearms to foreign countries. At this point, it's hard to tell whether he's oblivious or just plain uncaring to the fact he's assisting in the murder of thousands of people this way.<br/><br/>Enter the alluring Ava Fontaine, or Yuri's 'dream girl' as he had previously named her in his days of admiring from afar. But after stocking up on enough cash and guts to double-deal his way into her affection, those days are clearly over. Bridget Moynahan's chemistry with Cage could be/should be better, but she does an exceptional job in playing out the anguished trophy wife Eventually, Yuri find himself pulled deeper into his baneful role as the supplier of lethal weaponry, or as third world country tyrant Andre Sr. dubs him, ""Lord of War."" And it's not long before he realizes that he's dug himself into a hole deeper than he could climb out of.<br/><br/>On a slightly different note, if you're easily disheartened or distressed by volatile images or situations, this movie is not for you."

","I saw Lord of War yesterday and I was overwhelmed. It's clearly for adults only but with that in mind I can't think of one moment I would change. I would say this is easily one of the most completely satisfying films I've seen in many a year. I'm in awe of its beauty and I left the theater completely inspired. In my mind everyone connected to this film has just risen a couple of notches up in my book. This movie has a point of view, and it is strongly anti-violence, but it is also able to give a realistic sense of the gun-trade that must have taken years to acquire. I would think this is mostly inside information that no one would have wanted known generally.<br/><br/>Still glowing from my viewing I went to today's Chicago Sun-Times Weekend insert to see what Ebert had written about it. I was completely surprised to find that there's not one word about it! What could possibly be the reason for this obvious spurn? Well, I always thought Ebert was Jewish and there is one scene, quite a short scene, which is not very complementary to the Israeli Defense Forces that may have offended him though to anyone who has followed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, by almost any non-mainstream media, it's not only justified, it's long overdue. Could that be why he's ignoring it? Or could it be that he takes offense to its portrayal of Africans? I've read Ebert's reviews in the Friday Chicago Sun-Times Weekend insert for years now. You have to amend his stars awarded by these rules: If it's predominantly got Blacks as actors he automatically will give the movie at least an extra star. On the other hand, if it's likely to be a blockbuster regardless of what he and the other critics have to say, he will frequently give the movie at least one less star than it really deserves. The man has a knack for descriptive phrases but his rebuff of this magnificent film will not be forgotten by this movie lover for a very long time.<br/><br/>Politically savvy males in particular should run to catch this movie in theaters before it's gone. But those who like to see masterful direction should go to see it as well. It's a rare triumph of a movie and if I were making movies this is one I'd love to have been involved with."
"teamgs3se","Null","2","7","17 September 2005"," It's pretty good but fails to be great
","Watching the trailer for the new Nicolas Cage movie ""Lord of War"", I was interested in seeing what I thought would be a Crime/Drama movie in a vein similar to ""Blow"", it ends up trying to have political/moral seriousness and it comes up short.<br/><br/>The movie opens with Cage's political/moral monologue amongst thousands of bullets, a scene that it caught me off guard. We are shown an CG montage of a bullet's life (Something CG fanatics will appreciate) and then quickly thrown into his story starting in the early eighties.<br/><br/>I think most people know the basic story of the movie. Cage (Orlov) turns to arms dealing with his brother, Leto (Vitaly), because he is not satisfied with his current life's direction. As Cage moves up in the business, he is pursued by Interpol agent Valentine (Hawke), he faces a fierce competitor Simeon Wiesz (Holm) and he becomes friends with a ruthless African dictator (Eamonn Walker). All this is being done secretly (for a bit) behind the back of his wife and family.<br/><br/>The movie can be taken as anti-gun. It has a bit of sex and violence. Cage makes an alright performance, he straddles a sappy middle-aged man with some sarcastic wit (typical Cage role). I might add that he and Bridget Moynahan (Ava Fontaine his wife) establish minimal chemistry. Jared Leto chimes in with a good performance, along with Eamonn Walker as the African dictator. Ethan Hawke's character appears only a few time till the end, he turns in a decent portrayal.<br/><br/>Alright, let's get to the bad bits...<br/><br/>My main problem was that it felt like it was building up to a point but it just never came. Is this supposed to be a serious political/moral movie? It begins and ends with a statement, but seems to forget what it's trying to say throughout (minus a few ""speeches"" by Hawke, I'm sure he enjoyed doing those). Is this just supposed to be about the corruption in the real world? How are we ""supposed"" to feel about Orlov? Cage barely lets a whimper when his family and wife disown him. Orlov's mindset is, ""I'm good at what I do."" and he sure sticks to it. He doesn't seem to care too much that his wife, son and family (predictably) leave him.<br/><br/>After his brother Vitaly is killed, he ends up working for the same people anyway. Leto's death, along with his Ukrainian Uncle's car bomb death, was predictable. By the end you think he will be in jail by Valentine (who I disliked the character for some reason) but he's not, he gets away with it! He even ends up working for the same clients anyway. Hell, if things are like that I thought, ""Why don't I become a cold emotionless arms dealer, I'll make millions and the US government will let me off the hook!"". BOTTOM LINE: CAGE'S CHARACTER IS ALMOST NEVER CHALLENGED WITH ANY MORAL DILEMMA TO CONFRONT! That's how the movie fails. <br/><br/>I expect it to do mildly well, or poorly. I saw the opening Friday night show, about one-fourth the the Theater was filled. Everyone left in silence, and you could tell it wasn't a ""What a deep and powerful movie."" silence, just an ""Ehh..."". It was entertaining and it could have been great but it fails in execution."
"tlcndc","5","2","8","26 September 2005"," Another Hollywood Picture Trying To Make a Political Statement
","Look, actors just need to act and quit trying to pathetically make a political statement. The trailers made this movie to a fun spoof of gun running as Cage did with car-jacking in ""Gone in 60 Seconds"". When we walked out at the end all we could say was ""depressing"".<br/><br/>I'm having a hard time knocking it as I like Cage and on one hand the acting, photography and direction were done well, and the movie had it moments. But then it turned into a political statement. Watch the credits for the actor of one shadowed character which you never really did quite see but was typically of the ""big bad US military"" ala Oliver North type with sharp close ups of headgear or ribbons, etc. In the credits this character was played by at least 3 different actors. One I caught as the credits quickly scrolled up was Donald Sutherland not otherwise credited anywhere else. All of which trying to get their say in against bad old US of A, but they'll gladly take their paycheck and lifestyle here huh?! In my line of work I've seen enough ""reality"" without needing to be preached to. At least in ""Hotel Ruwanda"" you knew what you were going to see, not switched and baited as in ""Lord of War"".<br/><br/>Wait for the DVD, then let someone else rent it for you."

Why? Well, I'll get to that.<br/><br/>This movie is superb. Niccol does a masterful job in telling a story about politics, war, and the darker side of the human spirit. Is this a movie with specific political intentions? I'm not sure. But it is definitely a movie with a lot of sarcasm towards ""good"" governments.<br/><br/>When I left this film, I had a horrible taste in my mouth. Do I blame the film? No. It took me a sleepless night to discover the reason. This film may not be a documentary but it is still very real. I am disgusted with the politics of war. I am humbled at the thought that it could be me committing any number of horrid deeds. It probably would have been me, if I was unlucky enough to be born on the wrong side of the globe. Am I a soft, sentimental type? Well, I'm much more sentimental than I expected.<br/><br/>And now, when it's all said and done, I just want to watch a different movie - one with a happy ending and an uplifting story.

"thinker1691","3","2","9","2 February 2006"," The Purpose of Guns
","Wars have always been an integral part of humanity's suicidal efforts to destroy itself. In The film, Lord of War, Nicolas Cage, plays Yuri Orlov, who's weapons, allow the process of death and mass murder to become an art form. The film is unapologetic and quite brutal as are the actors who portray the various waring dictators, soldiers and merchants of death participating in the gun-trade. Following his transformation from drug dealer to arms dealer, Yuri displays a genius for circumventing international law and becomes an expert at delivering death to any infant nation struggling for survival around the world. Chased by a persistent Federal agent from the U.S., as well as inter-pol agents, the film is set to the background of various conflicts around the globe. The film is a social statement which reminds us, there are many nations who'd rather prostitute their country's resources and the lives of their people, than establish a future for them. Cage is perfect as the soulless arms dealer who learns there is a personal price in becoming a pimp. **"
"aok-4","5","2","9","19 September 2005"," I felt used at the end.
","I was attracted to the movie by the prospect of Cage, one of my favorite actors, playing a cool and interesting character (he did a great job). I was pleased early on, while coming to my own conclusions about the vileness of the character's business dealings, but very disappointed at the end by the heavy-handed political digs that seemed to have been crammed in at the last minute. I think I was the victim of a bait-and-switch: lured by movie violence and then preached to that the US is the world's largest arms dealer. For people of like mind, who prefer their movies and their politics separate, leave 5 minutes early and don't sweat the details."

","This movie features Cage in a ""Morgan Freeman POV"" You know, like in Shawshank Redemption where he narrates the movie while being in it himself. Great tool. <br/><br/>As Cage says early in the movie; This isn't about twisting the truth to something that makes him the good guy. This is a movie that illustrates what might be something not so far from the actual truth of arms dealing. <br/><br/>There isn't really a plot, but more like a story about a mans life, and how he ends up in the business of arms dealing. I really recommend it. 9/10"

"evileyereviews","8","1","3","24 November 2010"," The Dark Mirror of Humanity
","The biting humor of Lord of War almost leaves one sickened to have made light of such a dark subject. Almost. Instead of taking sides this flick teeters on the fence of judgment, leaving the viewer locked and loaded to make his moral decision sans any Hollywood influence. The opening credits, in a tragically spectacular fashion, allude to this, placing guilt in the appropriate lap such that the movie can get back to the business at hand and manifest a flick free of the PC crowd's wishful thinking. Nicolas Cage is perfect for this role, the middleman of evil whose mantra of inevitability forms the Teflon skin that sheds any and all icky guilt that might cling to his vocation of choice. Deep down though, his character simply has found his role in life, something fate seems to have gifted or maybe cursed him with, and is fate to be denied? The story slightly veers from highlighting the typical storyboard anatomy, concentrating more on human nature and purpose of being. In doing so, it sets up an uncritical canvas upon which the viewer must come to terms with the reality of the human creature without the filter of rose tinted glasses. Not a film for everyone, it is a flick for those not afraid of the mirror of humanity. Merci beaucoup.<br/><br/>Genruk of Evil Eye Reviews"

","This is a good movie. It is a very well told and described story, and contains and delivers a message. I did like it. I was just about to puke when the wife of Nicolas Cage abandoned him on moral grounds, but later, when Nicolas Cage is released and the movie departs for a while from its politically correct point of view, i was delighted.<br/><br/>It is not brilliant, but it is actually quite good. Cage is great, as usual, the plot is well thought, the Liberian Dictator André Baptiste(Taylor was the real name of the dictator) is very well depicted, and it is amazing to see the effect of the fall of the Soviet Empire.<br/><br/>Yes, it is a very pleasant movie."
"SerpentMage","9","1","3","16 May 2009"," A Movie That Surprised Me...
","This movie is impressive because it shows what is, and not what can be. If you look at the description you can probably understand it is yet another movie trying to show the ills of the worlds and how you should change things.<br/><br/>While it tries to do that it succeeds on a completely different plane. It succeeds by not looking at the macro picture, but the micro picture of a single gunrunner. It shows his world and how he likes his world.<br/><br/>When ""Hollywood"" gets these types of films it tries to show the evils and then has some ending that says, ""see this is how things should be."" But this movie does not do this. This movie says this is how it is. The fact that the gunrunner was so emotionless made it very hard to digest the film.<br/><br/>If you think that he kills in cold blood like most movies make people to be then you are sadly mistaken. This is not classical ""Mob"" and honor type movie. No, this about cold, emotionless, calculations and strategy. This is what makes this movie so scary and how come this movie just saps the energy out of you.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film and if you are in the mood for something serious and dramatic then this movie is for you."
"johnnyboyz","5","1","3","12 July 2008"," Deceptive and depressing film that seduces its audience into a world of humour and inappropriate glorification.
","How sad to stumble across a film like Lord of War, a film that thinks itself to be a powerful and political statement on the world as we perhaps don't know it, whilst at the same time trying to incorporate conventional action film ideas but ends up as a morally inept, casual look at the life of arms dealing through a character that we are led to believe really exists. There is no justice in Lord of War; there is no feeling, just an air of arrogance as the film flies through scenes; voiceovers and scenarios of great danger with so much ease, we are perhaps tempted to laugh at it all. But whilst films that are morally bankrupt and centre around an anti-hero of sorts can be good fun, they should never be produced with the idea in mind that the anti-hero's actions are right or 'just'.<br/><br/>Alas, Lord of War makes that mistake. I wonder how many kids, or indeed stupid people in general, came out of the cinemas or watching this film thinking ""Wow, doesn't being an arms-dealing look cool!?"" We don't come away from films like Scarface, Blow and Layer Cake thinking being a gangster or a drug dealer looks like great fun with cash, women and a lifestyle because of what happens to those films' anti-heroes but Lord of War seems to want us to think that being a gun runner with similar lifestyle traits is a very good career move. If we look at Layer Cake, the opening voiceovers provided by Craig's character inform us of his situation and the fact he has the audacity to assume himself to be a 'business man' rather than a drug-dealer; we are not immediately on his side because of this terrible assumption. But later he is given a drug-unrelated mission by a boss and this propels him into a world in which he must prove himself to himself as well as us. The film becomes a passage of the protagonist showing us he can cut it when heart and soul is required to win through and adversity (traitorous employees, etc.) needs to be beaten. By the end, we feel he has proved himself and maybe we have forgiven him for getting 'business man' muddled up with 'drug dealer'.<br/><br/>In Lord of War, protagonist Yuri Orlov (Cage) does not have heart or soul. He is like one of those hormone fuelled young male adults at a grotty nightclub; ever sensing and ever looking out for the next lay. In Lord of War, Yuri wants the next batch of guns so he can sell and re-distribute to places run by people he couldn't care less about. Much like a drug-dealer would not care if his customer overdoses on the stuff he supplies. But this is the film's problem, it assumes we will care for Yuri despite who he sells to. Unlike Layer Cake, Yuri is never given a chance to redeem himself like Craig's character is; he is constantly buying and selling to the nastiest people imaginable without care.<br/><br/>The majority of the trouble with the film is its seductive mannerism and its tempting way it goes about its subject matter. In Nicholas Cage, we have an actor who very rarely plays a really nasty character. This seductive piece of casting of a name and a face we have an opinion of before even going into the film immediately draws us to 'side' with him. Secondly, the film has been constructed in a very clever way that brainwashes its audience. The film is full of funny voiceovers and situations we are supposed to laugh at. I wonder how many people actually laughed at the opening quote about 'arming the other x% of them'. Similarly, when Yuri finds himself in an African village with two girls specifically there to sleep with him, despite the high presence of AIDS, I wonder how many others will have laughed at the manner in which Yuri established the situation, the camera cutting to the two women trying to seduce him, the voice-over accompanying the scenario and the editing during which they are dismissed. This four pronged technique creates a light atmosphere in a situation that is dangerous; political and definitely un-funny.<br/><br/>And yet the film continues in its siege on the ridiculous, glamorising the depressing and serious, while making jokes out of serious political issues of recent years. There are numerous shots of the AK47 assault rifle in slow motion, slow motion being powerful and significant tool to use on any subject in any film. Then there are the voiceovers dedicated to the gun and the close up montage of it, further fetishising the product: aren't guns so cool? Just look at them. Lord of War is the sort of film that will show us an execution during a particularly nasty scene but will cut to the next situation and have it accompanied by some upbeat music. The film is not in good taste and the immediate ending which brutally betrays the rule of thumb for anti-heroes in films fuelled by crime is very disappointing; not on a dramatic level but on a moral one. Remember that Scarface quote: 'Don't get high on your own supply'? Lord of War's tagline is 'never get shot with your own merchandise.' This is the only connection between one very good and one very poor film that tackle the glamorisation of a certain element within the crime genre. Given how delicate America's gun situation is at the moment, maybe we should all stop making films that make guns and people who have guns look good."
"Danimal-7","5","1","3","14 August 2007"," Stick to what you do best, Andrew
","Andrew Niccol is the greatest screenwriter of our generation. He thinks deeply, writes intelligently, and is blessed with an incredibly fertile imagination. Above all he has passion and isn't afraid to show it, when most writers today hide their real feelings, if they have any, behind cute, cynical inanities. When his screenplays end up in the hands of good directors, like Weir in The Truman Show or Spielberg in The Terminal, the result is a masterpiece. But, regrettably, Niccol feels driven to be a director himself, a trade for which he has no talent at all. In 2002's Simone, his hand on the helm hobbled his own brilliant script, reducing a potential all-time classic to an ordinary good movie. And now, directing his own script again for Lord of War, Niccol falls flat on his face.<br/><br/>The story: If you've got money, Yuri Orlov can sell you guns. Or tanks, or helicopters, or whatever weapons you need. It's his job, and he's good at it. He sells African dictators the weapons they use to slaughter their own people. He sells arms to terrorists for their mass murder jobs (though not to Osama bin Laden, who is always bouncing checks). For some reason, although he will sell guns to anyone, good people never end up buying his wares. He uses his blood money to buy a beautiful wife, a nice home, and to support his drug-addicted brother Vitaly. The development of the plot is essentially a moral version of the Limbo: how low can Yuri go? <br/><br/>This is not one of Niccol's best scripts. It suffers badly from the worst kind of political naiveté, the kind that imagines itself to be sophisticated, making profound insights like ""somebody makes money off guns,"" while cluelessly confusing Liberia's HIV+ rate with Zimbabwe's, attributing non-existent arrest powers to Interpol, and equating the single misguided Bush v. Gore decision to the rampant every-election cheating of a Third World despotism. <br/><br/>But the script still had potential to be good, as it studies Yuri's growing self-loathing, and his suspicion that his brother Vitaly's worthlessness stems from his shame for Yuri's way of life and his own failure to do anything about it. The best and most tragic scene, where Vitaly finally does take action both to stop and to save his brother Yuri, represents what the movie could have achieved. A better director than Niccol would have focused on these character-driven moments and ditched the naive political nonsense.<br/><br/>But alas, thanks to Niccol's directing, character languishes in the background while sloppy political thinking stands is spotlighted. The essential problem is that nobody in the movie, Yuri least of all, honestly examines gun-running as a profession. Yuri tries once to justify himself by saying that he sells people the tools they need to defend themselves. In Yuri's case, that happens not to be true. His clients, or at least the ones we are shown, use their new-bought weapons to massacre political opponents, wipe out ethnic minorities, and otherwise commit mass murder, not for self-defense. But the movie never addresses the fact that lack of guns, and the arms embargoes that Agent Valentine castigates Yuri for violating, also can facilitate mass murder. For a famous recent example, an international arms embargo against Yugoslavia in the 1990s left Bosnian Muslims and Croats defenseless against Serbian nationalists bent on genocide, and the resulting carnage went on for years before the international community decided to do anything about it. Yuri's sin is his choice of customers, not his choice of merchandise.<br/><br/>This basic error percolates. As the movie points out, private gun suppliers like Yuri are small potatoes on the world stage. The five members of the UN Security Council sell far more weapons than all the world's private dealers combined. What is not addressed is whether these nations behave like Yuri, arming any murderous psychotic with ready cash, or whether they can legitimately say that they are helping people defend themselves. It is again simply taken for granted that all arms dealing is evil.<br/><br/>The movie loses the opportunity to examine the ethics of arms dealing through the underused character of Simeon Weisz. Weisz has some kind of ideological basis for his arms dealing, but it's not clear what it is. Weisz believes that ""Bullets change governments far surer than votes""  an absurd claim, as in fact challenger candidates win far more often than armed rebels do. Eventually Weisz ends up selling guns to the enemies of Baptiste, the African dictator that Yuri is arming (or I think he does, anyway; Baptiste denies it but is probably lying). But there is no clue whether Weisz has chosen to arm Baptiste's enemies because he is morally opposed to Baptiste's brutal rule, or merely because Yuri has beaten him to Baptiste's pocketbook.<br/><br/>However, Niccol's direction has other flaws than self-indulgent and sloppy political moralizing. He has also taken an above-average actor, Nicolas Cage, and wrung a bad performance out of him. Cage is monotonous and shallow, with none of his trademark appealing vulnerability. I blame Niccol not only because Cage is normally better than this, but because the supporting players who get less directorial attention are mostly doing good jobs. Eammon Walker is commendable as the ruthless Andre Baptiste, Sr., and Ethan Hawke projects considerable frustration in the role of Agent Valentine. I feel his pain, for this movie is an intensely frustrating experience, despite occasional flashes of character insight.<br/><br/>Rating: ** out of ****.<br/><br/>Recommendation: TV fare for a VERY slow night."

However, the entire movie, and Cage's performance, is so well done that it doesn't damage the value of the movie very much (10/10 -> 9/10).<br/><br/>His commentary is very dry but not sociopathic or detached as the main character (Yuriy) is supposed to be.

But the real message it wants to send to is not from all of these, it's for the US government, especially the president to stop supplying arms to other countries. Countries like Taiwan. Stop helping them, because when you give them fire arms, you give them the will and power to defend themselves physically. When they have machine guns and grenade launchers, they will surely fight back, and that means more casualties. If you really want to help them, let them settle their problem politically. Just an example, the issue with China and Taiwan, they can work it out the peaceful way, or if US helps Taiwan to become an independent country, China will surely use force to take over. If this happens, there will be blood bath, there will be casualties, and there surely will be innocent children dying, because the US government wants to make money out of it. Taiwan belongs to China, and it will become a stronger country by joining with China, whether the government of Taiwan is willing to let China to take over or not, China will finally take over, it's just a question of when?"
"rsilverst","7","1","3","22 February 2006"," Decent Movie
","(The spoilers are not plot giveaways - but I make comparisons with some other films, and thought that might be construed by some as a spoiler)<br/><br/>I liked this film. Had heard nothing about it. I am intrigued by the assertion that it was based on true events. I would like to know what they mean by ""based on"". The story is compelling. Nicholas Cage is back to playing the attractive version of himself again. Seems like every other movie, he alternates between being handsome and hideous, which in and of itself, is something of a skill. Jared Leto's part I think was not fantastic. Given its similarity to his role in ""Requiem for a Dream"" I don't think he really broke any new ground. He also wasn't particular believable as being Ukrainian. The movie had a similar narration technique to that used in movies like ""Fight Club"" and also had a certain matter-of-fact way of presenting a fairly brutal story, that also gave me a similar vibe. It's overall an entertaining, semi-political, semi-action, semi-thriller. Keeps the energy level going at 75% just about the whole way through. I heard the special features are great, but I didn't have the opportunity to watch them, unfortunately. The only characters that were well developed were Nicholas Cage, and to a much lesser extent, Jared Leto, and the Liberian leader (can't figure out the actor's name from the credit list). In some sense, that's not particularly strong on character development. Really the movie is about the story, and Nicholas Cage's character. But there are other movies in this category that probably managed to develop more than one character. As I write this, I feel like I'm almost talking myself down from the 7/10 rating I gave, but the story was good, so I'll stick with it."

","At the birth of a bullet we start our journey into the world of firearms. Travelling along the assembly line, through inspections, transportation, meeting its other half; the jacket of an gun, to its death where it 'rests in peace', lodged into the head of an African boy; but peace is a word of taboo by the world of guns, for which Yuri Orlov is apart. After witnessing a mob hit, Yuri's mind click to realise that gun trade is one of the most profitable trade on earth, feeding man's lust for guns. Yuri's brother Vitaly takes as the sideman, yet struggles with a heroin addiction. Trophy wife Ava loves the high life, never questioning where the money comes from. Starting from the bottom, Yuri works his way to the top; standing on first name basis with world leaders. Simeon Weisz, once leader of the gun trade, tries to push Yuri out, yet Yuri has more than one person out for him. Constantly on his tail, Jack Valentine wants Yuri out of commission, yet fails from incriminating evidence.<br/><br/>From the opening sequence the message of Lord of War hits you hard, making its statement clear and right in the cross hairs. Mixing satire with the political agenda makes the message even harder, as the story is based on actual events. Lord of War is one of the first films that exposes the underworld of gun trafficking, which is heavily dominated by films of the seedy world of drugs, so Lord of War is a breath of fresh air, yet Lord of War doesn't reach the grandiose mark that a lot of films have done for the drug world. Yuri is not a hypocritical man, for the lack of morals he has, his life is a balance of paradoxes from the friendships he has from all the government leaders. Stating that he does his job because he's just good at it, emotional connections are severed to Yuri, though reflects a cold truth on the people who run the trade. Being unsympathetic for the people who fall under the rain of bullets, it becomes harder to sympathise with him when any tragedy hits him.<br/><br/>Narration is always a hard element to handle, as the narration either works to the films advantage or back-flips and doesn't work. Yuri's narration hinders and distances further from the emotional connection of the characters. Shining moments are the symbolism mixed with the statistics, the sound of cash registers from the expulsion of the bullet shell, placed with what may be any almost to perfectly picked sound track; granted it hits every moment perfectly.<br/><br/>Suited perfectly for Nicholas Cage, he embodies Yuri, evoking that unsympathetic, cool hardness, rattling off gun specs without skipping a beat. Jared Leto turns a disappointing performance as Vitaly, bouncing on an emotionally erratic yo-yo. Ethan Hawke brings nothing special to Valentine, with his brief appearances so wooden. Bridget Moynahan brings one of the better performances, wonderfully showing the unquestioning naivety of Ava.<br/><br/>While its not startling revelatory, Lord of War still surprises on the illegal gun trade, yet doesn't compare to the depth brought to films on drugs. Yet this does open the door for more films like this to make their appearance."

","Well, I've appreciated this movie, but something is hitting back in the 'after-shock', and this is the reason for not so high a vote: first of all I would have preferred it filmed on a black and white film, or a mixture of B&W and Color, so as to appear more dry and 'reportage-like'; I believe that would have solved much of the past-impression I got of some kind of indulgence about 'weapons ads', video games and blood shedding... from the first title sequence onward... The second point, and this comes probably from my being Italian, I was already somehow accustomed to this subject, since I saw this kind of characters and situations in one of Alberto Sordi's movie, 'Finché c'è guerra c'è speranza (1974)'; I should also admit this is not just a carbon copy of that work, and not just because of its updates: possibly you may consider it as an homage to that movie as well, but I feel someone should have pointed it out here!"

","This film is an honest but unsettling account of the gun running trade by mercenary gun runners whose only morality is to money and nothing else. The good thing about this film is that it does not shy away from the morality of the whole issue, with Nick Cage effortlessly playing the lead role in a way that only he can do best. Charming yet ruthless, Cage is a wonder as the amoral lead character. Wonderfully assisted by the rest of the characters in this movie in a storyline that will keep your attention, and thankfully does not place a simple forgiving ending to the movie (as say Spielberg would).

It's for people to be less dumb.<br/><br/>Weapons might be ""helpful"" to defend oneself against dictators for instance. We don't have to decide whether arms are good or evil.

In countries like China today, this kind of movie can't be screened, it's not democracy. In countries like the US, we can see those wonderful movies about how bad is our country.

"The_Void","8","1","3","7 January 2006"," War! What is it good for? Well, business...
","Nicholas Cage utters a line in this film about how we can't fight our own biology, and this idea is shown throughout Lord of War; most notably on the plotting side. The film follows the familiar 'rise and fall' plot for most of the duration that films the likes of Blow and Goodfellas have used before it; and the only real difference between them is that here the story is about gun running. This could have been fatal for the movie - nobody likes seeing things they've seen before in cinema - but Lord of War gets over this fact with the themes that run throughout the movie. The film is definitely very anti-war, but it portrays this mood sarcastically by following the exploits of gunrunner Yuri Orlov. Soldiers wage wars; but Orlov is one of the men that actually make wars happen. He provides the weapons that provide the killing; and doesn't care too much about the morality implications because the business is lucrative for him, and if he doesn't do it; someone else will anyway. War is an atrocity; but for some people it's a good thing. Peace is bad for Orlov's business; and he's prepared to keep his morals in check if it makes his wallet bigger.<br/><br/>Lord of War may irritate some people as there isn't a clear story, and the characters serve more as a way to portray the movie's themes than add any emotional weight to the proceedings. The characters do have their moments, however; and a scene that sees Cage having his hand forced by one of his customers expertly portrays the character's attitude and the reason why 'Evil prevails'. Yuri Orlov doesn't want to get his hands dirty; but he's happy to profit from the people that don't mind dirtying theirs. Despite not being a film about characters, Lord of War definitely belongs to its main star. I'm usually indifferent to Nicholas Cage; but here he does very well, both in convincing us that he's an amoral profiteer, and holding the audience's attention. He enforces himself in every scene, and that is the reason why he will always be the headlining star. The supporting cast don't really get to do much; but Jared Leto stands out as Orlov's brother, and the slimy Ethan Hawke is perfectly cast as the Interpol agent on Yuri's tail. The support cast members that really made a mark for me, however were Eamonn Walker and Sammi Rotibi; who are excellent as the father and son that Yuri makes arms deals with.<br/><br/>Lord of War isn't a film for everyone. It lays its themes on thick, and doesn't give the audience much in terms of an actual plot. For me, this makes it all the better; although I can understand if others don't agree. The familiar plot structure doesn't get in the way too much; and Lord of War manages to break free of predictability with it's conclusion. Recommended viewing."

","This movie depicts the reality of the world arms trade very well, and mostly with excellent accuracy. The main criticism I could level at it is that the script softens the horrific reality of Liberia and Sierra Leone to make it palatable. I suspect that a more accurate depiction of the child soldiers hacking out each others livers and hearts to eat while the fallen from the other side was still alive would have been politically unacceptable in the USA. And so false history is made because of political squeamishness. <br/><br/>But aside from that, it is very well done and really accurate. That probably explains why critics didn't like it much. Most critics haven't got much of a clue about reality since they live in movieland."

","Yuri Orlov(Nicolas Cage) is a Ukrainian boy from the wrong side of the tracks 0r, as he puts it more succinctly, ""the end of the line."" He comes from a family where to survive they've had to lie just to leave the old country, just to find its not too peachy on the other side. He finds a niche in arms dealing, initially small stuff and works his way into the big leagues. <br/><br/>Cage plays him in his usual laconic style, making him a likable anti-hero, even when you know you can't possibly agree with him. It's not that he doesn't necessarily know what's wrong or right, but that he has come to the realisation that if he doesn't do it, it's not going to make the slightest bit of difference. His brother, played by Jared Leto, is along for the ride till he can't stomach it any longer and opts out, a broken wasted man. Ethan Hawke (seen in the Niccol directed GATTACA) is an interpol agent who is determined to bring down Yuri<br/><br/>Along the way we are given a couple of truths about the industry and reminders. Among them the most startling is that the number of gun shops in the US outstrips the number of McDonalds. Scary stats. Even these hustlers with their multimillion dollar deals skating on the edge of the law, wouldn't be missed if they disappeared, in relation to the countries with their multi billion dollar industries. <br/><br/>The writer and director, Andrew Niccol, was responsible for both THE TRUMAN SHOW and GATTACA; both original in concept and beautifully realised. In common, their central character ends up having to fight for his choice, damn the consequences. Yuri is apparently based on an amalgamation of the stories of five different arms dealers. The film found difficulty getting produced, with its off-beat and controversial theme. <br/><br/>With the nomination season coming up, I'd like to see it getting at least a best original screemnplay nod. A real original in a year of some poor copies( HERBIE) and some downright turkeys (DUKES OF HAZZARD)."

","In a society of escalating war, terrorism and youth violence, comes ""Lord Of War"", a film which studies the alarmingly accessible weapons market and its universal impact.<br/><br/>From its opening shots, the film almost feels like a documentary, with our reluctant hero Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage), looking like a weary reporter standing amidst a carpet of bullet shell casings and a backdrop of destruction.<br/><br/>His narration begins as an introduction to the subject at hand before launching into his own life and the profession he has grown to question over the span of his twenty-year experiences.<br/><br/>Yuri is a Ukrainian immigrant who now resides in New York's Little Odessa district. Having grown up in a neighborhood where death was a daily occurrence, he realizes that there's a highly profitable demand for ammunition.<br/><br/>Uninterested in working for his family-owned restaurant, he decides to become an arms dealer, and brings his younger brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) along on the venture, until Vitaly begins a downward spiral into drug addiction and must be left behind at a rehabilitation facility.<br/><br/>Yuri carries on a remarkable salesman pitch, presenting his merchandise as casually as someone who might be promoting household appliances. Soon, he sees his clientèle evolve from civilian buyers to prominent world leaders in battle-torn countries which benefit greatly from Yuri's contributions. He even forms a lucrative, and somewhat risky alliance with a ruthless African dictator (Eamonn Walker).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Yuri sets his sights on supermodel Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan), his longtime boyhood crush whom he manages to charm and eventually marries. For the most part, Ava remains unsuspecting of Yuri's job, but soon begins to wonder about her husband's lengthy business trips, especially when an Interpol agent, Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke), who has been tracking Yuri, comes knocking on her door asking a lot of questions.<br/><br/>At the center of all the exterior conflict, lies Yuri's inner battle between his conscience and the lure of wealth. As much as he tries to justify his role and all the implications, he can't help but feel remorseful, especially when his indirect involvement eventually becomes all too personal.<br/><br/>""Lord Of War"" hits all of its targets by demonstrating its ensemble of strong performances, as well as by being more than just an action movie, but one that carries a political and moral message which never falls under the weight of heavy-handed preachings."
"paulp-12","4","2","10","18 September 2005"," well acted but too politically heavy-handed
","Think grey. Lord of War while a good movie technically--the acting is sound, the story is relatively tight, and it has a good ""texture"" to it for what it's trying to portrayit is not a well-balanced movie and portrays a worldview of hopelessness and will-to-power fatalism. The world is grey, ethically, politically, socially. The only way to navigate a grey world is to wield the most power and don't allow yourself to think about the rest. ""There are three way to sell arms. White-legally, Black-illegally, and, my personal favorite, grey."" says the film's main character.<br/><br/>Lord of War feels almost like a documentary as it traces the life of a very successful arms trafficker Yuri Orlov (Cage). Orlov is a man of almost no feeling, certainly one of no moral sense, and who is extremely talented at selling arms internationally. Orlov travels the globe selling small and large arms literally to anyone who will buy while evading the law, bribing officials, doing drugs, and having sex. By the end of the movie Orlov is legally untouchable though he's not megalomaniacal. He has a good sense of his place and wields his power by filling his role with precision.<br/><br/>Lord of War is cynical both in it's view of the world and it's portrayal of the human response to evil. Actually, in this film, there are no neat distinctions between good and evil. The line that sums up the movie best were in the mouth of Orlov, ""They say that evil prevails when good men do nothing... Actually what they should say is that evil prevails."" Agent Jack Valentine (Hawke) plays an innocuous would-be spoiler to Orlov's cynicism and play far too minor a role in this film in this writer's opinion. Valentine still believes in right and wrong but seems to have no adequate answers to Orlov's frequent a-moralizing. The feeling you get is that there are no answers and that's why /director Andrew Niccol puts none in the mouth of Valentine.<br/><br/>The movie is somewhat drab and methodical partly because Niccol wants us to focus on the message not the special effects or even the technical details. This film, like so many modern films has no hero. Valentine is powerless, the U.N. is corrupt and impotent, there's no world leader that isn't self-absorbed, and even friends and family are motivated by drugs and money. Niccol, who wrote the screenplay for one of my favorite movies, The Truman Show, may now see clearly the outcome of facing a world without Godmoral decision making becomes very difficult if not impossible. Cynicism is the last defense.<br/><br/>Still, for all the film's cynicism, fatalism, and amorality, Niccol clearly doesn't participate in the same worldview as his anti-hero. Niccol clearly wants us to walk out of the movie with a clear moral message: guns are bad and the people that sell them (the US, George Bush, and other members of the U.N. Security Council) are evil. Niccol seems to have no problem making clear moral judgments. Too bad he doesn't allow his characters to do the same."

It takes two: Brilliantly Educational.<br/><br/>I didn't go ""10"" on this because of several cliché' abuses (baby on runway, etc.).

It is a taste of real events served by the composite character ""Yuri"", that achieves a level of voyeurism desperately needed amongst the ""yippee, Ki-Yay"" narcotic candy affect of the action genre.<br/><br/>This film is one of many must-see films (Pink Floyd's The Wall, and American Beauty"" come to mind...) that one should not declare them-self ""breathing"" without understanding the material presented. In a brilliantly woven screenplay seasoned with genius use of CG, we are lead through a part of our world we could not otherwise see through the mud of sheer mindlessness and greed that covers the lens, that shoots the talking heads, that read the scripts, that transform reality, into the sensationalistic news ratings war, that blocks the sun, from shining on what is really happening, as we cower from reforming our social consciousness and believing that something can be done.<br/><br/>Leaving this film left me with a small spark of an idea that maybe turning out in record numbers to vote is the wrong way to have our say. Maybe if there was an election and literally no one came, our countries would finally know that we really don't want to keep going down this same road, completely in the dark, to the BUSINESS of government.<br/><br/>If you want pure entertainment, eat candy.

"Theo Robertson","5","1","4","22 June 2013"," The Fact Much Of It Is Made Up Explains A Lot
","One thing I didn't find clear with Andrew Nicol's 2005 film LORD OF WAR of how does a nobody called Yuri Orlov find himself becoming an international arms dealer ? One minute he's selling a firearm in New York then in the next scene he's in Lebanon selling weapons to different factions of a particularly bloody conflict . Let me get this straight , a conflict that has been waging for several years that has seen thousands die and has many thousands of combatants armed by regional and international powers needs a man who's just come off an aeroplane for its arm supplies ? He must have been carrying very large suitcase . Like wise airport security must be very lax in that part of the world . As the story continues and we get constant voice over Yuri Orlov globetrots all over the planet getting richer as he sells more and more weapons but never gets round to explaining the mechanics of how all this works . There's a very good reason for this <br/><br/>LORD OF WAR opened to great acclaim from organizations that aren't known to comment on films such as Amnesty International and the fact that anyone praises a film starring Nicholas Cage makes you sit up and take notice . The fact is despite being based on real life events and characters Yuri Orlov is a composite character . This explains a lot as to how a son of a New York store owner suddenly and implausibility becomes a major player on arms market and supply around the world but at the same time it means a film portraying an important topic ironically loses its own integrity <br/><br/>Like so many other films that have an important topic as its subject matter LORD OF WAR has received more acclaim than it probably deserves . As a piece of film making it is deeply unsatisfactory , The scenes jump around from location to location or rather one different warzone to another different warzone every few minutes without much explanation . The film is also too reliant on voice over and yet as with the locations there's little filling in the audience as to how Orlov set up the deal or even who he is dealing with . I know the film feels the need to scream "" Oh Orlov is a bad man because he's selling guns to make money "" but more explanation is needed as to the why , how what and where of the scenes - especially the how . Compare this to the narration used in so many Scorsese movies and you'll see how unsatisfactory Nicol's screenplay is <br/><br/>And LORD OF WAR is in humble opinion a very unsatisfactory movie along with being a very simplistic one . Orlov is a bad man because he sells weapons to people and the film gives the impression that if he is caught by Interpol the whole world will suddenly ascend to perpetual peace . In other words the arms trade in general and the illegal arms trade led by men such as the composite character Yuri Orlov is to blame for the world's conflict . This totally misses out the point that most countries experiencing conflicts are caused by failed states , the international drugs trade and refusal of government to legalise drugs , religious intolerance and a lack of democracy and the arms trade is only a symptom of the disease . Don't believe me ? Then name me a war between two secular democracies ?"

","Given the presence of high-quality actors like Cage and the importance of the theme, I would say that this movie falls short of expectations, because of the uninteresting way it chooses to tell you ""truths about life"". Although there is a clear and distinct storyline in ""Lord of War"", I would not say that this is a story-driven movie, since there is hardly anything out-of-the-ordinary in it. What ""Lord of War"" really is - is a ""slogan-driven"" narrative. There is a short film-within-the film in the opening sequence that tells the story of the making and firing of a bullet. It starts at the factory where the bullet is made, then follows the route of the box full of bullets, and finally a black man shoots his Kalashnikov rifle, loaded with this same bullet, which zips through the air and bursts someone's head open. That's the whole message, told with the immaculate perfection of shortness. The moment it was finished I just knew that the rest of the story would just drag on and on, because, really, there is nothing more to it than that: dealing in bullets is dealing in death. Though true, it is totally unoriginal - we all know it and there is no reason to make another film saying the same words. Cage plays well, but there is something profoundly wrong about his character: he has no remorse, no second thoughts, no conscience. Where, then, is the drama? Nothing seems to touch him and, frankly, that's exactly the way how I feel about this film. Secondly, Cage's character is confronted with no real antagonists and therefore - no real challenges - in the movie. The CIA officer is completely lost against Cage and the African warlords all like him, so what is supposed to create suspense here? All in all it's an average achievement with some instances of particularly uninspiring thinking and the characters' words are as slogan-like and lifeless as they can be."

The film-makers sensibly let events unfold without heavy-handed authorial judgement.<br/><br/>Nick Cage's everyman screen-persona is used to good effect Â– he's amiable, genial even, and prone to wry dark commentary on his job, but his 'If I didn't do this job someone else would' attitude, probably mirrors that of much of the US and UK film-going audiences. The consequence of his actions and attitudes are nicely layered, and their representation subtly paced. We, as a collective audience, are encouraged applaud our 'hero's wits as he confounds his interfering Interpol adversary, Ethan Hawke, in the early stages of the movie, which makes us complicit in the consequences of those wiles, seen in graphic detail later on.<br/><br/>The film also has a few interesting things to say about the US Government's arms-trade interests, and their own culpability in many of the world's killing fields.<br/><br/>Not bad at all."
"alex_braveheart","10","1","4","16 January 2006"," An awfully realistic show of life
","This film shows the fascinating cruelness of reality. It is a movie which can really touch each and every one of us. Nicholas Cage delivers an extraordinary performance, highlighting the thoughts, reasons and consequences which lie behind the activity of an arms dealer. Though he seems really wise and clever, a perfect negotiator and predictor, all in all the ideal arm dealer, he hides the bloody consequences of his actions under the naive excuse that he gives people the choice of killing someone. The sad part is that he doesn't really believe it himself, but he needs to in order to continue doing what he does. <br/><br/>Abandoned by wife and son, by parents, by his only brother, killed during a negotiation, Yuri Orlov continues doing what he does best - being the LORD OF WAR -."
"Rob_Taylor","7","1","4","7 January 2006"," Unusual and refreshing change from the normal film dross
","Lord of War is an unusual movie in that it features an anti-hero. Someone who is not perfect, has questionable moral values and is quite happy to get ahead at the expense of his fellow man.<br/><br/>Cage plays Yuri Orlov, an immigrant who, bored of his small-town existence, decides to pursue a career as a gun-runner as a means of getting out of his otherwise dull lifestyle. What's more, he finds he is rather good at it and so begins the tale of his adventures on the shadier shade of life.<br/><br/>Orlvo is an inherently unlikeable man. He trafficks in guns, no doubt causing the deaths (indirectly) of countless thousands of people. He smokes, does drugs, marries a girl primarily because of an infatuation (not love), uses his brother whenever it suits him and is generally full of unpleasant moral leanings. In short, he should be a character we could care less about and, in fact, might hope to be brought to justice.<br/><br/>Yet, in spite of this and thanks in great measure to clever writing and Cage's performance, Orlov grows on you very quickly. You find yourself watching his antics (narrated by Cage himself throughout the movie) with amusement and even, in some ways, admiration.<br/><br/>Of course, if this were a typical Hollywood movie, you might expect that, in the end, Orlov's empire would come crashing down around his ears and he would end up in jail. But this is not a typical movie.<br/><br/>Instead, the final revelation of the film is one that, perhaps, we all know deep down. That, behind every bad man is another man, one step removed from the dirty-hands of the man below him and wielding more power. And behind him yet another, and so on, all the way to the top of the power tree. In short, the movie tells us that power is corrupt and that, no matter how good your intentions, there is always someone more powerful than you who is not so scrupulous.<br/><br/>Of course, Cage's character does lose much in the course of his career - wife, family, brother etc. But in the end, thanks to ""the man above him"" he walks free.<br/><br/>If there is anything wrong with this movie, it is the rather depressing thought that, no matter how good you are and no matter what you do to try and make the world a better place, there are always at least two people doing the opposite and, unlike you, they aren't hampered by questions of ethics and morals. Whilst perhaps portraying the world in a more realistic light than most movies, this is nonetheless a terribly depressing notion that, far from enhancing the film, actually drags it down somewhat.<br/><br/>However, the movie is fresh and interesting for the most part and a welcome change from the usual Hollywood shiny, happy people movies that we are so often plagued with. A few more like this won't go amiss."

","Writer/director Niccol's uniquely-spun morality tale is a worthwhile watch. With Nic Cage, he makes gun-runner Yuri an ethically bankrupt but rather likable chap, which has an unsettling effect on the audience. Should we admire him for his undoubted acumen and pragmatic approach to the distasteful arms trade or vilify him as a human leech who grows fat on the misery of others?<br/><br/>Yuri takes us through his business (to him, it's all just business) in a first-hand account which pegs him as smart, smooth and inventive. His justifications for what he does are questionable at best, but at least he gives them - ""I'd rather people fired my guns and missed, just as long as they're being fired."" But he's sometimes too confident for his own good - and that of others.<br/><br/>In many respects, this is like 'Blow' with guns, only better. It's all very Faustian but Niccol keeps it informative (What's an AK-47? Here's a quick history...) and sharply paced, keeping a dark sense of humour but largely staying true to the ultra-serious subject matter.<br/><br/>The film's weakness lies with the secondary characters (though not the actors playing them; they're fine) - the younger brother (Leto) who goes off the rails; the loving wife (Moynahan) who says she doesn't need to know the truth but reacts predictably when she does; the dogged lawman (Hawke); the evil dictator (Eamonn Walker) and his trigger-happy son... We're familiar with these people so their fates hold no surprises.<br/><br/>But the jarring life-of-a-bullet opening sequence is inspired, and scenes featuring seas of bullet shells, mountains of guns and tanks as far as the eye can see leave the audience in no doubt that this is a very grim business.<br/><br/>One question Lord Of War doesn't answer is this: why do they call them 'assault' rifles? Don't all rifles assault?"
"evo8mr","9","1","4","7 November 2005"," Strong movie featuring VERY strong performances
","Lord of War is written and directed by Andrew Niccol (Gattaca) <br/><br/>After seeing only the trailer once before I saw this movie, I was completely interested in this movie because its a movie that reminded me of The Insider. This movie talks about the business of gun running and I was completely intrigued. Nicolas Cage plays Yuri Orlov, a person who never met a person he wouldn't do business with. Jared Leto plays Vitaly Orlov, Yuri's younger brother and drug addict. Leto and Cage have entertaining, yet outstanding scenes together that truly does define 'character driven', its amazing because you completely believe them as siblings, yet on another level you completely believe that the younger brother is trying to put his older brother's grips on reality and on the final level you do believe that they're just trying to convince one another that what Nicolas Cage is doing is for the benefit of his family.<br/><br/>The reality of this movie starts off as entertaining, yet once you get into it you realize that its very chilling and nonetheless TRUE. You soon realize that Vitaly is very well justified in having his addiction because he just can't handle the fact that LITERALLY right next to them the war is being fought while they are making these deals. Cage isn't bothered with that.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage gives a VERY strong performance since his work in 'Leaving Las Vegas'. This movie covers 20 years of his life and he isn't bothered trying to look young or acting more energetically, he is focused, poised, intense and intensely fascinating at every turn of the movie. Jared Leto gives his best performance here, shadowing his work in movies like Panic Room, Fight Club and Alexander. He steps up his skill for his Co-star, an Academy Award Winner and his director who has made legendary films.<br/><br/>Also featured in this movie is Eamonn Walker as Andre Baptis Sr, in an entertaining yet top defining performance as a psycho killer in a dress suit."
"stuff2delete","8","1","4","26 October 2005"," solid story telling
","The film tells the life story of Yuri Orlov, a Ukrainian immigrant who turns to gun smuggling, a job he's very good at, as it turns out. The story manages to portray him both as a ruthless merchant of death and a sympathetic underdog trying to work his way up in the world. Cage, playing the lead character, pulls this off pretty neatly, never letting the story degrade to a simple morality tale.<br/><br/>Apart from one or two moments of shaky dialogue, both script and acting performances are rock solid. Cinematography is nothing groundbreaking, but wonderfully playful and engaging.<br/><br/>Overall the film engaging, well-paced, craftily told. It's a film for people who like their story telling without the usual black-and-white, good-vs-evil scenario. It manages to bring humor and shwung to subject matter that is pretty gruesome, without ignoring its seriousness. <br/><br/>So that's an 8/10 easily, in my book."

","Having just seen this film I believe to rate it on the whole as a very good film. Again Nicolas cage turns out a very good (and convincing) role as a Ukrainian immigrant to the US who starts to develop a natural role for dealing in arms.<br/><br/>The opening line of the film had me hooked on it straight away:<br/><br/>""There are 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation, thats a firearm for one in every 12 people on the planet, the only problem is... how do we arm the other 11?""<br/><br/>Even if you find yourself not enjoying the film, there are plenty of nifty little statistics and historical facts which will keep you entertained throughout.<br/><br/>The film has a slight echo of goodfellas about it, as the character of Nicolas Cage, 'Yuri', grows up in a run down neighbourhood with his brother and slowly rises to the power of his profession with his brother.<br/><br/>Of course the film does raise the issue of morality with arms dealing, and you can feel the strong moral at the end with Yuri's brother.<br/><br/>I won't ruin the film, but the acting is strong and the story interesting and well written. The only criticism I have of the film is that the constant jumping from one year to the next can make the story feel a little loose at times, but apart from that a good film.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Gun plays essential role in many movies produced nowadays. However, there's still not enough films which depict gun industry and the involvement of governments in gun trade (apart from Bowling For Columbine I haven't seen any). Lord of War is one of those sparse, enlightening movies. Although the idea of the flick was ultra-original and interesting, the film itself disappoints. I cannot deny this film bravery in attitude towards the subject which has been presented thoroughly. Nevertheless, Lord of War is mercilessly wordy as well as pompous and that makes it almost unbearable. Instead of suspenseful thriller, Andrew Niccol shot a lengthy satire with dry first-person narration. His sense of mission is excessively visible here and, as a result, the message is overstated."
"ACGreene","6","1","5","8 February 2006"," Guys will enjoy it more than girls (unless you're a big Ethan Hawke fan)
","I have to be completely honest, this is not a movie I would typically rent. The only reason I did rent it was because of the face of Ethan Hawke peaking out from behind Nicholas Cage on the display at the video store. Don't get me wrong, I really like Nicholas Cage, too, but he probably wouldn't have made me rent this movie without Ethan behind him. Truthfully, Ethan was probably only seen in the movie for a total of about 30 minutes, spread throughout the film. But that's OK. Now, down to business. I've never seen a movie on this subject matter and was surprised at the end of the movie to see a caption stating that it was based on actual events. For those two reasons, it is worth seeing, even if it's only for your own information. Nicholas cage is a 'gun runner' who deals with some of the most dangerous men in the world during times of war (mainly) selling them weapons of all kinds. There are some scenes that are somewhat disturbing, like the opening scene, for example, where you see a bullet go through a child's forehead. There is a pretty good amount of killing throughout the film, some shocking. All in all, it was a pretty good film. Interesting nonetheless. After watching it, I didn't feel as though it had been a waste of time, but I'm not sure I would feel the same if Ethan Hawke wasn't in it. I think generally speaking, it's more of a guys movie."
"cnewf","6","1","5","28 January 2006"," come on, tell an actual story will you?
","OK look, this movie gets an A for its bold moral stand: it is AGAINST gun running that KILLS PEOPLE! Especially poor African people who have been royally screwed by warlords and their tireless posses of sadistic killers. I was waiting for the audience member who would cheer the AK loving crazed son of a dictator using starving refugees for target practice, but to my surprise, nobody did. Score one for finding a topic on which EVERYONE will agree with you - random death in pointless wars fueled by amoral arms dealers is bad.<br/><br/>But would you like to know why a single one of these countless wars starts or continues? Or about the big business of arms trading, i.e. legal companies and not one guy working out of storage container under a bridge? You won't learn anything about these things in this film. What you will learn is the Hollywood lesson that moral feeling is the important thing. And the American political lesson: you are either for it or against it, so why have facts, geopolitics, economics, connect people to motives (besides money, drugs, and hookers), or any of that boring crap that explains how things actually work?? You will also learn the following: Africans are either victims, looters, or mindless killers; African leaders are mindless killers; Africans die because their leaders are mindless killers (oh yes, with First World guns); African dictators's sons like gold chains, gold-plated AKs, gold watches, local Ho's in Dallas cheerleaders outfits, and mindless killing; Africa has lots of local Ho's who like to watch people being mindlessly killed; the top international arms dealers ride in their own planes to deliver the goods to Sierra Leone or wherever; former communist generals will sell billions in lethal arms to whomever for a Rolls and a VCR<br/><br/>and so on. I'm not being too nice about this film, which is on an important topic, has a good cast and many good moments. Plus parts of the film offer a descent into hell that has some real power. But the film accepts that the average audience consists of political children who don't know about the arms trade or that the US government is a world leader in it. Therefore the film illustrates this fact rather than telling a story that would analyze this fact. The filmmakers make the usual mistake of assuming no one will watch a movie that doesn't eliminate all complexity in favor of a story about one or more movie stars acting normal in abnormal situations and talking about it. Oddly enough, this comes off as more didactic rather than less, since the lessons don't flow from the missing complex structure but from the stars' reciprocal speeches. Too bad."
"valadas","6","1","5","2 November 2005"," This theme should deserve better
","If it weren't for the scenes taking place in Liberia which show some kind of truth and realism and for the final scenes my vote for this movie would be much lower. In fact this movie is rather weak as a libel against arms traffic since the scenario is full of cheap ideas with some improbable or unexplained developments (for instance how and where could a modest Ukrainian immigrant suddenly find the necessary capital to create so quickly a large arms dealing business?).The dialogues and the off comments by the main character intend to be cynical but exhibit a large amount of commonplace philosophy about arms dealing after all. Even the sentimental story of the arms dealer and his wife is rather watery since the beginning and the sudden consciousness of the latter about the true business of her husband is quite unconvincing. The players do their work so so except of course Nicolas Cage who does a great job in a movie whose quality is unequal to his talent. The theme of arms trafficking deserved a better movie indeed."

","This movie is earnest, well-meaning, virtuous, right-thinking, long-winded, and confused. It might well have started out as a newspaper op-ed page article. It does have a few funny bits, and the performances are adequate, but the preachy tone drains the movie of whatever vitality it might have had. There is one plot oddity; Nick Cage's arms dealer has a son who never seems to age. He is always a toddler, though the film stretches over many years. Maybe this has some hidden meaning, or maybe it just shows sloppiness. I might have a little more respect for this heavy-handed sermon if it had shown me something about the international arms trade. But no, the Cage character just announces he is in the business and proceeds to get rich and guilt-ridden. The movie tosses around jargon (""end-user certificate"" for example) but demonstrates no knowledge of how the business works. What a bore."

I makes bringing awareness to genocide an easy task, allowing the public to laugh and cringe in the same two hours. this is one of the few films where I left feeling like i had been entertained, not just preached at about how ""topic x"" is bad, as many movies now do.

You see, I am a criminal defense lawyer trying a war crimes trial in Africa that to me was unexpectedly a part of this movie. At the end of the movie, it says it is ""based on fact."" It certainly is. Names of the guilty and the charged are changed, but the essential facts are true. The movie only touches on the Sierra Leonian-Liberian civil wars, so it only touches on the atrocities that occurred there. That is all it could do. This is not ""Hotel Rwanda."" It makes a different point. Nevertheless, the atrocities I've heard testimony about are horrible: amputations of innocent civilians, including children, cannibalism, and wanton homicide, all financed by diamonds plundered from the Sierra Leonian diamond mines. (Cage in a dream, or is it? Child: ""Let's ask the white man. Mister, will my arm grow back?"") Nicholas Cage is not great in his role, but, on further reflection, maybe he is. After all, he plays a conscienceless arms dealer whose own trophy wife in his penthouse apartment in NYC doesn't know what he does for a living. If that was what he was conveying, he did it quite well. Eamonn Walker, brilliant in five seasons of ""Oz"", a British Shakespearian actor, plays Liberian president Andre Baptiste Sr. In real life, Baptiste is Charles Taylor, charged with war crimes for fomenting the Sierra Leonian civil war who may never come to trial unless Nigeria no longer gives him asylum. Ethan Hawke is an Interpol agent hot on Cage's trail, trying to bring him to justice, morally outraged by Cage supplying both sides of any conflict, just for the money. After all, Cage rationalizes, somebody's going to do it, so it might as well be me. This movie shook me. I've been dealing with the Sierra Leonian civil war for 16 months now, but only as a lawyer and only when I am there in trial. When I am home, I accidentally find it on the big screen. I'm so glad I took the two hours to go."

","Hey, it's not because this film says true things about world politics that it's a good movie. Maybe politics is just too complicated to feature in movies without being over-simplified... So, alright Lord of War avoids over-simplification, but it fails to be a movie. For a start, there is absolutely no screen play at all. Facts are just enumerated, backed by pictures of bullets and guns. The story is told, not shown. Then the movie tries to encompass too many themes instead of focusing on one or two leading ones. Finally, it does not look realistic (never seen a love story that is so unconvincing), while actually it is a true story. But the thing is, this movie says something fundamental about world politics, and if you're not familiar with the implications of gun trading, you should see the movie."
"sharilast","8","1","6","20 October 2005"," No tacky blockbuster here. Cage ROCKS!
","You'd think a movie about guns starring Nic Cage, Jared Leto and Ethan Hawke would be just another explosion-laden atrocity of a movie, wouldn't you? It's OK to admit it - I did too.<br/><br/>But it's really not. OK, there are explosions, and a couple of them are quite spectacular and dramatic. But that's OK too. Drama is good.<br/><br/>I think I am going to be so bold as to compare Lord of War to Scarface. I'm not saying Cage is Pacino standard (not yet anyway, I do have quite a soft spot for Cage - he's just so sardonically cool). Anyway, Lord of War is a relatively modestly-paced account of Yuri Orlov's (Cage) career in the gun-running (or arms trafficking) industry. A Ukrainian immigrant to New York, Yuri is bored with his life and finds his calling in 'sales.' He then deals guns to pretty much anyone, disregarding the highly respected illegal arms trading 'code' of choosing sides.<br/><br/>Cage plays Orlov fantastically. He has no self-pity and pretty soon, we have no pity for him. There are a couple of points in the movie where Cage has a choice - he can prove he's a good guy at heart, or lock his soul away forever. Lord of War overtakes more obvious movies by taking the harder road. It makes difficult decisions in choosing how to engage the viewer. Instead of puking its guts out to secure the audience a blind and ultimately useless identification with the protagonist, Lord of War sticks to its guns and tells the story as it should be told: painfully.<br/><br/>Don't worry, I haven't finished yet. Although Lord of War exceeds many many expectations and structures itself as a well-intentioned, political and cynical movie, it does have its Kaboom moments, where subtlety is replaced by nice, white subtitles which ram the point home, where voice-overs feel the need to clarify the blindingly clear and where characters decide to express their emotions too overtly.<br/><br/>Overall though, Lord of War works so well because of it's ambivalence towards Hollywood. It's a film that critiques Western attitudes towards war ethics and war-torn regions but it also capitalises on Hollywood's slickness, its euphemistic ability to justify its actions and sell itself to its most sincere enemy. Orlov is the smooth charmer who can talk the hind-leg off Andre Baptiste, let alone a donkey. He fails himself and his loved ones and can still be redeemed again and again. Is he a nice guy or a smooth talker? Sincere or a great actor? Just like Scarface capitalised on its action, graphic violence and spectacle even though it was really the story of the rise and fall of a flawed man, Lord of War re-invents the gangster genre and uses the very Hollywoodness that Scarface tries to escape from to turn Lord of War into a post-Hollywood epic which doesn't need morals to philosophise about ethics.<br/><br/>In a word: it's a cool film."

","Nick Cage is an arms dealer who tells us about his life and how the world, and his conscious has changed over time.<br/><br/>This is a wonderfully made film. Its witty, well acted and contains some technically brilliant shots and sequences. This is a film thats a kick in the head and forces you to think about what people like Cage's character are doing to the world. Cage gives a wonderful performance as a man who begins doing something no one else is and manages to make enough money he can get everything he ever wanted,However he never expected it to weigh so heavily on his soul. The film does a great job of showing the truly bizarre world that Cage inhabits. Its all food for thought.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the film often undermines itself by being overly preachy with too many passages that are about the statistics of what the weapons are doing to our world. There are too many times where in the name of expediency people talk about what all of the weapons are doing, as if the story itself isn't enough proof.<br/><br/>I liked this movie a great deal, the problem is that I wanted to like it more.

","Greetings again from the darkness. No mystery in why this one is fading into oblivion at the box office. It is a very non-mainstream subject matter that is all but impossible to market to the film-going public. This again proves that a top movie star does not make a hit movie.<br/><br/>Writer/Director Andrew Niccol (""Gattaca"", ""S1mOne"", writer of ""The Terminal"") delivers a very visual film considering it is about gun runners. The sight of Nic Cage running around deserts and slums in a tailored suit and crisp white shirt is funny in a sick way. Cage's character seems to have convinced himself that being really good at something is enough, that something doesn't necessarily have to be a ""good"" thing. His wife, played by the gorgeous Bridget Moynihan (""The Recruit""; ""I, Robot"") understands that no lifestyle is worth failing as a human being.<br/><br/>The story is much better than the film allows. There is a bit too much cuteness and wink-wink nudge-nudge going on. The relationship between Cage and his brother, played by Jared Leto (Fight Club"", ""Panic Room"") is very confusing to them and to the viewer. Ian Holm has a nice turn as Cage's rival arms dealer. Ethan Hawke is actually pretty good as the agent on a mission to shut Cage down.<br/><br/>The film tries to make some political statements, but mostly it is a mish mash of seriousness and smart-ass comments. Usually when a film has this much voice over, it is either a cost cutting measure or the story is too difficult to follow. It appears Niccol just wanted to hang his hat on Cage's track record for delivering and didn't trust his own ability to make a stand-up film.<br/><br/>Overall, a decent performance from Cage (not his best), a solid supporting cast and some amazing shots of parts of the world most of us will never visit, make this one worth seeing. The opening sequence during the credits is pretty cool as it follows the manufacturing of a single bullet up until the point where it fulfills its destiny. This could easily be the Cage character's lifeline as well."

In today's society of protecting ourselves from the rest of the world, this movie blows all that away.<br/><br/>I think that there are 3 films this summer that were great: Batman Begins, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and now Lord of War."
"calditz1","10","1","6","22 September 2005"," Excellent movie with some intense acting in the smaller parts
","Cage is good as usual but some of the best acting has to go to Eamonn and Robitibi who play the Liberian strongman Bapiste and his son respectively. I don't know that I have seen a more menacing and unpredictable duo. Their parts are well written and the scenes look like they were really shot on location. Both men layer on believability that is unnerving.<br/><br/>Leto, who plays Cage's younger brother is very good but has some scenes that seem over-written. He does make the best of even those.<br/><br/>I don't know whether to place this in the extremely dark comedy category or just straight drama. I think Americans are used to violent comedies but most of those are too unbelievable (Beverly Hills Cop) to be close to real life - however, Lord of War, like Fargo, are too tragically true to life (murderous dictators in one and psychotic killers in the other) to not be taken seriously.<br/><br/>I like that Lord of War didn't get too preachy. Yes I know the US and Russia and China really are the world's largest manufacturers of armaments and that is pointed out in Lord of War, but it is done almost (literally and figuratively) as an afterthought."

","From writer (The Truman Show, The Terminal) director (Gattaca, In Time) Andrew Niccol, I may have watched a few minutes of the beginning of this film once or twice and got bored quickly, so I wanted for once to watch the whole lot and make a full opinion. Basically set in the 1980's in Little Odessa, this is the story of the rise and fall of Ukrainian immigrant Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) who is an arms dealer and sells guns and some other weapons with his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto). It is entering the early 1990's his business partnership with an African warlord and dictator Andre Baptiste Senior (Eamonn Walker) and his psychotic son Andre Baptiste Junior (Sammi Rotibi) is formed. We also see the personal life Yuri, a rocky relationship with his drug taking brother, famous model Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan) marrying him, being relentlessly pursued by determined federal agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) and battling with his demons of immorality, i.e. whether he is personally causing more wars and deaths in the world with his business. Also starring Sir Ian Holm as Simeon Weisz, Jasper Lenz as Gregor, Kobus Marx as Boris and Donald Sutherland as Colonel Oliver Southern. Cage gives a relatively alright performance as the provider of things that cause so much devastation and destruction in the world, and the supporting stars do fine as well, but I will be honest, if it was meant to be funny in places as well I did not find myself laughing very much, I did not find much of it thrilling or that interesting either, the stuff about weapon smuggling and selling and whatever is okay, and there were some scenes with gunfire and fighting, but it was not enough to keep me gripped, I just found the film mostly boring and easy to doze off in, a disappointing black comedy action thriller. Adequate!"

The Lord Of War, has good direction, a good script, good performances from everyone involved (especially Nicolas Cage, who plays Yuri), good original music, good cinematography and good film editing. The Lord Of War, is compelling, fascinating, powerful, good character development, a sharp script, engrossing, thought provoking, entertaining and stylish.

"Quinoa1984","8","1","9","24 September 2005"," some brilliant spots among a few flaws in the script, most of 'Lord of War' crackles with interest
","Lord of War is a film that inspires the historical, almost documentation-like, interest (via a constant voice-over) in a similar way like with Demme's Blow, only here used far more frequently, for better &/or for worse. Nicolas Cage, at times, brings more fascination to the film for a viewer with his narration than does his performance, as his character Yuri Olyev, gun traffic man extraordinaire, tells his first-hand story of the past twenty years. Not that his own story isn't gripping at times to watch, and sardonically funny, but there is something about just hearing Cage's voice, as opposed to hearing it alongside his physical performance (not always top notch, here better than most), and writer/director Andrew Niccol collides his panache with usually incisive and ambitious direction with the narrative.<br/><br/>If I could really point out the parts that I thought were keeping Lord of War from being a better movie, even a great one, I would, but it's just certain things sometimes left un-said (maybe for the better of the story, or Yuri's history), or un-tied, or tiny patches of dialog that just don't work for me at times. However, this may be not much of an issue with many moviegoers; Niccol, who's best work to date for me (and I haven't seen Gattaca yet so it's an inconclusive statement) was his script for the Truman Show, which like here takes the right jabs at societies gaping flaws in human nature. Yuri is a terrible man, but he is honest about his dishonesty (again, like Blow), and Cage seems to understand that just as much as Niccol, and while its not his best tortured soul performance (that would go to Bringing Out the Dead), he brings the right amount of humanity that the character needs. There is also a good performance in Jared Leto, and some standard, dependable fare from Ethan Hawke. But performances aside, the juiciest bits in the film (like an un-scheduled landing on a road in Africa, both amusing and horrifying; Cage's trips to Liberia) make it really worthwhile to see in the end, despite a lot thrown in the way of the audience. Perhaps that is one other flaw for me, is that there is so much given to the audience in way of learning about trafficking, as well as Yuri's story, its slightly over-loaded. The parts, in the end, are probably far greater than the whole.<br/><br/>However, in a time when parts in films are not even good let alone great, it makes Lord of War a semi-important film for its time. It's a character study as well as a history, a romance as well as a thriller, and a comedy as well as a dark drama. As Hawke's character says to Yuri, ""you know, I'd tell you to go to hell, but I think you're already there"", sums it up for me."

"filipemanuelneto","7","0","2","28 March 2017"," Sarcastic, mentally provocative, tackles a hard subject with great lightness.
","This film, allegedly based (very lightly) on actual events, tells the story of a Russian-American gun dealer and confronts the immorality of the war and arm business. It would even be depressing if it weren't ironic. Irony is the key to perceive the taunts of a film that takes for granted the inevitability of violence: just like food, death is a human need and man will always feel the urge to kill his fellow man. This provocation is the starting point for a trip to the world of arms trafficking, through the eyes of a trafficker who has surely killed more people than a nuclear bomb and who seems to live in a parallel reality. For him, the death of a child-soldier is sad, but its worse if its with arms purchased from the competition. All this shows us that this is a sarcastic movie, but with little drama and no characters that we can enjoy.<br/><br/>As far as actors are concerned, the film is based on a good performance by Nicholas Cage, perhaps one of his best film performances to date. He is not one of the actors that I particularly like, so I was surprised to have liked his work here. The rest of the cast merely seeks to support him with poorly structured and developed characters. Jared Leto was a casting error."

It gives us a strong impression of what Gun Running is like and it's a impression that leaves us the audience down right uncomfortable.

"estreet-eva","7","0","1","2 September 2015"," Works as an immigrants story and healthy dose of reality
","Of course, Hollywood's stock-in-trade is fantasy so it can be refreshing to see it depict the real world in real world terms. Like ""The Constant Gardener"", ""Lord of War"" lays out the picks-and- shovels guys behind geopolitical civil unrest. Lots of groups would like to start a war but few have connections needed to men like Nicholas Cage's Orlov to bring the idea to fruition. Cage's natural neutral affect, normally a liability, works perfectly here as we see Orlov as the kind of mostly emotionless pragmatist will to engage in the dirty business of acquiring and reselling arms without regard to the cause they will be used for. Ethan Hawke plays his good- looking, drug-addled brother and sidekick and if this were a ""Star Trek"" film he would wear a red shirt. The movie does an excellent job of demonstrating the ruthlessness Orlov needs to rise from cook in his parents' restaurant to the world's foremost arms dealer and husband to a model. It also does well at demonstrating the pressures and dangers he faces in this profession and why he has limited ability to extricate himself when he needs to later in the film. The twist ending may not be for everyone but it is a healthy dose of reality to how things really work. In short, while it appeals to a limited audience and can be something of a ""tough sit"", it is well worth your time."

","Whether it's the meat industry, child slavery or even racism, these are all modern day outrages widely present in society. Yet, people don't regularly stand up to these injustices since life is too comfortable, and that's the internal moral conflict Yuri Orlov fights. Always feeling inferior his entire life, he begins profiteering from trafficking weapons to build a sense of worth. Most people would find this ethically unacceptable since you are providing arms for ruthless dictators and causing the deaths of millions of innocent civilians. Especially because it is just for monetary benefits. <br/><br/>I will honestly say Nicholas Cage is not my favourite actor. I must also add that he performed exceptionally in this film, and that he definitely pulled Lord of War together. It's surprisingly revealing to see how the world revolves around money, and how people will act superficially in the face of controversy. Money equates to power, and this unfortunate truth represents how isolated we are from others. This movie certainly offers a unique perspective with regards to warfare, and offers a viewpoint most contemporary war movies don't. Regularly, war veterans are glorified and combat is shone in a bright light. The reason I enjoyed this movie so much was because it demonstrates how warfare can affect relationships and completely transform your sense of the world. <br/><br/>One of Yuri's primary arguments for his abhorrent work is that if he didn't do it, someone else would, and he would lose money out of it. Similar to other problems across the globe, the main reason why atrocities still occur is because people are passive and unwilling to risk their comfort for the sacred life of others. It is for exposing this side of war that I truly loved Lord of War."

Seeing the deadly gun play among the Russian mob in his crime infested neighborhood in Brighten Beach Brooklyn Yuri decided to get in on the action. Not by joining any Russian/Unkainian gang but in providing them with the guns to kill themselves. It's not long before Uri works his way up from providing local street gangs with guns but entire nations, mostly in Africa and the Middle-East, with not only guns but missiles hand grenades tanks and even attack helicopters to not only wipe out their enemies but their own people.<br/><br/>Yuri for his part stays away from the action or bloodshed and just concentrates on the money, tens of millions of dollars, that he gets for selling his merchandise of death acting as if he's an legitimate businessman making and honest buck to support himself and his family. Always a step ahead of US Government ATF Agent Jack Valentine,Ethan Hawke, Yuri seems untouchable from the law both in the USA and the International or World Court. But he's not immune from those that he deals with, a bunch of lowlifes like himself, to whom the law means nothing to. It's when Yuri who was later trying to go straight by cleaning up his act, and getting out of the arms dealing business, is contacted by a former client of his Monrovia Dictator Andre Baptiste, Eamonn Walker, with an offer that he couldn't refuse that his life turned upside down. Yuri is blackmailed to supply Baptiste with modern arms and ammunition in order to massacre his own people who don't support his bloody regime or he'll give Agent Valentine all the evidence he needs to hang him. It was in fact Baptiste who forced Yuri to personally murder, with a .357 magnum, one of his biggest competitors in the arms selling business Simeon Weisz, Ian Holm, and that alone can have him sent up the river for life. That far more then the thousands of innocent people who were slaughter by ruthless dictators like Baptiste whom he sold his merchandise of death to.<br/><br/>Having his kid brother Vitaly, Jared Leto, a recovering cocaine addict come along with him to Monrovia to iron out a deal with Baptiste things go dangerously wrong for Yuri. Vitaly who incredibly enough had no idea of what Baptiste was all about, a ruthless bloodthirsty maniac, saw his soldiers machete a mother and infant, who tried to escape, to death outside one of his concentration camps! Realizing what he'll do to his people with the modern and state of the art arms that his brother is selling him Vitaly flips out and ends up, with a live hand grenade, destroying half of the arms shipment Yuri brought for him as well as getting himself gunned down by one of Baptiste soldiers! It's then that Yuri realizes that there's now no turning back from the road that he choose in life. And now with him disowned by his friends and family,in finding out what he's in to, Yuri like a puppet on a string goes back to selling arms to anyone or any third world country who's willing to pay for them. With him now knowing, as if he didn't from the start, that for the time being until it gets someone better to replace him with Yuri is totally immune from being arrested and prosecuted by his own government for what he's doing because he has its full backing and support in doing the work, as a middleman, that it doesn't want to be accused of. <br/><br/>Honest and disturbing movie in what's really going on in the world at large in the proxy and civil wars and conflicts that are being supported under the table by the likes of arm dealers like Yuri Orlov with the full support of the five permanent members of the UN Security Console the USA UK France Russia & China who's job it is to promote world peace. But who are in fact the biggest arms dealers, legal & illegal, on the planet! <br/><br/>P.S Check out former Soviet Premiere Nikhail Gorbachnev in a cameo appearance in the film announcing the dissolving of the nation that he's in charge of-The Soviet Union- as a Christmas present to the world on Christmas day 1991."

This is a funny and often informative film about the consequences of guns that are used in conflicts Yuri makes big money from selling his guns as he lies to his wife about what he is up to. Things become difficult when another arms dealer Simeon Weisz, played well by Ian Holm (Bilbo Baggins in Lord of the Rings) goes against him, a terrorist leader in Africa buys his pocket and does not let him retire and the presence of an interpol cop (Ethan Hawke). Orlov isn't really a likable character and he gets his comeuppance at the end with consequences that are severe (which I won't say about) as he sells weapons that go in the hands of children and he cheats on his wife, but somehow through Cage's charm and his predicament, he becomes likable. Lord of War is nothing special but it is an interesting exploration of the culture of arms dealing and is entertaining to watch also with some great laughs.

There were plenty of good scenes, and overall the movie was very amusing.<br/><br/>I respect Cage a lot, but he played some really bad roles in the past few years. Nowadays it seems like he tries to be part of bad movies. This is the exception (National Treasure was good also).<br/><br/>This movie might not be the most accurate motion picture in terms of reality (There aren't Interpol agents that travel in third world countries to seek relative small arms dealers, etc.), but as entertainment, it was great.<br/><br/>I recommend this film because of its good storytelling, good actors and pretty decent plot."

","""When you see 'presented by', 'in association with', or 'in conjunction with' in the opening credits of a film, it usually means the production was financed outside the Hollywood system. Which isn't surprising; no one could accuse this of being a typical Hollywood film. I still don't know who these people are."" So begins Andrew Niccol's quietly wry audio commentary on this 2005 Momentum DVD edition of his ""part drama, part instructional video of how to be a gun runner"", and it's testament to the writer and director of one of the best, certainly most quotable, films of 2005 that he can confidently hold his own for the next two hours without losing the viewer to numerous tea-making sessions.<br/><br/>Among other things, we learn he ""had to avoid using real names of African dictators, as some of them are alive and sensitive about their image."" We also find out that one of models playing the (possibly HIV-positive) beauties Cage is offered by Baptiste is in real-life a good will ambassador for the World Health Organisation.<br/><br/>Elsewhere we discover that ""the only thing worse than shooting on the sea is shooting in the air, and in this film I was foolish enough to do both."" The plane that forces a landing on a teeming African dirt road was genuinely out of control, smashed into a camera, and its propellers nearly decapitated an extra, ""appropriately called 'Lucky'"".<br/><br/>The remainder is variable, with the most attractive proposition being a very watchable Making Of documentary. First AD Matthew Perry describes how he spent many hours discussing how they were going to get hold of so many weapons for the movie; in the event, and appropriately, it was cheaper to get hold of the real things. Yeah, worrying. ""We bought 3,000 Kalashnikovs and sold them back,"" adds director Niccol. ""It was almost like becoming an arms dealer."" And in meeting real dealers, the filmmaker worries about how much he actually warmed to them. Yeah, that's worrying too. We also discover the dangers of working with live South African vultures (they come first in the pecking order), and just how the crew managed to land that jumbo-jet sized plane on that teeming African dirt road: yes, they really did it (and without miniatures or green screens - but that's not an African dirt road).<br/><br/>In the depressing 'Making A Killing: Inside The International Arms Trade', assorted Amnesty reps, international lawyers and ambassadors profile some real-life dealers; discuss 'child soldiers' (""often plied with cocaine and gunpowder to make them high"" or given amulets to make them think they're invincible in battle); warn of the dangers of ""going to war with yourself""; and remind us (if we needed to be reminded) that there are more guns around than the world possibly needs.<br/><br/>Just as effective in its own way is Amnesty International's short satirical film on the main disc, that imagines a couple of smiley Shopping Channel-style presenters flogging AK47 assault rifles alongside the ice-cream makers and dressing gowns. ""Now, if you're sitting at home, thinking 'is an assault rifle difficult to use', then you need not worry: what do you think child soldiers are using in Liberia?"" A very sexy trailer makes explicit connections between sex, power and hardware; the only thing missing is The Beatles' 'Happiness Is A Warm Gun' on the soundtrack. There are 10 short deleted scenes, ranging from the quite unnecessary (anything featuring Jared Leto or Bridget Moynahan) to some expressly designed to showcase more of Cage's pithy one-liners: ""If I'm remembered, that means I'm dead""; ""There's nothing better for an arms dealer than disgruntled soldiers and a warehouse full of weapons."" <br/><br/>Most of the main players (and producer Norman Golightly) drop by for an on-set interview, during which we learn Yuri Orlov was a composite of several real-life arms dealers, and Cage discusses that bloody vulture again (""It was like a velociraptor""). Jared Leto (AKA 'an absolute waste of space') likes films that ""teach me things. It feels like a giant movie... for some reason. It's a really... uh... fascinating movie."" Talking with Jared (and Ethan and Bridget), you begin to appreciate why most footballer players and actors really shouldn't be allowed to deconstruct their own performances. Shut up, act, and get laid more than normal folk - that's what you're paid for. <br/><br/>Fortunately, Cage (more articulate, or at least amusingly laconic, than most) has his own stand-alone interview, during which he's quizzed by a sexy-voiced Eurofemme, while dressed like a Riviera pimp with a 'tache and a cornea-obliterating orange tan."

","I wasn't too sure what to expect from this film, going into it I just knew it was about an arms dealer so could have been an action flick or a pious movie about how evil the trade is. I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't either; yes there was action and there was a message to the film although that wasn't overplayed.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage plays Yuri Orlov, a Ukrainian who has left the Soviet Union and is living in New York. He decides that he can make a decent living selling guns with his brother. The business quickly grows but after an arms shipment is paid for in cocaine his brother becomes addicted and has to be dropped from the business. Yuri has his own addiction; to a model who he manages to seduce and later marry although he never tells her where his money is coming from. Business gets much better for Yuri when the Soviet Union collapses and he uses family connection in the Ukraine to steal a vast arsenal of weaponry which he sells to dubious regimes in West Africa. His best costumer is the president of Liberia played by the excellent Eamonn Walker. While Yuri is climbing up the ladder of leading arms dealers he is pursued by dogged Interpol agent Jack Valentine played by Ethan Hawke.<br/><br/>For a film about the arms trade there are a surprising number of laugh out loud moments, especially in the earlier parts of the film. Later things get more serious and there are some disturbing scenes, although these aren't too gruesome."

Not to say that Nicholas Cage completely ruined a perfect film, of course some parts were predictable and some parts should have been omitted due to the fact that they made it quite dull, the opening sequence was interesting but at the same time far too long and dull.

"Dr_Coulardeau","9","0","1","16 April 2009"," Man is a cannibalistic hyena to man
","An interesting film on arms trafficking, but too pedagogical in many ways. It tries to prove too much and it misses the real point. The real point is not the horror of these tribal or neighborly wars. The point is not the corruption of all the little warlords in Africa and other areas in the world. The point is not the domination of arms trafficking by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. The point is not even the rottenness of the politicians of western countries, of developed and emerging countries. The point is the hyena that lives in the human heart. The idea sure is present in the film, but not shown the way it should be shown. There is no escape from this basic idea that the human being is a predator against his own species, hence a cannibalistic predator, one of the very rare animal species that has this characteristic. Somewhere this film tries to save the human side of that predator. There is no saving of that human side because there is no human side. The human side is nothing but an illusion projected by hypocrites to hide their tracks and footprints. That's what the film should have shown in the most realistic way. Unluckily it did not dare. It tried to save humanity and show it is manipulated by the few predators that would be living in our midst. But these are not a few. As soon as a human being, especially in a group, a band, a gang, or whatever collective structure or party (all meanings of this word intended), has a little piece of power, that human being is going to turn predator. The trade-unionists in a strike will kidnap and keep hostages the engineers or managers of their business. The minority students will block their universities to force classes out and they will speak of a strike and pretend their diplomas and degrees must not be retained from them as a payment for their strike just like a worker loses a day's pay for one day's strike.. Professors or students will sell university diplomas to foreign students (maybe to French ones too) to make their week-ends comfortable. A cop will release the evidence of still not yet tried case to hurt who knows who and the public will not see the denial of the rights of the defense but plain information for the public to know. A bunch of hooligans will kill someone in public and in front of a camera just out of rage, when it is not a five year old boy who kills a five year old girl at school or some individual who starts shooting in a school, on a campus, in an underground station, a supermarket or the street, not to speak of terrorist attacks and suicide bombers. There is no end to that horrible human nature. Sainthood, saint-dom or saint-ness not to speak of sanctity do not exist on earth. Maybe in heaven but after death only. In this film it is more or less asserted that some cops are honest though impotent, that some people hate violence, crime and guns, that some people may prefer poverty in purity rather than wealth in blindfolded innocence. I do not believe it. There is no right side in no conflict. The working class is in no way better than the capitalists. If they get power they turn terroristic, they open and manage some gulag, or whatever procedure to eliminate the other side. There is no guarantee that any one human being could be in any one way innocent. Better get used to that fact.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID"

","Nicolas Cage, without serious doubts as one of the finest actors of this generation, gives a very strong performance as a gun-happy salesman who trots the globe looking to supply anyone and everyone with all kinds of machinery for all reasons. In the film, we are introduced to him from his humble beginnings to his climactic rise as one of the top gun merchants in the world.<br/><br/>The story does take a moral turn in many instances, especially with the character of his coke head younger brother played by Jared Leto, and his beautiful and unsuspecting wife played by Bridget Moynahan. Still, all morals aside, writer and director Andrew Niccol is not afraid to show all sides of this terribly bloody business and it helps the audience to really engage in the story. All points of Cage's character are discussed, including his relationships to family as well as the simple goal of staying alive in hostile territories. From the opening sequence of showing a bullet's complete life span to every scene of Cage scouring the globe for people to buy guns, Lord of War more than satisfies the crowd that wants to be entertained, as well as gives a good bit of food for thought on the very rational reasons to use or not use guns. Certainly worth checking out, if only for Cage's outstanding energetic performance as well as some great direction and action sequences. Definitely one of the best international thrillers of the decade."

","Really, this is a well made and good looking movie but it's also a movie that obviously tries to send out a message, in which it just simply fails. It's a movie that tries to make us sympathetic with the movie its main character. It's obvious that the movie tried to make us understand what drove him and why he did the things he did. It even perhaps tries to make it seem as if it's a noble cause what the main character did but you can just never fully agree with what the main character did in the movie, which also doesn't make you care and sympathize for them, which makes you root for the Ethan Hawke character instead. <br/><br/>The movie tries to tell it's main story in a ""Goodfellas"" type of approach. We know that the main character is bad and that what he does isn't good but yet we sympathize with him. Yes, it's obviously Andrew Niccol picked the ""Goodfellas"" approach with this movie, which gets all the more confirmed by the movie its last scene, in which the Nicolas Cage character speaks directly into the camera, addressing us the viewers.<br/><br/>The movie would had probably been better if it was more of an action-thriller about the Ethan Hawke character trying to hunt and catch Nicolas Cage, or at least in that case the story wouldn't had been such an issue then.<br/><br/>But no, ""Lord of War"" is by no means an horrible movie. It's too well made and good looking for that. Andrew Niccol proofs himself to be a capable director, even for a movie that due to its controversially (though the eventual end result can be called hardly controversial) didn't get much studio and financial support. It's a movie with lots of pace and style, which makes this a good as well as a pleasant one to watch. It's not a movie that is a heavy one or serious one to watch and it luckily picks a more light approach, which is the reason why this movie is mostly so perfectly watchable.<br/><br/>The movie has a good cast, which sort of all makes it more a shame that the movie only focused on the view point on things of the Nicolas Cage character. Besides Cage, the movie features Jared Leto, Ian Holm and Ethan Hawke in it.<br/><br/>It's a good movie, even if it doesn't achieve at what it tries to achieve with its viewers.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","If not necessarily by the start, then by the end, of the opening credits, you should be well aware of what the point of view driving this movie is. Like this piece or not, it doesn't really try to pass itself off as anything but what it is. I've liked all that I've seen of Niccol's(not always equally much), and this was the one I looked the most forward to. It lived up to my expectations. With an ironic tone lasting the duration, this takes you through the world of gun-running, with Yuri being our guide, also filling out the role of obvious metaphor, something not exactly foreign to Andrew(do not worry, this is by no means another S1m0ne... that would turn making fun of it into a ridiculously easy task, what with it featuring the actual, real-life kid of the director and star of said other effort). While there are moments of see-through material, and the occasional poor lines of dialog, this is a solid contender for the best film helmed by the man. It's fun, it's dramatic, it's fairly unpredictable and it does build tension when it seeks to do so. And when all's said and done, like the rest of his movies(again, to varying degrees), this'll provide something important to think about. The plot is great, and develops well throughout the running time. Pacing is rather good, neither boring nor in a hurry at any time. The acting is pretty spot-on for the whole thing. Music isn't bad. This has violence, language and sexuality, and plenty of them, for anyone either avoiding or seeking out such. I recommend this to any fan of Andrew Niccol, Nicolas Cage and/or their respective(heck, throw in the respect-less ones, too) works. 8/10"
"pogostiks","8","0","1","21 May 2008"," Another Lord of the Flies
","This film caught me from the opening credits. Visually stunning and innovative, it is anchored in its cynical but all-too-true black humour... and is one of the best ensemble casts I've seen in a long time. I don't think there is a bad performance in the entire film: quite the contrary, you believe everyone. Yuri (Nicholas Cage) is from the very first a fraud... masquerading first as a Jew and then as a shipping magnate... he is in fact an arms dealer who is particularly good at his work. His brother (played by Jared Leto in one of his best performances ever) is a lost coke-head who, despite everything still manages to have a sense of humanity that has escaped his brother. Saddest of all is the ""good guy"" - Ethan Hawke, who is trying to do some good in this horror story called reality; he is incessantly idealistic - but, as we see in the most cynical (and possibly true) final minutes ever put onto the screen, his idealism is shown to be totally ineffectual when faced with ""raison d'état"" power and greed. Despite moments of almost flippant humour, the underlying feeling that runs through this film is the unrelenting desire for power, which as we all know corrupts. The jovial menace of an African warlord is one of the most chilling performances I've seen on film in decades... mainly because it is so underplayed but reeking with the banality of evil. Played by Eamann Walker - recently of OZ fame - they couldn't have found a better person to play this part.He has a charisma which makes him riveting and all too believable. Perhaps the most telling thing about this film is that it leaves you with a sinking feeling that not only are the events on screen pretty much true, but that there is no way to stop or improve the situation. We are all headed to oblivion with such men loose in the world - and this film makes it all too plain that it is only a matter of time before chaos will reign supreme, and that there will be not much hope left in the world for the future.

","There was a current story in the news that ""Lord of War"" arms trader Viktor Bout arrested in Thailand. This made me interested in seeing the movie that was more or less inspired from 5 such characters of global arms traders like Viktor Bout.<br/><br/>Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is Ukrainian immigrant to US, and finds a niche in dealing with arms supply  first locally and then with big money coming in  goes international / global. He pulls his brother Vitaly Orlov (Jared Leto) to join him. The illegal trade fetches Yuri  good money and richness, a super model as his wife Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan), global trotting from one continent to another  but he looses his brother Vitaly in drugs, makes many enemies, and distanced himself from humanness and morality that even poor kids from Africa using arms to kill each other does not touch his heart. Even though Yuri substantially faces emotional and moral losses  the movie still ends in a note that ""Arms trade is a chic thing to go into!"" A very good topic to make movie on, which the New Zealand born writer / director Andrew Niccol has always loved to rake contemporary problematic issues. Surely, this movie throws enough light on arms trade and how it takes place. Where it falls flat on its face is the inter-weaving of Yuri's family life with his business. It is poorly scripted. In addition, he has created a very superficial, one-dimensional character of Yuri, and the screenplay does not give enough scope to the Oscar winning actor Nicolas Cage to give his best. He is good, I would say above average in his role, but nothing extra-ordinary. Jared Leto over-acts. Bridget Moynahan has hardly anything to contribute to the movie.<br/><br/>The movie has surely some funny and engaging sequences, like the Boeing landing on remote African mud-tracks, or Russian collapse and the boost in trade etc. but it could have been a lot better.<br/><br/>Indian musician A.R.Rahman sold his theme music of the movie of ""Bombay"" for a small scene  which sounds so absurd in the scene. Why should Antonio Pinto  the music director of this movie pay such a high price for this theme and put it in a most absurd situation? May be it is creativity of highest level, that we can not understand.<br/><br/>(Stars 5 out of 10)"

","Lord of War is an interesting concept for a movie: an illegal arms dealer, Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage), making his way up through the ranks, eventually becoming successful enough to supply the world's armies. This is a movie that tries to raise some moral questions about the business of weapons dealing while simultaneously instructing us about it, but its downfall is in how it is presented. On the one hand, the film seems to be glorifying weapons, through heavy use of gun-porn and informative bits of narrative from Cage that could have been taken straight from Wikipedia. On the other hand, you have the ethical side: Cage's character contemplates his position as the movie makes it clear that his job is to give people tools to kill each other with. You get the sense that the director is trying to be ironic, but the acting and writing is so bad that you don't really know (or care).<br/><br/>Cage has never been my favorite actor, but his performance here is especially wooden and uninteresting. I think he was going for the cool, calm feel, but it just comes off as boring. The whole time it sounds like he's reading from a legal document. Bad things happen to Yuri but you'll find it hard to care. Jared Leto and Bridget Moynahan are equally mediocre in supporting roles. The film's potential depth is ruined as much by its uninspired script as it is by its uninspired acting. It spends a lot of time informing us; some stuff is kind of interesting but you'll often find yourself thinking ""okay, but how does this relate to the plot?"" The movie basically becomes a documentary trying to make a political statement.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie is probably its darkly humorous portrayal of third-world plight, led by Eamonn Walker (Kareem Said from HBO's Oz) as a sadistic West African dictator. Somehow being able to smile in light of genocide, child soldiers, and AIDS makes it seem that much more real, and this film does a good job of making the viewer think. It's an unusual approach to making a social statement but it has the same effect as the typical depressing-scene-after-depressing-scene. Walker's performance, along with Sammy Rotibi's role as the dictators bloodthirsty son, saves this movie.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a decent film with a premise that will keep you interested if you can stand stale acting, annoying narration, and a plot that doesn't really exist. I can't say I liked it, but it impacted me enough to go ahead and write this review. That's basically what you'll get out of Lord of War: not necessarily enjoyment, but food for thought. 6/10"

","In director Andrew Niccol's new movie ""Lord of War"" (**1/2 out of ****), likable Nicolas Cage plays Yuri Orlov, an amoral globe-trotting merchant of death who sells weapons of all sorts to sadistic, Third World African dictators committed to the concept of tyranny and self-aggrandizement. You've haven't seen Cage in such a singularly unsympathetic role since John Woo's 1997 bullet-blasting blockbuster ""Face/Off."" Nevertheless, despite the lack of sympathy that his gun running character elicits, Cage's charisma shines through this unsavory veil, and he creates a genuinely affable persona. You can't help but like Yuri Orlov, because this devilish but friendly Cage character manages somehow to avoid getting his hands dirty. Truly, he is the man caught in the middle, a victim of circumstances that he manipulates to make a fast buck in a world gone mad. Indeed, he qualifies as the hero--or at the very least the protagonist, because ""Lord of War"" covers the ups and downs of his 20-years as one of the world's notorious armaments salesmen.<br/><br/>Appearances are deceptive in any movie that New Zealand native Andrew Niccol has either written or directed. Does anybody remember the cold, cruel, procrustean society of his 1997 sci-fi saga ""Gattaca?"" Although he didn't call the shots on the offbeat 1998 epic ""The Truman Show,"" Niccol wrote the film's thought-provoking screenplay about a man (Jim Carrey) trapped in a world that consists entirely of artifice. Lied to from birth, ""The Truman Show"" hero eventually learns that others have manipulated his whole life, so that his life has become the subject of the top-ranked TV reality show. Niccol penned, produced, and directed the featherweight Al Pacino comedy ""S1m0ne"" (2002) about a movie director who uses CGI to create a new female superstar, because he can no longer tolerate unruly, uncooperative starlets.<br/><br/>In ""Lord of War,"" Niccol flips everything upside down. He transforms the traditional villain into a hero and makes his embodiment of law and order--a straight-shooting, fair & square Interpol agent--into an adversary as pesky as any horsefly. As movies go, ""Lord of War"" shatters one convention after another, some for good, others not so good, and its politically incorrect agenda is undoubtedly going to alienate some audiences, not only because Cage is the bad guy that we are supposed to identify with, but also because some may find the violence objectionable. Squeamish audiences will flinch when bullets perforate heads and send blood spraying across the wall behind their victims. Not surprisingly, ""Lord of War"" bears an R-rated that reflects its over-the-top, ironic indictment of international arms dealing while it ridicules the hypocrisy of super-powers that cloak their complicity with freebooters like Yuri. Heavy-handed and factual to the nth degree (reportedly a real arms dealer supplied them with genuine tanks), ""Lord of War"" is a glossy-looking movie that is too clever for its own good. The imaginative but jolting opening credits chronicle the life of a bullet from the factory to a machine gun and then through a child's cranium.<br/><br/>The major problem with ""Lord of War"" is that Niccol spends too much time exposing the international arms racket rather than dramatizing the exploits of a cavalier gun runner. The Nicolas Cage characterthe son of Ukrainian immigrants in Brooklyn who discovers a future in gun running after he witnesses a gunfight at a restaurantqualifies as the only three-dimensional character. Everybody else lurks on the periphery. When they disappear from the film for stretches, like Yuri's troubled brother Vitalty (Jared Leto of ""Alexander""), we don't miss them. Initially, Cage's Yuri Orlov breaks the fourth wall and addresses the audience. Afterward, he narrates in intermittent voice-overs, not unlike the leads in director Martin Scorsese's Mafia bio-pics such as ""Goodfellas"" or ""Casino,"" and provides us with a profile of a gun runner. For example, Yuri warns us: ""The first and most important rule of gun-running is: never get shot with your own merchandise."" Yuri has no conscience. He sells to whoever can pay. The best day of his life occurs when the Soviet Union collapses. He bribes a high-ranking relative in the military to sell him a vast stockpile of tanks, AK-47 assault rifles, and helicopters. Acquiring this hoard is one thing, Yuri must now wrestle with the logistics of shipping the weapons to his clients without Agent Jack Valentine (Oscar-winner Ethan Hawk of ""Training Day"") busting him. This rivalry between Yuri and Valentine resembles a Warner Brothers cartoon with Yuri as the Roadrunner and Valentine as Wiley Coyote. Meantime, when he isn't orchestrating arms sales, he courts super-model Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan of ""Coyote Ugly""), but keeps her in the dark about his work. Indeed, Yuri's encounters with murderous African warlords generate more drama than his marriage to his trophy wife, his cocaine-addicted brother, and the ever vigilant Valentine.<br/><br/>Clocking in at over two hours, ""Lord of War"" wears mighty thin before fade out. Okay, Cage gets in several clever lines of dialogue, like ""Where there's a will, there's a weapon."" Literally, since this amounts to a one-man show, nobody else makes much of an impression. Although his Ukraine accent may be questionable, Cage gives a polished, nuanced performance, too bad that ""Lord of War"" couldn't have been half as assured and incisive as Cage's thesping. The audacious satire in Niccol's script lacks the sting of a Stanley Kubrick black comedy such as ""Dr. Strangelove"" (1964) or Richard Brooks' ""Wrong Is Right"" (1982), a Sean Connery thriller about terrorists blowing themselves up in America. Overall, ""Lord of War"" achieves more urgency as a cynical, fact-filled expose about gun runners and the governments that sanction their efforts than a satisfying, catharsis-inducing actioneer where everything resolves itself in less than two hours."

","My title is cynically shocking but my intention is to arouse consciousness about what really kills: WEAPONS. Not words, not ideas, no differences, but real objects made by humans whose aim is to kill other humans But a weapon is harmless if nobody touches it. So, the ""Thanatos"" side of humans (its death pulsion) needs to find somebody who can be the middleman between those who built & those who use.<br/><br/>This movies is about this kind of ""lord of war"".<br/><br/>From a realistic point of view, the movie is respectful: indeed, Africa is the main consumer because it is the poorest civilization, thus unable to have massive weapons of destruction. In addition, the movie acknowledges the situation of child-soldiers, and the director is honorable to refuse casting ""disabled"" child. At least, it denounced the bigger sharks which really pull the strings of those lords of war.<br/><br/>From a drama point of view, the story has good dynamics: a brother relationship, an attractive & moralistic wife, western background against natural sets. All the same, as the character of Nicolas Cage compartments his life (his container is a symbolic home for him), the movie is maybe too much rigid, too cut.<br/><br/>Cinematography, the director is a good visual one: excellent opening, intelligent frames (the ads of his future wife, the automobile design viewed as target, etc.).<br/><br/>But finally, the movie lacks something to motive several viewings but the first one isn't a loss of time also. It has the value of opening a high political issue from the basic level. This debate could go on with the insight of the Philip K. Dick's novel ""the Zap Gun"" in which he asked if those who design weapons are kind people, cynic or with a corrupt conscience ???"

"diegorodriguez","5","0","3","23 November 2006"," Tell me something new
","Arms trade is obviously nothing surprising for Americans. Wholesaling them abroad is neither. Its moral implications are completely clear.<br/><br/>So this movie was supposed to tell us something new about it. But it falls short in most respects by several reasons.<br/><br/>First, it simplifies all characters to the rule...'one of each'. For instance, all world dictators are incarnated by the fictitious Colonel Oliver Southern. All other arm dealers, the 'ones with principles', are incarnated by Simeon Weisz. The military corruption is simplified to one of each side, Ukranian and American top officials... All good men are represented by an ubiquous incredible cop, Jack Valentine. Finally, most of the women depicted in the movie are faceless prostitutes, besides Orlov's wife, an ex-top model. So, in the big picture, we have a frustratingly simple scene. The usual salt and pepper of violence and sex completes this moral 'fast food' product, that never goes deep into any character background or motivation.<br/><br/>Second, the whole movie turns around Mr. Cage's performance, who stays in the screen since the very beginning to the last shot, with the only exception of a notable trailer introduction that may summarize the whole thing probably better than the 120 minutes lenght of the movie that comes next. Is it hard to tell apart the many truculent parts Mr. Cage has played in the past from this new character. Only brief appearances of Ian Holm, as sole competitor of Orlov, dignify the poor acting of the rest of the crew, never seeming to believe their own parts.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie fails to dare going further in revealing the intrincated associations of the industry military complex. The only mention to US military, the world's number 1 arms exporter, is a top rank US General with no face that appears briefly a couple of times.<br/><br/>Maybe, Andrew Niccol faded before this dangerous subject when compared with his previous very interesting films, as GATTACA or The Truman Show, or maybe he had to surrender for the sake of average US people's understanding, but a lost chance, in the very bottom line, to tell us something new, something powerful enough to recommend this movie to be watched."

","LORD OF WAR fulfilled my expectations and was better than INSIDE MAN that I saw last week-end. Both films are accompanied by a narration but my wife doesn't like movies that are narrated. LORD OF WAR kept my attention from start to the end. There was a great message to the audience that all countries exporting and producing arms should respect the rules. It was mixed with some violent scenes and I think that these bloody parts were created to show how serious this problem really is. The picture was fine and all the actors delivered a solid performance. The story opened very wide my eyes and I could feel with Yuri's brother what he meant. Don't expect a great action flick because I imagined much more from them as the air plane scene for example that I liked.

"dominion76251","3","0","7","6 September 2006"," Pathetic
","Lord of War looked like it had the potential to be a really good flick, but looks can be deceiving. It turned out to be nothing more than a Hollywood bashing of the arms dealer, and guns in general. The storyline deals with a Russian immigrant and his rise to power and wealth in the arms trade. The whole object of the film was to vilify and make international arms dealer Yuri (Nicholas Cage) pay for his sins. The subtitle for the film could have been ""Die, gun guy, DIE."" They went so far over the top in punishing him that it was laughable. They made him a liar, adulterer, drug user, murderer... they even tried to give him AIDS. It was absolutely ridiculous. I won't give away the ending, but suffice to say it doesn't end up well for poor Yuri. The filmmakers were not at all shy about showing what their political views are. So successful in their mission were they, that I actually contemplated throwing myself in front of a bus out of guilt because I saw a picture of an AK-47 once. I realize that movies are often made today just to advance a certain political agenda, but this was the most obvious attempt I have seen yet. The movie is actually a rip-off of an 80's flick called Deal of the Century with Chevy Chase (which was excellent, by the way). Lord doesn't deliver any of the comedy that made Deal of the Century great. It is so dark and depressing that I wanted to slit my wrists before it was over just for a few laughs. The only amusing part of the film was the cat and mouse game between Yuri and the dedicated law enforcement agent (Ethan Hawke) trying to nab him. The opening sequence was awesome and original, but even there the political message was still obvious. It shows a bullet (from the bullets viewpoint) being made, loaded, shipped, put into a gun, and then going down the barrel to blow someone's brains out. I wonder if Handgun Control Inc. had anything to do with the making of this movie? I give it a 3 out of 10 just for some of the great one-liners that Cage gives in his voice-over narration, which are quite good. If I wanted pure propaganda, I would have rented Fahrenheit 9/11."

The fact that no US studios would back the movie makes it a brave choice for Cage, Hawke and Leto, and they all put in excellent performances, particularly Cage as the laconic, self-deluded arms dealer. This movie does not deal in the normal Hollywood black and white morality, but in the thousand grey shades of real life. The movie presents a thought-provoking look at the men who buy and sell arms to the world's dictators and bush-fire conflicts. This is a brave movie that doesn't shy away from showing the reality of the darker side of the modern world. A brilliant, and intelligent movie with superb acting and incisive characterisation, with the possible exception of Hawke's somewhat one-dimensional, crusading Interpol agent (though in fairness he does the best he can with the slim pickings the role offers).

","Story: Life story of Yuri Orlov, immigrant who becomes an arm dealer.<br/><br/>Pros: Eye-opening film. Cinematography and direction are brilliant. Very entertaining but also has a powerful message to say. Almost does not drag at all (which is a rarity for a 'drama' genre). Dialog is very clever, as there are some lines that are bound to stick in your mind.<br/><br/>Cons: Some scenes are way over-dramatic. Cage did an OK job, but I still think they should have picked someone better for that role.<br/><br/>Evaluation: This movie has just edged over ""Constant Gardener"" in my book as the best movie of 2005. The message is clearly anti-war, but (as opposed to ""Constant Gardener"") this movie has a very light tone (which makes the viewing much more enjoyable). But what I really love about this movie is its dark self-ironic humor mixed into scenes of harsh 'dog-eat-dog' reality (quite a contrast). Also it's notable that the main hero is not vilified throughout the film, but there's no excuse for his actions either: in a way he's an average schmo, that each one of us can relate to in some way (which allows us to think what we would do in his place).<br/><br/>Recommendation: A must-see for all of you liberal/anti-war kind out there.

"Benjamin_Cox","6","0","2","21 June 2006"," Cage shines in a film that could have been brilliant - 70%
","One of many things my Better Half and I share is a deep-rooted respect for Nicolas Cage. Personally, I find it hard to think of a movie he's done that I haven't enjoyed in some way – whether he's in blockbuster action fluff like ""The Rock"" or in seriously heavy dramas like ""Leaving Las Vegas"". OK, I can forgive anyone ""Con Air"" and Hell, every rule has to be broken at some point. From the moment I first saw the trailer, I could tell that this wasn't Cage in wide-eyed Elvis mode. ""Lord Of War"" is something that screams to be taken seriously, despite the near-the-knuckle humour and deep implausibility of it all. This is a very modern war film and an original one, delving into a world seldom explored in movies.<br/><br/>Cage plays Yuri Orlov, a Ukranian gun-runner who takes us on a journey from his early days living in America to his rise to the top of the pile. In the beginning, he trades Uzis to local gangsters with the help of his younger brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) but soon eclipses the efforts of his British idol, the veteran arms dealer Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm). But for all of his money, he is morally bankrupt - his trophy wife (Bridget Moynahan) is unaware of Yuri's other women, his son grows up without him, his brother descends into a drug-fuelled hell and the dubious nature of his business continues to eat at Yuri's soul. As if this wasn't enough, he is constantly forced to outwit federal agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) who is getting ever closer to catching Yuri.<br/><br/>While ""Lord Of War"" is an excellent character study of a thoroughly disgusting human being, it isn't what I would call an entertaining film. It has a streak of wickedly black humour running through it but because the truth seems so improbable (at least, I hope it is) and because Yuri is so vile a person, you don't sympathise with him at all. Cage is typically brilliant as the slimy arms dealer and Hawke is a perfect foil for him. But the story is one that you rarely identify with, set in a world that is both horrifying and reprehensible. The fact that many do this for real - a fact hammered home by the end credits - and often with the blessing of their respective governments can't help but anger those of us with a conscious.<br/><br/>""Lord Of War"" strikes me as being one of those 'cult' movies that come along every now and again. It's not a laugh-a-minute and anyone who saw the trailer (like I did) may feel slightly disappointed (like I am). I do feel that the film was marketed as something that it wasn't - maybe the studios felt that a serious war movie with a moral ending wouldn't have made much at the box office. I noticed that no American studio would fund ""Lord Of War"" and I wasn't surprised, given the US's current love for all things trigger-based. I respect the fact that this is a well-made, intelligent film but for me, I prefer something with a more overt anti-war message such as ""Black Hawk Down"". By comparison, ""Lord Of War"" comes across as a darker version of ""Jerry Maguire"" and to be honest, that's not what I'm looking in a war film."
"markbeardslee","9","0","1","19 June 2006"," Genius, pure genius
","Orlov (Cage) starts this film with an apology, saying that he is who he is, and that he expects no one will think he is not one of the ugliest, dirtiest, most murderous men in the world, because what he is, he confesses, is an illegal arms dealer. With that necessity out of the way, Orlov says he intends to simply tell his story, no matter how much it may offend folks. He just wants to tell the truth about what he did. The film's producers claim that it is based on actual events.<br/><br/>And offend the story does! No political correctness crossed this film's sound stage and survived. Cage's narrative does not simply verge on the obscene, it becomes so in a beautifully written examination of and a near justification for the existence of the private arms dealer. Consider, the film asks us, that the greatest arms traders in the world are the US, the UK, France, China and Russia, and that all five of these countries are the only permanent members of the UN Security Council. That fact itself is enough to help viewers begin to see why middlemen, like Cage's character Orlov, not only survive, but thrive in this war-ridden world.<br/><br/>In a terribly ugly movie, writer and director Andrew Niccol is able to present comedic and sexual scenes that can make a viewer feel sick for realizing he's laughing. Such sharp ability on Niccol's part is what prevents an otherwise shamefully violent gross-out movie from becoming both a compelling piece of self-examination and a powerful expose of the world's true ""foreign affairs."" Cage continually plays you and me, people who would work for profit if it were to be made and damn the consequences. While doing so, he admits that he is one of the most powerful men in the world, not because he has the guns, but because it is human nature to kill each other. ""That's why all the earliest skeletons of humans have arrowheads in them,"" Cage's commentator dryly offers early on. And the rest of the film painfully and arduously proves that this nihilistic view is quite accurate.<br/><br/>Through the expansive use of information gleaned from the minutiae of Cold War spy games to the outright abandon of any sort of law of the seas or of borders when the Cold War finally ends, Niccol guides us on a tour of Cage's Ukrainian character Orlov as he buys abandoned arms from rarefied areas and sells them to high bidders throughout the Third World, always competing with the dangerous dealers who came before. Niccol also allows us into Orlov's personal life, his marriage to the love of his juvenile dreams, and to the extent he will go to maintain his deception. His wife, the premier occidental Ava Fontaine, brilliantly played by Bridget Moynahan, accepts Orlov's fallacy and ignores his work, just as he asks her. Orlov himself seems often to ignore his own work as well. Pursued intermittently by Jack Valentine, a painfully honest INTERPOL agent played with newfound boldness by Ethan Hawke, and toyed with by Simon Weisz, a character portrayed by Ian Holm with that actor's usual deftness, Orlov becomes THE private gunrunner in the world. He can be tracked, caught, arrested, but he will always be released because he knows of and does those things with which the highest ranking members of the militaries of the world would rather their names not be associated.<br/><br/>The grist of this film comes in a variety of fashions. First, we appreciate the mock-comical approach of the narrative that offers profound but accurate aphorisms as we watch Third World children murder and be murdered. Second, we relate to Orlov, because he is really only doing what many of us would reasonably do in his shoes: recognize the horrors around him but hold himself blameless because there is always someone else who would gladly take over the dirty work. Third, Orlov is a real person, dealing with family conflicts and the demands of keeping certain matters secret from his wife and child even while he bestows his love upon them. Finally, Niccol populates the film with colorful, if not downright pernicious, characters who work as Orlov's clients. This technique lends a great amount of credibility to Orlov's refrain of personal innocence. The self-appointed president of Liberia would obtain his arms from whomever, Orlov has us believe. As we watch, it is easy to believe this to such an extent that we become willing to exonerate Orlov for his crimes.<br/><br/>The film's only weak points are when Orlov is betrayed by his wife and by his crack-head brother. The scenes are not believable, but their inclusion is understood as explanations for Valentine's ultimate arrest of Orlov. Still, we are left wondering who will be punished, Orlov, his wife or his brother.<br/><br/>""Lord of War"" is not pretty by any means. Avoid it if you have qualms about children dying, about instant murder, or about what may really be happening behind the headlines of events in the Third World. But if you want to catch a clever and insightful glimpse into the history and persistence of underground arms dealers and how they affect global politics, see this astonishingly good movie."
"Wolverine31","9","0","1","17 June 2006"," Morals versus Reality
","I waded through the Lord of War, just last night. The opening scene  ""The Life of a Bullet""  paraphrased the theme of the movie. Mankind mindlessly produces the components of war, without moral introspection, or without even thinking about their end use. We ascribe morality only after an event. This is not to say, however, that the production of everything man invents should be evaluated purely on a moral basis. If we did that, we would still be sitting in caves naked, and without fire.<br/><br/>Mankind has had this uncanny ability to turn almost every invention into some kind of weapon. All we have to do is look back to the opening sequence of a film classic  Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Here we see the early seeds of mankind bashing in the skulls of rival hominids with a bone clubs. Today, our clubs have evolved into nightmarish, mechanical, mass-produced weaponry. We have always killed one another, its just, that over time, we have improved on our ability accomplish this end.<br/><br/>Yuri Orlov, played exquisitely by Nichols Cage, is simply a very successful opportunist and realist. He knows what his product is, and what it is intended to do. He is simply filling the middleman role in the supply and demand process. If not him, someone else will. Every successful businessman is much like Yuri, maybe not to the same degree, but they almost need to be amoral about how they conduct business, or they are out of business. Do the names Enron or Tyco ring a bell here?<br/><br/>In the scene, where Eva confronts Yuri about what he does, he states: ""Its not the money. Its just that I'm good at what I do."" There is no such thing as an ""honest buck."" But, shouldn't Orlov take a certain pride in what he does? We all know what that the weapons produced by every capable government are meant to do. Some regimes simply don't have the capacity to produce their own weapons. Should these governments be left defenseless? Enter the Orlovs of the world.<br/><br/>The beauty of the film, which, by the way, I thought was exceptionally well done, is that it did not moralize. It was not a morality play. Instead, it more like a documentary. The moral issues are left to the audience to resolve. Sure, by our very nature, we will align ourselves with Yuri, his addictive brother Vitaly, the African warlord, or the Interpol agent (played exceedingly well by Ethan Hawke). Every one of them had a defensible reason for doing what they do, albeit naively.<br/><br/>My only criticism of the movie was that it was a bit slow. Otherwise, the content, the acting, storyline, and cinema photography were exceedingly well done. This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It was entertaining, as well as thought-provoking."

Leto's acting is great, but I would like to see him play a part other than becoming a drug addict.

","Plot Outline: Lord of War is an intriguing movie about a gunrunner Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) who starts as a nobody and ends as one of the world biggest gunrunners. In the process he becomes an almost immoral person. At the end of the movie he loses everything people value most in their life (his brother gets killed, his wife and parents do not want to know him anymore), but he gains a status of being almost invulnerable.<br/><br/>Below the story: What the deeper story tells is that in this world good and evil often go together in order to achieve a ""greater goal"" of people or governments. It shows the two sides of the world we live in, one being the good protective world, the other being that of ""the ends justify the meaning"". As viewer you get reminded that even the governments and companies we trust, sometimes do things that might not be ethically correct but do serve our greater good. Yuri Orlov personates this by becoming immoral, and when knowing his guns will be used to kill hundreds of innocent people he simply states ""This is not our war"".<br/><br/>Acting and characters: The main characters are all very well made. Most of them represent existing persons or stereotypes of people. Yuri Orlov and Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) represent evil and good (Orlov being evil and Valentine being good). During the movie Cage narrates as Orlov, making remarks about good and evil, concluding that ""evil prevails"". As Orlov and Valentine struggle against each other, Orlov constantly wins. The reason that Valentine does not win is that he does not want to break the law while trying to catch Orlov. He even gets the chance to kill Orlov without getting caught, but he doesn't because ethically he is ""too good"". Eventually Valentine does get Orlov and good seems to prevail. But by that time Orlov has made himself an almost invulnerable necessary evil, and the status quo decide to let him go free. And so ""evil prevails"".<br/><br/>Music: The soundtrack is amazing, even hearing the late and amazing Jeff Buckley was breathtaking.<br/><br/>Great movie, one to watch."

","The title comes from one interaction with one of his good customers, the dictator of Liberia, who has a habit of reversing common sayings. So 'blood bath' rolls off his tongue as 'bath of blood.' When he is referred to as a war lord, he says ""It is you who are the Lord of War."" Nicolas Cage is the Lord of War, Yuri Orlov, raised in the USA and now an international weapons dealer. He will sell to anyone at any time, because he has rationalized that he only sells weapons, he has no control over what the buyers do with them. He further rationalizes that they will get them from someone, so even if he didn't sell them, there would be no impact. But, as he describes later in the movie, he doesn't do it strictly for the money, he does it because he is GOOD at it. Plus, the profit margin on honest work is not very good, because there is so much competition.<br/><br/>This movie seems to work best as a very dark comedy. There are lots of funny things, not the least of which is how Nic Cage plays his character. And how he gets the girl. Former model Bridget Moynahan is Ava Fontaine, and her picture is on billboards all over. Yuri has admired her from afar for a long time, but finally takes action by contracting her for a fake photo shoot on the French coast, and also buys out the hotel so that they are the only two there. They meet on the beach, she laments that the next flight out is in several days, so he offers her a ride on the private plane he chartered, with his name ORLOV painted on the side. he just about went broke doing all that, but he charmed the girl and they were married. During their life together Ava always suspected that Yuri was into a different business but she didn't ask any questions.<br/><br/>This is a very unconventional movie, and may in fact be a commentary on gun sales everywhere. A footnote at the end says that the 5 countries which are on the UN Security Council are also the 5 biggest sellers of weapons worldwide. As usual Cage creates a fascinating character.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. When Ava asked him to quit, after she finally found out his real occupation, he did for 6 months, getting into legitimate business. But the Liberian dictator showed up, shoved a very large diamond into Yuri's hand, and said he needed him. Unable to resist he asked his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) to help. But at the site of the exchange Vitaly saw what was going on, he tried to stop it by blowing up the two trucks of weapons, only destroyed one and was killed by machine gun fire. Back in the States Yuri was arrested and questioned, but predicted he would not spend even one day in court. He correctly predicted that in a minute, a man would knock on the door of the interrogation room, tell the detective (Ethan Hawke) to release Yuri. The last we see in Yure getting a briefcase of payoff, and realize that he is being protected by the countries that have the most to lose if he exposes everything."

","Never has so much been said about the arms trade in this film than the beginning of it when we view the world from a bullet's point of view: from it's manufacture to it's subsequent use. This scene alone defines the tone of this whole film. Cage as ever plays a Ukranian born American citizen small time arms dealer. He might as well be one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse as he plies his trade literally all over the world. However, although he does extremely well for himself, he quickly realises that he has a problem in FBI man Jack Valentine who tries to find a reason to put him in jail without opening himself up to bribery. Cage's narration is an exercise in the sardonic, even black and dry humour that surely comes from an arms dealer who has seen too much of his product used in conflicts throughout the world, but particularly in Africa. He is called a Lord of War by an African leader but disagrees with the title, saying he is really a Warlord. The African leader replies 'I like my title best'.<br/><br/>That really does sum up this film. There is a sly morality to it.

","""Lord Of War"" is probably the most in-depth, cinematic look into the world of gunrunners, which is a world that many know nothing about.<br/><br/>Starring Nicholas Cage as Yuri, a Eukranian-American who stumbles upon the world of selling firearms and becomes the greatest gunrunner in the world, ""Lord Of War"" is an educational, entertaining, wonderfully written thrill-ride. At times, it is difficult to watch because the subject matter is so intense and disturbing.<br/><br/>Guns, in the film, are seen as merchandise, not weapons of death. They are thrown around as though they are food or clothes for sale. But there is constantly that thought, in the back of everyone's mind, of what this ""merchandise"" will be used for. But Yuri does not let that thought in.<br/><br/>Cage does an excellent job, as always, in the lead role. His character seemed, at times, to be the cliché, suave, bad-ass criminal that everyone hates to love, but he takes Yuri to places that many of these type of characters have rarely been. He is vulnerable. He is incredibly smart and very aware of his flaws. Of course, he is the hero of the piece, but American audiences are most likely getting used to the bad guy being the good guy nowadays. Good and evil don't mean much these days, and this film strongly represents that.<br/><br/>Jared Leto and Ethan Hawke are the other stand-out performances in the film. Leto stars as Yuri's lost brother who seems to always be getting himself into trouble. Hawke stars as the detective who is after Yuri throughout the entire film, and is outsmarted for most of the time.<br/><br/>The greatness of this film lies in its writing. Andrew Niccol created a script full of beautifully flowing humor, tragedy, violence, suspense, satire, and political education. So many great lines, especially with the character of Yuri, are present in the film. Of course, having Nicholas Cage deliver these lines doesn't hurt. Cage has a way of saying a line in a way that nobody would have thought to do, but he blows everybody else out of the ballpark.<br/><br/>The underlying message of the film (there always has to be one) is stated in the last lines of the film, spoken by Yuri: ""The art of survival is never to go to war - especially with yourself."" The battles we go through during life are unavoidable; all we can do is try to keep living. That's all we can do."

","In the modern era of warfare, nothing has been more important than a good firearm at your side. Thus, the gun runner was born. The film ""Lord of War"" tells the story of one such man, Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage), a Ukrainian refugee living in America who decides to sell weapons for a living.<br/><br/>The opening of the film begins with you the viewer following the path of a bullet from the factory to the battlefield, an interesting vantage point. The story moves rather quickly, staring in the late '70s with Orlov trying to make it in suburban Brooklyn, New York. Progressing throughout the '70s and '80s, the film really picks up speed after the Soviet Union's fall in 1991, and continues on right up until modern times.<br/><br/>The acting is what you would expect for a film such as this, good, but not great. Cage is easily the stand-out actor in the film, although Ethan Hawke does a good job as well. But in this film, acting was the smallest part of what made this film great.<br/><br/>The story alone is worth at least a rental. All of it is based on actual events, stories, and actions that are played out every day across the world. This film isn't necessarily an entertainment piece, but more of one in which you would learn something in the process. Its something Americans should know about, on both sides of the isle. As a politically active conservative, I was well aware of what was going on in the film, but it did a good job of further expanding upon what I already knew. The DVD's second disc also contains a good documentary about the gun runners, I recommend watching that as well.<br/><br/>If you like your films with a bit of political background, this is one of the best we have seen in years. Although it might not suit everyone's taste, it's worth a watch. 9/10"

","I enjoyed ""Lord of War"", although I was expecting more from Andrew Niccol. That said, this is an extremely interesting movie that took some courage to make. Nicolas Cage is believable and doesn't overplay for once. The script is a little clichéd sometimes but for mere details.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie is the really dark humour through its snappy dialogue. For instance when Cage describes the AK-47. As informative as it is shocking, and it brings uneasy laughs sometimes... proof that it works! The opening sequence following a bullet from its factory to the skull of its victim is well done and sets the tone for the entire film.<br/><br/>Give it a try, worth watching."

","Andrew Niccol has a short but exquisite record as writer, producer and director, including 'Truman Show', 'Gattaca' and 'S1m0ne'. He is doing again something different in 'Lord of War' but unfortunately the difference is mainly relative to the quality of his previous record. 'Lord of War' disappointed me, it looks more like a documentary longer than the usual 60 minutes (including commercials) than or a HBO biography feature than like a real feature film.<br/><br/>It's not that the subject is not important. Arms traffic is one of the more critical problems in world policy and it certainly deserves a good film. The problem is that 'Lord of War' is not that good film, it is so obviously engaged that even if you agree 100% with the message you shortly become sick of it being repeated again and again. Moreover, there are many details that are superficial and characters that get a soap opera treatment, like all the assortment of bad guys from Ukraine, Liberia and so on.<br/><br/>We are certainly left with fine acting from Nicholas Cage. He is good as always, but his character's deepness is spoiled by the fact that he is put to explain himself and philosophize for half of the screening time. Cage does not need this and I believe he would have created a much more interesting character without one word spoken off-screen. The other piece of fine acting is given by Janred Leto. As we are one one night before the Oscars, I wonder why was Leto skipped from the supporting role list of candidates.<br/><br/>It's a disappointing film for those who expect a real feature movie from a director like Niccol and an actor like Cage."

","Truly one of the most grabbing movies I've seen in a long time! From the stunningly perfect visual start to the in-your-face rant about the reality of things at the end. It is also very daring in that it comes from Hollywood. The movie is accusing itself a lot, without being too apologetic or dogmatic or moral. Very well crafted script, fast pacing, cynically harsh and evil, telling, revealing, shocking, yet done in a way that is almost laughable. All while realising one is not allowed to laugh about it, because you *know* the world is like this, or worse. And even when the Cage character tries to excuse why he does it, you feel how difficult it has been to stay in the clear when writing and directing this, and it only just barely stays on the good side of itself, warning us all: Chaos will prevail. On top of all that it's got an amazing choice of music illustrating the beautifully shot images. A definite must see. No doubt about it."

","The Australian Prime Minister has been celebrating his ten years in office this week.<br/><br/>I disapprove of the Australian Prime Minister.<br/><br/>He's a ""rear-view mirror vision of society"" kind of guy. It is often suggested that he hankers for a return to some long gone, probably mythical time. Some golden era when virtuous and upstanding citizens carried on their cloistered lives behind white picket fences.<br/><br/>He denies it.<br/><br/>But then back in 1997 he denied the state premiers and their health ministers the opportunity to participate in a properly supervised medical trial, to establish whether there were more suitable approaches to the problems of drug abuse then simple-minded prohibition.<br/><br/>The Prime Minister did not want the issue confused with evidence based upon observations made under controlled conditions. His attitude was reminiscent of the Renaissance Catholic Church and its opposition to the early Enlightenment practitioners of the scientific method.<br/><br/>The Prime Minister still believes the Viet Nam War was a just and worthy exercise in the battle for freedom. Never mind that its best-known proponent, the former US Defence Department Secretary, Robert McNamara, has publicly expressed his heart-felt regret over his, and his country's actions.<br/><br/>And of course the Australian Prime Minister was vociferously happy to make a puny contribution to George Bush's coalition of the willing. So puny that, to my recollection, Australia is not even mentioned in the list of unlikely allies catalogued in Michael Moore's film, ""Fahrenheit 9/11""<br/><br/>My charge against the Prime Minister is simply this.<br/><br/>He is guilty of sapping the spiritual, intellectual and moral resources of my country.<br/><br/>Think about just three of the rash of truly amazing films by American film makers hitting the cinemas at the moment, questioning the spiritual, intellectual and moral fabric of that country.<br/><br/>Good Night and Good Luck Syriana Lord of War<br/><br/>Is it possible that they are a direct response to the re-election of a power clique that flagrantly mislead (read ""lied to"") their constituents and were exposed in their perfidy? <br/><br/>Cut. Back up a minute. Did you spot the odd one out? <br/><br/>Lord of War was written and directed by a New Zealander, Andrew Niccol.<br/><br/>He's a countryman of Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings) and Lee Tamahori, who's criminally under-rated Mullholland Falls, was a profound insight into the state of the post war American malaise and its causes.<br/><br/>How is that New Zealanders can produce such great films?<br/><br/>I love Australian films, but I have to admit the last few years have not really produced anything astounding. I have to go back to David Caesar's 2001 film, Mullet to nominate a film I consider to be truly great, and who has heard of Mullet?<br/><br/>Could it be something about the cultural climate the form and pressure that has moulded the age and body of its current fabric?<br/><br/>America, Australia and New Zealand are, or were, members of a military alliance until New Zealand had the temerity to insist that American ships bearing nuclear armaments would be denied docking facilities in its ports.<br/><br/>Tiny New Zealand, the shaky isles, that antipodean outpost where the population suffers an irrational and guilty fear of pronouncing vowels, found the internal strength of character to stand up for a conviction.<br/><br/>Of course Australia, then led by a nominally left wing government, had no such scruples. And of course Australia supported the invasion of Iraq, not heeding the lesson taught by the Viet Nam fiasco. that such modern day crusading should not be attempted without rigorously defined and specified goals and a pre-planned exit strategy.<br/><br/>But then Australians are apparently fearful of causing any trouble that might endanger their life-defining, life absorbing obsession with amassing wealth, in the form of land and buildings. And God help anyone who does anything that might upset the delicate balance required to keep this chimera of prosperity intact.<br/><br/>Is that the reason that Australian culture is currently so second rate? Is that the reason that the local film industry that is capable of producing such great art is currently struggling to produce even mediocre films?<br/><br/>Let's not delude ourselves. New Zealand is probably no ""heaven on earth"". And yet it keeps throwing up players who strut the world stage with such assurance and artistry.<br/><br/>Take Andrew Niccol.<br/><br/>He wrote the script for the Truman Show, only to have it taken from his capable hands and given to an Australian director, who did a competent but not breath-taking job.<br/><br/>Then he wrote and directed Gatica. Films about androids, clones and genetically modified humans doing battle with mere mortals are not really my thing. But Gatica was engaging, intelligent and well made.<br/><br/>But with Lord of War, Niccol has really hit his straps, An unbelievable plot line that is totally credible. Its denouement catches the viewer unawares, after watching the arms dealer Nicholas Cage manoeuvre his way brilliantly through the minefields of international arms dealings for one hundred and twenty minutes. This is George Bernard Shaw's Major Barbara retold for a twenty-first century audience.<br/><br/>The film looks great - apparently it is cheaper to gain access to warehouses full of real guns than to mock up sets with fake ones.<br/><br/>All the performers are first rate.<br/><br/>The narrative maintains a forward momentum, built as it is around Cage's engaging off camera addresses to the audience. And the inventiveness of his character's ploys to escape prosecution and maintain good relations with amoral killers while wooing and winning his childhood femme fatale keeps the viewer constantly entertained.<br/><br/>Australians have made amazing films for relatively small amounts of money. They have cobbled together a laconically passionate and yet surprisingly morally self aware and searching film culture.<br/><br/>But it has not been evident for a while.<br/><br/>Maybe around ten years?"

","If it were the only film of its kind, ""Lord of War"" would probably play out a lot better than it does; not to say it's a bad film--not in the least. The semi-factual story is suspenseful, engaging, dramatically convincing, and occasionally witty. Writer-director Andrew Niccol's tale revolves around Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage), a Ukranian who emigrates to America only to discover his true calling lies in supplying arms to third-world countries; Jared Leto plays his coke-addict brother, who provides an occasional assist; Bridget Moynihan is Yuri's trophy wife; the underutilized Ian Holm is a fellow dealer; and Ethan Hawke enters periodically as a persistent Interpol agent out to apprehend Orlov. With a fine cast and a lot of stunning visual ingenuity, Niccol has a seemingly infallible formula for success. Unfortunately, ""Lord of War"" quickly reminds us that we've been down this road before, joining such embellished, voiced-over productions as ""Goodfellas"" (a young man's rise to Mafia power) and ""Blow"" (a young man's rise to international cocaine dealing) as a moralistic, 'rags-to-riches-through-illegal-means' story with a script that just isn't distinguished enough. The sentimental material between Orlov and his wife could have easily been excised, as it feels contrived and unnecessary (I would have preferred more time spent with the characters played by Leto and Hawke). As it stands, ""Lord of War"" is a sleek, interesting thriller with great visual flair and fine performances, but all too quickly becomes self-indulgent as it putters toward the 2-hour mark."

","Incredibly moving, very sad and somehow profoundly riveting. I wouldn't suggest it to kids, it's definitely R for a reason. While the message in this movie is terrible, it is a very well put together film and easily conveys its message. The story is very well put together and personal. It definitely makes you think. For some background information, without giving away much of the movie, this is a movie about a down on his life arms dealer who gets extraordinarily wealthy by selling guns and ammunition. This shows all the heartrending destruction caused by his weapons, and, even though Orlov is by todays standards (you'll understand what i mean if you see it) a monster, the film portrays him in a way that makes the audience wonder at what is wrong with him, in some scenes you know what will happen and you cry inside at the injustice of it."
"Spacetree","8","0","2","4 February 2006"," Not Perfect, but still pretty good.
","While Lord of War isn't the perfect movie, it's still gets it's powerful political message across. Lord of War is the story of Yuri Orlov, a Ukrainian immigrant from Brooklyn who works in his family's failing restaurant. Unsatisfied with his slot it life (which he describes no better than Soviet-controlled Ukraine), Yuri witnesses an attempted assassination on a Russian mafia boss and changes his profession to arms-dealer, first starting locally then widening to every war zone on the planet between the mid 80s and 2000- during which he spirals into a haze of lies, drugs, pain, and guilt. While I didn't find Cage's performance particularly spectacular, it was enough to bring such a well written character to life. The other characters, while not especially developed, act as good foils to Orlov. I especially like Andre Baptiste, dictator of Liberia based on real-life Liberian dictator Charles Taylor.<br/><br/>Simply put, Lord of War has a clear message that it pushes at nearly every point in the movie when it's not developing the tragedy of Cage's character. If you dislike movies that harp on a single point on multiple levels, then this isn't for you. More so, if you don't agree with the point (which many won't, since it implicates the United States and several other superpowers in Yuri's wrongdoings), you won't like this movie. However, most students of history and politics will appreciate how the movie connects the last days of the Soviet Union and the continuing conflicts in parts of Africa with it's tirade against arms-dealing ( most of which is true, especially in Africa) even if they disagree with the moral. It's as much as an objective analysis as it is a cautionary tale.<br/><br/>The cinematography and direction is stylish and flashy, and can be compared with Michael Bay in someways. For some it might be a turn-off, but I say if you can do something outlandish with a camera and still have a good movie, do it. It never hurts to have a bit of flash, especially in a movie which has the potential to be quite visually dull.<br/><br/>The only negative criticisms I can find with the film are that, in some parts, a bit of plot development is needed, and that it has a tendency to generalize the issue of Africa. Sure, the continent has had it's share of corruption and violence, but not every coup or revolution in Africa has been bloody and not every government is corrupt. The movie redeems itself by making Yuri the true villain and by making a division between good, evil, and desperation in West Africa.<br/><br/>All in all, a powerful, highly enjoyable movie."

He does't GET to rely on his familial connections to get into Vinewood, then pretend otherwise as if he got where he is based on acting skill.<br/><br/>ACTION) This isn't an action movie, despite the guns. The effects are functional, and there's a cool intro sequence that follows a bullet from manufacture through travel to use.<br/><br/>COMEDY) LoW is a dark movie, and it's peppered with bits of dark humor here and there that can be good for a chuckle if you're sick like me.<br/><br/>PLOT) The movie is a fictional character study of an illegal arms merchant as he develops his business, gets paid, and runs from The Man. The script is good, and the flick wisely decides to set things up as a sequence of interesting narrated Vignettes rather than a straightforward story. This lets us skip from one story to the other quickly, and keeps the movie moving at a brisk clip. The only time the movie slows down is during the last quarter, where our antihero undergoes his crisis of conscience; that sequence could have been handled better.<br/><br/>The narrating is passable, but sweet lord Mr. Coppola cannot act, and it shows, and while his valium-drip monotone was OK in a simple action movie like Face Off, this isn't Face Off. As the focal point, he's supposed to be carrying the movie, and he's the worst actor here. Only the script saves this movie.<br/><br/>Regardless, the character he plays is a well-written totally amoral salesman, rationalizing his death business. It's those people with moral convictions, the government agent who won't bend the rules to catch his prey and the competing arms dealer who takes sides in conflicts based on politics, who are the losers. All the protagonist sacrifices are those family members who insist on following a code of morality that no longer seems applicable in a world where people are going to kill each other, anyway, no matter who's supplying the ammunition."

In this film, he sells guns, but doesn't use them. And that's all wrong for Nick. The rest of the cast is pretty decent so it's Cage that's holding it back. Cage becomes very successful at selling arms and staying just one tiny (sometimes comically so) step ahead of the Feds. Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are very interested in his dealings. The film actually tries to show that most of these weapons end up in the hands of villagers or warlords who then slaughter villagers. It shows that the arms dealer, who sees some of the violence wrought by his wares, is able to distance himself from it. The one decent thing that this film has going for it is that fact that, at the end of the film, Yuri still hasn't seen the error of his ways and is still in business.

Jared Leto was a good choice as the troubled brother, Vitaly. He brought a nice dimension to Cage's character that helped complete the overall picture of who Cage's Yuri actually was.

The opening sequence of following a single bullet from it's manufacturing to the end use was really powerful and put into perspective the volatile nature of the subject matter. After watching this movie, I could easily compare it to the Johnny Depp movie, Blow. What Depp did for Cocaine traffickers in his film, Nick does for the arms dealers in Lord of War.

","Nic Cage is the world's most successful arms dealer in LORD OF WAR, which follows his story from childhood to middle age, at which point he is on the verge of losing everything that is dear to him as he continues to heed the call to arms. The script is a marvelous distillation of the madness and mayhem of the wars that have taken place across our globe in the last 30 years. Cage is compelling as a manic gun dealer, and plays his role in a most deadpan and droll manner. The cinematography is astonishing, especially in depicting massive convoys of war planes and tanks and endless weaponry rolling through the war-torn landscapes of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Russia. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, particularly Jared Leto as Cage's drug-addled brother and Bridget Moynihan as Cage's adoring but disillusioned wife. A must-see."

","Yuri is a young American man, emigrated from Ukraine, who decides to throw himself in the business of weapons traffic to make maximum amount of money to realize his dream to get marry with a beautiful young model, Ava. He is an ordinary man without unkindness but also without any moral sense. He sizes the opportunity of the end of the cold war between Western and Eastern nations to empty the ex-communist's arsenals and send all kind of weapons toward any potential clients, specially in Africa to arms as well official armies as rebels in the diverse countries were civil wars are active. At the beginning of his activities, he is helped by his brother and especially by a Ukrainian cousin, an ex-communist general. His business goes very well and he becomes rich and famous in spite of rivalry with another big gunrunner and the pursuit of a tenacious Interpol policeman, Jack Valentine. But, his relationship with the dictatorial and psychopathic president of Liberia will drag him into grave problems, causing the dead of his brother. The Interpol policeman, Jack Valentine, who have gathered evidences against him, succeed to arrest him. But, the political interests of the nations that maintain the international weapons traffic will be strongest and Yuri will be released. The movie is brilliantly made and very well played by Nicolas Cage. The description of the way of live in African countries is very impressive and the denunciation of the implication of politics in weapons traffic is very courageous. A very great film, indeed!"

","Yuri looking for a way to find fortune beyond his dreams, decides to turn to arms dealing. Supplying arms to every army except the salvation army. It turns out that he has a natural talent for the gig and brings his brother in for the business. Although when Interpol agent Valentine starts to shake things up, Yuri finds himself slowly losing his mind. Will this dangerous business ruin his relation with wife and son, what will it cost him to stop?<br/><br/>Andrew Niccol hasn't had a really good successful film as of yet, both Gattaca and S1mone had lackluster box office. Here Niccol has the support of Cage, who has a long list of films as of late. As well as a controversial topic, perfect for these times that we live in. Niccol does score with his biggest opening for a film and great reviews, yet the box office seemed to fade away. Well, with no US distributor funding money for this project, who could really guess why?<br/><br/>Lord of War opens with the production a bullet, going through every single stage until it reaches it's target, which is a young African boy. This is the best opening for a film the whole year. It's quite unique and ultra cool. If you went into this film expecting action left right and centre, then this will be a huge let down for you, because Niccol's films are about characters, and Lord of War is one of the best character driven movies in some time.<br/><br/>The main character is Yuri and Nic Cage hands in a great performance by making a dirt bag character actually likable. He gives the character a certain charm, as he does with every role. Leto is Cage's brother, who is a drug addict, going to re-hab to get his life straight. Leto does a decent job and in the last scene showcases the highlight of his talent. Then we have Hawke, who is surprisingly not in the movie that much. War is more about Cage's character and his life as a dealer through the decades, then it is about Hawke tracking him down. Hawke gives a good performance with what little he has.<br/><br/>If you are interested in the topic, then Lord of War is a great film. It will give you insight of what the world of arms dealing is and how it affects everyone. With every character driven movie, there are bound to be some parts that will drag on, and Lord of War is no exception. I found that when Cage is stranded in Africa and starts to really lose his mind, it was kind of dull.<br/><br/>Lord of War is really a film that you either love or hate. This is Niccol's best film as of date, with Gattaca right behind it. Ian Holm, Bridget Moynahan have small roles that play an outcome of Cage's character. But it's the ending of this film that will have the biggest effect on you. Love it or hate it, Lord of War has something to say and in these times it's best to listen to it."

","This is the story of a small-town man bored with his simple life. He decides to sell firearms and begins as a very small criminal and eventually escalates into a worldwide gun-running expert, the man to call if you need guns. But as he does this, he slowly loses all his ethics and eventually loses touch with all reality, all that he is doing. He only concentrates on doing what he is best at: selling guns. This is the powerful message carried behind this film. That this is actually happening.<br/><br/>It begins in a very poignant collage of the life of a bullet, from regular metal made into a bullet, shipped to a country, hauled somewhere else, goes into a gun which shoots someone. Another of the better shots of the movie that conveys the message is the dismantling of an unattended plane when it crashes in the middle of Africa. And, of course, I couldn't go this whole review without mentioning Nicholas Cage. The man is in top form in this movie, pulling off the unattached man with a conscience effortlessly. He really adds so much to this movie; it truly wouldn't be the same without him.<br/><br/>This film uses fantastic acting and a good story to get the message across. The message that people like Cage's character are doing this every day, and that there is really nothing that you can do to stop them. There will always be customers and there will always be people to sell to them, whatever the costs."

This work manages to combine dramatic events and a dark humour, succeeding in making laugh in spite of the seriousness of the subject. Nicholas Cage's acting performance is not as perfect as usually but decent anyway, the script is quite solid and the direction too, that's why the movie gets its message, dealing with ethical matters without ever being heavy.

The question is, how do we arm the other 11?"" The rest of the film is told from the early 80's to the present day. The character played by Cage was an interesting one, as we learn more about his background as an immigrant to ascent as an arms dealer and married man with a child.

"MrChi","7","0","1","30 November 2005"," Hmmm, Adnrew Niccol really has a lot on his mind....
","Nicolas Cage leads as Yuri Orlov, an arms dealer that believes his trade is fair, so to speak, and that he is doing his job, well. Director Andrew Niccol offers another social assessment, this time scraping a little bit more bone.<br/><br/>Niccol tackled social discrimination in the form of genetics in Gattaca, the world's lust for tele-visual junk in The Truman Show and now he resides in the helmer's chair for the Lord of War, a tongue in cheek look at the world's arms trade and the politicians and warlords that pay for Cage's designer lifestyle and maintain his designer wife.<br/><br/>Mr Niccol is a man that has a clear vision. His previous works all engaged the audience with an underdog, someone that society has said has no chance who eventually circumvents the odds and liberates themselves. This film however is a little trickier to decipher.<br/><br/>The opening shot trails across a sea of bullets and lands on Cage, explaining the woeful truth via his jobs description: ""1 out of every twelve people on the planet has a gun, my job is to figure out how to arm the other eleven,"" and then we are taken on a clever life cycle of a bullet from it's birth to it finding it's home - a child's head. Indeed, tongue-in-cheek, indeed the opening sequence is laced with brutal cynicism but is Niccol wagging his finger or trying to provide us with a vehicle where we, the popcorn chewing audience, make our minds up? Both methinks, but the answer is hard to figure out. Possibly due to the subject matter or the reality that there are Yuri Orlovs everywhere, courtesy of none of the characters being romanticised- there are no good guys or bad guys as such.<br/><br/>However, on closer inspection it is clear Niccol wanted to create a pure anti-hero, someone who cares for his family and his wife but has the moral unwavering of a government assassin, which is essentially what Cages' Yuri is. The film works very well as a blasé report of a trade that seems futile to try and stop despite peoples' efforts. One said person is Vitaly (Jared Leto) who's flawed Adonis is present again in this role and is compelling to watch as his morals outweigh his brother's and provides a good contrast. Ethan Hawke, continues to reinforce his Oscar nominated calibre as an Interpol agent constantly outwitted and outranked by Cage and his supporters (i.e. customers)..<br/><br/>This is a good film, that explores subject matter that hasn't really been tackled in this vein. All performances from the lead, Bridget Moynahan as Yuri's wife to Ian Holm's rival arms dealer are concrete.<br/><br/>Andrew Niccol has provided yet another interesting social critique that may hit harder than his others but nevertheless should be appreciated for its audacity if not for its unsettling truths that (maybe) should have been tackled a while ago."

Nicholas Cage is great, if you cast him his part in a movie. If you need a smooth, charismatic, yet somewhat scum-bag of a guy, Cage is your man. His narrative addition, kept you interested in the film.<br/><br/>A lot like the movie ""Blow"", starring Johnny Depp, ""Lord of War"" breaks down the art of dealing arms starting at the first step. One always recognizes that we have gun problems throughout the world, but do they ever stop to think how it becomes a problem. This movie does a great job of accurately portraying how it is done. Anytime I can watch a movie and say ""that is exactly how I would react in that situation"" I find that scene a success. Cage does a great job in portraying reactions of what would really happen being put in certain situations he is put in. The light humor keeps a good rhythm.

"nowonmai42","8","0","3","1 October 2005"," No ""Urban Legends: Bloody Mary,"" but still a good effort
","To note that ""Lord of War"" falls short of its ambitions is less a criticism than an acknowledgment of a good effort. Writer-director Andrew Niccol always has something to say in his films, and here he plays mad scientist, cobbling together bits of ""Goodfellas,"" ""Three Kings,"" ""MASH,"" and a host of other seriocomic socio-political stews to create a lurching, cynical, sometimes frustrating, often sharp portrait of the global arms trade. Niccol's films like to examine the nature of reality, but with ""Lord of War,"" he drops the allegory to poke around the existing world, and those who make it such a violent place.<br/><br/>In the opening credits we follow a bullet from its birth to the death it ultimately causes (this bullet cam recalls, perhaps intentionally, the mischievous police siren from ""The Naked Gun"" movies). We then meet Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage), a Ukranian immigrant who makes a similar journey through the last few decades of global conflict, going from small time gun dealer to the self-proclaimed biggest merchant of death on the planet. Yuri's justification of the immorality of his trade is to practice it entirely amorally, with zero regard for politics, consequences, or loyalties. He explains all this to us in a running voice-over that stretches the entire length of the film, emulating Scorcese's device in ""Goodfellas."" At one point Niccol even throws in a police helicopter to tail Yuri around New York, an unambiguous tip of the cap to the gangster epic that ""Lord of War"" so fawningly emulates.<br/><br/>The film spends considerable time on Yuri's family and personal life, and it's here that it has trouble shifting gears. Though there are some good scenes with Yuri's coke-addicted, deadbeat brother (Jared Leto), these family sequences end up repeating themselves, with Yuri tossing out vague, half-hearted defenses of his trade, though it's clear he doesn't think it requires any. The idea is that a family treated with the same ruthless detachment as the gun running business is destined to be yet one more casualty of that callousness, but ""Lord of War"" gets torn between being a character study and a larger commentary on contemporary geopolitical realities. The film is at its best when following Yuri at work, and his efforts to stay one step ahead of dogged INTERPOL agent Jack Valentino (Ethan Hawke). There's a great, absurdly nihilistic scene in which Yuri, forced by INTERPOL to land a carrier full of guns on a dusty West African road, hops about on the deck, exhorting the locals to take all his cargo ""free of charge,"" then watches over the next several hours as they also take away the plane itself, piece by valuable piece.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage is just right for this material; his matter-of-fact drawl is perfect for explaining why an arms dealer is less dangerous than a car salesman. ""Lord of War"" feels like it has more it could say, though, were it less divided between its personal and professional stories. How can we condemn Yuri, it asks, without condemning the society and politics that produce and depend upon him? It's a shame that this film settles for being intriguing and engaging, when more was within its grasp."

","in most films to involve me much in what he does. That being said, he does a pretty good job here as his all mind no emotion approach to his arms-running ""job"" is right for the central character of this horrifying film subject. It's not often that money over lives is shown so graphically to be of such greater importance to the depraved people doing it that whatever happens to the world as a result means absolutely nothing to them....they would merely say, ""it's a business, like any other."" As with most Nick Cage films it doesn't survive close scrutiny for details and realism, but it is a good non-stop action film about one of the lowest forms of human activity, about one step above or below child porno/sexual slavery. And, neither have any regard for human life.<br/><br/>As most others have detailed the film's plot and, alas, its outcome, most of what is left are the emotions evoked by the film's subject, that of private-business arms-running to wherever in the world there is a bloody ""war"" and big money to be made off of it. The main question is.....It does make obscene money and is grossly immoral, but does anything it does or causes make an ant's toenail difference in the big world picture? Some would say no, others would say it makes every difference. These strong arguments can be made either way, as some might say, ""if I don't do it someone else will, so what?"", and on the other side, ""it just brings us that much closer to the Appocalypse"".<br/><br/>We alive now probably will never know the eventual true cosmic cost of this seemingly heinous activity or whether it has a cost the world truly cares about, but it may suffice to say that violent human behavior through history has been forbidden and/or supported in every human endeavor, including religion past and present. But, who can say with authority that it means much to the world in the long run, or if there will be a long run as a result? Some would say it makes no difference to the world as we are all worm food in the end, and the recycling of our bodily energy is all the world cares about whether it is too early or too late or now or whenever, just so it gets done and allows the earth to go on doing what it does best to survive.<br/><br/>But, it is really aesthetically and spiritually worth living in a world that coldly pragmatic, with no other importance for us than to feed the eternal earth recycle? Most on this earth would say no. Thus enters religion, and the other side of the meaning of life issue for most of us.

There are a couple of sequences with amazingly inventive visual techniques. Production values are elaborate and flawless. It is well paced; never flat for me. Even if you know the full story it is suspenseful, dialogue is witty, some brilliant. This is a subject that has never been dramatized. The finale factoids blew me away. As such The Lord of War can be compared to and said to have as much impact as a Michael Moore film. The films are not comparable in any other way as Moore's film is pseudo documentary while The Lord of War focuses on the entertaining story of family relationships and interplay of interesting actual characters.

","""Lord of War"" is a very black comedy that turns quite serious. It deals effectively with issues that ""The Interpreter"" botched because this uses real place names in real conflicts with no trussed up sympathies for white victims, assisted by vivid location shooting from Brooklyn's Brighton Beach to South Africa.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage is another ""Gordon Gekko"" as a Ukrainian immigrant who finds a knack for using his gifted entrepreneurial skills to achieve the American Dream, but as a quick-witted, film flam gun dealer very like the dapper drug dealer in the comparably stylish ""Layer Cake."" <br/><br/>In an arch narration, Cage's ""Yuri Orlov"" shrugs that his business is no morally different than a tobacco or car salesman. With its eye on international affairs, the film doesn't touch on second amendment issues of the U.S. gun market or on what goes around comes around in terms of terrorism, except that he blithely notes that he didn't sell to Osama bin Laden because his checks bounced. The film is full of dark and absurdist humor, from the opening description of how his family faked being Jews in order to get out of the U.S.S.R. to what happens to an abandoned airplane on the African plain.<br/><br/>Seen through the prism of ""Yuri""s burgeoning career and family, the film is particularly good at tracking the impact of the end of the Cold War and the small conflicts around the world that have emerged as an export business from the resulting surplus ordnance, especially those between various liberation fronts that have found their horrific full flowering in Africa. I think this is the first feature film to show the sickening impact of the boy soldiers and blood diamonds of Sierra Leone, while it is equally filled with grim ironies about African realities and contradictions of living in a daily war zone. <br/><br/>Ethan Hawke, as his ""Inspector Javert"" type nemesis, gets stuck with the clunky idealistic dialog, making obvious what we can already see are the consequences of ""Yuri""s actions, even as we are entertained by his flamboyant, Milo Minderbinder type tricks to outwit the law. The ending is appropriately cynical and probably realistic.<br/><br/>Jared Leto, who is much more than his beautiful blue eyes, again movingly embodies a troubled soul, as in ""Requiem for a Dream."" He and Cage establish a warm chemistry that makes their brotherly trust palpable.<br/><br/>Eamonn Walker of ""Oz"" is not over the top as a corrupt Liberian power monger, given the horrors that have been perpetrated there. Bridget Moynahan gets to poke fun at her own talents, as she plays a model turned wooden actress who is content on her husband's worshipful pedestal until she slowly wakes up from the fantasy. <br/><br/>Writer/director Andrew Niccol's whooshing camera angles get a bit gimmicky as they reinforce ""Yuri""s sales pitches, but they are chilling in showing the enormity of the business and how that volume gets used one on one. It is also a visually exciting way to keep our attention on a serious topic instead of preaching at us, which is reserved for informational text before the credits.<br/><br/>The choice of '80's songs into African and other world music helps to create the appropriate ambiance, though I presume they couldn't get the rights to Dylan's ""Masters of War"" and Warren Zevon's ""Lawyers, Guns and Money."""

","The Spent Shell: <br/><br/>A compelling and thought provoking film, surprisingly different from what one might expect by its name, or from Nicholas Cage. LOW is Cage's best acting in years, a role well suited to him, with a superb supporting cast. More importantly, beyond fine acting, is a movie with a solid core: a strong script, commanding cinematography, and a great story of moral and social significance.<br/><br/>Not reading other reviews or even a storyline, I took a chance on LOW, expecting an action thriller. I was wrong. LOW is based on real life events, and is better painted a docu-drama that contains action and suspense. But its heart is the story, and this is never overshadowed by Hollywood antics. <br/><br/>While it may not sound like your beyond the pale, morally objectionable subject, this eye-opening exposé of the illicit gun running trade makes a personal connection at every level of human life, including yours in the theater seat. Not a moment passes where some deeper conflict is not underway, from personal moral choices to big socio-political issues concerning the greater good of humanity. That's a pretty fat range which could be easily mishandled, but is carried off masterfully in LOW.<br/><br/>After watching LOW I read some IMDb reviews that said, ""preachy"" and ""didn't need to be spelled-out."" I simply disagree. For me these things were delivered comfortably within the context of the movie, mostly as questions juxtaposed by opposing points of view. For me this was helpful, and nothing felt shoveled down my throat. <br/><br/>Woven throughout was the question, ""does a gun runner have any moral obligation or connection to how the guns are ultimately used."" Asked many times, and answered with various layers of rational, it is best handled in a scene between Cage's character ""Uri Orlov"", and his wife, ""Ava Fontaine"" played provocatively by Bridget Moynahan, who says, ""Because it's wrong.""<br/><br/>If anything, I would have liked to see stronger development between Uri and Ava. Not because Moynahan is a classic over-30 beauty, but because the relationship was interesting and had chemistry, and made for an engaging sub-plot. Of course the movie would have been longer. Okay by me. <br/><br/>Note: ""A Bullet's Life"", is the opening introduction to LOW, depicting journey of a bullet from gun powder to its deadly result, and this small gem of a moment could easily stands on its own as a great movie short albeit short even for a short. <br/><br/>In the end LOW definitely passed the Pee test, and is well worth seeing in the theater, or for sure with your undivided attention when it comes out on DVD. And you are asking, ""what is that Pee test."" It's the test for a movie based on a medium Diet-Coke. How long you are willing to hold out, or better said, in?"

And I hate guns, or maybe just the people that he (and real arms dealers) was selling them to. Either way, it was weird, and slightly disturbing, but at the end of the movie I realized that arms dealers, too, have a purpose in life, not just those people that do good. As was said at the end of The Good Son (the book, not the movie), ""Without the darkness there can be no light."" Also, I really enjoyed Nicholas Cage's performance in this one. It's nice to see an actor explore other characters that are different from his usual portrayals. It's like watching Robin Williams in ""Good Will Hunting;"" he wasn't funny, he was real. In ""Lord of War,"" Nick Cage is NOT the good guy, or he guy next door, or the loving older brother.

","This bizarre, troubling, yet excellent movie is about a sociopath masquerading as a legitimate businessman who is so deluded, cynical and out of touch with his own feelings that he is able to effectively rationalize his own criminality without giving it a second thought. Indeed, according to this movie, the way to make a ""fast buck,"" and to marry the woman of your dreams, is not through hard work, or being a law-abiding citizen, but by being a gun runner - and a gun runner who snorts cocaine and flaunts all laws whenever it suits his criminal purposes. But what makes this movie even more chilling is the outstanding performance by Nicolas Cage who aptly portrays a man who on the surface projects an image of civility that belies his sinister activities that promote war. And what is worse, the character works in collusion with government officials of other countries, further underscoring the corruption that marks his nefarious enterprise.<br/><br/>This movie brings to mind the career of Nazi Germany's notorious Foreign Minister and war criminal, Joachim Von Ribbentrop. Like the Nicolas Cage character, Von Ribbentrop was also a warmonger, and also like the Nicolas Cage character, was socially adroit, fluent in several languages, a fancy dresser and had a successful marriage to a beautiful woman and had a nice family. Yet anyone familiar with the history of Nazi Germany knows the havoc Von Ribbentrop caused and how his suaveness was a mere facade for a man who was an irresponsible opportunist who promoted war and recklessly helped lead his country to total destruction. The Nicolas Cage character fits the Von Ribbentrop mold. Joachim Von Ribbentrop was the ""Lord of War"" who engineered the infamous Nazi German-Soviet Union Non-Aggression Pact of August 1939, which is arguably the biggest single example of outright warmongering in history, where two countries, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, connived, in secret, to obliterate a third country, Poland, and then, to the utter amazement and disbelief of the entire world, DID IT, marking the the start of World War Two. So what about making a movie about Joachim Von Ribbentrop? Or what about making a movie about an actual historical case (a pun, get it?) of gun-running, such as, for example, Lend-Lease where the United States, acting as the ""Arsenal for Democracy,"" shipped weapons to the British while ostensibly remaining neutral, or the Soviet Union's amazingly reckless decision to sneak nuclear armed missiles into Cuba, which almost caused a nuclear war? What WERE the Soviet bureaucrats and militarists thinking when they concocted THAT crazy scheme to sneak missiles into Cuba? What WAS that arch-warmonger and real ""Lord of War"" Joachim Von Ribbentrop thinking when he concocted that insane treaty with the Soviet Union which all but guaranteed a war? These might provide interesting material for a movie.<br/><br/>P.S.: That both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union no longer exist is evidence that even in our war-ravaged world, justice occasionally still does prevail."

","I just saw this movie tonite ... 9/16, opening night in my area. And I thought it was just wonderful, from one end to the other. Lots of action, lots of irony, lots of humanity, lots of darkness ... for this is really a ""Neo-Noir"" film. And if you don't like Noir, you might want to pass on this film. But if you *do* like Noir ... I sure do ... this is just a wonderful, wonderful movie.<br/><br/>The plot could be summarized as sort of a ""life and times of an international weapons dealer / gun runner."" If that sounds like it makes for fast-paced action, it definitely does.<br/><br/>The opening scene ... with Nicholas Cage the weapons merchant standing amid thousands and thousands of spent casings littering the ground in a civil war scene ... is gripping. It's also a perfect segue into the opening sequence: tracing a single bullet from manufacture through distribution to deadly use in a street battle. This opening sequence seems to very effectively set the mood and the theme for the entire movie.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage as Yuri Orlov is perfect as the very damaged merchant of death ... cool, cynical, ironic, engaging. This is a type of role that Cage has already given us, very successfully, so many times before, in Snake Eyes, in 8 MM, and more. He brings to this particular role a crisp energy and professionalism that are simply flawless. His ongoing soliloquy-like monologue is classic Noir ... in the very best sense ... and matches the pace of the film perfectly.<br/><br/>Jared Leto as Yuri's brother, Vitaly, is excellent throughout, in a role that doesn't get a lot of screen time, but which involves an amazing series of personas that Leto enacts with a compelling reliability that is entirely credible throughout.<br/><br/>Bridget Moynahan as Ava, Yuri's wife, is very fine in a role that naturally reminds one of The Godfather's wife; but which is fresh and believable at every moment in her rendition of this appealing and tragic character.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke as the Interpol (?) agent turns in a solid performance in a role that had weight throughout although we actually see very little of this character on screen. The final confrontation between him and the Cage character shows Hawke at his best, and is a very convincing foil indeed in this setting.<br/><br/>The remaining cast are quite simply excellent as well, providing a wonderful array of fascinating yet ultimately tragic figures.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent as well, and some of the visual sequences are superb: as in the back-and-forth camera action on Yuri's son and his mother and Yuri's ""base"" hideout. Similar scenes set in Africa are particularly effective as well.<br/><br/>There's an interesting sort of historical device that we saw first in modern times with Forrest Gump. The entire story is stepped through the years from pre-Glasnost to ""today"" with historical allusion after historical allusion. We see depictions of Gorbachev, of Reagan, and of more chronicling the years from the 1980s thru 2001. The scene of Yuri sitting on a fallen statue of Lenin while doing business is one of many that will both please and tug at the heartstrings.<br/><br/>All in all, a fine movie, by a fine cast, with a great action pace, a wonderful plot line, skillfully told story, and an appealing darkness that is truly the best of Noir."
"imdb-4099","8","0","5","17 September 2005"," Engaging movie that manages to make a point as well
","""The Lord of War"" is the story of an arms dealer (Nicholas Cage) from the start of his career up through the time a federal agent begins pursuing him on gun-running charges (Kevin Bacon). The movie kept my attention from the opening credits--a bullet's eye view of the manufacture, transport, and ultimate use of a bullet--through the closing credits. The writers manage to educate the audience quite a bit about the gun trade, while keeping you moving ahead with Cage's increasingly large-scale and dangerous career. While issues of the morality of gun-running (both individual and government-sponsored) get brought up, they're kept second-place to the story. I walked out feeling satisfied with the story, actually thinking a bit about the issues the film brought up. Few movies manage to make a statement and tell an engaging story. This does both."
"gracie28","9","0","6","17 September 2005"," An intelligent action picture with a punch..
","Nicholas Cage has made a mint playing action figure roles and this movie is no exception. Except it has a layer of intelligence beneath the surface that comes back to grab you toward the end. The casting, direction and acting are superb. The shots of a gun-running airliner crash landing on a remote highway somewhere in West Africa are spectacular. The visuals of this movie have an impact and it is not a hollow one. The plot takes some interesting twists and turns. Some sniff at the political aspects of the movie but it really is not about politics. It is about the realities of those who profit from war. As such, ""Blessed are the Peacemakers"" for they will not make money."
"sagentx2005","8","0","5","16 September 2005"," Deeper than one may expect
","I saw LOW today with practically no expectations. I didn't expect to @<br/><br/>see a high tension action flick. I didn't expect a sappy drama tale. I didn't expect to like it as much as I do. This movie is far from the norm. It doesn't deal with international terror like some modern movies do; it tells the story of a man, his life, and his lie. Cage does a more than adaquette job of playing his character well. This is no normal anti-hero movie; this is tale about the soul. I liked it, I found it to be powerful, not a typical movie, but nonetheless one that many should see good movie see it, see it, I'm typing this to meet IMDb's requirements for a movie review"
