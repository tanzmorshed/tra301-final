","Inspired by Frozen I started my search for new Disney movie which will offer me same ""Disney magic"" as i experienced in Lion King, Pocahontas, Bugs life, Frozen etc.<br/><br/>So I found Big hero 6, and the magic started. This movie is made for all ages. What i find very interesting in this new Disney movie is that he is very educational, specially for children, but grown ups will enjoy ether. characterization is very deep , and you will feel as you are one of the characters in this beautiful story. Visual effects are stunning, so u will experience another Disney master piece. <br/><br/>After seeing this movie , I would really recommend it to all movie lovers, especially fans of the Disney cartoon movies. If you are looking for an intelligent and inspiring cartoon movie for your youngest, you can stop looking because you just found it."

","Big Hero 6 is another in a line of many successful Disney animated movies. And rightly so, might I add. The movie is about a boy, Hiro, his friends, Nerds and a health care prototype robot, Baymax. They live in a not so distant, technologically advanced future in a city called San Fransokyo. The story is action-packed comedy with dramatic elements to it and, as such, is appropriate for all ages. If you love Marvel movies, you will most definitely like this one as well. If you are more akin to beautiful landscapes and animated design, then by all means, this is the movie you will want to watch. If you are feeling down, the abundance of comedy, present in this movie is sure to make your day up. There is also a lot to learn from this movie, as some of the most important things (as well as most painful) in our lives, are depicted in this movie. Plus, the movie features one quite notorious figure (without too many spoilers). In short, the movie is a must see for children and for grown-ups as well, if they have a child lurking somewhere within them. Do not make a mistake and pass on a beauty of this movie."

","I went to watch this movie with my son aged 10 and daughter aged 7 - it was my son who was especially keen to see this, and to be honest, I wasn't really expecting much, as I hadn't watched any trailers about it, or heard much about it, & I thought it maybe more a boys' movie and my son would enjoy it more than my daughter or myself... <br/><br/>However... For the entire movie, myself and both of my children were completely immersed in it, and it evoked a range of thoughts, feelings and emotions in all of us, which included laughter and reducing us to tears (and I don't usually cry easily!). We all came out from the cinema each wanting our very own Baymax, and we were talking about and reliving moments from the movie for weeks after! My son who is a huge Marvel fan too spotted and enjoyed that he could make connections with Big Hero 6 to its Marvel origins. <br/><br/>Mine and my children's conclusion... We loved this pretty much the same as we loved Frozen... Another fantastic animated movie from Disney!"

","Hiro is a teen genius who seems to waste his time until his brother sets him on a right track. Tragedy strikes, and Hiro teams up with new friends to find the truth...eventually saving the day.<br/><br/>Baymax is a robotic healthcare assistant that could have been developed as the usual annoying sidekick that has the heart of gold, but he just has a heart of gold here--as in doing research, his only intention is to help whomever he can.<br/><br/>On a scale from 1 to 10, I rate this movie a 9 because its heart and soul outweigh the problems I have with it. Some scenes might be upsetting to younger viewers, but it is perfect for all ages.<br/><br/>My issues:<br/><br/>1. One of the characters sounds stereotypical. 2. The villain's identity and motive feel tacked on.<br/><br/>I know the primary audience is not going to notice things like this, but I do...and I this happens to be one of those times that I cannot let it go."
"nicolechan916","8","37","51","16 January 2015"," A cool story with great animation and voice acting.
","Honestly, I put off watching this because I didn't feel like I would enjoy it so much. I was proved wrong. Right from the start, the fresh animation of this film along with the brilliant editing and voice acting had me engaged. Though the plot is pretty flat and for kids, the concept is pretty new (in that it hasn't been totally overdone), dealing in robotics which allowed them to show some cool stuff. But the story being from Disney, did have moments of it being 'too easy' as well as a few stock characters but it wasn't such a big deal. The story was told well, and wasn't cheesy or boring at all. The freshness of the voices and the animation really put this film together.<br/><br/>The connection between the voices and animation really showed on screen the chemistry between the characters, and this worked to gain the sympathy of the viewer's at certain scenes. I thought that was well done, the characters were developed well in relation to each other. And I know I keep saying this, but I just really like the animation, and the effects. Baymax is so cute, and the other character's have a kind of Asian feel to them. It's also quite cool how the animated characters almost always resemble the actors voicing them (I guess this is intentional).<br/><br/>However, watching the trailer again, I notice that they miss some of the scenes out. I mean if you put it in the trailer, you've got to put it in the film! I would've liked to have seen the scene with Baymax and the soccer ball.<br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"
"castelan-daniel","9","345","549","27 October 2014"," With the Action of Marvel, Emotions of Disney, and Comedy of Both, Big Hero 6 is a fantastic film for anyone.
","Back in 2009, Disney purchased Marvel Comics for four billion dollars. Shocking and surprising the world, many fans of both sides were curious whether Disney would make an animation film based on a group of characters from the comics. Three years later, Director Don Hall approached John Lasseter on making a film with Marvel Characters and found the Big Hero 6, a comic book series that even the most well known of comics didn't know who they were. In fact they were so obscure that Marvel themselves even forgot that they had the characters.<br/><br/>Marvel gave Disney the liberty to change the characters so that they could be seen as a Disney Animation Film. And the result is simply refreshing.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 is a beautiful film, showcasing how much animation has become. The east and west coast mash up of San Fransokyo combines to make such a spectacular scenery, that the city may as well be a character to the film.<br/><br/>The cast is also fun to watch. One annoyance films try to do is by shoving the diversity of characters in your face. Big Hero 6 doesn't do that, instead the focus is on the characters themselves and not the diversity, making it enjoyable to watch. One of the biggest highlights is the girls of the cast. I took my 3 nieces with my friends and I, and they loved how they were smart, enjoyable and didn't need to fall for a man. The cast is truly relatable, whether you are precise like Wasabi, positive like Honey Lemon or just a guy who loves media like Fred.<br/><br/>Of course the star of the film is the robot of Baymax. Any scene that he is in steals the show, whether it is his introduction or his care for Hiro and Company.<br/><br/>The Villain by far is one of the best villains in recent Disney history, he doesn't sing, dance or monologue, he simply gets the job done.<br/><br/>The film showcases the action greatly by giving large scopes and music that fits exceptionally well. Emotionally, the film captures the audience by showcasing the bond of brotherhood between Hiro and his older brother Tadashi, as well as his friend Baymax who is like a Surrogate brother to our main hero.<br/><br/>A strong lesson in this film, is that family can be more than blood related, you have friends, who become part of that. That really showed how much I cared for the loved ones around me, especially my older brother who is in the military, creating robots and fixing medical equipment.<br/><br/>If there was one complaint I would give, I would've like to see a little bit more about the rest of the team. Other than that, Big Hero 6 is a heartwarming tale that captures something for the entire family.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 is another showing that Disney can continue to make great films after the juggernaut that was Frozen. This film showcases that the Disney Revival (Films such as The Princess and the Frog, Tangled, Wreck-it-Ralph and Frozen) is not over yet, and I cannot wait to see what the next film has to offer."

","My family got tickets to an early showing. The movie was excellent. The atmosphere was refreshingly different, the characters fleshed out, the plot touching, and the humor was rich and consistent . I would recommend this one to anyone, and especially to couples and families with children.Big Hero 6 really blew me away, I expected it to be good since Disney is having another animation renaissance but once the credits began to roll all I could do was wish it was longer. This movie has something for everyone, comedy, action, some despair. In fact, surprisingly the only thing missing was romance, which is fine with me. If you love superheroes, robots, and animated films, I think you've found your holy grail."
"Screen_Blitz","10","83","124","25 February 2015"," Beautifully animated and fun filled family adventure
","Disney has brought many gifts and rarely disappoints me. Big Hero 6 is one of the best Disney films I have seen since last year's Frozen. This film is fun, clever, imaginative, and filled with spectacle. While the film is somewhat similar to Pixar's The Incredibules due the film's plot dealing with robots and and children with superpowers, it is very enjoyable and would easy please children as well as parents. <br/><br/>Big Hero 6 is not only brings out the charm with heart-filling characters and comic relief but has some of the most dazzling CGI I have seen in a Disney movie. The animators did a fantastic job on the character models and the environment was nice looking. My favorite character would probably be Baymax. What's not to like about a funny, inflatable robot who cracks funny one-liners,has the power to heal, and assists Hiro (main character) on his quest to defeat an evil scientist? <br/><br/>I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this movie. I recommend this movie to all parents and children. Big Hero is a family thrill ride!!!"
"isaacglover_05","10","262","417","28 December 2014"," Why is this getting so much hate?
","To be honest, when I saw the preview I thought it was going to be another Disney movie gone bad. So when the movies came around, I had really low expectations for it. But holy crap nothing has made me laugh this hard at a movie since maybe Amelie or Up! Baymax is a non-threatening huggable robot who's only purpose is to nurse those who are in need of medical attention. The only way to wake him up is to scream out ""OW"" and he is alive and will help you until you are better. The only way to put him back to sleep is to say ""I'm satisfied with your work"" (Or something like that I'm only paraphrasing) and he has gone back to sleep. But this movie isn't all comedy: it does have a bit of an emotional side to it which I won't go into too much detail about. However I do know that the movie isn't really like the comic books: the back stories of the characters aren't how they are in the movie and even the plot itself isn't like how the movie is, so for the devoted comic book fans, I understand if you hate this movie. However the people who didn't read the comics confuse me when they say it's ""Cliche"" ""awful"" ""boring"". I found none of these things in the movie at all. I was smiling right from the beginning and found myself a little teary-eyed towards the end. <br/><br/>So I do recommend this movie if you're up for a nice light movie with a lot of laughs: it might be better than you think."

","Big Hero 6 [2014] is the Disney 3-D animated comedy action film that centers on Hiro Hamada, a 14-year old robotics prodigy, Baymax (an inflatable health companion robot) and an unlikely team of superheros. <br/><br/>5/5 graphics. Big Hero 6 transports viewers into a new visual realm and relatively individual style (besides its anime resemblance). The story is set in the futuristic city of 'San Fransokyo'. A little of Tokyo and San Francisco in one place. This explains the amalgamation of both Japanese and American components within the story and setting. It should be noted that Big Hero 6 is not a wholly original idea, and the animation is inspired by the Marvel comic by the very same name. <br/><br/>Baymax. Voiced by Scott Adsit, this lovable robot is animated to appear soft, cuddly and adorable, credit goes to the graphics and writing team on this one. Hiro's close friendship with Baymax is a highlight. Baymax can hold his own on the screen alone too, just strolling through the city streets, caring for others health and well-being. So yeah, he's cute and he knows it. <br/><br/>Expect to have a couple of teary moments. I won't describe or skim through details, out of utmost respect for those who haven't had a chance to see it yet. Since more serious topics aren't the usual in children targeted animation films, it's a nice change of pace. <br/><br/>Fantastic message for the young'uns. The main character Hiro (voiced by Ryan Potter) and the rest of the superheros team study robotics at the local university (including T.J. Miller from Silicon Valley and Damon Wayans Jr from New Girl). Reach your potential, practice non-violence and exercise sacrifice. That's just the tip of the iceberg. There are more spoiler-worthy ones that will be omitted from this review entirely. By the way, it's not 'preachy' in the slightest."

","so i originally didn't care for this film. a waster of time, irrelevant to both Disney and marvels big plans. i assumed it would end up like daredevil or black cauldron, best forgotten, bow was i wrong. this film combines the amazing animation, writing and greatness of recent Disney like frozen and tangled, with the great plots of marvel. it nearly had me in tears at times, because there is so much emotion in this film, and had me laughing uncontrollably at others. the group is full of personalities that are lovable and great. baymax is the true highlight of the film, but hiro and tadashi are incredibly stong and great characters. wasabi is always there for the comic relief and gogo is bad-ass. but they all become great as serious characters. and you have to love how honey lemon says ""hiro"" obviously, there are some issues. no film is without sin. it is predictable, cliché and some of fred's lies are just too stupid for words. but they aren't the points that you will remember. this film is definitely worth a watch and i suggest to to EVERYONE"
"jboothmillard","8","59","87","21 February 2015"," Big Hero 6
","This Disney computer animated film was advertised a good few months before the actual release, including cinemas with a large inflatable rubber versions of the recognisable leading robot character, I was very much looking forward to this feature. Basically fourteen year old robotics genius Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) lives in the futuristic city of San Fransokyo and spends his time participating in back-alley robot fights, his older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) worries he's wasting his potential, so he takes him to the robotics lab at his university, there Hiro meets Tadashi's friends GoGo Tomago (Sucker Punch's Jamie Chung), Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.), Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) and Fred (T.J. Miller). Hiro is also introduced to Baymax (Scott Adsit), a personal healthcare robot Tadashi created, amazed, Hiro decides to apply for the school, presenting his project - microbots, swarms of tiny robots that can link together in any arrangement imaginable - to gain admission, school robotics program head Professor Robert Callaghan (James Cromwell) is impressed and Hiro is accepted, but a fire breaks out at the university, Tadashi rushes to rescue Callaghan, but the building explodes and both are killed, Hiro secludes himself from others having lost his brother. One day, Hiro accidentally activates Baymax who responds to his cry of pain, i.e. ""ouch"", the robot notices one of Hiro's microbots moving in its jar and thinks it wants to go somewhere, Hiro and Baymax are led to an abandoned warehouse, there they discover that someone has been mass-producing Hiro's bots, before a masked man controlling them attacks and chases them out. Realising this masked man has stolen his project, Hiro decides to catch him, upgrading Baymax with high-tech armour and a battle chip, and he reunites with GoGo, Wasabi, Honey Lemon and Fred, the six form a superhero team, they are all attacked by the masked man but manage to get away. The group discovers a former lab of prestigious robotics company Krei Tech, it was experimenting teleportation technology, the test went wrong when the test pilot vanished into the unstable vortex, the masked man reveals himself as Profressor Callaghan, he stole Hiro's bots and used them to escape the fire. So Tadashi died in vain, Hiro angrily removes Baymax's healthcare chip, leaving him only the battle chip, and orders him to kill Callaghan, Baymax almost does so, until the healthchip is reinserted by Honey, and he is restored, angry for their interference Hiro leaves his friends and goes home where he breaks down. Baymax asks Hiron if killing Callaghan would improve his ""emotional state"", he is not sure, but to soften Hiro's loss Baymax plays several humorous video clips of Tadashi creating and running tests on him during Baymax's development, Hiro realises killing Callaghan is not what Tadashi would have wanted, so he makes amends with his friends. The group discovers that Callaghan wants revenge on Alistair Krei (Alan Tudyk), president of Krei Tech, because he blames him for the death of his daughter Abigail (Katie Lowes), she was the test pilot, so with newly formed armour and technological advances they team together to save Krei and stop Callaghan. The microbots are destroyed and Krei is saved, but the teleportation portal remains active and is imploding, Baymax detects that Abigail is still alive, trapped in hypersleep, in the abyss, he and Hiro race to save her, but with most of his armour lost Baymax realises the only way to save Hiro and Abigail is to propel them back out the portal with his remaining rocket fist, Hiro refuses to leave him, but Baymax insists and Hiro tearfully gives in, Hiro and Abigail make it back, and Callaghan is arrested. Sometime later Hiro is trying to move on, but he discovers Baymax's clenched rocket fist contains his healthcare chip (this contains his entire personality), delighted he rebuilds Baymax and they happily reunite, and with their four friends they continue helping those in need in the city, as Big Hero 6. Also starring Maya Rudolph as Cass, Abraham Benrubi as General, Billy Bush as Newscaster and Daniel Gerson as Desk Sergeant. The young leading character is a likable and sometimes vulnerable technological genius, his supporting friends all offer their good traits as well, but it is the hero's robot companion that steals the show with his kind and caring personality, and when he gets added extras he becomes much more the fantastic pal to have. This is supposed to be based on a comic book series, it apparently does not have much relation to the original, but that doesn't matter, the whole family will be enthralled by the high-octane fight, flying and chase sequences, as well as the tender moments, the references to western technology and culture is great, and the animation is superb, it is a fabulous animated superhero action comedy film. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film. Very good!"
"TheLittleSongbird","8","68","102","1 March 2015"," Disney continues to impress with Big Hero 6
","Big Hero 6 is not among the best that Disney has ever done and it isn't flawless. But it is still very good and one of their best easily since the Renaissance. It did feel a little rushed at times and felt like it tried to do a little too much in the storytelling, as a result some ideas that were introduced like the science-is-good message gets lost. If it slowed down and explored a little less areas it would have improved things. The villain felt underdeveloped and his reveal came over as very obvious and forced as well.<br/><br/>However, the animation is outstanding with lots of rich colours and textures, backgrounds that are incredibly detailed and sweet(but not in a cloying way) character designs. One of the best-looking recent Disney films definitely. The catchy and upbeat yet atmospheric and emotion-filled soundtrack and smart script are other things to like, as are the brisk(when not rushed) pacing and rousing if not exactly inventive action. While the story is not flawless, on the most part it's still a winner. Whatever originality it may lack, it more than compensates for that with fun and heart. There are plenty of funny moments(i.e. Stan Lee), and of the laugh-out-loud witty kind and even better is the emotional impact Big Hero 6 has. The brother-brother relationship is handled very affectingly, like between Anna and Elsa in Frozen it was Disney trying to explore a different kind of relationship than they did before and it succeeds in that respect.<br/><br/>Sure Big Hero 6 sometimes takes a dark tone but not in a heavy or inappropriate way, there's no reason why anybody should be disturbed by that. The characters are not the most developed ones there ever were and as said more should have been done with the villain, but they're still engaging. Hiro is a very flawed but still likable main protagonist and his relationship between brother Tadashi is beautifully done. The most memorable character for me though was Baymax, he has to be one of Disney's most adorable characters, along with Maximus(Tangled) and Sven(Frozen) he has one of their cutest since the Renaissance. As well as being beautifully designed he displays a lot of laughs and a wide range of emotions, literally the film's heart and soul. The voice work from all(I just wish that James Cromwell had more to do) is very good, with particular mention going to Scott Adsit and his voice is a good match with Ryan Potter's deeply felt Hiro. All in all, not one of Disney's best but one of their better ones of the past 15 years. Haven't seen all the Best Animated Feature nominees but while this viewer did prefer How to Train Your Dragon 2 and the un-nominated Lego Movie they still felt that Big Hero 6 was still a good enough film to merit an Oscar nomination. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

"BillSims28","7","48","70","2 March 2015"," 5-word review: Dazzling, witty, emotional, enjoyably action-packed,
","Thankfully not the sixth film in a sextuplet, Big Hero 6 is the latest visually dazzling Disney film since the studio's resurgence. I was not a fan of Frozen, deeming it inferior to Pixar's elite animation masterpieces, and the feature- length music video to 'Let it Go' was mildly enjoyable at best. However, Big Hero 6 is much more fun, with science prodigy Hiro Hamada (voiced by Ryan Potter) forming a bond with his brother's home-made ""huggable"" robot invention Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit) and subsequently creating a team of superheroes to combat a masked villain with a nefarious motive (it's way better than I just made it sound.)<br/><br/>The best part about Big Hero 6 is undoubtedly one of 2014's cutest characters. An ever so slightly more health conscious Groot, Baymax, your personal health care companion, is the film's highlight. He and Hiro provide both a surprising amount of emotional depth and superb action sequences which most definitely reflect the story's connection with Marvel. The supreme quality of the animation makes the action and flying scenes through the excellently-designed 'San Fransokyo' city skyline visibly awesome, cueing an unfortunately audible Neo-worthy ""Woah"" from me several times. The soundtrack is also highly recommended.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 isn't without its faults though. By all means don't lose faith if you need to see it with an offspring or younger sibling; it's certainly an enjoyable time. But it is not as re-watchable or fantastic as a Pixar offering or Disney Renaissance film. This is mainly due to the poorly fleshed out characters, with the exception of the two leads - the supporting characters who form the superhero team are decently done but disappear for a while before being re-introduced. Maybe I've become spoiled by Pixar over the last few years and am expecting too much from a kid's film. Probably. But make sure to see it anyway, and treat it like a Marvel film (which really it is) by watching out for the Stan Lee cameo and staying for the post-credits scene."

I instantly fell in love with Baymax. He's huggable and simply adorable. Along with that, he's a HEALTHCARE companion!

There. he meets people like Wasabi, Fred, Go-Go, and more. <br/><br/>This movie also played with your emotions. And no, not just a little bit, but a lot. Disney seriously did a good job doing that. This movie was one of those that actually almost made me cry. Near the end, Baymax had supposedly ""died"" and that made me very emotional. I was so happy that at the end, Hiro managed to make another Baymax using the chip the original Baymax had left behind. <br/><br/>All I have to say is that this movie is definitely one worth watching, especially if you like humorous animated films."

"Theraxorterminate","10","65","98","15 March 2015"," A genuine and perspective review (from someone who have seen the movie)
","(Warning there might be some brief spoilers and please READ before rating!)<br/><br/>For a long time IMDb has been my help for not only watching many movies but also helping me to be aware what movie's are great or awful. But now I think I'm almost starting to lose my respect for this site when a movie like Big Hero 6 is being wrongfully bashed for being clichéd or unoriginal and many other things. To be honest everyone, Big Hero 6 is getting too much undeserved hatred. Why are there so many people who are so against this movie in the first place? <br/><br/>Now don't get me even started with that ""it's a kids movie"" crap, I'm a 20 year old boy who loves Animated movies as well enjoys live-action movies but I have realized one thing that I think everyone should learn is that: Just because it's an animated flick it doesn't have to be a true kids thing. I don't care if this is a Disney movie, most of them are great and well- crafted but as well there have been some less better movies lately like ""Brave"" and ""Frozen"" (please I don't want to offend anyone I just didn't enjoy them very well for various reasons).<br/><br/>What I have also learned is that there are two kinds of experience when people watch movies; one are those who enjoys them through the whole of their length and the second are those who analyzes them. I usually don't analyze movies but lately it has been useful for me to experience them but I do enjoy them as well depending my interests and vision. I know when a movie is good or awful but a movie like Big Hero 6 just doesn't deserve the hatred it is getting and having seen the movie twice I really can't find and see what's to wrong with it.<br/><br/>People were arguing that ""Brave"" didn't deliver a prominent story being based on its title, and people were arguing to ""Frozen"" for the bad moralities it delivered (I admit that some of the morals they showed indeed left me questionable). Did I feel the same with BH6? No not at all. I wasn't just looking for a movie with beautiful animation and some nice humor, I looked for and were hoping for a movie with better morals and I can assure that you will get those in this movie.<br/><br/>Stop thinking that this will be a movie that the kids will find it awesome like a ""Ben 10"" show-off with no story. This neither was a brain-dead movie like a Michael Bay film and neither was it only made for the kiddies, when I was in the theater not only did the children enjoy it but the whole theater with the adults cheered and were happy that it touched them and realizing that the movie worked without being a commercial of something.<br/><br/>The movie worked fine and yet being based on the comic book and it's ""obvious"" changes it didn't look something that looked ""childish"" or ""unbearable"". The main character and it's adventure did remind me why I loved the first Spider-Man movie from 2002. I know that many people said that the movie was too fast or really fast-paced that you don't get to learn it's supporting characters. OK while I can agree that the movie was pretty fast-paced but I got to learn the ""supporting characters"" without any problems, they're not one-dimensional trust me even though we get to learn more about Fred which in my opinion was a very nice character which indeed left me surprised for who he really was. <br/><br/>As for the main villain, I didn't mind if it would have been an important or a special character from the movie but I was hoping to know if it were a true villain for a ""good"" reason. Be honest you don't like it when a certain villain is a villain for no reason. And it's main reason for me looked alright I wasn't unimpressed or flabbergasted at all. Really Yokai was a much better villain than ""Hans"" from ""Frozen"".<br/><br/>Anyways I found BH6 to have the things that kept me enjoyed, good morals, characters that learn and evolves from their flaws, a cute robot like Baymax (who wouldn't like to have a robot like him?), nice humor without being too crude or inappropriate, pretty nice soundtrack, a gorgeous unexpected moment and most importantly; Heart and I do mean it this time. I don't care if a 10 sounds ludicrous, I gave it a 10 because I was so pleased that Disney finally could capture their essence not only what they were made for, but a movie that finally delivers more desirable morals than what both ""Brave"" and ""Frozen"" didn't deliver.<br/><br/>So really ignore the poor and negative reviews out there, there not making any justice to this movie. This movie is much better than what you might think it is and stop thinking it like it's meant to be for the children's entertainment where no older people than them can enjoy. Give this a chance especially if you're looking for a better animated film than the last 2 Oscar winners we recently had. And if you ever or somebody you know need a movie that delivers the good morals, this movie will always be there for you."
"ovkil","9","37","53","11 February 2015"," All in all, the movie satisfies the goals of a being an AWESOME animation!
","Firstly I must mention that it's been three days since I've watched it for the first time and since then 6 times I watched it entirely.<br/><br/>I'm 29 and I've watched every animation movie at top ranks and bottom and I think it's safe to say that Big Hero 6 is one of the most entertaining, emotional and inspirational animation movie I've watched my entire life. And I'll prove that to you.<br/><br/>An animation is made out of imagination and through that, it is made for us to think that our lives and living boundaries has no longer exist as if we are living in a dream world.<br/><br/>So, about this movie, the creators showed us the importance of family care and family values, technological care and use of different perspectives as if it's good or evil or both(in this case), friends that takes care of friends when they are in need and few mysteries behind the curtain. Although there is slightly obviousness about the plot, but Big Hero 6 was worth to watch it again and again just to feel those emotions. Once you realize, you are connected to the brain of Hiro(main character) and feel the accomplishments as if they are yours and losses, as if they are yours.<br/><br/>Some of the reviewers are so much unfortunate that they compare this movie to non-animation movies or comic books. I even have read a few critics about the title.<br/><br/>Moreover, some reviewers were so lazy to watch it twice or third, they have reached a conclusion that the villain has created the fire. There is not a clue of that. Watch it again!<br/><br/>Grow up people and see the things as they are!<br/><br/>And Lastly, for those who knows nothing about the process of creation; research and realize the effort to make a good animation movie. Maybe then you will write something useful.<br/><br/>Well done Big Hero 6!!!<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to kids, adults and technology enthusiasts."

","I can't say that I'm really a fan of the source material for this movie but the animated product that Disney Studios made from it I can honestly say that I am a big fan of! <br/><br/>After numerous (and, in my opinion, warranted) changes to the ""Big Hero 6"" superhero team from the comics, Disney Studios created a superhero origin story that never felt like all the other superhero origin stories and contained a story that had a lot of heart, tons of exciting action, and lots of ridiculously funny moments. Additionally, the film had a slew of interesting and diverse characters and all of them were performed amazingly well by a cast of very talented actors. Disney also proved that it is very possible to create a legitimately entertaining comic book film in your usual Disney 3D animation style and not make it feel like it was doing a disservice to the world of comic books.<br/><br/>I don't have a single complaint about ""Big Hero 6"" and it easily sits right next to some of the other great Marvel films out there (even thought it isn't actually a part of the MCU). In my opinion, this film is just as entertaining as ""The Avengers"" or ""Iron Man"" or ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" Just a great, great movieand Baymax is flippin' adorable! <br/><br/>Hi!

","I have seen this animated film a number of times now, and have not grown to become sick of it. I love the plot, the characters (especially my favorite, GoGo) and am so thrilled that this film won an Oscar for Best Animated Film 2015. The only downside is that my favorite male character, Tadashi, dies, but I understand why the writers included this in the plot, for it had a huge impact on the film and brought great reflection to - especially - Hiro Hamada. The idea that the overall 'hero' is a non-threatening vinyl 'marshmallow' brings further interest to the film, for he ends up saving just about all of the protagonists lives, not to mention he is a very appropriate character for all audiences, as well is the film entirely. All in all, I rated this film 10 out of 10 stars for its excellence, in my opinion, and look forward to any future works that will come out of this film!"

The jokes are adorable, with a lot of hilarious scenes with Baymax(the whole theater erupted with laughter whenever the fist bump part came on) and plenty of clever dialogue from the other characters. The animation is very colorful and lifelike, with realistic character animation and unique action scenes and backgrounds. The film is not without its heart, as the charm of Baymax and the surprises will hit the mark in the soul.

But I didn't expect greatness. Disney certainly did a amazing job combining what we love about Disney with what we love about action movies. A-freakin-mazing!<br/><br/>The characters were nice and goofy, the aunt was adorable. <br/><br/>The only bad thing was the usual ""kill of a loved one"". Did not appreciate that. To be honest, I don't understand why Disney loves killing of characters in so many movies. And in this one the brothers had already lost their parents and then Hiro loses another member of the family.. Just makes me a little frustrated that's all. <br/><br/>But that is the only negative thing I can think of right now.

","3 February 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Big Hero 6. With an Executive Producer like John Lasseter, whose name can be found on most of the well known animated films from, Toy Story, and Cars to the mighty success that is Frozen, you just know this is going to be another great. Great it was. These days it seems if you can find a good story you can make an amazing animation. Set in the futuristic yet oddly homely city of San Frantokyo, this is the story of Hiro, a brilliant 14 year old who is devastated after the death of his brother. Together with Baymax a health robot created by his brother, Hiro discovers dark deeds afoot and he uses his exceptional mind and some good friends to help save the day. The modern animation never ceases to amaze me how it can stir as much emotion as an live action feature. Take the opening 15 minutes of Up for example, if that doesn't make you reach for a hanky then there is no heart in you. This film is the same, you feel sorrow and it makes you laugh. I was advised to sit through the credits until the very end to see an extra, and in doing so I learned a flew things.....the amount of people needed to produce an animation is just as many as a live film, there is even an animator in charge of crowd scenes, and the sound was managed by Skywalker Sound out of Marin County California. Oh and the extra I was telling you about......let's just say......roll on the sequel."

","Big Hero 6 is awesome! One of the best Disney movies I've seen. This movie is less cliché than the other movies which is a good thing because we are able to see something new. The story was well written and the characters were introduced properly. <br/><br/>Things happen in an unexpected way. Same goes for this movie because it's unpredictable and I like it that way. Another thing I like in this movie is that it can mix our emotions. There are scenes that are fun, also there are sad scenes. I thought Baymax was really going to be stuck inside the portal but later on we learn that his ""memory card"" is on Baymax's rocket arm. That scene made me happy at the end of the movie. And also, the funniest scene is the end credits scene where Fred sees his dad which surprisingly, is Stan Lee. Not only it had a good ending but it also had a funny end credits scene. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Big Hero 6 is an awesome movie. It satisfied me. Safe to say it is a child friendly movie (because it's Disney)."
"InMyHonestOpinion","8","42","61","24 January 2015"," Who wouldn't want the ultimate best friend?
","I have always loved animated films, whether they be by Walt Disney, DreamWorks, Marvel, Miyazaki or any other storytellers out there, but of late I haven't enjoyed the anime style and artwork that has been delivered. Personally I thought Frozen was so over rated, sure there was a couple of good tunes, cool, characters, interesting storyline, but it lacked that special something Mr. Disney and his crew always managed in years gone by to bring out in me. Don't get me wrong I do really like frozen but nowhere near as much as I am supposed to according to everyone else on the planet. I'm not sure what it is that I love about animated films or where the love developed from but I find myself far more attracted to them in my later years than I ever did in my earlier life. So when I heard about Big Hero 6 and the fact that both Disney and Marvel were collaborating together I pretty much had instant tingles, my expectations without seeing a single thing went higher than any film I have anticipated before. What the hell was Big Hero 6 and why hadn't I heard of it up until now?!? Why did I ever stop reading the comics!?!?<br/><br/>Hiro Hamada is a young 14 year old boy genius who knows how to make things work, he loves his gadgets and robots. Hiro lives in the futuristic city of San Fransokyo with his brother Tadashi and his aunt who has taken the boys in after the loss of their parents when Hiro was three years old. Hiro spends most of his days creating and then destroying robots in underground robot battles for cash, the robots he creates devastate the competition without any mercy. After being arrested for attending one of these illegal battles Tadashi on the promise of taking Hiro to another back alley for another fight detours to his university where Hiro discovers that the genius gene doesn't fall far from the tree at all. Tadeshi introduces Hiro to his five Uni friends who each are working on their own scientific breakthroughs. Wasabi, Go Go, Honey Lemon, and Fred. Tadeshi then shows Hiro his latest work, a personal walking talking health specialist named Baymax who can cure all with his sweet soft tones and loving temperament. Hiro instantly loves what he sees within the university and decides he must attend. To get into the university the heads of the campus hold a special talent show where potential applicants can show their work and hopefully the university board are convinced enough to sign up the entrants giving them a scholarship to attend. Hiro creates a way to revolutionise life as we know it and wins his way into the university to the joy of everyone. While celebrating and getting ready to leave a tragedy strikes the university and Hiro loses far more than his exciting new project. With the help of his new five friends from the Uni Hiro reinvents Baymax and together the team of 6 become heroes ready to find the truth to what really happened<br/><br/>I thought this film had it all, I loved it from its beginning to its after credits surprise. I laughed pretty much all the way though, Baymax really grabs hold of you by your heart strings, you can't help but fall in absolute love with him. The way the animators make him move and react is adorable and will definitely keep you smiling throughout. The animation is outstanding and deserves so much applause, everything from the 3D art work to the colour to the rendering is perfect, there is nothing to pick at here in the way the film is made. The voice acting isn't any different either, the directors Don Hall and Chris Williams have chosen an amazing cast and all do a fantastic job for their individual characters as well as their group dynamics, with a couple of recognizable voices amongst the fray as well you will totally love everyone. Staring the voice talents of Scott Adsit as Baymax, Ryan Potter as Hiro, Daniel Henney as Tadashi, T.J. Miller as Fred, Jamie Chung as Go, Damon Wayans Jr. as Wasabi, Genesis Rodriguez as Honey Lemon, James Cromwell as Robert Callaghan and Alan Tudyk as Alistair Krei. It's a film that really surpassed all my expectations and hopefully will do the same for you. If I had to pick on one thing the story was a little weak and predictable but not enough to concern anyone, you will still thoroughly enjoy every second of Big Hero 6.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 is a compassionate feel good loving caring and fun time adventure you're entire family will love. Get your popcorn ready and fall in love with Baymax."

"Robovikso","10","66","100","28 March 2015"," Don't believe the negativity.
","I refuse to believe that this is an awful movie that users around here with such abysmal ratings and thoughts wants you to believe it is. If you happen to read those reviews you'll find that they are only perturbed that the movie and it's story is predictable, filled with clichés, fast paced or being an idiotic film or the fact that they still don't like the idea that Marvel is being owned by the Disney Company and it's certain characters have received some brief changes.<br/><br/>I'm really starting to think that those users didn't take the movie seriously, just because a certain movie happens to be a ""Disney"" movie it does not mean that every movie from them should be the considered for doing the same typical actions. Big Hero 6 delivers more than just of those prejudices for what Disney is famous for.<br/><br/>If you really want to know how the movie was, let me ""just a little bit"" tell my experience with it. First of all the beginning of movie worked fine, it showed a good-spirited brotherhood with Tadashi for caring his little brother Hiro and giving him his thoughts of what he really should do with this gift.<br/><br/>Hiro as the main character reminded me a lot of Peter Parker/Spider-Man, sure just like him Hiro was a flawed character but in the movie it showed him how he shouldn't be squandering his gifts as well. I didn't find him bratty or annoying, you will find that deeply inside of him he's a good person despite being a little shy to show it.<br/><br/>The supporting characters are not ghosts or unnecessary filler they are indeed one of the important keys to this movie and its title. We do get to learn them well enough. What's wrong with a movie that happens to be a little fast paced? Fast paced movies can be entertaining too guys, remember Inception? But unlike that movie I got to learn the supporting characters well and they're likable as well with their own personalities. Just to inform it wasn't that extremely fast to follow.<br/><br/>What about Baymax? He is in my personal opinion one of the best robots in movies I have seen. I was glad to see him being both likable and smart at the same time. I had so much fun to see him learning about the humanity from both Hiro and his friends especially the Fist-Bump scenes.<br/><br/>Of course this movie was based upon the Comic books but I don't really understand why some people think that it's title should have been changed just because it didn't become the movie they expected. Look the movie is about how the team got created in the first place while showing a good story and reason to their build up. I strongly disagree that it should have been called Big Hero 1 or 2 no, no, no you must be kidding here :P.<br/><br/>But most importantly I'm happy to see that Big Hero 6 managed to deliver good moralities. I haven't seen a Disney movie having so many good thoughts since ""Wreck-It Ralph"". I dare to say that this movie surpasses my disappointment from ""Frozen"". This is not an idiotic film, there's plenty of both the entertainment and good moralities that I don't think I've seen from other previous Disney movies. Like (just an example): be careful for someone you don't know or trust yet. See?<br/><br/>And another thing, ignore those who says its a kids flick and that stupid prejudice about ""animated films are for kids only"". No! Everyone no matter the age should see this. I wasn't angry at all to find out that it won its Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film and I'm happy that finally a movie with such good-spirited presentation got what it deserved."

I can't understand why people hate this much, this is a movie for kids!!! I am tired of all this comments ""was cliché, was predictable, was stupid.."" It is made for all ages, God. Is it too hard to understand? And please, stop comparing movies, for lord Jesus. Baymax is one of those characters who can basically do no wrong. Every sequence he's part of is automatically funnier just because he's on screen. A big, gorgeous, consistently funny and touching animated adventure. And what i love the most about it was that it celebrates nerd culture. And not merely the pop-culture- obsessed version (comic books) but the let's-invent- something-cool kind. To me, this kind of films makes me want to work in this business of creation and entertaining, highlighting universal values and dreams. Personally I have to say that this is very inspiring and motivating, it reminds me a lot of my little brother who is a genius tech lover I am separated from him but watching this, kind of make me feel him closer. Now I am feeling better after watching this movie. It just worth it, and I give a 10 to 10, it is going straight forward to my top 10 of my Disney favorites movies of all the time. Thanks again Disney, you made it again! <3"

","When I first heard Disney was doing a movie about giant robots, I was skeptical. I thought it would be just like Transformers or all the other giant robot movies.<br/><br/>Boy, was I mistaken.<br/><br/>It's not traditional Disney--there's no romance, princesses, or blockbuster songs--but it's actually better without those things.<br/><br/>Baymax has to be one of the best Disney characters I've seen. For a robot, he's quite the personality, rivaling even WALL-E in that regard. Unlike Olaf from Frozen, Baymax doesn't exist solely for comic relief--he plays a major dramatic role in the movie as well.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast shines and each member is given memorable lines.<br/><br/>If I had a drawback, I would say it's the soundtrack. However, Frozen's was a tough act to follow.<br/><br/>But Big Hero 6 has it where it matters most--heart. I guarantee that you will want your own Baymax by the end of this movie!"
"ddangtruong23","8","50","74","7 February 2015"," Very entertaining and overall well-made
","Honestly, I didn't have very high expectations for 'Big Hero 6', considering that I'm usually not a fan of Marvel's works, but I was gladly proved wrong.<br/><br/>Story wise, 'Big Hero 6' is rather formulaic and not too outstanding, but it's still very entertaining due to the way it balances all aspects. You have everything: drama that's not over the top but still touching, thrilling action, great comedy, and some okay twists. And more importantly, they all mix together perfectly, so you'll never get bored or frustrated, and at the same time, you will feel connected with the characters as they deal with some mature conflicts rarely seen in recent Disney products. A huge part of this accomplishment is thanks to the character Baymax. The guy is amazingly likable, steals every scene he's in, and has great contributions to every part of the movie. When the movie needs drama, he provides the sensitivity and cuteness, when it needs action, he's the coolest, and when it needs comedy, he's the funniest. His voice acting by Scott Adsit is also great as he sounds both emotional and cute, despite the robotic voice effects.<br/><br/>The rest of the characters, however, are hit and miss. Hiro is cool, and I like the way he deals with grief: quite mature and not excessive, though his voice doesn't sound like a 14-year-old. The other two boys in the group are okay because they tend to break away from stereotypes. But the others, including the main villains, are just cliché and forgettable.<br/><br/>Visually, 'Big Hero 6' is very stunning, mainly due to the lively San Fransokyo and the impressive effects. Personally, I find some of the action scenes in this to be the most cinematic and thrilling I've ever seen in animation. All of the camera movements, slow-motions, and lighting and explosion effects easily rival the best live-action blockbusters out there. Moreover, the characters' visual designs are also more imaginative than other recent Disney products'. This is especially true for Baymax, who is surprisingly expressive despite the minimalistic looks. <br/><br/>'Big Hero 6' is no masterpiece, and it may not be up to the standards of Pixar's classics or Dreamworks' 'How to Train Your Dragon', but nonetheless, it's still a greatly entertaining and well-made movie. I also love that it still leaves a lot open for the sequels as I now really look forward to them."
"raoull-209-283714","10","50","74","10 January 2015"," Probably one of the best animation movies I've seen
","This is probably one of the best animation movies I've watched in the last 10-15 years, believe me, I've watched almost every animation in that time period. I love how the friends of the brother of Hiro fit in together, so you can definitely find yourself back in one of those, or in the main character or Baymex. I love how Baymex brings humor and feels in the movie on the right moments so you can cry like a little baby or laugh your ass off, even if you don't want too. I also find it awesome that there is a bad guy in this movie that you can extremely sympathize with, which makes it more relaxing and exciting to watch. And further, I like the graphics very much, the story line is well played out (build up to the bad guy, escape too poor guys villa, change of heart and a happy ending).

"luckycool_gr8","8","35","50","1 March 2015"," Real treat for kids!!!!
","One of the best animation movies in the past couple of years. Gets hold of its audience right from the beginning and doesn't lose grip until the credits. Charged with grandeur of animation, once you begin to watch the movie, neither the popcorn, the soda nor the people around can make you take your eyes off the screen. It's a real ride!! The fast paced screenplay and a very well written script around robotics keep your heels dug. May not be as good a treat for adults but will not be reprimanded by them either. For kids, it's got everything to keep them bubbling throughout the movie. From its characters to the well executed action sequences to its superb background score the movie is a delight to watch. All the ingredients of a ""BOX OFFICE HIT"" animation movie are pretty palpable. The ever evolving protagonist of the movie Baymax who senses pain around and activates, determined to go beyond limits to treat its patients (Hiro most of the times,) receives blows, puts itself through any challenge and rises again. Though just a robot that's programmed this way, the portrayal of its character is what makes Baymax the real Hero of this story. Nice job by Disney again. I hope the Disney announces the sequel soon."
"Quinoa1984","7","58","87","4 April 2015"," a solid Disney-Marvel-Anime hybrid, if less than masterful
","Big Hero 6 provides what you'd want in a movie as a kid, and maybe as an adult depending on how in touch you are with your inner-kid. Especially if you have a sibling (brother more specifically) the film's core relationship between Hiro and his older brother - it's not something that we see throughout, due to the first major turning point in the film, but the memory certainly remains strong - it will resonate. But the movie is only intermittently interested in pulling at your heartstrings; it's ultimately about suiting up, getting on the gadgets, and putting together a team. So the film is a lot of things in one - not to mention having an instantly adorable (i.e. lucrative) mascot at the center with Baymax.<br/><br/>By saying that it has ""what you'd want"" in a movie, I don't just mean super-heroes in the Marvel tradition (though it doesn't have the Marvel banner, this is based on a Marvel title, albeit an obscure-ish one), but anime as well. Many of the story turns, including the ones that are rather startling and the tonal shifts from lightness to tragedy and then swiftly back to lightness and action and thrills, it's like what I might expect to see from Japan directly. Which, of course, is part of the source itself, and the fact that the city is called 'San-FrancTokyo' (ho-ho) and the film has primarily Asian characters - whether they're all played by Asians is another story, but I digress.<br/><br/>I can't be too hard on a film that is just out to sheerlessly entertain the audience like this. It does have some points on the nature of grief and what happens when people are faced with losing someone who can't come back (... or can they?) I think it could've been even better, possibly great, if it had a bit of a better balance on the dark and the light sides of the film. Ultimately, I felt, the tragic parts came when they had to, and outside of that Big Hero 6 is essentially a Fun Ride Of A Movie (in caps), primarily led by a Doctor-cum-Fighting robot in Baymax, and some other supporting characters who are fine, no more no less. Just fine.<br/><br/>But maybe Baymax is enough, and certainly, more often than not, this is a very funny movie. He has the entertainment value of the Genie in Aladdin - like in that film, he's the friendly BIG companion who can help save the day for the protagonist - except instead of the thousands of impressions of Williams, it's the exact opposite that makes him appealing: one personality, pretty straightforward, and the dead-pan nature is closer to, oh I don't know, Jeff Bridges in Starman. He's the perfect innocuous character, but is hilarious for the reasons of reaction and straight silliness.<br/><br/>It should also be noted the last act, the climax, has its predictable points - like most (or almost all) superhero movies, i.e. from Marvel, it has to all build up to a gigantic Must-Save-the-City from impending gargantuan destruction, involving space as well. And a turn from a character kind of comes out of nowhere, which is fine except that the development is kind of off to suddenly be the ""villain"". However, again, akin to anime, so I can let it slide and still be sucked into the peril of the thing (I mean, hey, they can't all be The Incredibles).<br/><br/>For what it's worth though, there's so much to enjoy with this film that I'm sure if I was younger I'd eat it up with a spoon and want seconds-thirds-fourths-etc. It's an insatiably pleasant film to experience, faults and all. 7.5/10"

My favorite character is Hiro, its not just because he is smart and nerdy, but the guy who plays him (Ryan Potter) is really cute. If there is a next movie I think that, Hiro should fall in love and somebody kidnaps Baymax to make it more interesting. Big Hero 6 is amazing and I can't wait for the sequel."

","This is a feature based on a Marvel comic book and produced by Walt Disney Animation. There will be spoilers ahead:<br/><br/>The descriptives for this film are legion. It's exciting, funny, poignant, sweet, charming, breathtaking and delightful. I had some doubts when I first heard about this movie. I thought it looked iffy. I was happily wrong.<br/><br/>There are two brothers, living with their aunt, both technical wizards, the younger one (named Hiro) a 13 year old, super smart but at loose ends taking part in robot fights and getting in some tight spots. His brother Tadashi, wanting his brother to have some direction, tricks him by taking him to his school and getting him interested in getting into the same place.<br/><br/>This introduces most of the other characters into the film, including Tadashi's friends, all of them technical wizards as well-Go Go, Wasabi, Honey Lemon and Fred-as well as a tech legend, Robert Callaghan and the most important and enjoyable character in the film, Baymax, who is Tadashi's big project, a medical diagnostic tool which is very empathic, capable and childlike.<br/><br/>Hiro has to enter a competition to get in and comes up with a micro-bot which has enormous flexibility and range. It's an incredibly impressive thing, attracting both the attention of an industrialist named Krei and an acceptance letter from Callaghan. Hiro takes the letter and rejects the financial arrangement from Krei.<br/><br/>Tragedy strikes and throws Hiro into a tailspin until two things happen: he re-encounters Baymax and finds out someone is using his micro-bot technology, which he thought was destroyed. This is where the film starts taking off. Hiro puts some additional coding on another chip into Baymax, adding more skills and making him more than just a medical diagnostic machine. The four introduced earlier form a superhero team with Hiro and Baymax, which ties back into the title.<br/><br/>The film is at times reminiscent of the film The Avengers, which isn't surprising, given the source material for the film. The visuals here are great, particularly the look of San Fransokyo, the city this is set in. It's breathtaking.<br/><br/>I really don't want to go into much more on the last part of the film, so I just have two observations left. One, I fully expect there will be at least one sequel coming in the next few years and, two, when you watch this, watch all the way to the end of the film, end credits and all. It's most definitely worth the time. The art under the credits is excellent and there's something nice at the end.<br/><br/>This film is out on Blu Ray and DVD and is well worth watching on Blu Ray if you have that capability. Most highly recommended."

"abhirockin912","7","33","47","7 February 2015"," A must watch for Marvel fans
","So basically, it's a movie which is inspired from the Marvel's comic book with the same title. Removing the serious parts from the comic book, Big Hero 6 by Walt Disney is a bliss for those who ended up loving similar movies, for example, Kung Fu Panda, The Incredibles etc. They have changed the story a lot which makes it way too different than the comic.<br/><br/>Other than that, what I loved about the movie is how, throughout the movie, Hiro, the protagonist learns of responsibilities and to come over his pain.<br/><br/>They have done a great job on Baymax, who, in the comic was a ""monster"" (seriously)? At some point, the movie seems like it is lacking the fun but that's just for 10-20 minutes and I am very sure of the fact that most of the viewers will end up loving Baymax for his behavior and way of speaking.<br/><br/>This is not some another movie like Planes but a whole new experience from Disney which blends comedy and action nicely along with a sense of responsibility."
"CleveMan66","9","26","36","8 March 2015"," ""Big Hero 6"" is a bigger deal than you might think.
","What IS ""Big Hero 6"" anyway? Yeah, I know that it's an animated film from Disney and it was the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' choice for Best Animated Feature of 2014, but what does ""Big Hero 6"" MEAN? To what does it refer? I didn't know until I saw the movie – and read up on the film and its background (my usual post-viewing and pre-review writing research) and now I understand. But there's more at stake here for the movie than whether its title confused a formerly ignorant movie fan or two. This film has to live up to its Oscar win! Does the movie deserve the award? Does the basis for the title become clear during the film? Does this reviewer ever tell the readers about the movie? Read on and find out! Does ""Big Hero 6"" refer to the giant marshmallow-looking robot that is featured on the movie poster and in its theatrical trailers? No, it doesn't.<br/><br/>That robot is called Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit) and is the creation of a very talented college student inventor named Tadashi (Daniel Henney). Tadashi created Baymax as a health care provider. Baymax can assess your physical and emotional health in an instant with a pain-free body scan and give you the help you need. And Tadashi designed Baymax's look to make him more effective, or, as Tadashi puts it, ""non-threatening and huggable"".<br/><br/>So is ""Big Hero 6"" a reference to the President's Affordable Care Act?? No.<br/><br/>Baymax is completely apolitical – and he actually works. Besides, he doesn't go away until he hears you say, ""I am satisfied with my care."" How many people have said that about Obamacare? But that's how 14-year-old Hiro (Ryan Potter) meets Baymax. Tadashi takes his brother Hiro to his college's inventors' lab in hopes of inspiring the brilliant and precocious (very) early high school graduate to actually do something with that big brain of his. It works. Hiro is impressed enough with what he sees at San Fransokyo Tech Institute that he decides he has to become a student there. (San Fransokyo is the futuristic mash-up of San Francisco and Tokyo that serves as the fictional setting for the story.) So, Hiro sets out to invent something in order to impress Tadashi's professor, Robert Callaghan (James Cromwell), enough to gain Hiro admittance to the program. That works too.<br/><br/>Is ""Big Hero 6"" somehow a reference to Hiro??? Nobut you're getting warmer.<br/><br/>Hiro's invention is a revolutionary new tiny robot, or microbot. It's smaller than some computer thumb drives, but when it gets together with a bunch (a BIG bunch) of others like it, and their efforts are directed by the thoughts of a human wearing a neurotransmitter headband, their potential is practically limitless. As an interconnected group, they can form shapes, lift and move heavy objects and even transport people across the room or across town. A fire at the lab later that night consumes more than just the lab, and Hiro's dreams and motivation seem destroyed too. Eventually he learns that there was more to that fire than he realized and he builds some carbon fiber armor for Baymax in the hopes that the two of them can get to the bottom of what happened and try to put things right. But it's too big a job for just the two of them. Hiro and Baymax end up getting help from Tadashi's (and, now, Hiro's) college friends, Go Go (Jamie Chung), Wasabi (Damon Wayans, Jr.), Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) and Fred (T.J. Miller). They adapt their inventions to make themselves more formidable than they would be as mere college students, fashion superhero costumes and identities for themselves, and away they go – as a team.<br/><br/>Does ""Big Hero 6"" refer to the six newly-minted superheroes???? Yes! This film is actually an origin story for a group of superheroes in the Marvel Comics universe. Making this film as an animated feature rather than a live-action movie allows the creators a lot more freedom to create the spectacle that is this film. The animation is amazing. It is not detailed in an HD way, but is impressive in its smoothness. And the colors are as varied and vivid as I have ever seen in an animated movie. The story is great too. As a relatively obscure group of comic book superheroes, the Big Hero 6 can become whoever the creative minds behind the movie want them to become. The script contains elements of danger which give the film a little more depth than in your average animated feature, but keeps it kid-friendly by making Baymax into a physically reassuring presence. The movie is also family-friendly as it clearly endorses respect for elders, healthy ways of dealing with emotions and the selflessness that is required to truly be part of a family (or group of close friends) and make a difference with your life. As an origin story, an Oscar winner and a very profitable film, you can expect a sequel. But what will they call it since the original already ends in a number? Well, I guess that doesn't matter as much as the sequel living up to the quality of the original – especially since most people seem to agree that ""Big Hero 6"" deserves all the profits and accolades that it has received. I think so too, and give this film an ""A-""."
"shakilabuzafor0","8","38","55","7 March 2015"," Big Hero 6 is an excellent modern sci-fi animation movie with incredible action packed in a lovely wrapper.
","It is obvious that Big Hero 6 was the best animation film of 2014.I always appreciate those movies which motivates us and especially children towards science and Big Hero 6 is a awesome example of that.This movie movie was full of fun and show us the importance of family,friends and how to clam down when we lost our loved ones.when it comes to characters i must say Baymax is truly a masterpiece,every children and people of all age surely will love this character because of his loving and HUGGING personality.The special bond between Baymax and Hiro was incredible and that made this movie my favorite next to How to train your dragon.Big Hero 6 is that kind of movie that make us believe that i can be super hero and that differ it from other superhero movie.And last of all when it comes to villain,Big Hero 6 movie did an outstanding job because there was quiet a good story behind his evilness.the graphic and sound quality was truly marvelous."
"derekpku66","8","38","55","6 March 2015"," Enjoyable and relaxing
","Okay, let's first start with the pros. This movie successfully showcased how good the animation 3D technology can be. My friends and I quite enjoyed its overall quality. Also this movie has pretty much innovative elements in it, with some big high tech creations. Overall, it's a light hearted movie. I'm sure almost everyone can find it amusing. It is not perfect of course. First, seriously, all big hero movies have to start with a family tragedy? I understand revenge is an emotional treat and good for plot, but this seems to be forcing the sad parts in and I don't like that idea of big heroes all have to suffer from family loss. Apart from that, some jokes are kinda stiff. The big marshmallow bear's blalalala is pretty lame on my side. It certainly has good branding effect tho. I see big ad boards everywhere including the bus station at Zhongguancun, Beijing. In a nutshell, it's amusing, sort of funny, nice animation with fairly good character settings. You might enjoy it if not being too critical."
"skane110-1","8","38","55","13 January 2015"," Such a great movie.
","This movie is absolutely wonderful. It really reminds me of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" which is probably the best movie of 2014. I just love how it so effortlessly mixed heartwarming emotion, with thrilling action, and laugh-out-loud comedy.<br/><br/>For a quick synopsis, the movie is about a young boy named Hiro who is gifted in robotics and has an older brother named Hadashi who he looks up to very much and for good reason. Hadashi is also a brilliant scientist who has built a remarkable robot named Baymax who has the ability to scan people and give them medical treatment and advice. There is also a group of Hadashi's friends, the funniest being Fred, and there's also a villain whose motives and identity are not revealed until the climax of the film. After a tragic accident occurs and after learning that it was a planned attack, Hiro, Baymax, and their new group of friends end up creating a rag-tag group of superheroes which they name ""Big Hero 6"". The only reason why I gave the movie an 8 instead of a 10 is because of the villain. I just feel like some of his actions and his overall attitude are a bit over-the-top evil and his motivations aren't successfully explained. With that said, this movie is truly for everyone and it has something that I think many animated movies have been missing lately which is a very good plot, and endearing characters that you learn to care about deeply. I also love how they didn't make Baymax too human-like. I really hate when movies do that with AI characters, I think it's a cop-out because the audience will obviously care for a machine if it acts and looks exactly like a human. I also hate how they overuse the whole ""questioning of love"" cliché with those characters. In this film, Baymax understands that love and friendship are important to people because those things are important to a ""patient's"" emotional well-being. Although he is a believable robot, you can still get attached to him just like Hiro does because he is such an adorable, lovable, sweet-matured character and it doesn't hurt that he looks like a big marshmallow.<br/><br/>Although the film introduces awesome new superhero characters and has some amazing action/battle scenes, what it truly succeeds in doing is being a thoroughly entertaining movie that tugs at the heartstrings, and makes you root for these great characters. I left the movie in awe of how it so effortlessly entranced me and brought me into it's unique world. I can't imagine anyone watching this movie and not loving it so, if you're reading this review to see whether you should watch it or not, definitely do, you won't regret it."

"KingCritic","10","77","119","3 April 2015"," Beautifully written, touching, and faced the hero with big decisions!
","Where do I begin? Big hero Six is one of the best movies I've seen all year. In one of my previous reviews, I used the term over and over again that Disney has always done what it's done and should stick to that. And this movie has! Running Disney themes have this movie that gets me very happy with Disney. This movie as I said in my previous review brings us back from the god awful frozen. Very original and I'll bring this back from any any old tales or fairy tales, big hero six tells the tale of a young man's struggle to find the men who killed his brother.With great action scenes good moral values and enough strength and motivation in its stride it brings me back to good Faith with Disney. Constant Disney clichés that always want to make me watch this movie over and over again , with a side of no backtracking and no unnecessary characters brings us to believe that Disney's got it back again. This movies originality, good writing, and overall good happy feeling, got me believing that Disney can move on from its mistakes. Disney has shown that it can make a good movie again by showing that you don't need a musical and ridiculous characters to get little kids up and happy to buy your merchandise. This movie spoke to a wide variety of people and not just easily fooled little kids. This movie must've been a stowaway on the crap boat that was frozen and maleficent.This movie is a rare occasion of well done combinations of different elements (superheroes, Disney clichés, etc). If you lost your money to frozen watch this movie so you metaphorically won't waste it."

","I did read before I went to see this movie that Disney would be testing some adult subjects, like the loss of somebody. Without putting out some spoilers, I might say that the movie really touched my boys. I have two boys in the age 6-9, and both of them had both laughter and tears during the movie. <br/><br/>It is a great action, comedy, drama package. Both my sons fell in love with Baymax, and if he where standing outside the cinema when we left he would have been given a big hug for sure. <br/><br/>The storyline is good, and as a father I had quite a few laughs myself and managed to stay awake for the whole movie. Many times going to the movie with your kids can be a snooze-fest, but this one actually entertained me as well."

Discovering the personal health companion robot Baymax invented by Tadashi, Hiro starts investigating the suspicious circumstances of the fire, helped by Tadashi's work colleagues.<br/><br/>Disney, CGI, based on a comic, heroic goings-on – I know I was going to enjoy this before I went through the doors. What I didn't realise was that it is a super-hero origin story (or, rather, a super-team origin story). And, for me, it had everything – great characters, emotional depth, and terrific action. It had heart – something I always love in a film - genuine jeopardy, and a sense of joy in its super-heroics that last year's drab, depressing Man Of Steel couldn't even sniff at.<br/><br/>Oh, and it's very funny, too.<br/><br/>And I was delighted to see that a flyover of the animated city of San Fransokyo clearly showed the small beach where I paddled last year on a holiday which took in San Francisco.<br/><br/>Highly Recommended."

So many people will be able to relate to his character just in that sense alone. The storyline was done so well and captured the hearts of both kids and adults. Throwing in problems and finding solutions to the problems was once again reiterated here. My mom and her friends even enjoyed the plot. The fact that there was an incredible invention developed in this story gives all those inventors out there a push to go forward with their ideas.

The realism in the animation, while not losing the charm associated with the genre, is stunning, the humanity and emotion in the film is superior to most live action films you'll see, and the story is fresh and entertaining. It combines humor with sadness with action to make for an exciting viewing experience. They also make you absolutely love Baymax, the big, white, puffy looking marsh mellow robot in all the advertisements.

Every hair, every detail, water, fire, you name it; I caught myself wondering at times how they made everything look so natural!<br/><br/>Then the plot; though the overall storyline is not that original, the way they built the characters around it and still gave the story it's own unique personality is brilliant. This was one of those movies that I didn't want to end just because it was so fantastic.<br/><br/>One of the most important reasons I loved this movie so much is the humor in it. Especially the way Baymax learns and still tries to remain true to his original programming had me to tears (from laughing) several times. And not just me; the entire (adults only) cinema was bursting out into laughter!<br/><br/>Whether you go with kids or not; I guarantee you will have a great time seeing this movie.

"StevePulaski","8","29","41","2 December 2014"," Predictably strong animation; unpredictably stronger themes
","It didn't really hit me why I eagerly anticipate animated films each and every year, whether they be from high stakes studios like Pixar and Disney or low-key efforts from Blue Sky Animation or Rainmaker Entertainment. To me, every animated film is an opportunity to showcase different writing and directing talents, as animated studios rarely keep the same director for every single project. Sure you have directors like John Lasseter or Pete Docter that frequently direct films for certain studios, but often, you get a solid variety of films made by people you've never heard of and that provides for a film experience akin to watching a filmmaker's directorial debut.<br/><br/>I only noticed this when I reflected on the bulk of Disney's films at the turn of the decade, from the enjoyable ""Tangled,"" to the joyous ""Winnie the Pooh,"" the incredibly fun and, my personal favorite in years, ""Wreck-It Ralph,"" and the beloved and cherished ""Frozen,"" the studio has consistently churned out a wide variety of films from a barrage of talented people. Disney's latest, ""Big Hero 6,"" as expected, is no exception; this is a briskly-paced and different film for the animation studio, as it adopts a structure more akin to the one we've seen Marvel take on in recent years, and creates a film from the ground up that keeps its morals in check and its checklist of adventures in mind every step of the way.<br/><br/>The film follows Hiro Hamada (voiced by Ryan Potter), a fourteen-year-old technology prodigy from San Fransokyo, a city built and thriving on technological innovation. Hiro, despite having the intelligence and time to spend on debatably more significant projects, enjoys the concept and strategy of ""bot fighting,"" or the act of two small robots dueling until ones destruction. Hiro is kept in line and motivated by the work of his older brother Tadashi Hamada (Daniel Henney), a skilled engineer, who has created a tubby white robot named ""Baymax"" (Scott Adsit), who is designed to monetize the healthcare system in America by providing non-threatening and responsive care upon hearing the expression ""ow"" from a person.<br/><br/>In the midst of all this, Hiro gets in contact with Professor Robert Callaghan (James Cromwell), a renowned technology guru who becomes attracted to the fourteen-year-old upon viewing a tutorial of his invention of ""mircobots."" Microbots"" are tiny, metallic links that swarm and fit together to create whatever the human mind can imagine, proposing immense innovations and efficiency in architecture and transportation. However, after tragedy strikes, Hiro's motivation flatlines, and it's only him, Baymax, and a group of Tadashi's loyal workers that can stop a potential threat to technological and scientific evil.<br/><br/>When Hiro and his band of inventors band together to form a group of superheroes, ""Big Hero 6″ easily could've opted for a sound and lights show, disregarding all the potential morals and ideas it laid so neatly on the table. However, despite a narrative structure that reminds us of the many Marvel superhero films we've seen this year, ""Big Hero 6″ keeps key morals in place, some of which are understanding the differences between external and internal pain, as brought on by the presence of Baymax and how unprecedented scientific innovations can be used simultaneously for good and bad. We see all of these ideas pan out and develop over the course of the film's runtime and never does the film become too rushed or too simplified to the point where lofty morals are sacrificed for rock-em sock-em action; the balance is delicate and well worth commending.<br/><br/>On top of great, sound morals, ""Big Hero 6″ instantly wins thanks to a cuddly and lovable hero, Baymax, who finds ways to charm with his straight-forward nature and his strive to make everyone around him comfortable. Baymax steals almost every scene he is in, and meshes quite well with the other characters, working germane to their characteristics and never undermining the true force of Hiro as a character. The film, in addition, is predictably gorgeous, with eye-popping colors and wonderfully animated surroundings, effectively delivering the aesthetics as well as the morals in a neatly-wrapped package. ""Big Hero 6″ may not rank as highly as ""Wreck-It Ralph,"" but seeing as it operates on a minefield of pitfalls and destructive forces, the fact it succeeds this well is a small miracle in itself."

","I believe I have not seen such a great film in my taste since Wall.E, that is also by Disney.<br/><br/>It is a high quality film that teaches the importance of humanity in our lives, instead of losing control at moments of distress and hurting other people. It is a family movie.<br/><br/>It presents very different characters that find themselves together at university for their higher levels of intelligence. It also shows the love and care between the robot and a boy, a theme that is usually successful when used on this perspective.

One day when he hurt his left foot and cried, Beymax activated himself and asked Hiro whether he needed health- care. Hiro refused him and wanted to deactivate Beymax. When they were pushing, Hiro found the last microbot in his pocket and Beymax thought it wanted to go somewhere. Beymax went alone to find out where it wanted to go and Hiro followed him. They stopped at a warehouse. To their surprise, someone was producing a large number of microbots. Suddenly a guy in a mask appeared and wanted to kill them. Hiro and Beymax escaped from the warehouse. At night, Hiro realized the fire was started by the guy in the mask and he stole his microbots. So Hiro militarised Beymax into a fighting robot and decided to find out who was the guy in the mask. They went to the warehouse again but he was almost killed by the guy. Luckily, four friends of his brother, Fred, Go Go, Wasabi and Honey Lemon passed by and saved him. They went to Fred's house and made the decision that they would revenge for Tadashi and Professor Callaghan. Hiro made armors for six of them. Beymax found out that the guy in the mask was on an island. The six heroes went to the island and saw a video in a secret government facility, which was about a failure of a transportation experiment. A lady disappeared in the portal. Suddenly the guy in the mask attacked them again. After difficult fighting, the six heroes were surprised to find out that the guy in the mask was Professor Callaghan. Actually Professor Callaghan's daughter was the lady who disappeared in the experiment and the experiment was managed by Alistair Krei. He wanted to kill Alistair Krei and revenge for his daughter. <br/><br/>However Professor Callaghan did not give up after he was exposed. When the six heroes arrived at Alistair Krei's company, he was caught by Professor Callaghan. At the moment Professor Callaghan would nearly be defeated by the six heroes, he opened the portal and everything was attracted into it. Hiro and Beymax got into the portal bravely to save the lady. Unfortunately, Beymax was hit by a rock and he sacrificed himself to save Hiro and the lady. Finally, the bad guy, Professor Callaghan was caught by the police and Hiro used the chip which Beymax left for Hiro in his hand to restore Beymax.<br/><br/>Although the storyline is common and I could predict what would happen at the end, I still like this movie. It is really interesting and fun. Specifically, Beymax is a very successful cartoon character and nowadays is popular among the public. For his appearance, white is easy to remember. Beymax is so cute that he even looks a little bit stupid, but not in the bad way. When he and Hiro needed to escape at first, he did not know what happened and just, standing there, looked at ""the big monster"". Then he used adhesive tape to fix his body in the police station. There are so many funny actions leading me to laugh. Asking Hiro whether he needed health-care makes him more successful. When they were stuck in the portal, he sacrificed himself to save Hiro and he asked if Hiro was satisfied with the health-care again. It deeply moved me."

","Are we soon coming to a time when the truly life-like actions and representations of objects by animated films are taken for granted? I hope not.<br/><br/>""Big Hero 6"" tells the story of a young boy and his robot. And I hope no one is taking for granted the amazing ""cinematic effects"" created via animation. These animators repeatedly fool the eye into thinking the images are created through the lens of a camera. To further this illusion, the point of view is what one might see through a camera. It is almost tempting to compliment the camera's movement, until you realize there is no camera. In the same vein, I love the ""shots"" through translucent (but not clear) glass, the slo-mo, and the depth of field created by ""unfocused"" objects in the background.<br/><br/>The overall style of the film is reminiscent of anime and classic sci-fi. And it starts with a mystery that our hero (Hiro) cleverly--with the aid of a clue that is genius in its simplicity and design--sets out to solve.<br/><br/>Time and again, the characters look and behave in very human ways. And since I am not yet ready to just accept such technical artistry as de rigeur, I say ""Bravo!""<br/><br/>If you liked ""The Incredibles"" or ""Wreck-it-Ralph"", you will probably like ""Big Hero 6""."

","A little over a year after I took my granddaughter Catrin (then almost three) to her first ever movie ""Frozen"" (which she utterly adored), I took her (now just four) to see this very different film from the same stable (Walt Disney Animation Studios) and I'm delighted to record that she loved it. We saw it in IMAX in 3D and we were both blown away.<br/><br/>Although this time the central character is a young boy - Hiro Hamada of the city of San Fransokyo - rather than two princesses, my granddaughter had no trouble relating to it because Hiro is so cute, his inflatable robot Baymax is androgynous, and two of his four friends - making up the six heroes - are very capable girls.<br/><br/>I reckon that ""Frozen"" plus ""Big Hero 6"" - with a few films in between - will give her a lifelong love of the movies."

","What I appreciated most about this movie was the setting, having neither been to San Fransisco nor Tokyo I cannot comment on if it is true to either of them - but I really liked the city and the culture that resulted from it.<br/><br/>You can hardly see the effect of the technological advances that has happened in this world, and because of this it feels like it's in the near future. As it is a movie for younger audiences, it is understandable that they want it to be easily relatable.<br/><br/>The parts of this movie that I did not like are probably some of the parts that the younger audiences will like the best. The Fred-character was partly delightful, but also ""too much"". The same with some of the moments in the film (like the suggestion given by one of the heroes in the last fight). Some of the motivations of the characters are also simplified so much that they are hard to understand.<br/><br/>If you are a comics geek, I recommend staying till after the credits!"

"Sahl_95","10","78","122","5 January 2015"," Fun, Action Packed and Adorable
","""Big Hero 6"" is a movie that shows the best of both Disney and Marvel. It's funny, has exciting action scenes and has enjoyable characters.<br/><br/>Baymax (Scott Adsit), the inflatable huggable healthcare companion for Hiro (Ryan Potter) was, for me, the best part of the movie. Baymax brings laughs in almost every scene he is in, has a lot of action scenes and you end up loving him. Hiro is the most developed of the human characters (he is funny, his actions, however rash and dangerous, are understandable and he grows and learns from his mistakes) and he along with Baymax makes the movie great. Although the other humans are all fun in their own way, I wish we got to know more about them.<br/><br/>The villain in this movie is good as well. Just goes about his job doing evil stuff in an evil manner and is threatening throughout.<br/><br/>My only issue was with the ending which unfortunately went as predicted. However, this was still a very fun movie which did go places (dark intense places) I did not expect and improved the movie for me. Big Hero 6 entertained me a lot and will be fun for the entire family."

"japamo","10","57","87","26 November 2014"," All Six of ""Hiro's Heroes"" Have Brains, Power, and Most Importantly, Soul
","Basically a fusion of ""Teen Titans"", ""The Incredibles"", and one of those '60s Japanese cartoons featuring a boy and his giant robot (""Gigantor"" comes to mind), Disney's Big Hero 6 (hereafter ""BH6"") is a large-scale, comic-book action extravaganza that is on a par with any other ""superhero"" movie. However, BH6 delivers far more than the usual slam-bang hero/villain battles. The movie illustrates and celebrates ""geeky"" creative, scientific, and technological intelligence and its valuable contributions to society. It cherishes familial, fraternal, and even mechanical relationships and friendships. BH6 also examines the unthinking, dangerous pursuit of violent vengeance. Most unexpectedly but reassuringly, the movie is spiritual and convinces us that even robots and machines have souls (in their case, chips).<br/><br/>First of all, BH6 shows that without purpose and guidance, even the greatest, genius intellect is wasted and useless. Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) is just that person. Gifted in robotics but aimless and unfocused, Hiro is content merely in pitting his creations against other miniature robots in illegal, underground fights. He usually wins, but is nearly apprehended in a police sting operation before his older brother Tadashi Hamada (voice of Daniel Henney) zips by on his motorbike to save him. Equally technologically adept, Tadashi has constantly berated the 14-year old Hiro for wasting his life and has constantly urged him to apply to the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology (SFIT), a scientific academy he attends. Tadashi's proudest achievement is a medical, health-care robot named Baymax (voice of Scott Adsit), a 7-foot tall white walking balloon figure that looks a little like Bib the Michelin Man or a man-sized Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man, and sounds like HAL from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". At the beginning, Baymax's sole function is healing and taking care of people, namely Hiro, who initially isn't too crazy about Baymax's protectiveness toward him.<br/><br/>After a little hesitation, Hiro, who's already graduated high school, agrees to put on a demonstration before the SFIT scientific faculty to show his credentials. His invention is microbots (nanobots) that work like computerized LEGO blocks that can instantly combine to form almost any object, animated or stationary, from buildings to huge moving hands. A mechanical headband controls the microbots' movements. The demanding SFIT Robotics Department Head Professor Robert Callaghan (voice of James Cromwell) is impressed and urges Hiro to apply. Tadashi had already introduced Hiro to his off-beat, nerdy, but accomplished robotics classmates: GoGo Tomago (voice of Jamie Chung), a brusque, stern, electromagnetics expert and extreme bicyclist, Wasabi (voice of Damon Wayans, Jr) a muscular but somewhat fastidious and cautious laser expert, Honey Lemon (voice of Genesis Rodriguez), an extroverted but sweet-natured chemist, and Fred, a happy-go-lucky (and surprisingly well-off) Valley Dude type who is a comic-book and dinosaur fanatic (and SFITs reptile mascot).<br/><br/>Tadashi's friends and the SFIT curriculum finally persuade Hiro to apply. However, the SFIT robotics lab is set afire with Professor Callaghan inside. Tadashi rushes in to save him. The lab explodes. Hiro is overcome with grief at the loss of his brother and he again goes off- course. Tadashi's friends, and the suspicion that Alistair Krei (voice of Alan Tudyk), the Krei industry magnate who unsuccessfully attempted to purchase Hiro's microbots, killed Callaghan AND stole Hiro's microbots, rouse Hiro to action.<br/><br/>However, in order to capture the Kabuki-masked villain, who is using the microbots to spread havoc in San Fransokyo, Hiro needs a super-powered team. Tomago, Wasabi, Honey Lemon, and Fred have their respective agility/electromagnetic disk, laser, chemical potion, and fire- breathing abilities. But someone extra is needed: Baymax. Baymax has neither the body (though he can lift over 1,000 pounds) nor the programming for super crime fighting. Hiro overcomes these formidable obstacles with carbon-steel armor and a ""fighter"" computer chip. The ""Big Hero 6"" team is ready to kick some evil butt. But the team has some serious hurdles. First, they are still uncoordinated and unfamiliar with fighting. Second, despite his upgrade, Baymax is still a pacifist healer at ""heart"". Third, and most shockingly, Hiro's desire to avenge his brother threatens to unbalance and consume him. Can the team overcome these obstacles to not only stop the villain, but uncover his true identity?<br/><br/>BH6 eventually answers these questions with both vibrant, eye-stunning action and quiet, contemplative scenes that demonstrate that blunt, thoughtless force and vengeance is not only not enough to solve problems, it may exacerbate these problems and cause still others. Planning, logic, and creative thinking must also be used. Even power and brains combined may not be enough. Compassion and caring, as embodied by Baymax, must also enter the mix to solve problems without losing your soul. Speaking of souls, despite Hiro's lament that his brother is gone, Baymax continually reassures him that ""Tadashi is here"" and points to his torso video, showing Tadashi's trial-and-error process in creating Baymax. This comforts Hiro (and us) Also, when Baymax is called upon to sacrifice himself to save someone, we realize that all may not be lost, because, as mentioned before, robots and computers have chips for souls. I think BH6's ultimate comforting message is that since souls and chips live forever, people and robots can never truly die. Thanks for that inspiring reminder, Baymax, Hiro, and BH6."

"klpcast","10","66","102","25 April 2015"," One of Disney's best in years
","I have been a lifelong Disney fan, and make a habit to see any new releases from Disney. After hearing many positive things about Big Hero 6, I was eager to see it. However, I tend to proceed with caution on many new Disney movies because I know that the quality will likely not be on par with the classics. This movie proved to be an exception.<br/><br/>I found all of the characters in this movie to be wonderful and well-developed, even the supporting characters. Hands down, Hiro, Tadashi, and Baymax are the most memorable, and the watching the film will make you become attached to these characters. Only Disney could cause you to feel attached to a robot, and they hit that nail on the head.<br/><br/>The storyline is very unique and original, even though it is loosely based off of the ""Big Hero 6"" comic from Marvel. The many plot twists will leave you wondering what is yet to come. In addition, this movie highlights the struggles of overcoming grief from the loss of a loved one. As this is something that many viewers have experienced, you will probably find yourself feeling emotional and will be able to relate to the feelings of most of the characters (especially Hiro).<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 brings us back to the magic that many recent Disney films have been lacking. This movie is definitely not just for little kids. I'm 19 years old and loved this movie, and my parents AND grandparents greatly enjoyed this movie as well. I hope Disney learns from the success of this movie and continues to produce wonderful films. It is perfect for the whole family to enjoy!"

","This was one of the most enjoyable films I have watched in quite some time, and is one that I believe I'll continue to enjoy even years down the road after viewing it multiple times.<br/><br/>It offers great balance to the story and is pleasing to a wide range of audiences. The session I went to watch in the cinemas had people old enough to be my father and kids young enough o be my own all getting heavily engaged and enjoying the film.<br/><br/>If I were to be completely objective, I should in fact be giving this film a score of about 8.5. It has a good story, good actions scenes with good animation, and a very healthy serving of humour, making it an exceptional movie. Unsurprisingly there are elements that are quite predictable, which would prevent it from being a flawless film, but given the emotional response it can evoke, and just the sheer enjoyment it gave me watching it, I was quite happy to give it a perfect 10.<br/><br/>This movie, despite being targeted primarily at a much younger audience than me, really captivated me. I was always engaged, and never left wanting, which combined with the fact that it struck a few personal notes with me too, meant that it was by far the most enjoyable film I've watched in recent years.<br/><br/>Very impressed with it, and highly recommend it to anyone, of any age."

","From the creators of Wreck-It Ralph (2012) & Frozen (2013), here comes another impressive animation that's as fabulous as the above mentioned films, continuing the recent success streak for the studio. Big Hero 6 is based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name. It is such an outstanding animation a whole family can enjoy.<br/><br/>The story of Big Hero 6 is set in a futuristic city called San Fransokyo (a coinage of San Francisco and Tokyo), the scenery is amazingly beautiful.<br/><br/>The protagonist Hiro, a genius in robotics, has a special bond with his older brother Tadashi's invention called Baymax, a cuddly balloon like inflatable robot, which is designed to serve as a personal health companion. The relationship between Hiro and Baymax is very touching. Who doesn't like this cute, kind, lovely, royal, cuddly human-like robot?<br/><br/>The version I have watched is 3D but the visual effects are almost the same as 2D. So, if you don't want to spend extra money on the 3D version, 2D will be fine in my opinion.<br/><br/>All in all, the animation is superb, the plot is interesting, the dialogs are humorous.

"rjsf96","7","52","79","5 January 2015"," Disney's Latest is possibly its Greatest
","It has been a good year for animated flicks. Lego had a crack at it, a dragon breathed fire once more and now Disney is back to put the competition to shame. There was once a time when PIXAR overshadowed Disney, now that process has been reversed with the likes of quality films from 'Tangled' to 'Frozen' and now 'Big Hero 6'.<br/><br/>In a world where superhero films have become its own genre, the market recently has been flooded – with well too much of everything. Have these marketing executives over at Marvel ever heard that less is more? I doubt it. Although 'Big Hero 6' is a Disney film, it was actually adapted from a Marvel comic. The real question is that do these two existing franchises work well together? You can bet everything that you own they do! All the key hallmarks of Disney are there – minus the music numbers, with added wise cracks and wit surely helped by being brothers with Marvel.<br/><br/>Our hero is a 14 year old boy called Hiro Hamada resident of fictional city San Fransokyo who teams up with his friends and lovable, caring and unintentionally funny robot Baymax. Their bond is one of loyalty, friendship and full of heart. No bond has been stronger since that of Andy and Woody in 'Toy Story'. The six heroes – hence the title – realise their city is in danger and must become their own brand of funky superheroes in order to fight this mysterious new force.<br/><br/>'Big Hero 6', like most Disney films is daring, be prepared to be put through the emotions frequently. This film will undoubtedly draw comparisons to other superhero ensembles that we have been treated to like –'The Incredibles', 'The Avengers' and 'X-Men: Days of Future Past'. Consider this the icing on the cake.<br/><br/>Of course the film has visual flair, so much so that I initially thought PIXAR were the ones responsible. The voice acting without question is stellar and the characters therefore feel fully formed, had I not known it was animated I would have sworn that the characters and their relationships with others are real.<br/><br/>'Big Hero 6', really hit hard for me how animation is rivalling that of live-action. Many superhero films were released this year, four, yes four others! But this one stood out and had me crying like a little baby. Consider that a compliment, I don't think that live-action films even had half as much feeling as this film – ironic considering that the characters are computer animated! Many of the sceptical among us will shout and cry no musical numbers from the rooftops! Does this mean that the score from Henry Jackman is worthless? No! It is energetic and vibrant providing some of the best superhero themes ever produced! Just wait until you hear the new Fallout Boy song; 'Immortals', it works seamlessly into the film. If this is what it cost to not have musical numbers them I'm all the more happy for it.<br/><br/>How could I call this anything less than spectacular? I can't! Anyone in need of a great animated film step right up! It never panders to the kids, always thrills and most importantly understands key human emotion, particularly loss and how to deal with it. I've honestly never felt so happy that animation exists within cinema since 'Beauty and the Beast'! Anyone in question of my belief should see it for themselves; this is truly an opportunity you cannot afford to miss!"
"esimich97","9","41","61","14 January 2015"," Much more than just a kids film
","I don't normally write reviews, however after reading some other reviews on here I felt that it may have been misinterpreted. Whilst it is a kids film, which is obvious in the animation and relatively simple characters, Big Hero 6 is so much more. Disney has attempted many new things which in my opinion has invigorated the brand and widened the audience. The obvious one being the use of a Marvel Comic and superhero theme. This allowed for the movie to be much deeper than a typical Disney movie as it was a metaphor for loss and the seven stages of grief. For example, the superheroes convey the fight that Hiro needs to have within him in order to overcome such tragedy. The anger he feels towards Callaghan conveys the betrayal one often feels after experiencing a loss and how they may lash out, isolating themselves and perhaps hurting loved ones. This is seen in his treatment of the four friends and Baymex when he removes the memory card and tells him to destroy. In the end he eventually manages to move on and accepts his brothers death. This theme is also explored through Callaghan. Therefore I believe that this is as much an adults film (or perhaps more) as once you explore it beneath the surface there is an alternate meaning."
"ElStuporTwix","10","68","106","27 April 2015"," An unusually great movie that is being undeservedly and wrongfully bashed.
","As much as I am shocked like everyone else is, this movie gets too much undeserved hatred. Did I watch the same movie like those who didn't like it did? Was this movie really that horrible or stupid or a ""waste of time""? My answer to those questions are: Nope, I don't think so. Are we ""really"" going to live in a generation where we're supposed to believe that almost every movie that makes today is the same and filled with overused clichés? I won't believe it people, that's just a stupid fact. While BH6 is based upon a superhero comic it worked out just fine, I can't remember the last time I truly enjoyed a superhero film especially when it's 100% animated.<br/><br/>But first of all I just want to say that I am ridiculously tired of hearing and reading from people saying that this is a movie that only kids will enjoy. Whenever I hear that thought it makes me feel sick about it, if I can comment to that thought everyone and I do mean everyone can enjoy this film. Don't let this ""thought"" fool you because Big Hero 6 deliveries more than just what that particular thought wants you to believe into. And I don't even want to remember in the future that a movie like Big Hero 6 is being known as a ""just another ordinary kid flick"", no screw that! That's just preposterous.<br/><br/>My next comment is that I am also getting tired of hearing people saying that it wasn't like or as fun as ""Frozen"". Why on Earth does it have to be like or as fun as ""Frozen""? This movie was nothing like that other movie and it didn't have to be either. And frankly this movie is so much better and smarter than ""Frozen"" which BTW I was disappointed with (no offense I really wanted to like that film but there were too many things I just couldn't bare into.) Without any musical numbers I still enjoyed it, although I dig the main theme song by Fall Out Bay (no I'm not familiar with them but the song managed to be catchy.)<br/><br/>But wait I have another comment and that goes to those who says this was a complete ""ripoff"" of ""How To Train Your Dragon"".<br/><br/>1. Hiro did not find Baymax it was Tadashi who introduced him at first and then Baymax himself found Hiro by hearing his pain, plus he was moved to their house.<br/><br/>2. BH6 and HTTYD have different issues: BH6 is about technology coming in the wrong hands. HTTYD is about the conflict between humans and dragons. I simply don't see any resemblances.<br/><br/>3. Just because actor T.J. Miller appeared on both films it doesn't make any copies of his characters he voiced to since two of them are completely different characters.<br/><br/>So stop believing that BH6 is a ripoff of HTTYD.<br/><br/>Like I said before BH6 delivers more than what you might think it is. I won't spoil any important plot lines but I will say some things that kept this movie for being such a watchable film especially it's good morals. If you've been looking for an animated movie with good morals this is the movie you have been waiting for and some of the examples are:<br/><br/>1. What makes Tadashi such a good and thoughtful person is how he cares about his little brother and wants him to do something good and he's careful with people he don't know. He did a good job to remind Krei not to steal one of Hiro's Microbot just like that.<br/><br/>2. When was it the last time a certain supporting character in the movies of Disney were really this smart and helpful and would give a lot of good ideas to help someone who's depressed? Baymax apart from being adorable and funny was always there for him and never left him out of his sight. But also a character that learned his own way of helping people.<br/><br/>3. And of course Hiro himself whom I'm happy that they showed a character of how it is like to be cocky and later realizing to finally do something good for once in his life instead of squandering his gift.<br/><br/>Oh and let's not forget about Hiro's friends Go Go, Wasabi, Honey Lemon and Fred. I know what many people has said about them but trust me they're not characterless, each of them had different personalities which is what made them a memorable team and they were always there for Hiro whenever he needed them.<br/><br/>Let me also say that the animation was undoubtedly gorgeous and detail rich that the sets nearly looked photorealistic (apparently IMDb doesn't seem to know that the word ""photorealistic"" is indeed a real independent word) plus the Microbots were extremely well presented. I just couldn't resist to say it but it would be good to know since I know that many people are worried if the animation process hasn't been taken seriously but fear not BH6 was beautiful to look at. Even though if it wouldn't have won the Oscar I still think it would be a worth watching film no matter what.<br/><br/>In addition: A movie isn't bad just because it couldn't be like previous movies by the same company that made it. I for one enjoyed this, it felt fresh and added a story that at least looks for goals and learning them. The movie did an amazing job to tell its superhero story, I don't even think I've seen a similar story like BH6 before."

","You will fall in love with the main character . The story is simple . In great movies , I have often seen use of a normal phrase apt to a defining moment which gets overlooked in normal situations . The duration is a bit short . The feelings of revenge , love , mindless enthusiasm are shown vividly in different contexts . The first half has more laughs . There is some similiarity with iron man but the original look of protagonist is far more entertaining . Everybody likes happy ending . This is not comparable to wall-E which had deeper meaning . Seems , animation movies are now being created in bulk . A few years ago , all animation movies had revolutionizing ideas with great fun , Nowadays it is less funny and more formulaic for commercial success . Still , this movie is good . I will call 'lego' as far more intense in graphics due to its unique presentation . You can watch this lightly without analysing ."
"lloydmorgan111222","7","33","48","13 February 2015"," A pretty fun Disney film
","'Big Hero 6' isn't my favourite animated film of 2014 (that distinction belongs to 'The Lego Movie'). However, it is enjoyable and entertaining. <br/><br/>What makes this films work is its characters and their interactions with one another. Hiro, the main character, isn't wholly original. He's your typical genius kid protagonist that you see in a good amount of family films. However, he is fairly well rounded enough to root for and be an enjoyable presence. I particularly liked a brief moment in the film in which his character took a slightly dark turn, which something that I don't normally expect from a hero (or should I say Hiro lol) in a Disney film. Baymax is also a fun character. His voice actor, Scott Adsit, does a great job of bringing him to life and giving him the right balance of robotic monotone and human personality. The relationship between the pair, which acts as the film's emotional centre, is definitely one of the film's strongest elements. <br/><br/>The other members of the ""Big Hero 6"" are also enjoyable characters. They never overshadow the two main characters and don't really go beyond the stereotypes of their characterisations but they serve their purpose. The highlight of this group is Fred, a superhero and giant monster enthusiast who is probably the film's best source of humour. <br/><br/>The film is also very pleasing to look at. Like any film from Disney's main animation studio, the animation is top notch. The film takes place in San Fransokyo, a wonderful amalgamation of Japanese and American culture.<br/><br/>However, this film is not without flaws most of which come from the script. It has a very clichéd and predictable story. The reveal of the villain's identity isn't surprising at all. Even when the villain has been revealed, he isn't really interesting or well written. For the most part, the dialogue is pretty good. However, there are a handful of lines that aren't. In particular, one line of exposition feels very forced and unnatural. There was also a plot hole that momentarily took me out of the film (which I won't reveal in case you want to figure it out for yourself). <br/><br/>The film contains two scenes in where our main characters construct their inventions over a period of time. The first one was told through time lapse, a decision that I quite liked. The second one, however, was your standard montage. The montage isn't bad but the use of 'Immortals' by Fall Out Boy in it felt out of the place and didn't really convey the emotion of the scene. <br/><br/>'Big Hero 6' is not the best animation has to offer but it is still a light-hearted and enjoyable film with some well-executed emotional scenes. If you're a fan of Disney animation, you should check it out.<br/><br/>http://boxd.it/55V4T"
"freemantle_uk","10","44","66","18 February 2015"," Disney does it again
","In 2013 Disney scored a massive hit with Frozen, a making over $1 Billion and was particularly popular with girls. Their follow-up is more boy aimed adventure and the 10-year-old inside me loved it.<br/><br/>Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) is a 14-year-old tech genius who is wasted his talents on underground robot battles. He brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) shows him the light and the potential good his talents might produce and gets him to apply for university. But like in many Disney films a loving family member dies tragically and during Hiro's grief he awakes his brother's creation, the medical robot Baymax (Scott Adsit). While exploring the street of San Fransokyo Hiro finds a masked man he believes is responsible for his brother's death and decides to upgrade Baymax to take on the supervillian.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 has everything you would want from a Disney film, it is funny, dramatic, emotional and action: it is the complete package. As you would expect from a Disney film the animation is of the highest quality imaginable, detailed, complex and very colourful. The action sequences are fantastic, fast and fluid and easily matches anything in their live-action counterparts. It is a thrill ride of a film.<br/><br/>The emotional core of Big Hero 6 is the relationship Hiro has with his brother, how he put Hiro on the straight and narrow and that he suffers from his grief. He slowly develops a love for Baymax as Baymax becomes a part of Hiro's mission. This is well trodden territory for Disney and some of the point plots are predictable to anyone who has seen a lot of films or some of Disney's most recent films: but Disney does this formula very well, so you cannot fault them for that.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 gets its balance between the comedy and the drama absolutely right. The comedy is a great mix of wordplay and performance based to slapstick and physical humour. Baymax was offered both forms of comedy brilliant and he was fantastically lovable creation particularly with some of his running gags. The dramatic half of the story has plenty of weight as Hiro tries to figure out the mystery and lets his anger get the better of him when big reveal happens. The villain had an great look to him, dressed in black and wearing a hannya mask and his power has no limits.<br/><br/>The heroes haves array of powers when they suit up in the armour and the training and development aspects of the film are very reminiscent to the first Iron Man film. Hiro himself has a Tony Stark quality to him as he creates his robotics. It was particularly refreshing to see that the team are inexperienced and make mistakes when they are called into action for the first time.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 is a delight for the whole family, being an action packed adventure and having excellent drama and comedy. I couldn't recommend it more highly."

","This movie, if you haven't already seen it is a must see in my opinion. I grew up watching Disney movies and i recently haven't watched any of the new titles they have been releasing. But i sat down and watched this just because nothing else was playing and i was not disappointed. It was really nice to see the Japanese concept i feel like they haven't touched on the Asian community since Mulan. I would love to give this movie a 10 however compared to the lion king and Aladdin it takes the silver. The only thing its missing to be a truly great animated Disney flick is of course the musical numbers. Other than that this movie is defiantly one i must add to my collection worth every penny and time."

"kieranbattams","9","78","123","2 February 2015"," Disney is making Marvel movies now.. ? its great to be alive
","Big Hero 6 is another movie based on Marvel source material but isn't like others recently released.. this one is also a Disney animated feature. How to train your dragon 2 was previously my favourite animated film of the year.. that was until i saw this gem.<br/><br/>The story follows a smart kid named Hiro who is suffering from kid depression after his brother is killed in a huge fire. This is where he meets Baymax, the star of the film and possibly my favourite Disney character since Olaf the snowman. Baymax is a big lovable idiot-type robot who was built to provide healthcare for humans. Hiro sees Baymax as a chance to get revenge on his brother's killer and with him and his new- found friends they embark on a journey to get justice.<br/><br/>Some of the film's best scenes come from Hiro's attempts to turn Baymax into a badass fighting machine. This results in hilarious moments because we still have our big lovable idiot.. but now he has awesome superpowers, and i must say this kept me thoroughly entertained. The other characters were also awesome and each had their own personality traits but at the end we are left with the relationship between Hiro and Baymax, although definitely not a bad thing because as an audience we can never have enough Baymax.<br/><br/>I did feel that this film suffered from what Guardians of the Galaxy also suffered with which is that the villain was underdeveloped, although unlike Ronan the villain in this film (no spoilers) did have a fleshed out plan and was quite a surprise twist. In the end I came out of Big Hero 6 feeling satisfied and entertained, featuring the humour of Marvel and the heart of Disney, this one is well worth a watch for people of all ages and if you don't want your own personal Baymax by the end then something must be wrong with you!"

Big Hero 6 immediately replaces the Lego movie as my No.1, main stream, animated film. <br/><br/>I came onto IMDb to find out more about this entertaining, action packed, emotional roller-coaster only to see half a dozen vicious reviews ... I feel so somber. I can't believe anyone would loath this film to the levels of some reviewers have gone to on this site. It was an absolute joy. The whole cinema was ecstatic, both kids and adults. <br/><br/>I have a 7 year old boy, and even without being a dad, I'd still love this film. Hope it picks up the awards (Oscar, Golden Globe, BAFTA etc etc) it deserves."

Adorable and yet relatable to most at his age ,this character tugs at all the heart strings. This film also sees the introduction to a new side kick and best friend 'baymax' the cuddly marshmallow man who says little words but is full of humour and love. As well as pulling off grade A animated characters , Disney have out done themselves with the imaginative ,futuristic technology. <br/><br/>All good films need an evil villain and I feel his back story and appearance were great however feel we should have seen more action packed fighting scenes between 'Yokai' and the heroic members of 'Big Hero 6'.<br/><br/>Overall this is a FANTASTIC , must see film for all family members.

","The special bond that develops between plus-sized inflatable robot Baymax, and prodigy Hiro Hamada, who team up with a group of friends to form a band of high- tech heroes. <br/><br/>Big Hero 6 is the first Disney animated to have Marvel characters in it as the story is inspired by the Marvel comic of the same name! Apparently we get Marvel movies in a form of Disney movies now: it is a good time to be alive! There's even a Stan Lee cameo! Life is good. A large theme of this film is science, how it could be use to help mankind and before the adventure even begins they make it look cool. What makes this film special is the relationship that forms between Hiro and Baymax. In fact, Baymax is one of the most lovable character I've ever seen in an animated movie, everything that come out of his voice and behaviour is hilarious. This bound that forms between them is what gives the movie its emotional core. We mostly have seen this movie before as it is a sort of amalgamation of The Incredibles, Iron Man, The Avengers and Terminator 2; but the movie is written and directed so well, is so funny, that characters are what drown you into it. Obviously this film is aiming children but the major theme being science it will appeal to all ages, it has this feeling of ingenuity which can influence and inspire children to make something special for mankind. This film tells a story that is realistic and that children can understand, sometimes in life certain things do happen and even though this is a fictional/fantastic movie there are a lot of human emotions to be felt; emotions that are not forced at all. It is good for kids to know that they're out there. Finally it has some quite entertaining action scenes however for an hour and a half long movie it also has some pacing issue, at one point I feel like the movie was dragging a little bit but then it goes on. <br/><br/>Overall Big Hero 6 is a movie for the entire family in which everyone can learn something and be entertained"
"hannah-nelson","10","51","78","27 January 2015"," An excellent Disney worth seeing!
","I have seen Big Hero 6 twice, and both times I've been amazed by the quality of this movie. Baymax was an amazing sidekick, who actually had a place in the plot, with the addition of being adorable and a well trained nurse! Sure, Hiro didn't fall in love, and the brothers didn't have a happy ending. But I think this shows that not everything has a happy ending. Plus, the main charters were complete nerds! As a fellow nerd this brought great joy in my life. I was surprised when I first heard this movie was in production, but never the less I think it's lived up to the hype of Frozen and Wreck it Ralph. And of course I enjoyed the hidden Disney items within the movie. Fantastic!"

"bayboytwo5","9","68","107","29 April 2015"," An extremely satisfying watch about innovation, family, revenge, and the future
","Im more of a renter then a movie goer, and i watched this movie right after watching Interstellar, so i will always remember this sequence as probably one of the most satisfying weeks of watching new movies. The movie is well balanced (besides having no romance whatsoever), suspenseful, unpredictable, action packed, innovative, touching (even tear jerking) and beautifully presented with a fantastic ending (always important). There is a little bias, it is set in San Frantokyo and I reside in the bay area so i loved that part (because were kind of the center of the world over here), and its not a first time seeing the idea since they did something similar in Cloudy 2, but none the less it was done way better and way less dumbed down. <br/><br/>I won't get too much into the story line, but the ride takes quite a few turns turns. Certain goals are made in the movie and once their met, a sudden turn is taken in an unpredictable way, making it pretty suspenseful. They also make an interesting connection between Hiro, his brother Tadashi, and Tadashi's invention ""Baymax"", the worlds first robotic health care companion. The other 4 of the 6 don't have the hugest role (similar to How to train a dragon), and their powers aren't amazing either, however, when needed they make a mark in the action scenes and in some of supportive situations as friends. There's no pure evil in the movie, always rationally fueled evil. And the fact that its futuristic, animated and about robotics and inventions, gave the staff plenty of potential for innovation and they did a great job with it. <br/><br/>Once again the movie was so well balanced, and though i could see a girl maybe not liking this because there isn't romance, the connections between brothers and friends, and some of the other family references make it watchable for most people. It should be an additionally exciting watch for the older and perhaps nerdy type who can catch on with some of the technology and subtleties. However, even my GF said that some of the sadder moments were extremely touching. Once again, they use animation and futurism to their advantage with the touching scenes. The first Marvel Animation made under Disney and they start it off with a bang. It wasn't hugely advertised, and there was a large Asian influence on it Hence the city San Frantokyo which might be why it wasn't advertised greatly(Disney tends to do that) but I absolutely love this movie. I rented it again a week later, and i think i will purchase this one for sure (along with interstellar)."
"kevinquiroga2020","10","52","80","7 January 2015"," This movie is great for all ages
","This movie was awesome and appeals to anyone comic book fan or not. You learn to love and care for every character. Baymax is also a great role model for kids. He shows a large, huggable posture that can really be a cool mascot at Disney parks or events for all to enjoy and remember when ""I saw that movie"". Also, Hiro shows you to never give up, no matter what happens along the way. Just stay positive and keep your friends close to help you. It truly deserves an excellent review, even with all the odd hate. This movie was right on the dot for comic fans, fans of comedy, or just people looking for a good movie to see. It's still out so get to the nearest movie theater quick."

Even though Big Hero 6 does not have lots of Political Messages as The Lego Movie, It Still is a fantastic film that should be more loved. I really want to support this film in its fullest.<br/><br/>PLOT: Hiro is a Bot Fighter. But after Tadashi convinces him to go to University where he sees potential, things go bad as 1. Tadashi Dies in an explosion. 2. His Micro Bots that he has made is found to be stolen and 3. A masked man is using the micro bots for his own good. So now its up to Hiro and his friends, The Big Hero 6 to set off to save San Fransokyo!<br/><br/>From what I looked up, the movie is very different from the comics which I will have to look into more and find some to read. But for what the movie is... WOW. San Fransokyo looks amazing in its opening shots of the movie. It looks incredible! As for the characters, MY GOD I LOVE THEM ALL. Baymax is hilarious and is the center messenger of the film. Hiro is really cool and so are all of his friends. <br/><br/>The whole film is filled with so much heart. An important movie because of its commentary on technology and if we are really ready to step into the future and how it should be used properly. <br/><br/>By the end of the movie, I was wanting more and more! I actually wrote a fan letter to John Lasseter who was the executive producer of the film to make a sequel or better yet, a TV series because there is so much you can do with these characters!<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 I think is going to be one of the all time classic animated films.

"Necroambulant","9","32","47","12 May 2015"," Not Like the Comic, But That Isn't a Bad Thing
","I'm tempted to say that children's movies or family oriented movies are getting better, but that would be tantamount to outright dismissing gems like The Dark Crystal, The Neverending Story, The Princess Bride, Labyrinth, The Secret of N.I.M.H, and so many other fantastic movies from my own childhood. So, even though the movies today might not actually be better as far as subject content and narrative are concerned, there are a lot more of them...and that makes me happy. Big Hero 6, which I just watched last night, was both sweet and adorable while simultaneously poignant with its handling of difficult subjects like the death of close family members and the grieving process. My favorite thematic element would be the focus on science and engineering as positive and pleasurable hobbies and occupations for children to pursue, a sentiment that is sadly underrepresented in the world today. Much like Frozen, Despicable Me, and Monsters Inc., there isn't much that I could complain about where Big Hero 6 is concerned. The animation, like so often anymore, was fantastic and the cast of voice actors brought life to even the less pivotal characters on screen. Like most, if not all of the family friendly movies coming out, this isn't just for children and can be enjoyed by anyone of any age, I think."
"markrogers743","9","32","47","23 February 2015"," They say we are what we are, but we don't have to be,
","Disney and Marvel have had a baby, and it's wonderful. At the time of writing this, Big Hero 6 has won the Oscar for Best Animated Film of the Year, yet the amount of criticism I've seen here has compelled me to post my thoughts on this movie. Personally, I loved it. <br/><br/>Based on a Marvel comic so obscure that even Marvel essentially forgot it existed, Big Hero 6 tells the story of Hiro Hamada, a 14- year old robotics prodigy whose gateway project to get into San Fransokyo's most prestigious technology university is stolen in the wake of a tragic accident. With the help of his new friends and his brother Tadashi's latest creation, an inflatable medical robot named Baymax, Hiro forms a team of misfit superheroes to see that justice is done and solve the mysteries that keep cropping up. The characters are just great. We take time to get to know all the major players and their quirks and foibles from Hiro, to the neurotic Wasabi and even Hiro's Aunt Cass. It's fun just having these people interact without even getting into any action. Though the star of the show is undoubtedly Baymax with his unthinking compassion, willingness to help those in need and sheer gentle, huggable nature. The world looks incredible too as a seamless fusion of East and West architecture and culture. <br/><br/>The story? Some called it predictable, and you could argue so, but the villain (not giving it away here) was not who I expected it to be. Some would likely argue that Disney did the same thing with the villain reveal in Frozen, but that doesn't matter to me since I'm likely the last man alive who hasn't seen Frozen and I don't think I even need to since the whole thing's basically been given away by people who wouldn't shut up about it for a year. But I'm going off on a tangent... There wasn't a single moment in this film where I was bored. In fact the lengthier setup before we get to the hero- and-villain meat of the story actually helps, as we take time to get to know the players.<br/><br/>Of course it's not perfect. No movie ever is, really. The music isn't that memorable with the exceptions of Fall Out Boy's Immortals and the score pieces Nerd School and Huggable Detective. And some of the dialogue towards the end is a teensy bit cringe-worthy, but, hey, it's Disney, you let it slide, especially when the movie's this much fun and emotionally involving. I personally can't wait to see it again.<br/><br/>And this is still sort of a Marvel movie so don't forget to stay behind for the post-credits scene!"
"tenaciousfall","10","32","47","19 November 2014"," brilliant!
","Big Hero 6 was whimsical and wonderful and an absolute joy to watch. I've long grown out of kids' movies, so I stepped into the theatre with a cynical mindset and very low expectations, especially considering the recent animated movies Disney has put out- but it blew me away! It's gratifying to see that the entertainment industry is still capable of a feminist, racially diverse, culturally respectful movie that's all-around sweet, heartwarming, tear-jerking and funny, complete with humour that's neither crude, clichéd, degrading nor disrespectful towards any gender or race, and highlights familial love and friendship instead of the classic romance. It has has singlehandedly restored my faith in animated movies (and Disney). Kudos to Disney and may they keep producing animated movies of this quality."

","A endearing tale masked as a adventure movie for boys; I laughed a lot, I cried a lot. That should speak for it. <br/><br/>The movie is about a boy who has an intellect that he uses for own amusement, instead of using it for the greater good; then, he sees his creations used for evil, and rebels against it; but mostly, what this movie teaches him and us is that we have to use creation and share it with the world, while honoring those we love. ""Somebody has to help, you understand?"" It is an absolute moving story, about loss, and what you do about it... revenge? helping out others in similar positions? I think this movie is gonna help a lot of people. The main character, Hiro, deals with growing up and having responsibilities, personal loss and outdoing himself using his head alone, with a little help from his friends. And meanwhile, you get to see a non stereotypical movie, with AMAZING GRAPHICS, with nerds that are the cool kids, a bad guy who isn't really that, a neurotic black guy (xD), and a robot, who makes people laugh just by moving... look, this is the oldest form of humor. It works. The movie just works. It's amazing. I am 23 and traditionally go see Disney with my childhood friends; everybody FREAKIN loved it OK? It is for all ages. Better than Frozen?

This is the first animated movie Disney creates based on a Marvel property.<br/><br/>Like other Disney films Big Hero 6 is a mix of action, drama, comedy and strong relationships between the characters I can tell you are going to lo love Baymax.<br/><br/>Visually it's amazing, Disney animators are pushing boundaries with every new film. In some shots, specially those showing San Fransokyo streets you can forget you are watching computer generates graphics it looks so real. Also the textures like the hair of the characters is mind blowing. I watched it in 2D but know I want to re watch it on 3D.<br/><br/>Well you should go and see it to see if you agree y or disagree with my enthusiasm!<br/><br/>Ps: the short film at the beginning is also very good."
"yashrajs536","10","39","59","9 May 2015"," So marvel is superb in animation too!!!
","basically I will say that I like all marvels live action movies but actually I never expected it will prove itself in animation too.<br/><br/>the film was awesome the action and techs were awesome especially ""microbots"" and I liked the whole team especially bay-max and the emotion between the Hamada brothers and between bay-max and Ciro were also awesome.<br/><br/>I like live action movies only though I watched smurfs but after watching this movie I will watch the animated movies too.<br/><br/>I thought marvel is awesome in live action but they proved themselves in animation through this movie. I heard that the sequel is announced and maybe it releasing in 2018 hail marvel................................"
"toboekohaku","9","25","36","29 November 2014"," I will be shocked if this doesn't get nominated for a Academy Award
","This is has Academy Award nomination written all over. <br/><br/>The characters are excellent and fun. Hiro is a great character and the writing for his character is very consistent as a genius and going through the reality of a teenager. Baymax is a well written character and has most of the character development with Hiro being close second. The chemistry and relations between Baymas and Hiro is great. One of the girls pronounces Hiro's name right in Japanese pronunciation. <br/><br/>The acting is pretty good and speaking off I found TJ Miller annoying in Transformers but not here. He is pretty good being the comic book jock and does not outstay his welcome. Speaking off this is a Marvel movie so there is a Stan Lee cameo in the post-credits. <br/><br/>The center of this movie is not about being a Marvel superhero movie, it is about a boy and a robot getting justice for the death of his older brother and then it becomes a superhero movie so it works getting to that point very well. <br/><br/>The jokes hit very well more than they miss. Some of the jokes got me laughing. <br/><br/>The animation for this movie is pretty good and I find them very colorful. <br/><br/>The story is pretty good and intriguing, and they have the tragedy at the beginning when Hiro's brother is killed in an explosion. <br/><br/>I say the film's biggest weakness that it is predictable. There is a twist on who is the main villain and it is easy to figure out on who is the main villain. So it's predictiablity what hold this film back for a perfect score. <br/><br/>If you hadn't see it yet, then go see it because it is really great. I say this film is better than Mockingjay and Interstellar."
"grottahopp","9","43","66","10 May 2015"," Stop hating this movie!
","I know there are generally many bad movies out there but Big Hero 6 is not one of them. Yes I know we had some pretty forgettable movies from Disney in the past but nowadays they have been able to show so much more than too simplistic stories or even annoying endings where it ends in a pathetic way. But Big Hero 6 does not have any of those I do not understand all the hatred?<br/><br/>Ignore the stupid fact about this is a kids movie, BH6 showed so much more than what the negativity wants you to believe in to. There are character development, a story that really focus to find its goal, good-spirited and likable characters, enjoyable soundtrack and of course it's heart.<br/><br/>I refuse to agree that this is a horrible movie, it bloody isn't! If you want to talk about bad Disney movies then talk about Little Mermaid 2, Pocahontas 2, Cars 2 or Brave. This is Disney's most entertaining and their best movie since Wreck-It Ralph. Ignore the hatred and see the beauty of this Oscar winning film which I guarantee it's also worth watching."
"deideiblueeyez","6","28","41","1 March 2015"," A very eye-pleasing kids film with something for the adults
","There are quite a few people who claim this film is boring. Having just watched it I will admit that yes, there are a few spots where the action and drive seem to slow down considerably, but honestly I think that, overall, the main characters are too lovable to not enjoy. The source of conflict is thin and perhaps if the movie had been centered around the misadventures of Baymax and the Harada family it would have been a bit more enjoyable for some, but for what the final product was I'm not too terribly disappointed. Can you believe that some people were up in arms over the fact that Honey Lemon was Hispanic but not ""Hispanic enough""? Talk about splitting hairs over technicalities of a film!<br/><br/>Anyway, I almost cried twice during the movie which seems to be a common occurrence when cute things are feeling deep emotional pain on my TV/computer screen (what happened to my emotionally- insensitive exoskeleton of middle school? Oh to be young). <br/><br/>The setting is San Franstokyo, a beautiful mix-mash of a city in what I can only assume is Japerica/Ameripan that seamlessly blends East and West together. The characters I found were quirky and dimensional in their own ways. Go Go, Fred, Wasabi, and Honey Lemon were great believable sidekicks who brought their own personalities to the table despite their limited screen time. Big brother Tadashi was one of the most endearing characters I have ever had the pleasure to meet in a piece of fiction and I was heartbroken when he died. <br/><br/>Despite it being a bit muted and brief, the topic of loss of a loved one plays itself into the film though it was a bit bogged down by ""THE MISSION"" that Hiro sets himself on. <br/><br/>The animation is beautiful and sleek though, and I can never fault a film for using neon colors. Ever. <br/><br/>What struck me during the scene of Baymax and Hiro flying in the air over the city after acquiring their new super suits was that it echoed of Osamu Tezuka's works like Astro Boy which sought to fuse Western and Eastern cultures and people together into one satisfying coming-of- age story. I don't want to speak for Osamu Tezuka, but I think he of all people would have been a bit impressed by how far we've come in regards to ""A boy and his robot"" story. The film also reminded me of The Iron Giant but what movie with kids and robots doesn't?<br/><br/>Overall I would recommend seeing it at least once."
"dan-barth","7","37","56","12 February 2015"," Classic Disney
","Okay I had some expectations on Big Hero Six going into this. I was aware that Hero Six was already a Marvel property that Disney was relaunching as their own separate movie away from the Marvel cinematic Universe. Well to be honest I don't see these guys throwing down with Iron Man you know because they are animated. But one thing I will say I had a lot of fun with this movie, kinda reminded me of my own child hood as well.<br/><br/>Right from the get go we are introduced to our Hero in this movie, ironically called Hiro. Automatically I loved this little guy and I was already on board with his adventure. He was funny a lil cocky and kinda had a Luke Skywalker sort of Vibe to him, with a spice of Marty Mcfly (Star Wars and Back to the Future similarities stopping now) But then the movie takes a dark turn (no Spoils so relax) and it reminded me of old Disney movies such as Lion King and Bambi. I always thought that lately Disney movies have been dulled down, and instead of teaching kids life lessons through cinema they are more focused now on just preserving their innocence. But not in Big Hero Six's case these guys hit us numerously with heart tugging emotions that really make me think back to classic Disney. For the record its not like they are shoe horned in these events, they have key elements to the characters development and the stories development as well.<br/><br/>On the lighter side the movie was funny it had a great story line, kids mums and dads will love this movie, hell I'm 18 years old and I'm buying this when it comes out. we are introduced to characters like Baymax who I can so easily see being this years hottest toy weather it be on plushy's or any other gizmo toy industries can concoct.<br/><br/>Go see this movie if you love Disney a good laugh and just in general fun. One of Disney's jewels Cheers"

","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>Hiro is a science prodigy inspired by his brother Tadashi to build and contribute great new technologies to society. After a tragic incident involving Tadashi, his creation Baymax, an inflatable robot does all it can to help Hiro during this difficult time. Soon a new threat linked to the accident arrives in the city of San Fransokyo, forcing Hiro and his friends to create their own superhero team. With Tangled, Wreck- It Ralph, and Frozen, Disney is going through a renaissance in their animation department. Big Hero 6 is yet another solid addition to their roster. Although the premise is not original in its simplest form, the characters and the adorable Baymax make this adventure worth experiencing.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>With such an impressive streak I expected Disney to deliver at the very least a good film. In terms of the story it was very predictable. However, the colorful characters and their personalities is what saved this movie. Most of all Baymax was awesome!<br/><br/>Baymax may be the cutest robot in animation since Wall-E. He experiences the world and the people in it with a childlike innocence. He steals each and every scene he is in. He may be huggable but when he needs to throw down he is a formidable opponent to go up against. Though he might not necessarily realize his fighting potential. The 3D animation is gorgeous, blending western and eastern cultures to create the beautiful San Fransokyo. The action in the movie could be on par with the current generation of superhero movies. Big Hero 6 is like a mini animated Avengers, but each of them is a nerd using their scientific expertise to become heroes. The movie is not just an action thrill ride but an emotional one as well. You would think majority of the movie would be filled with light-hearted humor, and it is. Still there is a moment where the movie goes much darker than I had anticipated. I liked that the filmmakers didn't hold back on the dark tone because it made the following emotional scenes much more effective.<br/><br/>Although I had fun with the film, there are few things that I wish was done a little better. The masked villain is completely obvious. I knew who it was the instant he showed up on screen. Even Scooby Doo and the gang would request investigating the identity to be a little more challenging. So the intrigue and motive behind the mask is not as impactive as it could have been. The rest of the supporting cast and team members are fun but they aren't given much screen time with Hiro. It would have been nice if we had seen more of their relationship together rather than it being sum up in a 3 min montage.<br/><br/>In the end Big Hero 6 is a heart-warming tale about how far we are willing to go for our family whether it be by blood, friendship, or in this case even electric circuitry in a giant balloon. This movie is a clear indication that Disney has not lost its momentum and I cannot wait to see what else they have in store for us.<br/><br/>Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"
"antoinedb2001","10","32","48","24 November 2014"," a fun animated, Oscar worthy, film too lovable to be missed!!!
","Big hero 6 is the story of a Boy named Hiro Hamada who lost his brother to a fire and is left with his creation, a huggable healthcare robot named Baymax. when they both discover a villain that stole Hiro's inventions to get revenge, they form a superhero team of robotic nerds, to save the day. so, what do I like about this film? it has a great story, great cast of characters, a great villain, great animation, a great crossbreed of two big cities, and the greatest character ever made by Disney. it also has a good message about getting over loved ones but still holding them dear to your heart. and it has a great twist halfway into the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is Oscar worthy.

"laoke","9","29","43","1 January 2015"," Fun...with a good blend of serious.
","I was reading some of the user reviews on here and don't understand some of the negativity...so wanted to share my perspective on the film.<br/><br/>For me, the Good Guy vs. Bad Guy ""action"" sequences aren't the main story line of the film. Rather, it seemed it was about loss and the struggle of living up to the lost person's expectations while still trying to hold on to the memories of that person and not let that loss ruin those memories. In so many ways, I was very pleased that this movie wasn't overly violent (Lego Movie) or princess focused but instead had this more heart focused goal of loyalty and remembrance instead.<br/><br/>Whereas some of the lines may have been cheesy or cliché and many of the supporting heroes weren't developed, I found that was fine because there was much more focus put into the main story line and it made it lighter on delivery. I also found the story was fresh and characters understandable - even the villain. <br/><br/>In summary, this movie was fun...with a good blend of serious. Highly recommended."

","Walt Disney Pictures' latest animated feature Big Hero 6 is based on a Marvel comic – a first for the company. The titular team was created in 1998 and has only appeared in what amounts to a handful of comic book issues. This obscurity ends up working in Disney's favor as they were given the freedom to tweak and mold Big Hero 6 into something that is much more family friendly than your typical Marvel fare without being beholden to some nonsensical reverence to the comic's roots. Yes, there are lessons to be doled out here and positive messages abound, but Big Hero 6 is so much fun and its ""big message"" so earnest and culturally relevant that these life lessons actually strengthen the film rather than provoke unintentional eye rolls. Big Hero 6 stars Hiro (voiced by Ryan Potter) as a child science prodigy who, in the film's early scenes, is content using his abilities to hustle in the underground world of ""bot fighting,"" which is exactly what you imagine. Hiro's older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) pushes him to be more than just a back-alley robotics hustler and brings him to his school to hopefully persuade him into enrolling. It is there that we are introduced to Tadashi's classmates, all of which possess a very specific science-based skill: The cartoonishly meticulous laser expert Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.), adrenaline junkie and daredevil Go Go (Jamie Chung), bubbly chemistry expert Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez), and the lovable slacker known as Fred (T.J. Miller). We also get to meet Professor Callaghan (James Cromwell) and his ethically unsound adversary, Alistair Krei (Alan Tudyk). It's worth noting that all of this tablesetting and introduction of heroes and villains occurs in the university's aptly named Exposition Hall – one of many clever sight gags in a film loaded with them. It is also here that we're introduced to the real star of Big Hero 6, Baymax – an inflatable robot whose sole purpose is to provide medical care to people.<br/><br/>Baymax (voiced by 30 Rock's Scott Adsit) provides the film with a majority of its comic relief. The puffy balloon design of the character is played for laughs often and the animators really let their imaginations run wild here. The film has a great understanding of physics and, as you might imagine, there are plenty of physically amusing things you can do with a balloon. Now picture that balloon having the ability to speak with the voice of a trained comedic actor because as great as those bits of physical humor are, the real charm of Baymax lies in Scott Adsit's vocal performance. He delivers his lines in a deadpan, matter-of-fact cadence that is both childlike and maternal in nature. It's an odd pairing of traits but it really works for such a unique character whose only desire is to heal, at all costs. With Baymax, we have the ultimate comedy presence on screen; he is both the foil and the straight man and that makes for a comedy act that never grows tiresome.<br/><br/>Anyone looking for the depth of The Incredibles should keep searching because you won't find it here. The rest of the Big Hero 6 team can't really compete with Baymax's wit or charm but they really don't have to. This is an animated team that functions much better as a team (Baymax included) than as individuals. Not that they're boring, per se, but these characters are more or less types rather than fully fleshed out heroes like Pixar's aforementioned team. Fortunately, teamwork is one of Big Hero 6's messages and so it's likely that these specific, one dimensional supporting characters are meant to shine a light on the greater good of teamwork rather than that of the individual. Still, it's frustrating when you've seen other films champion the idea of teamwork while handling the supporting cast much better.<br/><br/>The main message of Big Hero 6 is this: don't take the easy way just because you can. It urges its characters (and hopefully the audience) to solve problems by looking at them at another angle, to use your imagination and think creatively. This point is made no fewer than a half dozen times in the film and I couldn't stop myself from smiling at every occurrence. Maybe it's just my personal bias or maybe it's because I've never seen a film so eagerly invested in inspiring its kid- centric audience to actually think but I loved Big Hero 6 for this reason above all. The excitement of having a logical breakthrough is treated as being one of the greatest feelings one can have and I'd be lying if I said I disagree. This is a movie you can actually feel great about letting your kids watch approximately two million times before they become treacherous adolescents.<br/><br/>Despite some glaring black holes in the plot and a montage set to the abysmal sounds of Fall Out Boy, Big Hero 6 is a whole lot of fun. It's got heart, humor, and action and looks absolutely beautiful. This is a stellar animated film that will not only keep your kids entertained, but possibly inspire them to do much more than sing ""Let It Go"" in a cacophonous shriek for the rest of their childhood."

","Disney is clearly in a new renaissance with Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, and now Big Hero 6. In fact, it's almost impossible to tell sometimes whether it's a Disney animation or Pixar film. And I was really impressed with Big Hero 6. I cant believe I waited almost a month to go out and see this one. It's not the best Disney animated film, or even the most creative. But it is entertaining from start to finish and a film that can be enjoyed by everyone of all ages.<br/><br/>They introduce us to Hiro as a bot fighter who doesn't really have a home. Not literally, he lives with his brother and aunt. But he doesn't quite fit in with anybody and doesn't know how to put his talents to good work without getting into a little bit of trouble. Even though it was by the numbers Disney, I really liked his character arc. That's one of the many things that impressed me with Big Hero 6, it's not that different from any film we have seen, especially Disney, yet it brought so much joy and entertainment to the screen. But let's face it, the best part of the movie was Baymax. Last year Olaf and now Baymax. Talk about memorable characters and flat out hilarious physical comedy. Much like Olaf, his physical appearance brings a smile and chuckle to every motion (or attempt at motion) he gives us.<br/><br/>There's one particular scene which Baymax attempts to squeeze through a window and my sisters and I were unable to control ourselves it was so hilarious. I missed at least a minute of dialog because I had to literally wipe the tears from my face and recover from the last minute of laughing out loud. The rest of the team served heir purpose. I cant say that all of their jokes hit or even found them memorable. In fact I'm not sure I remember their names, but they still helped create a fun universe for us to enjoy for (hopefully) years to come. The film does get pretty dark at times and even borders a kids movie at times but I really cant complain with the results. I had a lot of fun at the theater and I can say it was well worth the ticket price.<br/><br/>+Baymax <br/><br/>+Hysterical <br/><br/>+Set's up a universe <br/><br/>+For all ages <br/><br/>-By the numbers<br/><br/>-Supporting characters need improvements <br/><br/>8.6/10"

","Just seen Big Hero 6 and really enjoyed it, another terrific animated film by Disney. I thought it was every bit as good as Wreck-It Ralph.<br/><br/>The film is somewhat a film of two halves, at the start it is all about the characters and it is absolutely hilarious in parts too. The second part of the film went a different direction as we saw a lot of action, which I wasn't expecting. But it was still good.<br/><br/>The animation is superb as usual and the voice cast are very good. I liked most of the characters in the film but Baymax is truly memorable, Baymax provided so many funny moments and in general is just a very lovable character.<br/><br/>A film that is a good mix of everything, sweet relationships between characters, very funny, cool gadgets, great action scenes and some amazing visuals.

","Having the opportunity to view this film twice really helped me get a perspective of the film that many may not have right now. This film is not FROZEN... it is not filled with songs or magical snowmen.<br/><br/>But this film has something else, it has family, friends, action , drama, and most of all a big robot named Baymax who will examine your funny bone and sense of humor . The film shows what kind of magic Disney can do with super hero's . The story is fast paced for the most part and the laughs and entertainment are high flying, that is if you like heights , but if you don't its OK because this movie knows how to get down also. <br/><br/>The characters work well with each other, kinda like the scooby doo crowd but twist that with a bit of incredibles and you have a fun filled, action packed movie that will delight boys and girls of all ages and keep parents happy that they took their child to see this.

","I didn't see this movie when it was first released back in December, I've read a few Big Hero 6 comic book issues, not a big fan. But the movie is really well done, you really care about the characters and their situations, the animation is superb, the story is really well constructed. The only ""problem"" with this movie is that it's the typical super hero origin story, there's really nothing new about it. However, this is not a problem since it's so well done. Without giving any spoilers, the movies gives us what Disney ALWAYS gives to the viewers, a tearjerker story. It's not as harsh as Bambi or the Lion King, but if you cry easily, get a lot of tissues along with the popcorn. Kids will love it as well as super hero fans. And there's some jokes here and there for the parents, they won't be bored with it. Big Hero 6 is a great time."
"squirrel_burst","8","30","45","15 December 2014"," A bit familiar at times, but It's one of this year's best animated films
","It dawned on me at the end of ""Big Hero 6"" that if we never get that sequel to ""The Incredibles"", a sequel to this film might satisfy me just fine. I thought it was very energetic, with some solid moments of heart and of humor, and some exciting action thrown in to boot. What's there not to love? It's the story of a young robotics genius named Hiro Hamada (voiced by Ryan Potter) who adopts his big brother's personal health care robot prototype, Baymax (Scott Adsit) and forms a superhero team with some of his fellow inventor/students to combat a masked super villain.<br/><br/>What I liked best about this movie were the characters and they dynamics between them. Baymax, so lovable and cuddly with that big squishy body and that calm temperament even in stressful situations was a riot and I genuinely grew to love him... Woops, there I go calling the robot a him. It's really just a defibrillator and a medical encyclopedia on legs, but I felt closely attached to the robot. What does that tell you about the movie when the mechanical device without a real personality becomes someone you would like to call your friend? Don't take that the wrong way though, I thought all of the characters were well fleshed out, and most importantly, intelligent and proactive. Hiro isn't given superpowers, he decides that he wants to become a hero and combat the threat in San Fransokyo. What does he do? He uses his brain to give himself gadgets and the tools he needs. He's a kid, but one that's as brilliant and inventive as the audience members. I felt the same about the other characters, even the goofy comic-book and kaiju enthusiast Fred (T.J. Miller). They're like real people because they had strengths and weaknesses and I felt like I got to know them as the movie went along. I was really happy to see that the female characters were tough all the way through. They didn't turn into damsels in distress when the action got going. I felt like this was a superhero movie with some ideas and it celebrated invention and creative thinking, that the characters learned from their mistakes and were able to think on their feet and improve instead of just being handed solutions out of thin air.<br/><br/>It's no surprise that the movie looks terrific, but it's worth mentioning that there are a lot of cool flying sequences and scenes where debris and stuff is flying at the camera and that in 3-D, it's pretty sweet. It's not in-your-face, but I was pretty impressed with it. There are some good action bits in this movie, particularly noteworthy is a long and very exciting car chase with our heroes driving with Baymax as they are being chased by the big bad in this movie. Speaking of which, without telling you too much about this villain, I really liked this guy's powers. When you've got six people going against a single guy, you have got to do some creative writing and planning to have the characters actually challenged and they did a good job here. The unique way they have this villain go about his bad guy ways really impressed me. I was excited any time he came on-screen, and not only because I was genuinely intrigued as to who (or maybe even what) was behind that kabuki mask.<br/><br/>If you're wondering if the best bits of comedy have been spoiled in the trailers, I would say... kind of. There are still some very funny moments, but if you haven't seen any trailers I would say just skip them and go straight into the movie blind to get the maximum amount of laughs. While you're there, make sure you stick around until the very end of the credits because there is a great little segment there you don't want to miss. Don't come in late either because while some of the best moments might have been spoiled for you with the clips on TV, you might not even be aware of the wonderful short ""Feast"" that is presented before the main feature. I thought it was absolutely wonderful. Why can't we get more of those before not just animated films, but every movie? I haven't really been blown away by any children's movies this year, not since ""The Lego Movie"" and way after that with ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"". I have to say ""Big Hero 6"" didn't have me screaming for joy once it was over, but I really enjoyed myself. It's solid family entertainment and if you're an adult, you can go watch it by yourself and you won't feel ashamed at all! I am still a little lukewarm about it overall, but you know what? That's me, and I feel like maybe I was just off that day or something because I can't think of anything I didn't like about the movie. I'd be happy to check it out one more time to see how I feel about it and I think that says a lot. I fully endorse you to check out ""Big Hero 6"". It's fun, it's colorful, it's funny, it's got some action and I was really touched at some of the more dramatic bits. It's not just for kids; adult can thoroughly enjoy this one too. I'm still laughing at some of the better gags. (3-D theatrical version on the big screen, December 9, 2014)"
"lisafordeay","9","41","64","5 February 2015"," Big Hero 6 is an awesome movie to come out this year from Walt Disney Animation Studios
","Just got back from watching Big Hero 6 and let me tell ya this film was awesome. It tells the tale of Hiro(voiced by Ryan Potter)who we see battling a man and his robot at the beginning of the movie and he of course wins the tournament. We see his brother Tadashi who rescues him and of course they get caught by the police and end up in jail,only to be bailed out by their aunt Cass(voiced by Maya Rudolph)who minds Hiro and Tadashi after the death of their parents 10 years ago so she has to mind them. Of course we later see Hiro going to college with Tadashi where we meet 4 new nerds including Honey Lemon,GoGo,Fred and Wasabi as Tadashi has created a new robot who can heal the injured called Baymax(voiced by Scot Adsit,who is the cutest thing you will ever come across in this film,I swear everyone is going to get a hold of a Baymax toy I guarantee it). <br/><br/>But tragedy strikes however when there is a fire at the college and Tadashi goes in to try and save Professor Callaghan(who is voiced by James Cromwell from Babe) who before the tragedy was impressed with Hiro's new creation which are like magnetic bolts.However when Tadashi tries to save Professor Callaghan he gets caught in the blaze and dies tragically,leaving a heartbroken Hiro behind. So Hiro ends up with Baymax and later becomes friends with him. But when we later meet a masked villain who stole Hiro's creation,and tries to destroy everything,its up to Hiro and his new friends to defeat the masked villain and discover who is behind the mask? Could it be Professor Callaghan and wants to seek revenge on Kali who we meet during the first 15 minutes of the film?<br/><br/>Bottom line I enjoyed this movie. The pacing is very fast so its a blink and you missed it scenario and the effects are awesome(SanFranTokyo is such an awesome place I love how they combined Tokyo and San Francisco together,to make an awesome city). The story is easy to follow as we have two brothers this time instead of two sisters like in Frozen(Disney's last classic movie),and the voice acting is brilliant,in fact I like how the voice acting isn't distracting,as in some films like let's say Tangled,you know who is behind the charchers voices,here in Big Hero 6 you don't picture someone behind a microphone so it was nice to have some new current actors that I have never heard of before like Genenis Rodriguez,Daniel Heeney and Scot Adsit(who I have never heard of before like I said).<br/><br/>But yeah Big Hero 6 is an awesome movie,if you love Marvel(since this is based on a Marvel comic) and some fast paced action than check it out.<br/><br/>Also stay tuned for the ending credits after the credits end,as we have a scene involving Fred and his father who you may know from somewhere. All I have to say is he is rather old and he appeared in the Spiderman movies both with Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. And he appeared in Chuck with Zachary Levi? <br/><br/>That's all for now<br/><br/>9.5/10<br/><br/>Verdict: Ladies and gentlemen may I present Disney's version of Toothless and Hiccup from How To Train Your Dragon,as Baymax and Hiro remind me so much of those two charcthers I have mentioned."

He finds out that his invention called microbots got stolen by a masked man, and he sets out to save the world with his friends.<br/><br/>""Big Hero 6"" has fun and really cute characters. Everyone is very adorable, especially the marshmallow robot who has unconventional superpowers. The best thing about this film is that the superpowers are technologically relatively sound, at least in the not too distant future, making the heroes and the plot look a little more realistic within the fantastical dream. I also like the mash up between San Francisco and Tokyo, making the city look like San Francisco with a Japanese twist. I enjoyed the film throughout, and there is not a moment of boredom."

","This is not the comic book I remembered.<br/><br/>Then again, I barely remembered the comic book at all. Goes to show how ""critically acclaimed"" it was. In typical Disney tradition, Disney studios took the title of an existing piece of work, and changed the heck out of it.what was originally a government sanctioned team of of super powered black ops operatives is now a bunch of genius teens named after food. Each character is recognisable modern high school stereotype: Wasabi goes from a chef with qi energy blades to the tough talking genius jock, Fred is the drawling slacker with a monster ""Fred-zilla"" suit, no longer the psychic who manifests a giant monster construct. Honey-Lemon keeps her power purse but goes from sexy-dressed secret agent to excitable genki girl-with-glasses. Gogo-Tamago loses her ex-convict background and power to turn into a high speed energy egg (hence the ""tamago"" name) and becomes your typical tough but quiet girl who is secretly loves an adrenaline rush (which she gets from her electromagnetic skating suit).<br/><br/>The biggest change is Hiro and Baymax, our main characters. Young Hiro Yamada finally finds his place among fellow tech-obsessed teens at his brother's university. With the help of his new found friends, he creates ""microbots"" which can form into any shape and are controlled by thought via a transmitter. A disaster robs Hiro of his invention and his beloved brother. Grieving the loss of Tadashi, Hiro accidentally activates Tadashi's project ""Baymax"", an inflatable health care robot who approaches Hiro as his patient. Hiro and Baymax form an awkward buddy relationship until news surfaces of a masked villain who appears to be using Hiro's microbots for crimes. Sensing that this masked man may be linked to his brother's death, Hiro sets out to investigate and take him down, with Baymax in tow whether he likes it or not. <br/><br/>Ah Baymax.......Disney's latest stroke of merchandising genius. Kids love their adorable non- human sidekicks. Olaf the snowman in FROZEN, Pascal and Maximus from TANGLED. And now Baymax, who gets stripped of his gritty comic book origin as a shape shifting robotic hulk with the brain of Hiro's dead father, who can transform into a monstrous demon form and kick butt. In the movie, he gets turned into an inflatable, huggable, balloon-bot with a simple programme to provide the best form of physical and emotional healthcare for his patient, even if he has little knowledge of human emotions outside of theory and data. His adorable look and innocent personality will be a big hit with kids. Children everywhere will be clamouring for Baymax balloons, Baymax floats, inflatable life sized ""hug-me"" Baymax, and if technology allows, an intractable ""talk-to-me"" Baymax toy. <br/><br/>Now putting adult cynicism aside, BIG HERO 6 does tackle some interestingly mature themes for kids' show. It is no doubt a tried and true superhero origin story fuelled by the death of a loved one. We've seen it in Spiderman, Batman, many times. The whole ""boy and his robot, forming a bond of family, and learning the value of human life"" thing was done with much more finesse and impact in James Cameron's TERMINATOR 2. But dig deeper into the narrative and even adults will find much to love about this movie.<br/><br/>We have have the theme of how one deals with loss, with various characters being put through the five stages of grief yet acting on those emotions differently based on one's values. On top of that, BIG HERO 6 deals with wish fulfillment of any kid's desire for the perfect friend. Baymax portrays love and care in its most simplest and innocent of forms. <br/><br/>Hiro on the other hand portrays a harsh world's tendency to force those closest to them into roles they were never meant for. His developmental journey with Baymax, from the awkward attempts at learning a secret handshake to the Baymax's straight faced earnest calm when faced with the gravest of situations, is a heartwarming and at times heart wrenching one as a boy and his robot forms an unbreakable brotherly bond. Love in its simplest form. Unconditional love that any child, past or present, secretly desires.<br/><br/>Digital artists and CGI aficionados too will desire BIG HERO 6's impressive computer generated imagery. Starting with the fictional city of San Fransokyo, the level of detail is astounding and almost photo-realistic. Leaves flutter in the wind, strands of hair react to movement. Although the character designs retain the simpler streamlined, big headed, style used in previous Disney CGI movie, the amount of care that went into crafting each model and animating it with the right sense of mass shows an amazing level of expertise in the field. <br/><br/>Bottom line is, BIG HERO 6 is good. It is colourful, action packed and simple enough for kids and inner children. Yet it packs a significant emotional wallop and some mature themes for those willing to dig deeper into the narrative. Visually, it is a fine piece of work to look at and just take in the details in the wonderful animation. Accompanied by a rousing electronic score by WRECK- IT RALPH'S Henry Jackman, BIG HERO 6 looks set to obscure its own middling comic book source material, (which is not entirely surprising since there was hardly any reprint of the comic aside from the hard-to-get single issues). Big on thrills, big on heart, big on technical achievement; that is BIG HERO 6. Oh and big bucks for Disney's merchandising department."

","Loosely based by the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name by Duncan Rouleau and Steven T. Seagle, the action comedy adventure is about a young brilliant robotics prodigy boy Hiro Hamada (Voiced by Ryan Potter), who finds the only hope of stopping a criminal plot that will threatens to destroy his fast-paced, high-tech home town city of San Fransokyo is become a superhero, himself. With the help of his health care provider and closest companion—a robot named Baymax (Voiced by Scott Adsit), Hiro joins forces with a reluctant team of first-time crime fighters on a mission to save their city. The film is directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams, and is the 54th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Studio Classics series. Much of the comic book original premise, is mostly gone, and replace by new concept. People like Silver Samurai, the bodyguard to X-Men/Avengers foe Madame Hydra/Viper & former X-Men team member Sunfire are omitted from here. Hiro is mostly the same from the comic book, but it still doesn't make sense why Hiro had to be orphan. It never play, much into the screen. Are all superheroes supposed to have their parents killed?? Kinda lame. Comic Characters like Honey Lemon (Voiced by Genesis Rodriguez) are recreated with new characteristics. Instead a hot blonde Japanese girl with the ability to access items from another dimension through her magic purse; she now a quirky chemistry Hispanic-Caucasian major, with the skills set to allow her to create a purse to mix different chemical elements into balls that she can use as explosives & traps. Her story about being the nano-bots inventor was also rip away. Other members like GoGo Tomago (Voiced by Jamie Chung), Wasabi (Voiced by Damon Wayans, Jr.) & Fred (Voiced by T.J Miller) had the same similar powers, but bits of their characters were change to meet the PG levels of Disney's key audience. The biggest change is Baymax from scary robotic dragon lizard monster to lovable inflatable robot built by Hiro's brother Tadashi (Voiced by Daniel Henney). I love the change. Much of the humor of the film, comes with the fact that Baymax is limited in human understanding and asking a lot of questions. This can be a bit annoying, but kids will love him due to the cute and hilarious kind nature. Some of the originals fans of the comic, might find this part, disappointing, but most of the new things, they added, works out for the best. There have been two releases of this comic in the mid-90s and 2008 and both were criticized as being racist and offensive. All the characters were Asian, but were based on stereotypes. Basically, it was Marvel trying to be Manga. When Disney approached Marvel and asked to make a movie on the comics, Marvel had pretty much forgotten about it and told them they could do whatever they wanted with the story and characters. This is why there's a lot more diversity among the members and that the Asian characters were portrayed respectively. Some things, I didn't like with the changes was, how the movie was set in a fictional city of San Fransokyo rather than Japan. The movie city name doesn't really exactly roll off the tongue, here. Plus, it's kinda disturbing in a way, as if the movie was saying, what would happen in Japan won World War 2 or the tech war of the 1980s? It didn't look right. I know, the filmmakers felt like they wanted to create a world; that would separate themselves from the other Disney's Marvels canon, but the movie portray Japanese culture, a bit too gimmicky. Did they feel that an American audience wouldn't see a film, set in Japan? I'm also disappoint that the movie didn't use more of the Anime-influenced animation style. There were hints of it, like how Hiro's hairstyle, but the film really stay away from that. The only part of the film that has it, is the end credits, as the characters are drawn in typical anime and manga format with Marvel comic pastels and printing. The movie is more Americanizes than ever. It's still nice to see the main characters in the film, are played by Japanese-Americans, you rarely see that in Western Culture Mainstream films. The voice acting is very well-played. All the actors did a good job. I even like the special guest cameo after the credits. It was pretty cool to see him, again. The music score was alright, but pretty forgettable. The movie is great to watch in 3D. The action scenes really do pop out! The animation is pretty beautiful to look at. It's nice to see that Disney Animation Studios is hitting home runs after years of disappointing films. For a while, it was very under looked by the power of Pixar Studios. I really enjoyed this movie, but I had more love for the characters than I did for the story. I hate to admit it, but the movie is a bit predictable and one-dimensional. I saw the twist coming, miles away. The American trailer focuses more on action and comedy, while the Japanese trailer delves more into the drama of the story. Still, there are bits in the second trailer that kinda spoils a lot of the things that supposed to make the film, more emotional and suspenseful. It was little to no surprise, what happen to Hiro's brother, but his part in the film plot drag really slowly. Big Hero 6 was released on DVD with the short film 'Feast' with it. The short film was alright. The movie has a ton of Easter eggs throughout the film of previous Disney Studios works so look for a lot of freeze-frame moments. It will give you a lot of replay value. Overall: I am satisfied with my care. It was a pretty good, movie."
"Alex_Roche","8","30","46","11 December 2014"," The Kind of Humour We've all been Waiting for
","The movie Big Hero 6 is a sweet film that packs lots of humour and some quick life lessons in less than two hours. The quirky humour from Baymax's cumbersome body never ceases to make people laugh, that being the core of the film itself. Even though the plot was quite predictable, it is a good film that you can just relax to and enjoy without having to think too much.<br/><br/>It, being the quirky-ness of Baymax, made the character extremely relatable as we have all had moments like he has. For instance, when he squeezes by the bed and knocks over some of the books or when he is so easily distracted from what he was doing and goes to try to watch the TV with Hiro's mother. Another scene being when Baymax turns himself into a portable heating unit that everyone then lies against. <br/><br/>The humour is quick and simple as to keep its audience entertained and amused as most comedians do whilst doing stand-up. For instance, take the scene where Hiro discovers that Baymax is in his room. First Baymax, being a robot that is designed to be ""your personal health-care companion"", inflates and his sheer size automatically becomes a handicap, as he isn't able to get to Hiro because there is a tight space between the bed and the table. Right after, Baymax is assessing Hiro having barely hurt himself just because he said the word ""Ow!"" Hiro falls backwards as Baymax tries to help him but then ends up having a shelf-worth of figurines fall onto him making him repeat the word ""Ow!"" a couple of times and Baymax responding each time with the same interrupted sentence ""On a scale of one to ""<br/><br/>Along with the ""Captain Obvious"" humour that is randomly thrown into the movie by the other characters. Especially in the case of Fred, the wannabe hero, who appears to be a young infant in an adult's body. <br/><br/>This movie was a great catch, because it took a normal kid's everyday life and threw in a couple of accidents and funny situations, which happens to everyone on a regular basis. What makes it funny is we are literally on the other side watching it happen to someone else and not ourselves.<br/><br/>However, with all this humour there was still some space to subtly squeeze in, as Baymax so skillfully showed us, a couple of life lessons. In regards to whether it is worth your time going for higher studies, as well as not accidentally putting your own interest before others'.<br/><br/>Overall, fun movie to watch with the family and have a good laugh all together."
"leonblackwood","8","12","16","30 May 2015"," Brilliant Movie! 8/10
","Review: I really enjoyed this movie! It's got something for the whole family and the different characters and great animation, added to this very well put together movie. Its about a little boy called Hiro whose a technology geek along with his brother who builds a huge marshmallow type robot to cure human beings when there not well. After sadly losing his brother to a massive fire, Hiro goes into depression and seeks answers to why the fire really happened. He then uses the robot (Baymax) and his new geeky college friends to get to the bottom of how he lost his brother and he finds out that it's all due to a chemical that he had made, which gets into the wrong hands. There's fast action throughout the movie, with comedy and some emotional moments. The different geeks in the squad, all brought great elements to the group and Haymax made me laugh. The vibrant colours and great animation also made this Disney spectacular, a joy to watch and I can truly understand why it made such a profit at the box office. Its not very often that I have watched an animation movie that has something for adults as well as the little kiddies so this movie definitely gets the thumbs up from me. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Disney have really stepped up there movies lately with movies like Brave, Frozen and Wreck-It Ralph but they have still brought out some duds like the Princess and the Frog, Tarzan and the awful Planes: Fire & Rescue movie. Now that Marvel have moved to Disney, they have really smashed the box office, which is what keeps the big executives in Hollywood begging for more. With Frozen and the Avengers franchise making over a billion dollars, Disney have really come back with a bang and I'm sure that this movie will be reaching the billion dollar mark soon. I just hope that they don't ruin this great concept with a awful sequel! Anyway, I didn't hear any familiar voices throughout the film, so I can't really comment on that but the mannerisms and face expressions of the characters were brilliant, even though Baymax didn't have a mouth or a nose. The main character, Hiro, had some anime traits which I have seen in some of the old classics like Akira and the Ghost in the Shell and the movement of the microbots brought a dark flavour to this happy go lucky movie. <br/><br/>Budget: $165million Worldwide Gross: $652.1million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their animation movies about a squad of geeks who want to take down a masked, evil-doer who has stolen the geeks chemicals to work against them. 8/10"

","We are lucky to be witnesses to the second ""Disney Renaissance"" at this moment in history. For anyone that doesn't know what that means, do you remember when Disney had a golden streak of winning movies in the early to mid 90's? (Aladding, Little Mermaid, Lion King etc.). Well, that is basically what is happening now. In the span of 5 short years, Disney have given us Tangled, Wreck it Ralph, Frozen and now Big Hero 6. It's finally happened. Disney have gone back to their roots to give us their traditional brand of storytelling in the contemporary age. I have no reservations when I say that this may be the best film Disney have made in 20 years. From a Disney standpoint, all the traditional characters are there and even though they seem stereotypical at first, I can promise that not a single character is unlikeable or annoying in the slightest. YOu have the young, troubled protagonist with the biggest story arc, the supportive older brother, the kooky and caring aunt (who has some of the funniest lines) and the eclectic group of friends - but almost none of that matters because ""Baymax"" steals the entire show! That's right, the plush, huggable, naive, walking marshmallow of a robot that you saw on the poster and in the trailers gets all the best lines, adds 90% of the film's humour and steals every scene that he's in. In a sense, this might be the ""Aladdin"" of the second renaissance, in that the supporting character is the greatest thing in the movie, just like the late Robin Williams' Genie was. What makes it even better is that the main character (Hiro) and Baymax have a great on screen relationship and genuine bond that makes Baymax feel like a real character and not just a bumbling robot sidekick. <br/><br/>When it comes to the plot, I won't spoil anything, but I will say that this is Disney's first (and hopefully not last) attempt at a superhero movie, origins and all. In conclusion, I implore you to see this movie, whether you love Disney, Superhero movies or just exciting, entertaining movies in general. Big Hero 6 is everything a good family movie should be - heartfelt and touching, exciting, compelling and utterly hilarious to the very last joke."
"tmaranhao","9","28","43","5 December 2014"," Oscar Worthy
","I know for a fact that it will be nominated for Best Animation at the 2015 Oscars, no doubt. After the princess high I am sure everyone was on after Frozen, it was nice to see a Disney film with a male lead and about hi tech/engineering (Obviously not the first, I just enjoyed seeing this). This film had action, enough emotion to make you want to cry, and some seriously funny lines that had most of the adults in the audience laughing. Disney has really found it's way of really being for all ages, I went with my boyfriend and there was just as many older couples as families. This movie was not just a film to entertain, it was a push for kids to create, Who didn't want to build their own Baymax after watching this?!"
"tavm","10","32","50","24 November 2014"," Big Hero 6 was a very awesome Disney animated experience!
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen this twice before and liked it very much. So did I after viewing this-what an awesome display of a bunch of science nerds becoming superheros after some tragic occurrences that happen early on. Baymax, a rubber robot, is also on hand to help his human counterparts to set things right. I didn't watch this in 3-D so when certain scenes came on, I winced a little in not being able to do so. Still, this was such a great mix of humor and action and had very likable characters, I mostly didn't care, one way or another! I mean, this was quite an awesome experience, I was simply just glad for the ride! So on that note, Big Hero 6 is highly recommended. Oh, and don't miss the after-ending credits sequence, it's a great hoot!"
"calvind-4","9","18","26","21 May 2015"," This movie had a major influence on my recent life.
","And for all of its flaws, that is a significant accomplishment. On top of that, the movie is directed by Don Hall, who happens to have co-directed Winnie the Pooh (2011), one of my favourite kid's films. And the music comes from Henry Jackman, who also composed the music for that same. So I'd think we're in good hands.<br/><br/>Like most Marvel comics and movies, Big Hero 6 is defined by tragedy in the protagonist's life (namely, Hiro losing his brother), which leads through a series of events which creates the team of crime-fighters. Admittedly, the team itself is not really the main focus: it's really mostly Baymax and Hiro. Baymax, being the main attraction, is highly suited to his built purpose, and of course, is pretty darn adorable. Hiro's pretty awesome too. We do get a handful of scenes with his brother Tadashi too, and he seems like a nice guy. So much so, that the scenes with Hiro trying to cope with his death really got to me. I mean... REALLY. In fact I'm still pretty bummed that Tadashi had to die the way he did.<br/><br/>I cared about these people. Immensely. I wanted them to succeed, and that's the important part of any movie, even a Disney one. This caring forms sequences that may be TOO intense for some young children, like Wall-E, one of the only films that made me cry, and at the same time I hailed as one of Pixar's finest.<br/><br/>The film certainly does not fail in the visual department, either. As the name ""San Fransokyo"" might imply, it's a futuristic amalgamation of both Eastern and Western cultures, and it is certainly a sight to behold. It takes a vision of the future we've seen before and makes it look fresh and innovative, to say the least. The attention to detail is astounding, in fact it might need repeated viewings just to take it all in! Which, of course, might prove somewhat distracting from the story. The story might not be much of a surprise to you, but then, with these origin stories, what is surprising?<br/><br/>In short: Big Hero 6 is worthy of its Oscar. Just about. I'm just a bit saddened that most reviews on IMDb don't share my sentiment on that. And I'm also annoyed that they delayed the film in UK cinemas just to put together a cameo of two British YouTubers! Come on guys, stop wasting time and give us our masterpiece!!! You know it's a masterpiece just as well as I do!"
"mober1996","10","42","68","2 January 2015"," The best movie since Guardians Of The Galaxy
","Big Hero 6 is a big shot through the heart (with a taste of Bon Jovi) to all of the other films of this year. Being one of the first major collaborations between Disney and Marvel, Big Hero 6 delivered one hell of a blast in the box office to become one of the best movies of this year. Keeping the lovable Disney style with the typical Marvel taste gave this movie a big jump in quality. It looked gorgeous, it felt smooth and savory, and I enjoyed every second of it.<br/><br/>Mixing a beautiful visual quality with its glorious soundtrack, it felt like I was watching Guardians of the Galaxy. Having a great cast of characters who had their wonderful personalities and visible flaws (as all people do, this is personal flaws, not flaws in the actual characters), it felt like I was watching a mini Tony Stark trying to build his way to solve all of his problems. The movie was a perfect length, having a quick introduction into who everyone was (with no 20 minute backstory *jumps up and flails in excitement*), and then it got to the problem. It was on point and direct all the way through, just as well as having fun along the way.<br/><br/>I only had one, very very VERY slight problem with this movie. It was how Hiro (the main character) didn't come across as to who the supposed villain was, even though he could build an army of neuro-transmitted microbots in a garage. And how quickly the scene seemed when he came up with the solution to fight the problem with his friends. Very very slight personal issues and nothing that reflected in on my review of this film.<br/><br/>Big hero six is a clever, cute, funny, and VERY creative take on the modern day superhero film. The movie took itself to great heights and earn its spot among some of my favorite movies of all time. This was a movie made for anyone of any age, and that is a hard thing to pull off. Final note, stay until after the credits. (It's a Marvel movie.)<br/><br/>Final Review Score: 10/10"

","Big Hero 6 is a witty and hilarious superhero flick without the recent trend of nasty grittiness. Visually engaging, the movie is easily accessible and will entertain general audience. Its many heartfelt moments as well as genuine comedy elevate the movie into the caliber of Disney's greats. The plot moves fast as it shows a lighter take on superhero formula, it never presses too much or heavy handed on its approach. While Disney is always known to showcase visual in fantasy setting, it's nice to see the vista changes to modern city of San Fransokyo, as the name suggests, an oriental version of San Fransisco.<br/><br/>For those who have been exposed to horde of superhero movies of recent time, it's easy to see how the plot moves, especially as an origin story. Big Hero 6 makes the expected journey fun with plenty of humor, mostly fat jokes in expense of Baymax, the inflatable marshmallow robot. Viewer might predict the story, but still amused nonetheless. The assembly of the team deserves a credit for introducing many characters, presentable enough to be memorable but still delicately manages to produce a sense of camaraderie. Unlike many superheroes who have the luxury of a full movie or series, these guys must share the spotlight, yet they're all feel pretty welcomed in their own quirky ways.<br/><br/>Graphic-wise the animation is great. While there are other mediums with more realistic visual, the movie delivers action in just the right balanced tone of fantasy and modern contemporer. It's definitely vibrant with colors, design is impeccable, and the movement looks comically organic. Disney has reached the point where it can dazzle with 3D the same as it did decades ago with hand drawn picture and still moves audience with heartfelt story.<br/><br/>Despite all the action and flair, Big Hero 6 is centered on friendship. It's easily enjoyable as anyone will find something to relate and be thoroughly delighted."

His brother Tadashi, also a genius already built a 'personal nurse' robot Baymax, manages to persuade him to join the ""Nerd School"" SFIT college with Tadashi's friends, Honey Lemon, Wasabi, Gogo and Fred. At SFIT's tech fair, the Hiro amazes everybody, even the great Professor Callaghan with his micro-bots invention. Commanded telepathically through a radio transmitter, the micro-bots can be erected to structures very fast. Hiro gains an entrance to SFIT with it. But later that night there's a fire in the SFIT hall. Tadashi goes in to save Callaghan but the building explodes. Hiro drowns in sorrow of Tadashi's death, but his shout of pain initiates Baymax's nurse protocol. Hiro finds last remaining micro-bot trying to find it's way to rest of the micro-bots, which is quite impossible since the other micro-bots should have perished in the SFIT fire. <br/><br/>To help Hiro feel better Baymax then follows the micro-bot, with Hiro tailing behind. They find that someone is manufacturing a lot more of micro-bots. Soon a man in a kabuki mask uses the micro-bots to attack them. Hiro and Baymax narrowly escape. Hiro then creates some combat alterations to Baymax and goes back to the warehouse where they met the villain. The four Tadashi's friends come after Baymax contacted them, and again they escape the kabuki mask villain. The four of them eventually agree to help Hiro to find the villain, who's suspected at setting the fire at SFIT. Hiro also make combat costumes for him and his friends. The upgraded sensors and Baymax finds the villain's whereabouts, in an island. Lurking about the island, the six find a video of Alistair Krei, the tech mogul whose offer Hiro denied at the tech fair, testing a teleportation machine that goes wrong. The villain appears and attacks the six, but their cooperation manages to knock his mask off, revealing Callaghan inside it. Hiro goes into a vengeful rage, taking out Tadashi's nurse commands chip off Baymax, leaving only Hiro's combat chip in him. <br/><br/>The five manages to disrupt Baymax and put Tadashi's chip back in. Hiro leaves with Baymax, and then he repairs his broken sensor. But Baymax denied Hiro access to take out the nurse chip again and shows Hiro videos of Tadashi building Baymax, which then sobers Hiro out of his rage. The six then goes after Callaghan, whose now targeting Krei. They manage to lure Callaghan's micro-bots into the teleportation portal Callaghan built himself. But the portal is still engaged and sucking things up. Baymax's sensor picked up a woman, Callaghan's daughter from the video, still alive in the portal. Hiro and Baymax go inside it and manage to locate the girl. But they get stuck by building debris, damaging Baymax's jets. After Hiro says Baymax's shut down protocol key phrase, Baymax sacrifices himself by shooting his fist that's propelling the girl's pod with Hiro on it to safety. The five are sad that Baymax didn't make it. But then Hiro finds Tadashi's nurse chip on the fist, and rebuild Baymax.<br/><br/>The story is nicely developed to a good balance. Being of a Marvel superhero origin which is now a trending theme for movies, but being developed as an animation which largely associated with kids' movies, the story can really grasp the best of both worlds. The story gets to be nicely emotional but not to the point of making the viewers cry. The movie also can be a nice expansion of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, although I should also say that it's intelligently positioned as remote as there's still possibilities to link the live action movies with this movie.<br/><br/>The movie is also hilariously funny, I must add. It seems like the creators of Frozen and Wreck-it Ralph can really have a larger space in this movie to make it into a funny and enjoyable movie. The comedic moments are spread evenly all through the entire duration of the movie, mainly centered on Baymax and his reactions to the world and Hiro's interactions with him. This movie makes even the supposedly dangerous moments into very funny and laughable.<br/><br/>The voice acting quality is very nice. Scott Adsit really did his job well that Baymax can really be that funny and seemingly without knowing that he is. Ryan Potter nicely fills in the shoes for the main character, capturing all Hiro's emotions into the voices. All other actors and actresses are also of top end list of the Hollywood roster of younger talents, which makes the voice acting quite a completion for this movie.<br/><br/>For me, a 7 out of 10 score for Bg Hero 6 (2014) is a suiting rating. It is very enjoyably entertaining with quite a solid story and very funny scenes all around it. It also retains much of the Marvel superhero movies' trademark signatures."
"Troy_Campbell","9","26","40","28 December 2014"," A non-stop joyride.
","Sure to be the mega-hit of the holidays, Disney's futuristic tale ticks all of the right boxes: it's funny, smart, charming and exhilarating. Set in San Fransokyo – a clever amalgamation of American and Oriental style – we follow mourning teen-genius Hiro (Ryan Potter) as he bonds with his late brother's friends and scientific creation, Baymax. With an irresistibly huggable design, amusing voice (thanks to Scott Adsit) and delightful demeanour, Baymax provides the lion's share of laughs and, ultimately, is the star of the show. Not as memorable as the cuddly, inflatable robot, the humans are a mixed bag. Whilst lead protagonist Hiro and his brother Tadashi (the sort of older sibling we all want, voiced by Daniel Henney) are likable and fleshed out, their ragtag group of mates are cardboard cut-outs and the pair of scientists vying for Hiro's invention (awesomely conceived micro-bots) are clichéd and one-dimensional. But underdeveloped supporting players and it's somewhat generic ending are minor gripes, as Big Hero 6 segues from electrifying action sequences to hilarious comedic set-pieces, via the occasional touching moments, with absolute ease, resulting in a non-stop joyride. A wonderful Christmas treat from the Mouse House that'll be a smash with young'uns and, possibly even more, with their parents."
"appledreams4","9","26","40","27 December 2014"," One of the best superhero films of the year
","I have always loved Disney movies. From the classics (Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and so many more excellent films) to the more recent ones like Tangled, Wreck-it Ralph and Frozen, they all are able to capture my heart, and one of the reasons is that Disney always has a knack of creating really lovable and memorable characters - Scar, Jafar, Olaf etc, they are all classic characters that we love. And in Big Hero 6, Disney successfully creates yet another totally adorable character with the name Baymax.<br/><br/>I have not ever read the Big Hero 6 comics, but after some research on Google, I found that the Baymax in the comics is a kind of humanoid battle machine that can transform into some other forms to enhance his fighting skill, and that Baymax sure is not cute. However, the new Baymax reimagined by the Disney crew turned that (a little frightening) Baymax into a family friend - a fat, inflatable marshmallow/balloon medical robot whose sole purpose of creation is to heal and cure. This decision must be one of the best decisions made by Disney, because that fat, inflatable marshmallow/balloon medical robot is what keeps the whole movie going and glues our eyes to the screen. His mere appearance mines laughter, and I am not ashamed to admit that I cried like a little baby for his ultimate sacrifice.<br/><br/>Basically, the movie is about a boy, Hiro, team up with a bunch of ""nerds"" to fight an evil force that threatens the peace of the city San Fransokyo. While this plot may sound cliché, Big Hero 6 exceeds the common superhero genre in so many ways, the initial driving force of the creation of this band of ""nerd"" heroes is to catch the bad guy, same with other superhero films, but that quickly converts to an obsession - Hiro's obsession to not only catch the bad guy, but to avenge his brother's death. And eventually he is able to let go of that because of his friends and more importantly, because Baymax does not only protect him from physical injuries, but also heals his soul. <br/><br/>Also, I am utterly impressed by the city of San Fransokyo. Disney single-handedly created a place so vibrant and so rich, and it's the first Disney film to incorporate such cultural diversity, and as an Asian, I am really proud of that.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 is a movie so sincere and so heartwarming, yes, sometimes I really do hope the film would be less noisy, but I will still recommend this film to anyone I've come across with. And remember, if you are feeling sad or depressed or lonely at the moment, Big Hero 6 would be your movie of choice, because I am certain that while Baymax is healing the soul of Hiro, he can heal yours too."

","Great, amazing, excellent. I feel lucky that I got my daughter to watch this film and I have equally enjoyed it. One of the best of Disney's. The story kept the interest during the whole film. Laugh, emotion, action, message, friendship, family, inspiration had it all. Fully recommended to parents with children but anyone will enjoy it. Really worth it. <br/><br/>What touched me the most was the message tried to pass on of getting of the chair and fight for a purpose. Firstly the effort of the older brother, to help his brother stop wasting his bright mind and get him to the university. Then Hiro himself tries to fight the loss of his brother with the help of the robot and the other friends.<br/><br/>Scored it 10 without thinking. One of the best films I have seen, among all categories, not only the cartoons one."
"MartinHafer","9","27","42","2 January 2015"," Terrific.
","I am not a huge fan of CGI films. Now I am not saying I dislike them, but I do feel that sometimes there are too many and too many mediocre computer generated cartoons. However, I think that ""Big Hero 6"" is definitely a welcome film to the genre. Why? Because the film is absolutely beautiful, as the graphics are just amazing. Additionally, while I also think there have been way too many superhero movies, this one is different enough to make it worth seeing.<br/><br/>The film is about a brilliant young man named Hiro. Hiro, though incredibly bright when it comes to robotics, is directionless until his older brother introduces him to his research facility at the local university. To win a scholarship to the place, Hiro creates an amazing robotic system--one so amazing that someone is willing to kill to get it. And, once they've stolen it, Hiro uses his brother's medical robot, Baymax, to help punish the baddie and restore justice and niceness to the world.<br/><br/>While the film DOES feature the usual sort of finale (the weakest part of the film--though I do understand why it's there), so much of what leads up to it is nice. I liked the characters, the back story and the writing. It's really very clever in places--such as their wonderful use of Stan Lee in his cameos since this one is so unusual AND he appears twice in the film (so stay and watch ALL the film or you'll miss it). Well worth seeing."

","Disney's CG animation department is on a huge winning streak. With the success of 'Wreck It Ralph' and 'Frozen', Disney is back in the animation game after a long absence while Pixar did their thing. Dinsey's latest animated adventure is called 'Big Hero 6', and is based off an old Marvel Comics title. I can safely say that 'Big Hero 6' is a big winner and continues Disney's streak of success.<br/><br/>This heartwarming and thrilling story takes place in a futuristic city called San Fransokyo and follows a young boy with a pension for science and a gentle vinyl balloon robot that acts as a Professional Health Care Provider. Directors Don Hall and Chris Williams have perfectly concocted a great group of characters and woven a storyline that appeals to all ages and sexes. While yes, there are robots and superheroes, there is also a high level of emotional issues to keep you invested deeply with every character.<br/><br/>The young boy we follow is a 14-year old Wiz-Kid who graduated High School at 13 named Hiro (Ryan Potter), who would rather enter his BattleBot in underground contests for money than get a real education. His older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) tries to keep him on the right track by showing him his college, lab, inventions, and friends. But an accident puts everything on hold and Hiro takes solace in Tadashi's newest invention - Baymax (Scott Adsit), a bit vinyl balloon robot who acts as a gentle doctor.<br/><br/>However, this accident might not be an accident, but rather homicide, and Hiro takes upon himself to solve the mystery when he comes across a super villain with a Kabuki mask. In order to take down this villain, he upgrades Baymax and uses the help of his new friends GoGo (Jamie Chung), Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.), Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez), and Fred (T.J. Miller), who all become fun superheroes to take out the bad guys. Each character is distinguishable on their own and each pack some good laughs.<br/><br/>The big action sequences are thrilling and a lot of fun, but don't pack big pop that previous Pixar movies have. The animation and CG effects are quite amazing and the part Tokyo, part San Francisco skyline is gorgeous, making each color pop off screen. There is enough heart and soul in 'Big Hero 6' to appease every age here, and enough laughs to go around twice.<br/><br/>And don't forget to stick around till after end credits for a spectacular sequence with a big cameo. Also, the film is preceded by another excellent animated short film called 'Feast', which shows the span of a family's life through the eyes of their pet dog. It's amazing and Oscar worthy.

","I enter the theatre and donned the 3D glasses at exactly the movie start-time. Sitting in the front row, I witness the Disney previews featuring 3D animations of tomorrow-land concepts. The accompanying short intro-film is called ""Feast""... about Winston, the Dog Star of dog food. A concept for serious coders... how to feed the visual binary star in the centre stage. <br/><br/>The feature presentation then begins with glowing images of San Fransokyo, and the city lights up with the star, Hiro Himatta, a prodigy robot-builder kid, reading his robotic creation for a competitive robot-against-robot fighting tournament. After his win in the tournament, Hiro is picked up by his older brother, and he is warned that with a robot-building gift like his, he should be preparing for college and not just gambling. <br/><br/>Hiro's older brother, Tadishi Hamatta, is attending the Robot School in the SanFransokyo Institute of Technology. Hiro is introduced to the other students and the serious coding challenges in the robotics development industry. The industry needs a standard that is tangible and substantial... a standard for interface and communication that will enable such marvels as medical micro-bots. At the core of the industry is the heartfelt desire to help and heal people. Developers are serious about developing robotic hardware and software that pushes the boundaries of interface and shapes the future with bright, great ideas and memes that are easy to grasp. A paradigm-shift is gradually occurring. Developers are looking to see robotics from new angles, to communicate based upon a binary outlook, and reap the rewards of this sweet technology. Science... particularly robotics, enables young heroes like Hiro Himatta to self-actualize, even upload neuro- signals, leading to seemingly limitless applications. The only limit is the human imagination. <br/><br/>With some development, the tech at the core will soon become revolutionary and world-renowned. There are corporate-buyers ready to buy out the nerds, and sometimes it turns out that humans are the tragedy and robots are the only remaining hope. If developers can build robots with this code at the core, robots will be enabled to save the day. Tragedy strikes and Tadishi Hammita, Hiro's older brother, dies in a fire accident at the college. That tragedy becomes the core of the struggle for justice in the heart and mind of Hiro. Hiro seeks to build a brighter future for humanity using his innovations, and to implement a code that could make him and his friends become immortals. Hiro will be enabled to help a lot of people in the process of realizing his dream. And so the plot and the struggle continue with suspense and thrills, and a few plot- twists that are surprising and revealing of the true inner motivation of Hiro and his pals. The code representing the lineage of robot designers is preserved, and there is a happy ending and an invitation for more action and intrigue for a potential sequel."

But when Hiro discovers his own creation being used for evil purposes, he transforms Baymax & his friends into a band of high-tech heroes to take on the person responsible.<br/><br/>Directed by Don Hall & Chris Williams, the first half is filled with lots of creativity, passion & ideas that are seamlessly blended with elements of humour which is then presented in a very polished manner while the other half takes a more generic route but nevertheless succeeds in maintaining a fine balance between its emotional & humorous aspects to wrap itself up as one of the most polished films of the year.<br/><br/>Coming to technical aspects, the 3D animation is absolutely gorgeous for each frame is rendered in meticulous detail with expert use of colour contrast, saturation & sharpness to provide an intensely vibrant look to the whole picture. Camera-work is brilliantly carried out for it's pretty dynamic in the action sequences while more relaxed during dramatic moments. Editing briskly paces the whole story while Henry Jackman's score further enhances the experience.<br/><br/>Yet the best thing about Big Hero 6 remains its interesting set of perfectly voiced & finely written characters with the constantly developing bond between Hiro & Baymax serving as the core ingredient that makes this film work on so many levels. Baymax is the standout character here for he's simply impossible to not love and his cuddly, cushy & innocent appearance blended with soothing voice brings a charm of its own to make him an instantly huggable character.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Big Hero 6 is a sweet, funny, touching & colourful tale of companionship that's richly animated, skilfully narrated & emotionally satisfying and has something in store for viewers of all ages. Sophisticated in all departments, filled with heart & compassion, and exquisitely demonstrating the best of both Disney & Marvel in one action-packed feature that's full of awe & admiration, Big Hero 6 continues Disney's resurgence towards its lost glory & is one of this year's finest animated flicks.<br/><br/>P.S.

His eagerness to learn new things about human body and emotions is flawless. Hiro is the antagonist of the movie who realizes that intelligence is not enough alone without friends and family.A must watch animation of the year.Yet, there are some negative parts.

","The Sierra Nevada Movie Club members don't tend to show up in large numbers for horror movies or animated films. However I had heard buzz about Big Hero 6 in regards to being nominated for best animated picture and I am one of those weirdos that enjoys seeing all the nominated films before the Oscars. Also the movie had been out awhile and this further kept some of our movie going numbers down. Four of our group came out for this one on our usual Tuesday night movie meet up.<br/><br/>I went into the theater with mixed expectations. The previews had not won be over but as I said, I had heard good things about it. Also just because a movie has been deemed ""good"" doesn't mean that I will enjoy it. I was under the impression that the humor and story would be a bit too childish for my sensibilities. However, I was mistaken. It may have been the influence of the rum in my big gulp size cup, but I felt although the humor, characters, and plot would appeal more to children and was too geared toward adults, it was, nonetheless, a film with universal appeal, nether too simplistic nor too complicated. It was sweet without being sappy. It was emotional without being heavy handed. It was formulaic only to the extent that it may be one of those instances that the sequel may be better than the original. The original has to introduce you to the ""team"", where hopefully the sequel can build off of the personalities we have been introduced to and give us a full formed adventure. The team of course being the Big Hero 6: Baymax- the squishy robot programmed for health care, Hiro Hamada- the main protagonist of the film and robotics genius, Go Go Tomago- the tomboyish tough girl that gets around via wheels attached to her feet, Wasabi- the intimidating looking Rasta locked martial artist that gets spooked easily, Honey Lemon- the upbeat alchemist, and Fred- the sign twirling fan boy in a lizard suit.<br/><br/>The film takes great liberties with the comic changing characters, locations, and the general look. It is not one of the best recent films to come from Disney animation, but it is good and compared to some of the other properties, lends itself well toward sequels. If you are feeling like watching something light that is likely to keep you in a marshmallowy good mood, check out Big Hero 6.<br/><br/>Blarv Score: 7.7/10"

However, Tadashi doesn't approve. Tadashi tells Hiro to join the university & work in the robotics lab with him, Fred(T.J.

Hiro is also introduced to Tadashi's inflatable health care robot, Baymax(Scott Adsit). <br/><br/>Big Hero 6 is a mind blowing movie! There's something in it for everyone. Apart from being an animated movie, it's a superhero movie as well. This film made me laugh, cry, provided thrills, is visually stunning, suspenseful & action packed. It's a complete package. The animation is first-rate. The 3D in the movie is outstanding. San Fransokyo is a flawless fusion between San Francisco & Tokyo. However, the reason that this movie is the best animated movie of the year is, the inflatable balloon-like fat robot, Baymax. Baymax steals the show in every scene he's in. He's the most adorable robot in film history! In one scene, Baymax will make you laugh & in the next, he'll make you tear up. All this is very impressive considering that Baymax's face consists of two cameras & a line in between them. Scott Adsit should be given half of the credit for making Baymax so lovable. The other half of the credit should go to the Disney animators, for creating this chubby, caring, bear hug-able robot. Ryan Potter is brilliant as Hiro. Daniel Henney is great as Tadashi. T.J. Miller is hilarious as Fred. Jamie Chung is good as Go Go. Damon Wayans Jr. is effective as Wasabi. Genesis Rodriguez is impressive as Honey Lemon. James Cromwell, Alan Tudyk & Maya Rudolph are excellent as, Robert Callaghan, Alistair Krei & Cass respectively. The animated short called Feast that was shown before the movie is amazing.

","Disney does it again! Finally, back on track with films worth watching. Big Hero 6 delicately balances humor, tragedy, coming off age, loss, and grief for it's adolescent viewers. All the while cleverly wrapping the film in a bankable comic/manga/ superhero/marvel/ xmen eque good vs. evil storyline. Hero, a classic underdog, is wracked by grief worth the loss of his brother. This super smart Hero, aptly named, it's a scrawny pubescent boy. His friends are a ragtag bunch of equally as smart boys and girl. The quest for truth and triumph of good over evil, even if wrapped in grief and loss make this a story that is entertaining and action-packed for the kids and thoughtful and question evoking enough for parents that may or may not have found a pathway to do so previously. Disney seems to have gotten this particular, multilevel, emotional based story down without the use of magic or processes. A fact that this reviewer finds completely refreshing. On the track, initially, worth Frozen, Disney has finally broken free of 'Happily Ever After' and 'Someday My Prince Will Come'. I,for one, find it empowering that the lead is a boy. And the 'hero' is him, himself. Finding his voice and power via his brother's creation BayaMax, Hero actually winds up dealing with his grief and loss by saving himself and letting go of the guilt he feels as a result of his brother's untimely, accidental death. Disney could keep this formidable formula up and running for a series with this cast of characters. There would be a demographic, for sure. But, one wonders, if this was just an incidental hit. Seemingly, the tried and true process algorithm is their bread and butter. But worth Big Hero 6,we as parents, get some meat! Encouraging more films like this!"
"estebangonzalez10","8","23","37","26 December 2014"," Another Disney classic in the making with memorable and touching characters
","""Hello. I am Baymax, your personal health-care companion.""<br/><br/>I can't avoid going into a Walt Disney Animation Studio film with high expectations considering they very rarely get it wrong, especially when John Lasseter is involved in the production. Big Hero 6 is their latest animated film, and this time they teamed up with Marvel so there was much more to get excited about. Big Hero 6 delivers everything it promised in the trailers: fun characters, stunning visuals, entertaining action scenes, and a lot of heart. Let me begin with the aspect of the film I found most fun: the characters. This is basically an origin superhero story about characters I had not heard about. They really don't have special powers, but they are science enthusiasts who come up with great inventions. The lead character, Hiro Hamada, is all about making easy money as he destroys his opponents in robot battles, but when he meets his brother's friends who are all working on cool science experiments he wants in. His brother has created a personal health-care companion that looks more like a giant marshmallow than an actual robot. Its name is Baymax, and is by far the most endearing character in the film. Since it takes everything literally most of the comedy comes from it misinterpreting things (Marvel always has some character who behaves in this way) and the sweet way in which it reacts to different moments. It is the heart and soul of this film and the chemistry between it and Hiro is what elevates this film and makes it more endearing. Pretty much every character in this film has some sort of distinct personality and they all have their comedic moments. Big Hero 6 has its emotional moments as well as we deal with the death of one of the characters. It is standard at times and even predictable in the direction its heading, but it never ceases to entertain with a fun action-packed and comedic pacing. You have the superhero element on one hand and the touching relationship between Baymax and Hiro on the other. So there are several reasons why you can find it pleasing. It's hard to avoid comparison with The Incredibles and I think it does live up to the same level of enjoyment we got from those memorable characters as well. <br/><br/>So on the one hand you get plenty of action scenes because this is a superhero animated film where they face a mysterious villain, while on the other it remains emotionally engaging and touching with the center core relationship between this personal health-care companion and Hiro. The film balances these moments extremely well and thanks to the memorable characters Big Hero 6 will surely become another classic from Disney Studios. I've focused my review on the narrative structure of the film, but I can't leave out how good the visuals are here. The city where the action takes place is San Fransokyo, a combination of San Francisco and Tokyo. The architecture from both cities is combined here and makes for a gorgeous to look at futuristic city. I loved the way in which they blended these two styles together and the film looks amazing and culturally diverse. Add that to the charismatic characters and you have an instant classic."
"whyboy","8","23","37","7 December 2014"," Big Hero 6 Was a Blast
","From the makers of animated successes/cash cows, Frozen and Wreck It Ralph, comes Disney's first dive into their recently acquired bin of Comic Book IP, Marvel's Big Hero 6. Now seeing as Big Hero 6 was based off the comic book of the same name, first things first, does it resemble the comic at all? No. <br/><br/>Thankfully it seems this is a reimagining of sorts, so no outside context is required to understand the movie. It's just a story of a little brother's depression and how one overcomes grief. The best part of the movie's story is with the brotherly relationship between Hiro, Tadashi and oddly Baymax. Disney just seems to have a real understanding of sibling connections. Like with Lilo and Nami, Elsa and Anna and now Hiro and Tadashi, all these connections feel natural to watch and enjoy. And after the guaranteed tragedy this brotherly motif gives us a more subdued story of grief from Hiro, wanting to bottle up his sadness rather than express anything. But his brother's protector role transfers to his hug-gable invention Baymax, and the two continue the quasi-brother motif from then on. The best moment of Baymax and Hiro relationship is a shot of Baymax and Hiro watching the sunset as the sunlight silhouettes them. If you really look for the similarities you'll notice the rapid growth of their connection isn't just emotional but subtly physical which was a nice touch.<br/><br/>But hell you could've not had the scene in there and Baymax would have still sold the movie for me. Everyone in that theater I watched Big Hero 6 in with loved Baymax. Every innocent gesture, every clumsy mistake and every heartfelt pillowy soft word that came out of him invoked a grand reaction from the audience and it's hard to not notice why. Design wise, like the movie states, he has a cute non-threatening look to him that makes him very naturally appealing with a big soft body and cute little eyes, and his very basic personality connects well with people on a very base level. In fact the whole relationship of Baymax and Hiro reminds me of another robot and kid combo movie I saw a while back. Can you guess which one?<br/><br/>Yep, The Iron Giant. In fact Big Hero 6 would what I call the Brother's version of The Iron Giant, with its similar focus on familial and surrogate familial connections. Big Hero 6 however has one advantage over Iron Giant. It's a Marvel Action movie so, it takes full advantage of Disney's CG Animation department to its fullest extent, giving us some super creative fight scenes and the visual treats of seeing more ""practical"" super powers from the 6. The world of Big Hero immerses itself with technology that is practically used right now, the biggest example being 3D printing. The inclusion of this technology makes the world a lot more practical to view, not realistic obviously; I'll wait until I see a giant marshmallow robot flying around the city until I say that.<br/><br/>But what I can say is that Big Hero 6 has a fantastic grasp of animation and movement. With each of the Heroes' varied modes of motion the camera movement matches perfectly to give us the most action packed and fluent shots making every action scene a visual treat to watch. The animation itself is also very colorful and the design itself is like if you mixed the bright colors of The Incredibles and mixed it with the proportions of The Iron Giant, creating a style that's both familiar and intriguing.<br/><br/>But with all these positives and fun inclusions, are there any cons to this movie? Well the only con I should warn about are the side characters, Tadashi's four university friends. They are total stereotypes. Badass chick, the dude, the quirky girl with glasses, and the hyperactive black guy. They each fit into these stereotypical archetypes perfectly. However Big Hero 6 has two things that make these stereotypical roles bearable and even a lot of fun to watch. A) Their interactions with Hiro aren't being used to solely fuel their stereotypes. Their interactions work in tandem with the themes of overcoming grief, which gives each of these stereotypes a human edge to them adding some slight dimension. B) The actors who play these four, Jamie Chung, T.J. Miller, Génesis Rodríguez, and Damon Wayans, Jr., just pull off these stereotypes so well. It's like Gus from Psych. You know how stupidly stereotypical these characters are but they're just so good at it you don't care either way. My favorite out of this stupidly stereotypical squad is definitely GoGo for one scene during the climax. No spoilers, but her moment just put the cherry on the total bad girl sundae of her performance. So, if you're into these sort of stereotypical characters then enjoy, if you don't then this maybe will be a deal breaker.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, don't worry if you get sad in this movie from the dozens of scenes depicting some really soul crushing stuff. This movie is a cash cow waiting to produce some money flow. Even in the credits it was already advertising that the 3DS game was already out. So this isn't the last time we'll be seeing Big Hero 6, if it continues making such strong box office returns. So, what do I think overall? Big Hero 6 is a super fun movie. Despite what I mentioned about its theming, it isn't deep by any stretch of the term. However it understands the message it wants to convey and knows how to do it in a concise and fun way with fantastic flowing action, great characters and some sublime animation. So, if you want a movie experience much in the lane as The Iron Giant, but with more punching, then check out Big Hero 6."
"jwolfykun","9","13","19","14 August 2015"," Seriously?
","Okay, let me start off by saying don't listen to all of the naysayers. Big Hero 6 is an amazing film from WDAS, and surely is better than the dreadful frozen. Not only does it have a captivating story, but it shows realistic reactions to grief, loss, and depression. Generally films that we watch from Disney have that level of realistic emotions, even more so with films like the lion king and mulan, but with Big Hero 6 we have something that is reminiscent of this time period, so we can connect better to the characters being portrayed. Other than that, it really would be nice to hear people singing centuries rather than let it go."

","Let me make this short and simple--<br/><br/>If you couldn't find humor, warmth, and just a plain good time with this animation, you take life waaaaay to seriously. Get off your high horse and find your inner child. Yes, you, with the two and three stars who make it seem like this movie is such an abomination. Not every movie has to be a magnificent work of unfathomable genius with some epic, life changing meaning and complex character development reminiscent of the drama in your own life that has turned you into such a Scrooge. <br/><br/>This move was awesome. It was funny...it was sad...it strayed away from the typical children's movie formula and actually addresses death, grieving, and relationships meanwhile keeping its rated pg charm. Most of all, it was HILARIOUS. It was goofy, silly, fun type of hilarious."
"kupuvakata11","10","24","39","20 November 2014"," Great movie
","I am not usually impressed with recent animation movies. It takes hard work and a lot of talented people to make a kid's animation appeal to kids and adults all the same. And nowadays it is not enough for a movie to be targeted to kids only. For example, the movie ""Book of Life"" contains a lot of adult humor that kids will not necessarily understand. Big Hero 6 is something else. I went to watch it with my kids without having great expectations about it. I thought it would be the typical mess where a movie might be funny and action- filled but at the same time forgettable. Big Hero 6 is wonderfully made. Not just visually. The ideas behind it, even moral lessons that are well hidden so that they are not parent-like sounding, the real-life lessons it teaches are more than great. I have not seen a recent Disney movie that I liked as much. Frozen that became a hit does not compare to this movie. I hope this movie becomes as big as Frozen, because it certainly deserves to be. The people behind it should all be praised for a job well done."
"Franco_Strydom","7","18","28","5 January 2015"," An emotional ride that strikes all the right cords at all the right moments.
","Big Hero 6 is the kind of film I enjoy watching for entertainment – yes, a bit of a redundant statement. You walk in expecting a fun animated film with wholesome family values and you walk out feeling like you got so much more. The narrative is easy to pull apart. It's a simple story told in a simple way; effective but shallow. Usually this will be a sore point as the narrative is the most important element in my opinion. Considering the genre and form of the film – 'fun animation' remember - I won't hammer on that. The narrative is rich with moments that are emotionally enthralling. The exciting moments are somehow extra exciting and the sad moments extra sad. The characters start off looking rich and promising but soon turn flat. The lead character is great, I enjoyed the development there and most of the other characters go through a small but significant development as well; right at the 'save the day' moment which is predictable but nicely done. The character of the villain however is disappointing. The change in the character is such a huge stretch and a lot of the setup for the villain is just nonsensical. The ending is cute but a team of tech savvy crime fighters made me sigh, why is returning to a life of science not enough? As a bit of an aside, the resolution for the villain is surprisingly bleak and effects more people than just the villain; none of them in a positive way. With the values the film present and the family friendly attitude of the story, I found that character resolution a shock. Not necessarily a bad thing, the complexities of responsibility is also a valuable lesson even though you wouldn't expect to find it in a friendly animation film. The style of the film is beautiful. The animation and the sound is immersive and the moments get their intent spot on; funny is really funny, sad is really sad, disappointing is uncomfortably disappointing, and that makes this an entertaining film in the moment. I found it didn't leave me with any afterthought (perfectly acceptable) but it did leave me with a smile on my face and thoughts of when I was younger."
"imankind","10","26","43","17 November 2014"," Wonderful work form Disney
","Big Hero 6 is a departure from Disney's usual lineup in a number of ways.<br/><br/>Firstly, the film is not a musical like its 53 older siblings in the Disney Classic Collection. It is definitely a character piece, although given its comic-book background it may be more fair to address it as an origin story.<br/><br/>Secondly, the story has a much stronger appeal for adult viewers. While young children will most certainly find the film appealing in a strictly visual capacity, the story is engaging enough to hold the attention of seasoned and cynical viewers. The plot isn't anything new - in fact it's quite simple. But the delivery is excellent.<br/><br/>And finally, the characters. Gone are the days of The Little Mermaid or Aladdin whose characters are, apart from an overly powerful curiosity or kleptomania, basically just warm and fuzzy saints with only mild surface flaws. In Big Hero 6, the hero (or antihero in this case) is full of angst and character flaws that highlight some of the film's darker undertones. Obviously the movie doesn't linger in those areas - it isn't The Godfather and any seeing the film should know better than expect that. But it is definitely a shade darker than its older brothers and sisters, and it has some more human, more real characters that I think add much needed value to the Disney lineup."
"pranavbappanadu","8","19","30","22 November 2014"," A fun watch, the world just can't get enough of big huggable warriors!
","In my opinion, there are no bad animation movies. And Big Hero 6 is no different. Admittedly, this follows a pretty much tried and tested plot, has a few ""twists"" and follows pretty much in the same direction as many other animation movies. However, that doesn't mean you shouldn't sit down and enjoy this movie, because sometimes, you should see a movie just so that you can laugh along with the characters and just have fun without worrying about the story and where it is heading.<br/><br/>This movie also draws a lot of inspiration from other movies, like Kung Fu Panda, where you have a cute, chubby and huggable protagonist, not unlike Baymax. The second suit of Baymax seems to be inspired by Iron Man's suit, complete with an Arc Reactor type heart which houses the data that Baymax uses. There are also some references to Stan Lee (a portrait in Fred's mansion and the after- credits scene) included in the movie. All visual elements and audio elements aim at creating a fun, up- pace environment where you know that everything is going to work out towards the end. The songs and tunes are catchy and visuals are good. Nothing breath-taking though, but you wouldn't mind it too much, because the action itself is impressive enough. <br/><br/>Overall, I wouldn't go so far as to say this is a must-watch, but do not miss it either, for it is a fun watch which you definitely won't regret."

","Big Hero 6 is a fantastically brilliant movie that combines fun, great visuals, and an engaging story into what may be the best animated movie from Disney studios since Lion King. <br/><br/>Giant red herrings and a weak climactic scene aside (and the predictable and confusing cop-out death of our favorite character), it's just a fun ride the whole way there. Be careful when bringing really little ones, as there's a scene where Baymax goes on a rampage, and it's really scary as an adult to see that kind of unfettered emotional rage - so for a child it must be terrifying. Still that's why this movie works. It develops its characters and doesn't pull punches from real emotional engagement.<br/><br/>It's not as good from start to finish as The Iron Giant, but it's peaks are just as high, particularly for humor. If you don't laugh at the fist bump scene, you have no soul.<br/><br/>Great follow up to Wreck-it Ralph, Disney needs to stay the course on these."
"lesleyharris30","9","10","14","14 August 2015"," An Absolute Pleasure for Disney fans of All Ages,
","Big Hero 6 is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding voice cast. I think any fan of Walt Disney animation will be very impressed with this movie, it has a storyline that almost immediately takes you in and is very compelling. The character development is terrific, in the space of just ninety minutes it manages to make us feel for seven characters, the studio knew what their aim was for this movie and they achieved it. My only problem with this film is that Tadashi was a very underdeveloped character, we never really get to know much about him, I would have liked to have learned more about his past and what inspired him to create Baymax, and also at least some bit of information on Hiro's parents, it would have added some extra layers to the story which would have been very good. It's a surprisingly emotional film, it may not look like one that has a lot of heart, but it really does, it made me shed a tear on several occasions and I'm not afraid to admit that, the relationship between Hiro and Baymax is very sweet, it develops perfectly throughout the movie and is surprisingly powerful, it has more depth than any other Disney Animation film has in years, that's what makes it a terrific film and a deserving win for Best Animated Feature Film at the Academy Awards. Funny, sweet and very charming, Big Hero 6 is easily one of the best animated films I've seen in years, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good animation or family film. <br/><br/>After the death of his brother, Hiro teams up with his robot Baymax and a group of friends to form a superhero team to take down the man responsible."

","In San Fransokyo, the fourteen year-old Hiro Hamada is a little genius that makes money in illegal robots fight. His older boy, the college student Tadashi, saves Hiro from a dangerous gang and brings him to his laboratory in the university to convince him to forget the fights. Tadashi shows his nurse robot Baymax that he is developing to Hiro and introduces his little brother to his friends Go Go Tomago, Wasabi, Honey Lemon and Fred. When Hiro meets his idol Professor Robert Callaghan, he decides to join the university. Hiro needs to invent something to attract the attention of Callaghan and he brings tiny robots called microbots that are useful for many applications to the science fair in the university. The entrepreneur Alastair Krei wants to buy the microbots but Hiro prefers to stay with Callaghan in the university. When Hiro and Tadashi leave the fair, there is a fire and Tadashi returns to the place to rescue Callaghan. However the building blows up and Tadashi dies. Later, Hiro activates Baymax and the robot follows the direction pointed out by the last microbot kept with Hiro. The boy chases Baymax and they come to an abandoned building. Hiro discovers that someone is producing microbots and they are attacked by a masked man the controls the microbots. They succeed to flee and Hiro decides to include armor and another chip in Baymax to make him a master in fights. They track the masked man down to the harbor but Go Go Tomago, Wasabi, Honey Lemon and Fred arrive summoned by Baymax. The masked man attacks the group and they team-up forming the Big Hero 6, using armors and their skills, to capture the masked man that they believe is Alastair Krei. But they have a huge surprise.<br/><br/>""Big Hero 6"" is an excellent Disney production based on a Marvel character. The story is full of action and the characters are charismatic.

","Big Hero 6, as the title indicates, is surprisingly cleverly written and massively endearing. Despite the formulaic Disney structure-- killing the parents, then killing the fatherly figure off, the film smartly showcases love in a simplistic, sophisticated way without the use of overtly ebullient songs. The lack of song is refreshing and demonstrates Disney's maturing skill to create captivating pieces without the support of song. Songs aside, the villain's effortless menacing ferocity is a prime example of Disney's creative maturity. Terrifying, yet not over complex, the villain gets the job done rightly. Overall it may not appear meticulously crafted, yet imagine the will-power required to refrain from slipping a couple songs in here and there."

","After the highly disappointing Frozen,I did thought that Disney is going to do it again with this movie,Big Hero 6.However instead of being really of a bad movie,It was rather instead as turned out to be,one of Disney's best movies ever made with just a simple plot,a boy's relationship with his robot .<br/><br/>Wait,do I mean a boy and a robot pal,a relationship,no not really its about a boy who decided to turn his pals into superheroes after his brother's death.I know that some reviewers would thought of How To train Your Dragon when I mentioned a relationship between a boy and a robot but it is way amazingly complex than that.Asides of it,everything in the movie was one of the best animated sequence in the movie itself,from the animation to the plot(it did have,but it was hardly obvious and everything is done perfectly) to the music score which is one of Disney's best music scores to date and also to the themes of the movie that is really well played than some of Disney's previous movies and also the jokes that make so much of sense,and yes,Baymax which is one of the best characters in the more,is also really one of Disney's best sidekick since the Genie in Aladdin.On the plus side,you have amazing cinematography and most of the characters,even the minor ones did feel that they did somehow play a huge plot to the movie(and they are very likable too).It is honestly,as to say,the best Disney movie that does not feel like a Disney movie in a good way.<br/><br/>It is really sad that many critics did compare to Frozen,like this was not really one of Disney's best movies.However,if you can look at most parts of the movie,it is the BEST animated film this year and the BEST Disney movie since the movies of the renaissance period ,which is obviously Beauty and The Beast.While Beauty and The Beast focuses on the character animation, cinematography and the plot,Big Hero 6 also did the same thing and for some reasons,after watching this movie just now with my brother in the theaters,I obviously love to watch this movie again.This is the movie that has obviously made my week after some rough moments that I did went through this week and I do think that everyone did a well done job,which I forgot,the directing and the voice acting,it can be very phenomenal.I just hope that Big Hero 6 does win an Oscar for Best Animated Feature next year and lastly to Disney,I am satisfied with your care."

Big Hero 6 appeals to everybody. It was PG-13 in my country but the boys I took from ages 7-9 loved it and I laughed and cried with them. <br/><br/>I loved the fact that the girls in this movie were glorified as intelligent, butt-kicking, engineers but still girls who loved their girly stuff, this means a lot to me. Great role modelling for our daughters. And the boys were allowed to be scared, unsure, bad and emotional. This is also a great message. <br/><br/>The message was, people are people. Animation was awesome. Dialogues were intelligent, witty and funny without being corny or crude. Family element was wonderful and mostly, how the emphasis was on the main characters, Baymax and Hiro and not the villain. Even the villain had a good reason to be evil.<br/><br/>Watch it, love it, watch it again because that's what we're gonna do. And stop picking on the little things for once.

Move over 'Finding Nemo'.

If you do not have kids, go see this movie.<br/><br/>I don't remember ever laughing as often or as genuinely at a Disney, Pixar, or Dreamworks movie as I did while watching this. The main characters are genuinely likable, none more-so than 'Baymax' the big, white, fluffy health care robot, who is converted into a fearsome (but still loving) fighting machine.<br/><br/>The story is loosely based on a little-known Marvel comic of Japanese origin. In this adaptation the story revolves around Hiro Hamada, a 14 year old super genius and robotics prodigy. Hiro has struggled to cope after the loss of his parents and finds solace in underground robot fights. His older brother Tadashi, also a robotics genius (but not quite of the 'super' variety) always keen to get Hiro on the straight and narrow, manages to get him to visit the University (or nerd school as he calls it) he attends.<br/><br/>Here Hiro meets a bunch of like-minded young robotics and science nerds, and is awe struck by their inventions (including Baymax) and is instantly inspired. It's at this point the story takes off.<br/><br/>'Big Hero 6' is not greatly original. But, so what? The basic plot and themes can be seen in just about any super hero movie. Given it's Marvel origins, that's no surprise. So, if you're a super hero movie enthusiast, you'll dig this. If you're over super hero movie films, fear not. You'll dig this. It is funny, exciting, and genuinely heart-warming. I'm not much of an artistic guy, but to me the animation looks fantastic. The fact they made a health care robot which looks like the Stay Puff marshmallow guy from 'Ghost Busters' actually work is some achievement.<br/><br/>I'm going to put it out there now and say: Best movie of the Summer.<br/><br/>'Big Hero 6'- 8.5/10."

","First, let me preface this with the statement that I have found virtually every Disney film in existence distasteful. (Sappy characters, flimsy plots, and mushy dialog are my primary reasons for this.)<br/><br/>Big Hero Six is a very different film, especially for Disney. There are realistic characters, character development, and an engaging plot. (I mean it about the plot- there are real twists (very unlike something like, say, 101 Dalmations).) <br/><br/>The emphasis on technology, science, and Maker culture in particular were all aspects of the film I enjoyed. There was also a significant amount of research involved in the film (from what I can tell)- there were some details that they really didn't need to put in there, but did just to impress people who would get it. (Adding supports to a curved 3D-printed object (in a shot that lasted a fraction of a second) would be the most obvious example.) <br/><br/>Anyway, I liked it. According to the Peter Principle, Disney will milk this franchise to death, but this was a film that I engaged in. Film was family-friendly, and will probably help give some kids out there a ""I wanna do science"" mentality."

The villain also has a good motive and it's not one of those ""evil just because he's evil characters"". From beginning to end this movie is fast and smart full of action and very emotional . It's great for anybody. !! Oh and STAY AFTER THE CREDITS ! especially Marvel fans! What are you still doing , GO WATCH IT!"

","""Heartfelt, admirably entertaining, hilarious, and visually stunning.""<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 is one of the best animations of 2014 along with The Lego Movie and How to Train Your Dragon 2.<br/><br/>It is a special and more satisfying movie than Frozen in a diverse way (by the way why diverse? because Big Hero 6 is an action-superhero movie and no musical, unlike Frozen it is a princess tale and a musical, so Big Hero 6 has unique elements that diversely differ on Frozen; let's go back into the question above, why is it special and satisfying was it makes us care for its characters especially on the bond of Hiro and Baymax and greatly take consider its dramatic emotional depth moments. It's a touching experience at the movie theater when you watch it there. It's beautiful and amazing when you watch it in 3-D. The sophistication of the marvel of Disney animatronics creatively crafted its ambitious scope on the Marvel comic book series of the same name and its compelling battle action scenes.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 starts at the futuristic hybrid city of San Fransokyo (a portmanteau of San Francisco and Tokyo), Hiro Hamada, a 13 year old robotics prodigy is naturally gifted when it comes in making nanotechnology and high-tech toys and stuffs. He often spends his time on robot fighting in the streets of the colorful city. But his brother Tadashi Hamada, was not impressed by this performance, he wanted Hiro to make use of his brain talent on something more creative like he was doing at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology.<br/><br/>So he invite Hiro into the institute and amazed to see his brother's creation, the Baymax robot. a medical robot doctor capably of helping the sick and the injured<br/><br/>After some inspiration advantage, Hiro also wants to go into the institute like his brother do. So he invent a technology to bring it into the school fair that will admit him in the institute.<br/><br/>But after the fair, a mysterious fire broke in the institute and his dreams was shattered by a horrific event that will change his life forever.<br/><br/>Depressed, Baymax emerges to help his emotional state. Baymax is a cute, kind, and a marshmallow-like robot (which I describe earlier).<br/><br/>Baymax is one of the primary characters here. He is basically the funniest and one of the most memorable Disney characters I have ever seen.<br/><br/>But there was a contrary here on some drama animations, what makes Big Hero 6 a heartwrenching movie was the use of a rather realistic emotional love and grief, we don't actually saw it much on either Frozen or Wrech-It Ralph. You can see here how much Hiro loves his brother and his creation, Baymax. So you can sometimes call this type of animated movie a comedy-drama one.<br/><br/>Also the ending is a powerful one. Unexpected, it is some sort of a brand new beginning world for Hiro and the concept of the movie itself. Don't dare to miss it!<br/><br/>On the negative side, the reason why I gave it 9 stars out of 10, was it lacks the originality of some creative, inventive, and critically acclaimed animated movies. It actually copies some of the scenes of some of the past movies like How to Train Your Dragon 2 dragon training scene part. But all in all, it is compensated by something even more unique from its elements, and also for its well-scripted story. Nonetheless, Big Hero 6 will hit its target audiences contented and pleased as they go out on the theater house.<br/><br/>Overall, Big Hero 6 is a terrific blast in the theaters. Its technically stunning, emotionally satisfying, entertainingly amusing, and very memorable Disney movie.<br/><br/>A true Oscar runner-up in the ""Best Animated Feature"" category. <br/><br/>A job well done Disney!!!<br/><br/>RATING: 9 / 10"
"matheusgoncalves232","10","33","67","9 November 2014"," Watch out Pixar because Disney is on its way
","So Big Hero 6 is loosely based on a marvel comic of same name. I personally never read the comic but the movie itself, WOW, encouraged me to read it. Though it is not the same and the characters look very different, both, the movie and the comic are amazingly done.<br/><br/>The movie itself is superb. The animation is fantastic and the scenery and the characters are so well realized. Their emotions and charisma, especially Hiro and Tadashi, are real (well, not really, but you can feel and relate to the characters). San Fransokyo is gorgeous to look at. Best achievement in setting/localization in animation period. <br/><br/>Don't miss this hilarious and touching adventure. Make sure to watch it on 3D, it is worth the money. The second Disney renaissance is finally here. <br/><br/>Congrats Disney for another great success."
"NobodyElsa","2","191","461","5 November 2014"," A forgettable film with clichéd characters and story. A big disappointment.
","Sadly, this was a huge step back for WDAS. This was definitely no Frozen. This wasn't even Wreck-It Ralph. Heck, this wasn't even Tangled (and that film is dreadfully so-so, but at least it had Flynn and Maximus). <br/><br/>First, the title. This film should have been called Big Hero 2. All it was Hiro and Baymax mostly Baymax. The other 4 main characters, which weren't main at all— more like secondary, had little screen time and no character development. The other 4 had their own personalities that were never given time to show on screen. They showed up at the beginning, then not until the middle, and a few chunks at the end. They all 4 served no purpose.<br/><br/>Honey Lemon was by far the worst character. She was one big cliché and she didn't do anything but act happy, talk about the color pink, and pronounce Hiro's name annoyingly. Her design was as bad as Rapunzel's; just oddly proportioned and cartoony. Wasabi in the original comics was Asian and is now black for the only reason of having diversity in the film. Fred was kind of interesting and seemed to be the only person who fit the superhero theme. Gogo had a booty, but was too underused. Hiro's aunt was more interesting and likable than the actual 6. Hiro was typical non-original in character but he had his moments. Baymax was supposed to be the saving grace but came off as annoying. He was the stereotypical robot who couldn't understand humans and their ways. A lot of his jokes were repetitive, dragged, and could have been cut. I didn't hate him, he had a good heart and good intentions and was sweet but the humor was annoying. Too much focus on slapstick and action and none of character development and little on emotions.<br/><br/>What irked me was the fact that the other 4 characters never got any time to get us to know who they were and to like them as characters and relate to them; No connection to them. The reason for them to become super was rushed and unoriginal: ""Let's be heroes!"" ""We're in!"" And that's exactly how it happened. And do we always need the typical watching the hero learn to fly with funny results, like Spider-Man, Iron Man, etc? <br/><br/>The film also ended with a cliché. The typical, narration from Hiro as we see the heroes' race through the city""Who are we? We're the Big Hero 6."" What was really bad was when they were heroes they didn't do anything? Their first scene they were goofy and didn't really fight. Then not until the final battle scene the other 4 did not fight or help hardly and ended up captured and Hiro and Baymax saved them and they defeated the bad guy again, Big Hero 6? Nope.<br/><br/>The villain was pointless, no needed, and not even cool, bad-ass, nor interesting; again, no real purpose. The villain's reveal of who it was, was OBVIOUS and the villain's intentions on why being bad was cliché. The way to defeat him was also obvious and (spoilers) the sacrifice from Baymax was seen a mile away so it wasn't sad, plus, you knew it wasn't going to be the end of that character.<br/><br/>The only good thing the film had was the beginning with Hiro and his relationship with his brother, Tadashi . You could feel the relationship between them. They were great together and it was touching. Loved that. Then after 15-20 minutes the film went downhill and never stopped. Also, the opening was not a good way to get kids attention. It was unusual and did not have a Disney feel to it. In fact, this film was not Disney at all; it felt more MARVEL.<br/><br/>With two female characters, none of them can be considered strong female role models at all. They weren't on screen enough; they served no purpose, and didn't really do anything in the film.<br/><br/>The story was unoriginal, uninspiring, and full of one cliché after another. The characters were the same. This film was forgettable and as the days go I will forget it and as the years pass many will forget this film which could have been more, but was just about a silly robot and nothing more. The song ""Immortal"" made for the film from Fall Out Boy was also unforgettable and a generic today rock song. All I recall is the word Immortal used over and over. I can't remember any other lyrics or how the beat goes. The after credits scene wasn't necessary, but more proof this was not Disney but Marvel. <br/><br/>I didn't hate the film at least but it was close to being that. This won't be like Frozen, where people had multiple repeat viewings. Most people, and kids, will probably see it just once and maybe twice, but even Baymax won't get them to keep coming back like Frozen did, because the other characters just weren't there. I saw it once and that was enough. I don't care to see it again and won't own it any time soon, sadly. A boy next to me fell asleep on it. I noticed that kids only laughed or enjoyed Hiro and Baymax but didn't seem to care for the other 4. Best moment of the night was the beginning. During the Disney logo credits, a little girl behind us shouted with excitement. ""Is this Frozen?!"" Best part of the night. I am thankful I didn't have to pay to see it and that I got this film out of the way fast. I am thankful for the free passes. <br/><br/>""BIG HERO 2"", gets a 2."

","The world of future is shown by big hero 6 like most other animation of recent times. It is really a cool movie to watch with family as it has all the elements to be a family movie. I as a animation lover would say the story has a big humane touch. It shows no matter what is the circumstances, we value lives over machine. This would not overtake my all time favorite Wall-e, but definitely is on the list. The main reason this would not make it to the top is the violence. I hope some people will understand that animation has given us a window to show kids how to dream of the future, but if we put violence in there it kind of effects. But then there is Baymax, who at no circumstances would harm a human even though humans may do such. That can be taken as a lesson: We at no cost, should promote violence."
"mercurys","3","125","299","10 November 2014"," Baymax - The only redeeming factor
","I am a huge fan of everything Disney, but this seemed like a first draft that was rushed into production. The characters were one dimensional, The side kicks were AWFUL. Woman Up would have been funny if it wasn't coming from the aggressive angry female sub character, and only heard through explosions in the background to mask what she was saying. <br/><br/>The Big Hero 6 version of comic relief (the lizard obsessed comic nerd rich kid who served no purpose) was just really annoying and only served but to place inconvenient little plot jumps. <br/><br/>Did anyone else find it a little uncomfortable when the only character that would add an accent to the name Hiro was the white female? Everyone else just said it as ""hero"" <br/><br/>The Music was TERRIBLE, I still can't tell if it was just one song that I couldn't understand for filth, or two.<br/><br/>The whole thing was so forced. Pushing as much exposition in the first ten minutes as humanly possible, while simultaneously making these characters unlikable. But you had your basic Disney movie checklist:<br/><br/>Dead Parents? Check Self Sacrifice from an important figure? Check Self Doubt, followed by realization? Check Pack of misfits that don't fit in? Check Lovable flat faced character? Check Action Sequence Montage? Check Villain reveal Plot twist? Check SECONDARY Self Sacrifice? Check Check Realization that the big sacrifice was for not? Check again End with big action filled sequence happy sequence that shows the dawn of a new day? Sure why not.<br/><br/>It hit all the usual marks, but with no heart, no originality, and no purpose. <br/><br/>Baymax was the only redeeming quality, and that's because he was the slapped together version of everything that we as a collective love to see, cute, soft, bubbly, endearing characters who seem to be a clean slate with no previous background story that can learn and help when needed. You Don't want to see anything happen to these characters, but something ultimately does in one way or another, and when the main character cries, you cry, when they laugh, you laugh. IT's all very basic.<br/><br/>Solid 4 out of ten. Baymax, the Aunts candid conversations with herself, and the only likable character, the older brother (who SPOILER ALERT) doesn't make it are the only things that this movie had going for it.<br/><br/>I saw myself laughing more AT the movie than with it. Which is unfortunate. That being said, I'll be searching Amazon for a BayMax life sized inflatable promo."

The subtle emotions and the things you get to learn from this movie is pretty astounding and it does this without rubbing it in your face.

"wyx821041","1","119","291","5 February 2015"," Predictable, flat and no fun
","Dear Disney<br/><br/>First, stop killing the leading character's parents(or siblings), i used to like How to Train Your Dragon, but thanks to you the series' been ruined by now. It helped building up the stories in Frozen, but NOT in this case.<br/><br/>second, we knew who the villain is all along(surprise!), it's much more predictable than Wreck-it Ralph and Up, what's the fun in that? No wonder you can't even beat Lego Movie and How to Train Your Dragon 2 in this very season, you don't need me to point out how bad is that for an original film.<br/><br/>third, the balloon man is likable and your marketing do have some points, so it make sense that people went to cinema for their children and their own pleasure, but after all they'll just feel used, i mean you could at least put up something fun like Penguins of Madagascar, but NO, you didn't even do that.<br/><br/>It's just frustrating and disappointing that this movie can actually get a positive review from the critics. I dare to say, after all those movies you watched, this is really a good animated feature to watch? seriously?"
"qadreya","10","33","72","9 November 2014"," The best since Toy Story
","This is my favorite film since Toy Story 3. I can't stress enough how great this movie is, I'm not even worried about overselling it. So I watched this movie today in a HUGE theater but there was only 10 people there including our group, so I was worried that I won't enjoy the movie as much since half the movies are better with an audience, but this was great even with practically no one there to laugh at the jokes cause you are going to do all that by yourself. The graphics are suburb, the plot is suburb and the character are very very interesting. Maybe the reason why I loved this movie so much is because it slightly reminded me of my childhood, I too was into science and robotics, but it takes it a step further with the great techs that the team invents. This is an emotional movie that I at first thought the kids with me won't understand, but the movie plays out the scenes so well that the kids with me (aged 5 - 10) all understood what was happening just by how the scene/music plays out and how the characters react (also I want to mention that English is not our first language, so I was worried that the kids won't understand everything but they did). Although one thing in the film that I didn't really get was the city/culture they are living in, I think it was called San FrancisTokyo or something like that, and some of the character pronunciations and the city decorations came off as Japanese but everything else was American, I am not sure if I am making any sense, but this movie tried to be in a setting that is both Americas and Asian but it only left me confused because it was American 95% of the time. I think it should just have stuck with one, it would have been remarkable and truly innovative-in the same sense as a Black princess- if they were all (or at least most) Asian. This is truly a remarkable film that I will recommend to all my friends, BUT, be warned because there are two scenes that will make you and your companions cry too (I was fighting the tears)."
"eudamidas","1","118","295","3 January 2015"," shocking
","The animated short is about a slovenly man-child who lets his dog eat everything that he eats--pizza, pasta, anything. The dog becomes so spoiled on this unhealthy diet that when he is given only kibble he becomes morose, petulant and, in a pastiche of chaotic scenes, ends up dictating the course of his owner's life--marriage to a humanoid katydid, the siring of a Kewpie doll, golden-hued homeownership. The dog gets his spaghetti and meatballs again, and his negligent owner bumbles brainless and mute into all the supposed trappings of happiness and prosperity. Instant gratification for all! Viewed from its proper perspective, this animated short is a not-so-subtle form of mind-control--Walt reaches beyond the cryogenic vat to parrot ""Hey folks, you're not in control of your own life, you don't know what to DO, so just let the dog take over and be happy."" (Viewed from its improper perspective, it's apparently a real tear-jerker!) The feature presentation has a complementary message. It is the most dogged exposition of techno-narcissism that I have ever seen. The central conceit is that technology can solve any problem. Here, the protagonist isn't a dog, it's a blandly obstreperous 13-year-old boy who has neither desire nor perceived need for further education. Like the dog, his motivation is the simplest: he just wants to create cool tech! And he succeeds every time and with nugatory effort. He creates telepathically-controlled ""microbots"" that give reality to every thought. Entire skyscrapers made by the sheer action of thought! No catcalling Johnny Lunchpails in hardhats, no mining for finite resources with which to build, no consideration that maybe 13-year-olds aren't competent architects. Just instant gratification, ex nihilo! Huzzah! And thereby--because, just because--a bratty pubescent kid creates the magical technology that allows literally anything to occur without the slightest degree of human effort or environmental cost. Where does a movie plot go from there? Oh of course, the ""bad guy"" steals the invention. The bratty kid could presumably make more ""microbots"" with zero effort or personal expense but he instead opts to retrofit his hapless pals with destructive gadgets and thereby unleash general chaos and pellmell on the streets of SF. In short, the kid is every bit the equal of the petulant dog. If you cried at the end of the short, you're sure to cry at the end of the movie. But all it really means is that you've been conned twice. Or else you're a buffoon. Search your feelings and puke!"

","I hate this movie for having one of the most cookie cutter plots imaginable, and for trying to build tension where there is none.<br/><br/>I am tired of kid's movies trying to be something their not. You can only have so much drama, because only so many things can possibly happen in a kids movie. This isn't 'Breaking Bad' or 'Django', BayMax isn't going to snap and kill anyone. I just won't happen ever. So why would the movie pretend it could happen.<br/><br/>All this fake drama that leads to nothing makes for a very boring and hollow movie. The LEGO movie got it right. They realized it can't be dramatic but it can be fun. This movie took it self way too seriously, and it resulted in a very boring and mindless film. <br/><br/>As far as the plot goes it's basically the same as every superhero origin ever made. Except now you've already seen it dozens of times.

","I have always loved animated films, whether they be by Walt Disney, DreamWorks, Marvel, Miyazaki or any other storytellers out there, but of late I haven't enjoyed the anime style and artwork that has been delivered. Personally I thought Frozen was so over rated, sure there was a couple of good tunes, cool, characters, interesting storyline, but it lacked that special something Mr. Disney and his crew always managed in years gone by to bring out in me. Don't get me wrong I do really like frozen but nowhere near as much as I am supposed to according to everyone else on the planet. I'm not sure what it is that I love about animated films or where the love developed from but I find myself far more attracted to them in my later years than I ever did in my earlier life. So when I heard about Big Hero 6 and the fact that both Disney and Marvel were collaborating together I pretty much had instant tingles, my expectations without seeing a single thing went higher than any film I have anticipated before. What the hell was Big Hero 6 and why hadn't I heard of it up until now?!? Why did I ever stop reading the comics!?!?<br/><br/>Hiro Hamada is a young 14 year old boy genius who knows how to make things work, he loves his gadgets and robots. Hiro lives in the futuristic city of San Fransokyo with his brother Tadashi and his aunt who has taken the boys in after the loss of their parents when Hiro was three years old. Hiro spends most of his days creating and then destroying robots in underground robot battles for cash, the robots he creates devastate the competition without any mercy. After being arrested for attending one of these illegal battles Tadashi on the promise of taking Hiro to another back alley for another fight detours to his university where Hiro discovers that the genius gene doesn't fall far from the tree at all. Tadeshi introduces Hiro to his five Uni friends who each are working on their own scientific breakthroughs. Wasabi, Go Go, Honey Lemon, and Fred. Tadeshi then shows Hiro his latest work, a personal walking talking health specialist named Baymax who can cure all with his sweet soft tones and loving temperament. Hiro instantly loves what he sees within the university and decides he must attend. To get into the university the heads of the campus hold a special talent show where potential applicants can show their work and hopefully the university board are convinced enough to sign up the entrants giving them a scholarship to attend. Hiro creates a way to revolutionise life as we know it and wins his way into the university to the joy of everyone. While celebrating and getting ready to leave a tragedy strikes the university and Hiro loses far more than his exciting new project. With the help of his new five friends from the Uni Hiro reinvents Baymax and together the team of 6 become heroes ready to find the truth to what really happened<br/><br/>I thought this film had it all, I loved it from its beginning to its after credits surprise. I laughed pretty much all the way though, Baymax really grabs hold of you by your heart strings, you can't help but fall in absolute love with him. The way the animators make him move and react is adorable and will definitely keep you smiling throughout. The animation is outstanding and deserves so much applause, everything from the 3D art work to the colour to the rendering is perfect, there is nothing to pick at here in the way the film is made. The voice acting isn't any different either, the directors Don Hall and Chris Williams have chosen an amazing cast and all do a fantastic job for their individual characters as well as their group dynamics, with a couple of recognizable voices amongst the fray as well you will totally love everyone. Staring the voice talents of Scott Adsit as Baymax, Ryan Potter as Hiro, Daniel Henney as Tadashi, T.J. Miller as Fred, Jamie Chung as Go, Damon Wayans Jr. as Wasabi, Genesis Rodriguez as Honey Lemon, James Cromwell as Robert Callaghan and Alan Tudyk as Alistai"

","Big Hero 6 iis based off of a young teenager (Hiro) and his new friend (Baymax) that live in a city called San Fransokyo, which is a mix of Tokyo and San Francisco. He also has an older brother (Tadashi). Baymax´s is a robot and his sole purpose is to help take care of others in need. But something happens where he is thrown into dangerous situation. He recruits his friends, Go Go Tamago, Wasabi, Honey Lemon, and Fred, to become a crime fighting crew. I will guarantee you don´t figure out who the bad guy is until it comes to that point.
This a good movie for anybody that likes a little bit of comedy with some action. It has some diverse emotion scenes where the tone and sort of emotion kind of changes throughout the movie. It also has some good mystery, like who the bad guy is who they are against, who is there friend, and who is not. This adds an element of surprise and relief when it all comes together.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 has a lot of ups and downs when it comes to emotions. It can go from extremely sad, to really funny, and really heart-warming for some people. An example of the emotions changing throughout the movie is when Hiro is very mad with his team and turns Baymax into a weapon that hurts people instead of what he was made to do; help everyone. Baymax has these chips that program him with a helpful personality that Hiro's brother , Tadashi, made for him. Hiro, wanting to give Baymax some self-defense, made a chip that has every form of martial arts inside of it so that Baymax can help protect and defend everybody while still keeping his original personality that keeps him from hurting anyone. In this scene Hiro gets extremely mad and frustrated so he goes to Baymax and takes out his original ¨good¨ chip and is only left with the self-defense ¨bad¨ chip. He then says ¨Baymax, destroy¨ and Baymax goes on a mission to kill the bad guy without any other thought in his mind. The entire team tries to stop him before he kills the man that is considered the antagonist and eventually do but suffer a big cost on their morals and integrity.
This teaches Hiro that he was out of place and should settle this and learns that everyone can be good and he should strive to get everyone there. This is a very important moment in the movie as it is a turning point for the whole team, especially Hiro and it allows them to pursue the antagonist without any anger, vengeance, or revenge. It really brings out the emotion in anyone that watches it.<br/><br/>Another reason to watch this movie is it's intriguing mystery and not knowing what comes next. This is important for a movie like this because it keeps the watchers guessing and actually wanting to know what happens. This is shown all throughout the movie as they try to figure out who exactly the real antagonist. The team travels all around the city trying to find an answer to all of the fighting and trying to find out who is behind it all. The whole movie is filled with twists and turns that make you think more and more about who you can trust, and who you can´t.
This movie is a perfect match for anyone that likes a little mystery in a story. It gives just the right amount of hints to who it is without actually giving away them.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 is a great movie for all ages, from little kids to elderly people. This movie will please all.

","""Big Hero 6"" is somewhat of a departure from form for Disney - the crisp animation; amusing characters and rapid-fire narrative are all there, but it just doesn't 'feel' like the usual fare from the famous animation studio who are perhaps more synonymous with magical lands; ugly, ruthless villains; muscular heroes; beautiful princesses and mythical adventure stories. This is Disney attempting to branch off into superhero territory - an attempt at placing each of their eggs into a basket which is squared solely at the adolescent demographic rather than the family unit of mum and dad, brother and sister.<br/><br/>It's difficult to put here that the film is a failure - I liked its twists and turns where, villain and would-be villain are cleverly transposed; I thought it executed its tonal shifts between action-driven fun; horror and depicting the grieving process really well, but there was something missing from it to have me think it was better than pretty good.<br/><br/>Principally, the film's actually rather cryptic title (don't worry, it isn't a sequel - there aren't 5 other entries to see before this one!) alludes to its protagonist, who is named Hiro. Hiro is a boy-genius on the mathematical/engineering level who lives with his brother and aunt above her donut shop in a future-set city which is a (reasonably) clever amalgamation of San Francisco and Tokyo. At least, it has something resembling a Chinatown district and that huge red bridge we'd all recognise in a flash if it was shown to us.<br/><br/>A master builder and inventor, Hiro is squandering his talents in constructing inconspicuous-looking robots for a kind of miniature robot themed 'fight-club' among the grimy backstreets of his post-modern home city. Said practice is illegal, yet he persists - a kind of automatronic Eddie Felson amongst a sea of other lowlifes and gamblers who keeps winning big off the back of a boyish grin; innocent voice and some po-faced enthusiasm which has his opponents think they can win easily.<br/><br/>One night, he and everyone else are busted after a raid - his brother Tadashi, another scientist and inventor, reiterates that he is on thin ice. Hiro, despite possessing an obvious talent, is sniffy about it - indifferent as to following in his brother's footsteps in studying at the local university. The film provides him with one other defining characteristic: that his parents died in an off-screen accident - usually a sign that an adolescent in a film needs only one more push to completely topple over the edge.<br/><br/>Disaster strikes when, at an open evening at said university, a fire engulfs all within its vicinity and claims the life of Hiro's brother - just as Hiro was beginning to realise what a fantastic thing it might be to study there. In order to infer just how much of an impact Hiro might have, the film has him provide a Steve Jobs-like presentation on a recent invention he concocted: millions of tiny building blocks which will forge themselves to whatever neuro-command you provide them with - something resembling what Carrie White might have been able to do with Lego. All might not be as it seems, though, when the one remaining robotic block Hiro possesses seems to want to join its brothers, despite the rest of them apparently having gone up in flames. This pushes Hiro out of his depression and onto his quest to find out if all is as it seems...<br/><br/>Hiro is chiefly helped in his quest to discover the truth behind the fire; his brother's death and where his place is in life by a large white robot named Baymax, which was his brother's invention designed as a first aid response to medical emergencies when cries of pain are detected. In spite of being made for this purpose, the robot is somewhat cumbersome - moving slowly to shift a chair out of the way when we first see him activated, despite under the impression somebody is in need of urgent help. As a supporting character, his monosyllabic putdowns and statements at the most heightened of times are genuinely amusing; meanwhile off screen, he is no doubt shipping tens of thousands of action figures and plush toys.<br/><br/>Where B-Max is responsible for the most important line of dialogue in the film, that of when he asks Hiro if ""...eliminating {the villain} will improve your well-being"", Hiro's other supporting acts in the form of a motley crew of young students from the university exist for less substantial reasons - forming a superhero troupe off the back of learning of Hiro's discoveries and leaping into action in a manner that seems to want to be subversive of the genre, but actually ends up being a little tacked-on.<br/><br/>The film seems desperate to tuck into the substance behind the approaching fourth industrial revolution, dealing in the process with the co-existence of man and machine and what this signifies for the next generation as one potentially replaces the other. We witness Baymax, an otherwise passive entity enslaved to whatever programming he possesses, used to both help and harm, but nothing especially leaps out at you on the issue. I like how the film seems to encourage aspiration - going to university is construed as a good thing, not to mention the film seems to promote creative thought and imparts a number of positive messages along these lines to youngsters. The film is, however, largely a chaotic blur of colour; quips and spectacle - one that few will find particularly amusing."

","Big Hero 6 follows young Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) in mourning, he befriends the robot Baymax (Scott Adsit), with the aid of others they form a super hero team, together they must stop a mysterious kabuki-mask wearing villain.<br/><br/>Stepping away from their usual fairytale formula Walt Disney Animated Studios adapts a Marvel comic book into it's first super hero movie.

"iancmtexas","8","2","2","11 April 2018"," I am satisfied with my care
","Even after watching it for the first time in 3 years, Big Hero 6 is still an amazing film. The score and animation are both flawless, the writing and characters are mostly great (more on that later), and the plot is unique and the twist regarding the villain's identity is exactly what a twist should be: unexpected, but not completely out of nowhere (i.e. dropping subtle hints to set up the twist). Also, apart from the giant skyhole you've seen in every other movie finale from the past 20 years, the finale is creative, funny, well executed, and has a lot of heart. 
 My main problems with Big Hero 6 are that the villain is a bit too generic and TJ Miller voices a character (seriously, just stick to live action, TJ), but apart from that, the film is terrific. I highly encourage people to watch it"
"godhatesharper","4","2","2","15 June 2017"," Middling animation for Disney
","I was eager to watch this movie because it's abundantly clear that its aesthetic is influenced by anime/manga, a genre I'm not particularly familiar with, but appreciative of the art style all the same. And on that aspect, this movie definitely delivers. It's a cute, modern-day city that combines Japanese and American elements and that has an almost accolade-worthy devotion to racial diversity. But unfortunately, pretty much every other aspect of this film is stuff that we've seen before. I know that Disney, even without the high standards set by Pixar, is capable of producing stirring and classic features to this day. I would probably be more impressed with this film if it came from Dreamworks (and truth be told, it would probably be way funnier if it had been), but coming from Disney? Nowhere near the stature of Zootopia or even Frozen, as polarizing as that movie is. I enjoy superheroes and comics, but I feel like the film was massively bogged down by predictable action sequences and a generic, clichéd plot. The characters, while likable, are given so little time to develop that when they suddenly go into battle and are masters of acrobatics and combating bad guys, it's laughable. The stoner archetype Fred, however, was pretty funny, and Baymax had some chuckle-worthy moments too. People are lauding Baymax for giving this movie a heart, but I would argue that he was just the means to facilitate the message, for really it was Hiro's brother's legacy that lived on through Baymax that helped Hiro overcome his grief. It's touching, for sure, but frankly, Hiro's brother is just given too little screen time for the audience to truly connect to their relationship. <br/><br/>Probably the most confusing aspect to me was the villain. At first, the movie seemed to be espousing the merits of intelligence by encouraging engagement in technology, which is great. But then by the end, mixed messages of capitalism over education are seemingly established, which, political affiliations aside, is a confusing thing to assert to young children. This is all accomplished through a bizarre and convoluted villain twist that is the exact opposite of what we were set up to believe was very obvious, which is kind of annoying because the filmmakers deliberately knew that the audience would fall for their tonal framing. But regardless, the villain's storyline comes to an unnecessary and confusing end. Hiro literally sacrifices Baymax to save the antagonist's daughter...only to have them not even get an opportunity to reconnect as he's led away to jail. But then, the movie brings back Baymax from the grave, pretty much negating any plot development or message the audience could have garnered from that scene. It's a giant mess, and the surrounding scenes just can't excuse it.<br/><br/>I know I sound extremely negative here, but yet I still don't think this was the worst movie I've ever seen, and there's certainly more suspect and condescending media children could consume (I do think this film would mainly appeal to a young child, as its dialogue and story can be quite infantile at times). It had some humorous parts and a sincere heart, but it's just not quite enough to salvage the messy, overdone plot and underdeveloped characters. Disney can do better."
"tianye-91798","8","2","2","26 February 2017"," I really love this movie
","Big Hero 6 combines Disney wonder and charm with Marvel and action to deliver a film. It is a science fiction and action film. The main actor is Scott Adsit as Baymax, Ryan Potter as Hiro Hamada, and the movie is directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 is a robot whose body is fat and white. His name is Baymax, Baymax is invented by Hiro's brother. He can help you to cure disease and check your or not. Moreover, he can make his host happy. He is like a child when he can't understand something. Also, he is like a friend. He can do anything, whatever his host ask to do.<br/><br/>I really love this movie. All of us wish to have a friend like Baymax to take care of us, protect us, listen to us, and do anything that we want him to do for us."
"dsalouk","6","2","2","6 February 2017"," Has its ups, and its downs.
","Big hero 6 is set in a combined setting to Tokyo meets San Francisco. The protagonist; Hiro, is built from a cliché foundation; a broken family and questions to his lineage. It ends on a similarly cliché tone; where the good prevail. The excitement is mild, the antagonist has a flawed motive, and the animation is not anything unseen before. Whilst there are pleasant motives, and it is by far not an abysmal debacle, it leaves much to be desired and has no memorable soundtrack or moments. Big Hero 6 misses the mark it's larger iconic predecessors have set. Maybe its directors; Don Hall and Chris Williams, should stick to their strengths; writing."

","I really enjoyed the way Disney manages to make movies that appeal to all ages. This movie in specific really made me more self conscious and gave me the realization that even marshmallows can become your friends. Incredible to see how you get dragged in to the bonding of an object and a person, of course referencing to the possible role artificial intelligence might be playing in our future. I would definitely recommend this movie to all ages since I find it of great importance that the awareness of this potential change in society is triggered at an early ages, also to stimulate the motivation to discover new technologies. I really enjoyed this movie and will surely watch more Pixar movies!"
"C22Man","7","2","2","5 May 2016"," On to a Winner
","Big Hero 6 can be considered as Disney's first outright animated superhero film and its surprising that it took so long given the genres immense popularity. There have been times when the area has been touched on before and Pixar have delved into it with The Incredibles, but this is the first time we get to see Disney adapt an actual comic to the big screen. Loosely based on the Marvel comic strip, the film takes advantage of being animated and allows itself to be as creative as possible. It follows Hiro as he, his robot Baymax and four of his friends form a superhero team following an accident involving his brother.<br/><br/>The story flows very well, providing plenty of excitement and adventure, whilst getting surprisingly emotional on a number of occasions. Our protagonist Hiro does grow throughout the film and it is very effective. We see him struggle to decide his future, then his world comes crashing down and it's not until Baymax starts to help him that he realises he can depend on on his friends. There is certainly a depth to this story that goes beyond many Disney films, with many parts touching on issues such as depression and the how important friendship can be to an adolescent. It is done very subtly and never tries to push any of these ideas down the audience's throat, which was a welcomed thing. Though I would have enjoyed more superhero material I can't fault the film for dealing with such complex themes.<br/><br/>The characters are both entertaining and relatable. Hiro can be a little flippant but he has all the traits of someone struggling with themselves. He can be self-assured, humorous and brash yet he is also sensitive and despondent at times. He is a well-rounded character and he develops as the film goes on. Baymax is by far the funniest thing here. He gets plenty of amusing lines and offers some great physical comedy, but it's his warm temperament and genuine innocent that are always charming. Hiro's brother Tadashi is also very likable and the bond between the two is strong from the outset. I do think the side characters lack depth, especially compared to Hiro and Baymax, but they all have clear personalities and do offer plenty of laughs throughout. The main villain is something of a bore given his lack of personality, but his motivations are well thought-out.<br/><br/>Disney delivers the goods once again from an animation stance. The animation is very slick and detailed, giving just the right balance of colour and refinement to proceedings which match both the superhero style and the more subdued tone. The idea to combine San Francisco and Tokyo into the same city was genius and it looks spectacular here, the amount of detail in meshing the two cities together is clear and it provides a very unique setting. The action sequences were also very impressive. The fight scenes were graceful and smooth allowing for a lot of cool techniques, whilst still retaining a weight that made it look forceful. I also enjoyed the way in which the heroes' powers were shown and they were inventive with what they created. <br/><br/>The dramatic writing was certainly a standout feature. There were even a few tear inducing moments, most of them thanks to Hiro and his relationship to his brother. It felt like there was a real connection between these characters, even with a robot like Baymax, which is where a lot of the films strength comes from. There is a real maturity to this writing and an understanding, the writers really captured what it feels like to be going through these emotions. Even the villains motivation, which can suffer from feeling forced, felt totally justifiable here. The comedy worked well for the most part too. Though I would have liked little more, there was plenty of versatility in the jokes and the slapstick was fantastic when it popped up.<br/><br/>For me Big Hero 6 continued Disney's run of excellent CG animation. This is certainly an example of a film that has more to it than expected. What appears to be a fun superhero adventure frequently delves into some pretty mature themes and the characters have motivations that are deeper than they first appear. I enjoyed these characters, wanting to spend time with them and see them develop. From a technical aspect the film is tough to fault, the animation looks beautiful, the action is excellent and there is a lot of creativity to the world that it has crafted. A little more superhero and comedic pieces wouldn't have been out of place, but the film deserves credit for the challenging angle it takes. It's a film that balances itself perfectly and rewards you with its level of maturity."
"ilia_davidovich","2","108","273","21 December 2014"," Horrible
","Don't waste your time. To me it looked like a mash between Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and Kung-Fu Panda. That's about it. The plot is contrived and full of childish, simplistic clichés, too many to number. Disney is on its war path destroying anything remotely decent. Turning the magical ""The Snow Queen"" by G.H. Andersen into the abominable ""Frozen"" wasn't enough apparently. I'm cringing at a thought those butchers may get to one of Miyazaki's classics one day. <br/><br/>(Spoilers) The plot had many questionable spots, but my biggest question was why for the love of God Hiro couldn't make the second neuro-band to try and take back control over his microbots? He went at length to turn himself and his clumsy friends into the super-heroes, but somehow decided that building an army of his own microbots was a waste of time? I don't even want to point out that 4 additional heroes were utterly useless and goofy, and why even mention the fact that Hiro appears in so obviously intellectually superior to any other character in this movie, yet he wanted to go to school and study. Robert Callaghan is chosen to be a villain because his daughter presumably died during failed experiment by Alistair Krei (what a silly name, Aleister Crowley was definitely an inspiration so we would think he's an ultimate evil), but of course she hadn't died. <br/><br/>Baymax is as cute as Dupey and speaks like Dilbert. He's the only slightly meaningful character but thanks to such a predictable, contrived plot even he becomes annoying. His looks are a mix of Kung Fu Panda and Marvin from the Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy. I wonder if his brain is as big as Marvin's. In the end this cute inflatable fella sacrifices himself of course (wow!).<br/><br/>I can't believe Disney wasted 165 million on the production of this ""movie"", but couldn't write a decent story and think through the characters. What a shame. I have no doubt though many people will gobble this junk and ask for more. Sad, sad, sad!"

","Big Hero 6 is based on Marvel's comic book, which obviously means that this is a superhero movie. While the genre has been growing bigger, this movie sticks to the basics. In spite that it takes place in a larger than life world where a city called San Fransokyo exists, the stories beneath the characters are simple classic superhero stuff. The action is just teased with a couple of breathtaking sequences, there's a lot of build up to deal with getting there. This is more Spider-Man and Iron Man than The Avengers type of film, it's the heart that aims more of the impact than the action. Big Hero 6 is awesome in many of its elements, easily making this one of the most delightful and heartwarming films you'll see all year.<br/><br/>The only quibble here is the superhero movie elements feel a little forced. How the team is formed doesn't have the development it seems to deserve, they're just a bunch of misfits that join forces, relying to only one definition to each other which is the fact that they're geniuses, and that's probably enough for the movie, apparently. Even the villain doesn't have any distinction in his arc. They are all just displayed there for the sake of the genre. It's not that it's badly done, it's just doesn't sound so fresh anymore. But the movie has better priorities. This is generally about Hiro dealing with the loss of his brother and having an unlikely friendship with his legacy, Baymax. The theme of loss is not a stranger to both animation and superhero, but how the film handles it is a surprising turn that outweighs the rest of the experience. The scenes with Baymax are also the film's greatest moments, consisting with memorable gags and some adorable parts of the robot trying to overcome Hiro's emotional pain.<br/><br/>The bigger parts end up being the secondary appeal, while I said their origins may not be that innovating, there are still some cool stuff to explore. Their world is dazzling to look at, you could find plenty of fascinating inspirations from both cultures that were combined in San Fransokyo. The heroes aside Hiro and Baymax each have a set of abilities and personalities that that the audience would still root for, even if they are yet to be fully fleshed out in the upcoming sequels. This is a totally likable environment, but what's more important here is really the main duo. Everything else, including the spectacular action and flying sequences around the cities, are just additional entertainment to make the overall film totally fun. The voice acting brings enough pizazz throughout, while manifests genuine emotions beneath the drama.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 could have been a typical superhero set up, except except this one has a unique world and the capability of delivering relentless excitement and laughs, but what made the movie special is when it focuses on the main character; his relationship with his brother and his invention. Those are the parts where the story seems really sincere, making its entirety quite compelling, possibly almost leading the audience to tears (or just me.) But as a superhero movie, everything you seek for is all there, and that would be enough for a fun blockbuster. Big Hero 6 has the superhero bombast and the superhero heart."

","Not doing any research at all before viewing this movie, I assumed the title referred specifically to the big, white inflatable robot. But it doesn't. The robot is Baymax, it was invented by Hiro's brother as something to make instant medical assessments and then provide care. The title is a reference to Hiro and 5 of his friends banding together, each with a different ""power"", to fight evil, so the six of them together form the ""Big Hero 6"".<br/><br/>Younger brother is a prodigy, Hiro Hamada. He is entering college even though he is only 14. To get into a prestigious school for gifted inventors he comes up with a small ""mini-bot"" that is controlled by a headband Hiro wears. But then he makes thousands of these identical mini-bots and by thought alone he can have them assemble into any shape or accomplish almost anything.<br/><br/>There is a fire and explosion, Hiro thinks the mini-bots and his headband are destroyed, but they in fact were stolen by the evil scientist and the fire was a cover-up. Most of the movie is about Hiro and his friends, and the Baymax, discovering the identity of the thief and defeating him.<br/><br/>The animation is of course superb and the animated characters are interesting. There is even a Stan Lee appearance, in animated form, in a short scene immediately after the credits finish."

I find it odd and impossible that one person categorized as nerd/geek has to automatically like Doctor Who, Lord of the Rings, Marvel, DC, Star Wars, Star Trek, etc. I myself love Marvel and Who but I have grown tired of Star Wars and am no fan of Harry Potter.

And that is what this movie is. A good one shot viewing and not a long lasting one.<br/><br/>This film just did not get to me. I felt it was like every other ""hero"" film. The story was simple and just went all over the place at times, with a few ""plot holes"" such as the ending with Baymax and the whole villain thing.<br/><br/>In the end, Big Hero 6 was entertaining to watch, like Transformers but it also is as much an actual film as Transformers, meaning, all pretty effects and no real story or characters to look up to. <br/><br/>Sorry but Disney dropped the ball this time.

None of it's truly original. All the way down to the achingly bad ""San Fransokyo"" thing. There were a few times when I was genuinely entertained. The only problem is - that's not why I watch movies, to become a mindless garbage receptacle. I hate to admit it but what was said about Krei early in the film - that he basically cheats his way around science and only cares about money is EXACTLY where Walt Disney Studios is right now. I hate to say it but Disney is showing that it is not concerned with true art, only $$<br/><br/>On the other hand, a truly beautiful work of art came out in 2013, from a real film studio with integrity Studio Ghibli. Did it get the credit it deserved? Not even close. If you want to watch an actual film that's worth your time, look up The Tale of Princess Kaguya.

This is another Disney outsourced flop that has all of the technical details of a great movie but no soul.<br/><br/>Maybe I am too negative because Disney is coming off a truly great movie in Frozen. So you know they can do it, but this movie just never clicks. It is just forced like it was developed in an India animation sweatshop.

","I watched this film at a strange time in terms of its reception; before its Oscar win it seemed to be a film that most people enjoyed or really enjoyed, however once it won Best Animated Feature, there seemed to be quite the backlash against it. I tried not to pay too much attention to either camp and went into the film for myself. The plot is driven by a device that seems to be quite common and one that more children's films are using – which is death and loss. In this case we have the main character and main villain motivated by the loss of a loved one, and this is what leads them to their respective points. This is something that can be tremendously impacting and also done very well (How to Train Your Dragon 2, for example) but in this case I thought it was a bit too much, too soon – introducing darkness for children, but only being a plot device to adult viewers. I guess the good thing is that at least it occurs early in the film so is out of the way.<br/><br/>From here we get some nice comedy with the lovable Baymax as well as a superhero origin plot, although by far the former is better than the latter. The film from here is much brighter and funnier than some would suggest, and I generally enjoyed what it did, even if it still continued to really be able to balance the heart of the piece. This balancing act is pretty much forgotten by the final third, where it becomes much more a Marvel film than a Disney one. Feeling a touch like Captain America or some film like this, the action sequence and rapid movement is engaging and entertaining, but it does feel like just another action movie whereas the first half of the film felt like much more of a family comedy. These conflicting tones and contents never really gel the way they should, but mostly it works.<br/><br/>Technically the film is astounding. The animation is fantastic in its scale and detail, from the expanse of the city through to the smooth, soft likability of Baymax himself. Okay Hiro looks far too much like he is the lead from How to Train Your Dragon, but otherwise all the characters and action is very well delivered. The very high production standards, good comedy moments, and fast-moving energy in a simple frame all do produce a perfectly fun and entertaining film on the whole, but it is one I enjoyed watching rather than one I would rush back to see again and again. The use of loss and death never feels like more than a plot device, and the heart of the piece is a lot less evident than it would have been in a better film – which is not to say I did not enjoy it for the things it did, just that it is a lot more limited than we have come to expect from huge budget animated family films."

","As a single senior with no kids to accompany me to this well received animated wonderment, I was confident that this movie would entertain me in the same vein as The Lego Movie and Wreck It Ralph. I thought it was again built for kids with a sprinkling of adult concepts enough to emerge from childlike entertainment to amuse the adult funny bone throughout. Wrong! This is a kid's movie...period. Intense color, action, no logic to the story elements, just a kind of psychedelic splattering of stream of consciousness video game dream sequences. Over 18? Beware the waste of your movie dollar. Under 18? The action, state of the art animation, and absolute childlike fantasies brought to life, it's beyond lovable."

","My Dad and I see lots of movies together,but rare is it that my Dad will go on and on about a movie but that is what he did for this movie. Disney has really been hitting it out of the park lately. As both a Marvel and Disney fan this movie appealed to both sides. Unlike superhero movies like the Avengers,this is a movie you can take younger ones to.<br/><br/>San Fransokyo really blended the two cities well. I would love to see Disney do something with that in the parks. All the characters were wonderful;smart,funny and loyal. The cast was diverse but it was a cast that happened to be diverse instead of a diverse cast. That's when you know you've hit diversity when it's just a part of the who the characters are not the main part. The villain was nothing special but that's a very minor complaint of an otherwise amazing movie. What Frozen did for sisters, Big Hero 6 does for brothers. You can really see how much they love each other and Hiro's brother is always looking out for him and is a great example to Hiro. Hiro's grief is not a blink and miss it is with him throughout the movie. He learns to get support from his friends and that his brother will always be with him."

It seems like they picked this up at a Japanese animation garage sale. Be warned, the movie deals with the death of a sibling. If you take younger children to see it, be prepared to explain puberty.<br/><br/>There is a limited amount of likability to the overstuffed marshmallow, but I doubt he will be on any kids want list.

","BH6 tries to be emotional, funny, dramatic and action packed all in the same time. But it fails.<br/><br/>Hiro, main character, is not interesting nor original. As if created from several other characters, he is too clever, too resourceful, too emotional to be lead character. He is like Hiccup from How to Train Your Dragon, but not likable. He creates robots and stuff out of thin air, in no time, with no resources, and has solution for every problem. Not even once any of other 'heroes' had any input on course of action. That was boring to death.<br/><br/>Baymax is fun, and viewer gets all the fun in the movie out of his character.<br/><br/>Other 'heroes' are described only marginally. There is absolutely nothing that you can feel about them during the movie, since you don't know anything about them.<br/><br/>There were no time to get to know any of the characters - too much fighting, flying, even one ridiculous car chase, and one-liners to start to even care about anyone in the movie. Again, maybe Baymax.<br/><br/>If you want to see good movie, watch Wall-E (emotional and fun), or The Incredibles (action and emotional and fun), or How to Train Your Dragon (1st part, fun etc) or Stitch (and Lilo, you'll surely like those two).<br/><br/>BH6 is fast paced.

If anyone of the other 'heroes' died in any of the fights, I doubt I could remember when that happened and who is missing - that is extent of detachment I got from the main characters. <br/><br/>Sorry if I disappointed anybody, but this movie doesn't deserve more than three stars."
"maxmages","8","3","4","29 December 2018"," I try to picture me without Baymax but I can't.
","After overdosing on Disney and superheroes, I urgently needed something to comedown.
I would never have expected in life that exactly this film could do it. It is one of the Marvelous Marvel films ever. And has revived some of the Disney tropes that have not been used since the days of Cinderella and the Jungle Book for a good reason.<br/><br/>Probably no one is as surprised as me but all these things, all these ingredients and just these clichés have really promised me so that I could not get enough of this movie. Always I have the impression that time is standing still and I have discovered something new and just want to dive into this movie. I know that many things have been changed and there are some things that have nothing to do with the comic but ..
Who cares?
In space it does not look like ""Star Wars"", ""Hellboy"" is not a ""Men In Black"" and the makers of ""Starship Troopers"" never read the book. I was simply impressed, fascinated, encouraged, wanted to train, applauded and even had watery eyes at the end.<br/><br/>Despite all these praises, unfortunately, I have to give a few criticisms:
The character relationships are resolved a bit too fast, the team is not exactly balanced and the members do not complement each other very well, it is called ""show, don't tell"" but not ""just don't tell"" and the end again is Typical Disney kitsch, but I think we would not be so over saturated with all the happy ending this movie would stand out a little better. It is a really very emotionally satisfying film that only suffers from the fact that it is between so many films that have tried the same.
But that makes it a hidden gem that I can always admire again.<br/><br/>They say we are what we are But we don't have to be."

","Translated from Spanish by Google Translate.<br/><br/>I do not understand how an animated film so well to get to become a disappointing script. Bee Movie was another disappointment for not contributing anything to the history of animation, but the quality of their work, as in almost all. We could add in the disappointments Up, for their atrocities in the script. But this one in question is totally cheap as the script. Superheroes friends, forgiveness friends ""superheroes"" are duller than I've seen in the animated screen. Boring and simpletons, highlighting ... The truth is that the four can excel in their work of originality. The only thing that can save the story is the protagonist child and the superhero robot, with a few gags are funny. The manipulation of history so that everything fits and ""good"" win the game and the ""bad"" is defeated is quite childish. Finally, and in short, perfect image and technology; suspense in the script and the characters.<br/><br/>Ah, I forgot the character of ""aunt"" of the brothers, totally hated by simpleton. Minimally, but very minimally, the role of the evil, which is a character who is unsuccessful in most films of American animation, greatly highlighting the wicked from Disney saved."
"Talia_the_StoryMaker","6","3","4","7 September 2015"," Good, but would've been better if they dropped the superhero angle
","Overall, this was a cute, likable and fun movie. The aesthetics were really great. The superheroes had pretty fun aesthetics, powers and general appeal, and the action and adventure was pretty enjoyable. Definitely the best part of all was Baymax and his relationship with Hiro.<br/><br/>However, while this movie was good, I wouldn't say it's exceptional or anything. It probably would've been much better if they hadn't tried to make it a movie about a superhero team and instead had a story more focused on just Baymax, Hiro and their relationship. I know this seems contradictory, since I just said I found the superhero part fun...but I still feel like the movie would've been stronger if they had been replaced by more focus on the stronger part of the movie.<br/><br/>While there were good parts about the superhero aspects, there were also some definite flaws as well. Most of the team is really underdeveloped. I definitely want to like them, and to an extent I do, but they just didn't have time to give all the characters the delineation and development they needed.<br/><br/>In addition, making this a superhero movie allows them to rely more on clichés, making the movie fundamentally less interesting. If they had made a movie more focused on just Baymax and Hiro and not requiring as much superhero action, they would've ended up with something much more ""all its own"". It wouldn't just be another superhero movie, except animated. It would be no longer be something so defined by its genre.<br/><br/>I just want to emphasize that the Baymax-Hiro aspect of this movie was really strong in so many ways. Baymax is different from other robots you've seen in many ways, from his design to his personality. He's not another robot who wants to become a human or be accepted as a human or anything, his goal is to perform what he's programmed to do, and to do it in the most endearing way possible. He's just anthropomorphic enough, but they don't overdo it or focus primarily on that aspect of him. A really interesting dynamic is also created by Hiro trying to reprogram and redesign Baymax and get him to do things he was never intended to do. It would've been so much stronger if they had focused more completely on this aspect of the movie, instead of forcing the superhero team angle which I feel was ultimately detrimental. You can still incorporate some of the same themes of revenge and whatnot. You can still include a villain. You don't need all the clichéd superhero aspects or all the extra spectacle.<br/><br/>Again, I actually LIKED the other characters on the superhero team. But ultimately, I would gladly sacrifice them for a much stronger movie overall. And that's what would've happened if they had focused on this movie's true strong point. This movie was certainly decent, but if they hadn't insisted on it being a superhero movie, it could've been truly GREAT.<br/><br/>Oh, and I would just like to mention that I guessed the villain's secret identity IMMEDIATELY. And by that I mean, even before they showed the supervillain, when they showed the person who is his secret identity for the first time, I knew he would turn evil. There were also a few suspension-of-disbelief testers, like how Baymax was able to detect anyone in the city, the fact that a certain character managed to stay alive when (s)he really shouldn't have been able to, etc.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was fine. But if they had dropped the superhero aspect and focused more wholly on Hiro and Baymax instead, it could've been much, MUCH better."

"alixj248","7","4","6","2 June 2015"," Shocked at the Hate this film is receiving from the General Public
","It is no secret we are in a new Disney revival era, just as we were in the middle of the Disney Renaissance in the 1990s. The release of The Princess and the Frog seemed to see to that, almost acting as the Little Mermaid 20 years later. Then along came Tangled with it's memorable songs, lovely animation, strong female lead and darker plot(characters being stabbed, hung etc) paralleling Beauty and the Beast. Which was followed by Wreck it Ralph, the film everyone was excited to see just as they were Aladdin, (many video game characters in one place/Robin Williams as the Genie-RIP) And then Frozen came along and everything exploded! Love, constant singing of the songs, quoting, cosplay, fan tributes, merchandise, as well as many similar plot points- is definitely the Lion King of the 21st Century. As most of those who grew up in 1995 will be aware that after the highest grossing 2D Animated film of all time was released, Disney decided to do something new. They released their ambitious project of Pocahontas, the first historical Disney film, telling of the Native American princess and her life as well as her meeting with John Smith. It received mild reviews from critics and even less complimentary reviews from the general public who said it wasn't as interesting as The Lion King and messed with history. Big Hero 6 is the Pocahontas of this decade. As Frozen was such a huge hit, skyrocketing it's way to highest grossing animated film of all time, it only makes sense that it would be hard to top that. <br/><br/>Big Hero 6 is based on a Marvel comic of the same name. It takes place in the fictional city of San Fransokyo, in an alternate universe where America helped Japan to rebuild after the earthquake in the 1920s, supposedly changing history so that the Second World War never happened. The city is new and modern and filled with burgeoning inventors creating robots to benefit mankind. One of these is a 14-year-old tech prodigy named Hiro Hamada, who attempts to get into a special ""nerd school,"" however after the death of his older brother Tadashi, Hiro's plans are cut short. He eventually finds comfort in a nurse bot Tadashi made for him named Baymax who has little emotion but is programmed to love and care. When Hiro discovers a masked villain has stolen his microbot inventions, he teams up with his friends from the tech college to create a superhero task force to hunt him down. The good things about this film are VERY GOOD. The animation is lovely and the city is a unique style of both the US and Japan, for example my favourite piece of architecture was the golden gate bridge redesigned to look like a scarlet Shinto temple-how cool is that?! Second the characters all seem very genuine. Hiro is a real 14 year old boy who is smarter than most his age and who becomes very passionate and nerdy when he talks about what he loves. Tadashi is a kind and caring older brother, but he still teases Hiro and occasionally gets caught with him by the police after an illegal robot fight. The Aunt who takes care of The story is nice and surprisingly mature, especially since it deals a lot with death and loss. Tadashi's death is one of this saddest deaths I've seen in a Disney movie in a while. There is a fire in the tech college and Tadashi runs in to save one of the professors and in turn loses his life after a fiery explosion. The aftermath is heart wrenching-pictures and flowers being laid on the steps of the building, everyone in black, dressed up for a funeral for Tadashi in a rice paddy graveyard. The wake at the house. After that it does go back into cutesy again but still doesn't shy away from the harshness of sudden death and the impact it has on families. Once Hiro discovers the professor Tadashi tried to save is alive as masquerading as the Kabooki mask villain, his anger takes over causing him to change Baymax settings to killer mode and nearly dooming everyone. The bad things are actually quite minor. As an adaptation it does need changes. Some are small, like Wasabi being African American instead of Japanese however I do like the students who later team up with Hiro and they don't get enough screen time! II like Gogo Tamago and her rebellious streak, I like Honey Lemon and her chemistry obsession. Much like the Incredibles I wish there was more focus on the other team members instead of just two. The only thing that bugs me about this movie-I mean REALLY bugs me-is actually the fact that Baymax lives. I know that sounds horrible, but Hiro had already learned that death could happen to anyone so first of all Baymax being dead for months before being reanimated was really unnecessary. If anyone needed to learn about death it should have been Baymax himself, robots do learn even if they don't show emotion. I think it's the same as Frankenweenie, I wasn't pleased they reanimated Sparky because Victor didn't learn his lesson that bringing dead things back to life was wrong-and the townspeople of New Holland encouraged it! So is it a bad film, or a really terrible one? Of course not. It's a fantastic film. It's very very sweet, sad funny and there's a lot of Disney care put into it. I don't think it deserves such a bad rep from reviewers on here. This film is perfect for 6 and up. I say the best way to watch it is with your family and kids in your living room."
"Turfseer","4","64","174","30 November 2014"," Only the animation team has integrity as obnoxious 'superheros' battle unpleasant professor villain in a mythical 'San Fransokyo'
","'Big Hero 6' is based on an obscure Marvel comic series that was adapted by Disney and reconfigured into a 3D computer-animated superhero comedy. The characters function in San Fransokyo, a mash-up obviously of San Francisco and Tokyo. At first I thought this might be a city in a future USA where somehow Japanese culture became overwhelmingly influential but it turns out the city is entirely mythical (wouldn't it have been more realistic to use China as a model for some kind of future transfiguration?).<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the protagonist here is Hiro Himada, a 14 year old Japanese-American robotics prodigy. I could buy the idea that the kid has developed a small robot that he uses to win cash in illegal, back alley robot fights, but what comes next strained my credulity. After Hiro's brother Tadashi saves him from a bunch of rough characters who have been engaging in robot fights on the streets, he takes him to the university where he attends, which specializes in advanced robotics. Since Hiro has a rebellious streak, he never got around to checking out the university, which is right up his alley. Oddly, to be accepted, academic performance is not considered, but rather the fledging thespian must develop a robotics project which impresses the faculty.<br/><br/>Hiro ends up developing a project involving 'microbots' which swarm together to form any structure imaginable. The whole idea of the university is to help the student create the next great technical innovation. Hiro, however, has already done it, so why does he have to attend a university to improve on his capabilities? Nonetheless, when he's offered the chance to sell out to tech guru Alistar Krei of the new rising tech company, Krei Tech, he goes with Professor Callaghan at the University. <br/><br/>'Big Hero Six' begins its march toward complete unpleasantness, when Hidashi dies in a fire at the university. Callaghan saves himself by encasing himself in a swarm of microbots during the fire. While at first Krei appears to be the villain, it soon becomes apparent that Callaghan becomes a much bigger antagonist. He blames Krei for the apparent death of his daughter during a failed teleportation experiment. Very conveniently, Callaghan uses Hiro's microbots to attempt to destroy Krei and his company.<br/><br/>Hiro attempts to stop Callaghan by enlisting the aid of Tadashi's last creation, Baymax, a robot that resembles the Pillsbury Dough Boy. Baymax has a computer chip that turns him into a kindly physician, who can both diagnose and treat virtually any illness. Hiro is also aided by Tadashi's team of student colleagues who morph into superheros with Hiro, replete with special costumes (a la 'The Avengers').<br/><br/>The last third of the picture involves tiresome battle sequences where the superhero team is pitted against Callaghan and the microbots. When the vengeful, obsessed professor is finally subdued, we're treated to the completely awkward discovery that his daughter was in stasis the whole time inside a worm hole, and is saved—only to see her idiotic father being hauled away by the police, and probably sent up the river for years due to his myopic thirst for revenge.<br/><br/>Hiro learns his 'lesson' after first switching Baymax's microchip, transforming him into a violent robot with enhanced karate skills, only to suddenly realize that he was echoing Professor Callaghan's proclivities toward vengefulness and realizing he needed to turn the robot back into a kindly, attending physician.<br/><br/>For aficionados of violent video games, a good deal of 'Big Hero Six' is for you. The painstaking animation goes all for naught when one discovers that the film is devoid of charm. Everyone and everything is obnoxious: from 'kick-ass' Hiro to Betamax, where the medical profession is put up on a pedestal. From brother Tadashi's death, to the most unpleasant Callaghan, who insanely attempts to 'get even' after an accident, this is a film that is hardly appropriate for children. If you must see it, do so for the excellent animation team—they, as opposed to the screenwriters, still have some integrity left."
"3xHCCH","8","18","41","7 November 2014"," Baymax Saves the Day (and the Film Too!)
","The city is San Fransokyo, a hybrid between San Francisco and Tokyo. Hiro Tadashi is a bored child prodigy who graduated high school at 13, and whiles his time making fighter robots. His brother Tadashi is in college under esteemed pioneer Robert Callaghan, working on his own project -- a big white inflatable robot nurse named Baymax.<br/><br/>After Hiro develops a highly original, versatile and powerful mind- controlled microbot technology, Callaghan invites him into his program as well. However, that same fateful night, a big explosive fire breaks out at the school building with a highly tragic aftermath which would flip Hiro's world over. <br/><br/>With Baymax as his invaluable robot sidekick, Hiro would discover that there was something more behind that fire. Hiro uses his techy genius to upgrade the abilities of Baymax, along with four of his brothers' inventor friends -- Gogo, Honey Lemon, Wasabi and Fred -- to from a group of six superheroes who sought to get to the bottom of the mystery of the man in the Kabuki mask behind the whole thing.<br/><br/>It was only after the film that I found out that Big Hero 6 was actually a group of superheroes from Marvel Comics back in the late 1990s. This is the first Disney animated film that featured Marvel comic characters since the former acquired the latter in 2009. Disney was given license to change the appearances of the characters for the film version, Disney-fying them so to speak.<br/><br/>While watching the film, I got the vibe of Pixar's ""The Incredibles"", and even the rival company Dreamworks' ""How to Train Your Dragon."" But this film had its own memorable moments, mostly thanks to that adorable giant marshmallow of a robot, Baymax.<br/><br/>Baymax is really a wonder to watch. His face is nothing more than a two black dots connected by a line. However he can convey so much emotion with those. A lot of the credit I guess would fall on his animators who were successful to create a genuinely cute character who is not annoying (Olaf anyone?) The voice acting of Scott Adsit also gave Baymax his kind and compassionate character. <br/><br/>If not for Baymax, this whole film would be a generic superhero cartoon with little to remember it by. We did not really know the other four members of the team except that they were friends and classmates of Tadashi who had invented some awesome stuff. Hiro is the usual spirited Disney boy hero, but for a change this hero was no fool or weakling. His supreme intellect and engineering skills set him apart.<br/><br/>However, these may all be just nitpicking because as a whole the film was very entertaining and enjoyable for the whole family. The animated special effects were fantastically conceived, executed and great to watch. As a sucker for films featuring brothers, I loved that the story between Hiro and Tadashi was so touchingly told. <br/><br/>Since this is technically a Disney-Marvel film, do wait for an extra scene after ALL the end credits. The credits rolled for an interminable ten minutes before the extra scene, but these scene is a must-see and worth the long wait. This short scene features a cameo from a guy we see in cameos from most all Marvel films."

Baymax, the fat white robot, is cute and adorable. His lines and fistbump are epic! How I wish he exists for real! Hiro's friends are amazing and different in their own ways. Gogo is the kickass girl and Honey Lemon is a tall girl who wears high heels. The villain feels like a ghost from J-horror films, so a PG rating is very deserved by this film. I like the emotional and moral tensions unfolded in the story run. The plot twists are amazing, emotional, and shocking. <br/><br/>San Fransokyo is spectacular. Seeing the torii-themed Golden Gate Bridge, the giant cat statue, and the sumo wrestling-like robot fight are very awesome. 3D is well used, unlike in ""Frozen"". Indeed, the filmtranscends the typically predictable superhero film. <br/><br/>I give this 9 of 10 because I'm disappointed that Hiro has to be half-Japanese instead of full. Race-bending has happened with ""The Last Airbender"", ""47 Ronin"", and ""Edge of Tomorrow"" and I think this act backfired with these movies' success and profitability. I thought that the hybrid city San Fransokyo promotes racial diversity but the film falls short into it. Also, the title is misleading. I thought this is the sixth installment of a film franchise that is probably only shown in Japan. Much better if called ""Big Heroes"".<br/><br/>Anyway, if you love anime and Disney, you're gonna love ""Big Hero 6""."
"tieman64","Null","37","96","9 February 2015"," How to Train Your Robot
","An animated feature by Walt Disney Studios, ""Big Hero 6"" revolves around 14 year old Hiro Hamada, a vaguely Japanese robotics prodigy whose inventions are stolen by a mysterious masked man. With the help of a medical robot called Baymax, Hiro attempts to solve this crime. Assisting him are a band of super-scientists, each armed with high-tech gizmos.<br/><br/>Wholly derivative, ""Big Hero 6"" plays like an amalgamation of every animated feature released over the past ten years. Almost every character is a wisecracking, manically animated attempt at ""cool"", family members die on cue, villains are predictably revealed and the film's last act rolls out the usual heroic sacrifices and false deaths. Throw in obligatory ""flying sequences"", ""musical montages"", ""canned sentimentality"", generic ""action sequences"" and several moments done better in other recent animated features (""Megamind"", ""Summer Wars"", ""Iron Giant"", ""The Incredibles"" etc), and you have a film almost entirely devoid of imagination.<br/><br/>Computer animated features allow for a level of hyper-control almost impossible in conventional films. Every ray of light, every colour, every camera movement, can be fine tuned with machine precision. Despite this, the virtual choreography of ""Big Hero 6"" is mostly unimpressive. The film's aesthetic – manic, overly busy, graceless, no scene allowed to breathe – is itself annoying; like listening to a sugar-addicted 5 year old yell for 90 minutes. Like most recent animated films, ""Big Hero 6"" struggles to be both action adventure and anti-violence sermon. It contains one neat bit of conceptual design: a marshmallow-shaped inflatable robot.<br/><br/>6/10 - Better recent animated films: Chomet's ""The Illusionist"", Hosoda's ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"", ""Summer Wars"", ""The Secret World of Arrietty"", Oshii's ""The Sky Crawlers"", ""From Up on Poppy Hill"" and Yeon Sang-ho's ""The King of Pigs"". Worth one viewing."
"Robert_duder","9","11","23","17 November 2014"," Disney does it again
","I don't think there is any question that Disney is the undisputed King of Animated. In many ways they always have been but in modern day they have taken that to a whole new level. They don't make cartoons for kids anymore but rather films that are animated that everyone can love. They've made animation a completely viable form of film making. The trailer for Big Hero 6 absolutely had me hooked. It reminded of Wall-E (one of the most brilliant animated films of all time) but also had that super-hero/Marvel vibe so I was intrigued. Big Hero 6 does not disappoint for a single second. The characters are as vibrant and fun and full of life as you can expect, the action is non-stop, the story is solid and they lay a foundation for future films though that seems unlikely given the time and effort and money they put into each one of their animated films. The only truly ""successful"" franchise of Disney/Pixar Animation seems to be Toy Story which gets better and better each time around. Big Hero 6 is fresh and unique and a little bit dark but not dark enough to ruin it for older children. It has moments of intensity and some violence but nothing ten and up can't handle. Its a story of bravery, grief and loss and acceptance.<br/><br/>Ryan Potter voices our hero...Hiro. One of the best things about Disney/Pixar films is their casting. Somehow they almost always absolutely nail these characters with their voices and Hiro is no exception. We become attached to this young genius and he's the perfect hero and leader for the Big Hero 6. Scott Adsit is the adorable, hilarious and heroic Baymax. He was simply amazing as I knew the character would be and Adsit captures it perfectly. TJ Miller, Jamie Chung, Damon Wayans Jr, Genesis Rodriguez all play significant parts and you completely lose yourself in their quirky and fun characters. Much like The Incredibles, Big Hero 6 gives you the opportunity to find your favourite hero and gravitate to them. The only downside is that we don't get to see a lot of them because there are so many characters. Regardless you will have your favourite and you'll want to see more of them. James Cromwell, Alan Tudyk and Maya Rudolph are just stupendous in their perspective roles as the adults in the film. Rudolph in particular has a small role that is just really terrific.<br/><br/>The animation is nothing short of stunning. I saw the film in 3D which made no difference at all of course (yes I'm a 3D hater but wasn't given the option) but regardless of that the special effects and animation are excellent. The car chase scene when they are being pursued by the mask villain is just brilliant, edge of your seat stuff. The villain himself is a brilliant piece of work. He is memorable and visually very effective and yet never utters a word when he is in costume. He reminds me of a Disney classic Villain and a Sith Lord all rolled into one. If you think The Avengers is perhaps a little too intense for your youngster then Big Hero 6 is just as effective. They aren't well known heroes but that only adds to the originality of this story. I still wouldn't let my young youngsters watch it due to some intensity but that's your call. My major beef with the film (and its not really major) is the ending felt a little too neat and tidy. It was an okay ending on a truly great film. It felt a little hurried and a little too easy and perhaps they could have drawn on that a little more. Regardless Big Hero 6 is everything I expected from the studio and their latest entry. This is a must see for children, adults, superhero fans and anyone wanting a great time at the movies. 9/10"
"foghorn_clj","4","55","151","3 January 2015"," Underwhelming (and a blatant rip-off of a popular sci-fi franchise)
","Oh what potential this movie had. I mean what movie could go wrong with a giant, lovable, sweet, inflatable robot as a main character?? A character so adorable that grown women would buy stuff toys of it to sleep with.<br/><br/>But alas the execution is so scattered & convoluted that the charm factor is totally lost. Where to begin?<br/><br/>1. The beginning - unnecessarily long winded. The BOT fights & tech convention didn't really need to be a part of the story. <br/><br/>2. 4 supporting characters - woefully underdeveloped to the point of being totally superfluous. Boring and unnecessary.<br/><br/>3. Not enough time spent ""getting to know bay max"". Seriously the entire appeal of the character is that it's sweet and adorable and naively funny. Instead almost immediately Hiro turns him into a warrior to fight. And Hiro turning all homicidal halfway through & asking Baymax to kill Callaghan was frightening for a kids movie.<br/><br/>4. The main villain's use of the micro-bots - uninspired and boring. Seriously they can take any form and all he does is constantly shoot them in a straight line towards the heroes?<br/><br/>5. The flagrant rip off of ""Stargate"" - I mean there's an homage and there's blatant copying. A round metallic circle that creates a blueish, water-like event horizon which transports people from one portal to another??? And don't even get me started on the whole ""going into the event horizon and finding the girl in some temporal dimension"".<br/><br/>But all the adult over-analysis not withstanding, overall it was a boring labored story with a few genuine laughs here & there."

","This movie was unoriginal and totally cliché. We've seen it all before. Some of the attempts at ""comedy"" were simply random. The cool graphics were eclipsed by a holey plot and the inventions were backed with a lack of creativity. I feel as if the creators were just trying to get it to be dramatic, then got bored with it and said lets move on to the next project. I was extremely disappointed with what I expected to be a fun, cute and well-thought through kids' action story and am appalled that this movie got an Oscar on account of its blatant absence of depth. There were many parts where I rolled my eyes because of the overused script. The big moments were not explained and left the watcher unsatisfied."

Once again Disney provides us with great characters and fun personalities. There was enough variety in the team that everyone is sure to relate and love someone. The animation was wonderful. The fictional city is so rich with detail and felt like it was a real city you'd want to live in. And the movie was full of emotions, a little crying and a lot of laughing. And the script was very well written and now my family has a few more quotes we'll be using for years to come.<br/><br/>Great job Disney! Another favorite for our family. Can't wait to see it again.

"bmcdannell","9","16","38","6 November 2014"," What a Relief!
","After a long period of major disappointment with animated movies such as How to Train Your Dragon 2 (watch the first one twice instead) and Frozen (Disney's most over-hyped - er, excuse me - popular movie ever...seriously?), we had hopes that this would not be another loser. We were far more than pleased, as it turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable experience from beginning to end. It was packed with humor (very little of it of the bodily function variety for a change), heart and important life lessons for the younger audience. While I was stunned by the visuals of San Fransokyo and the attention to detail, my wife was equally impressed at how much expression and emotion could be extracted from Baymax - considering he has no mouth and not much in the way of eyes to register expression. There are some interesting - and I do not think for one second unintentional - parallels to the old Scooby Doo cartoons in terms of both plot and looks and behavior of a couple of the characters, but that's forgivable and I think will make the movie that much more accessible to those 40 and under. I won't go in to plot details; I'll just note that this should be a fun ride for any age - nothing to scare the little ones (one 2 second shot of a menacing dark figure in a Kabuki mask is the worst). We also think it was well worth it to see the film on the big screen. If you're into 3D have at it, but I doubt that it would add much to this film - and might actually detract from the beauty of the scenic backgrounds. Having endured the overlong train wreck that was Gone Girl (see our review) earlier this week, Big Hero 6 was a welcome and tremendously entertaining relief."

Good ideas turned into something totally predictable in which you can guess every cliché and tropes that will happen. The action is very boring and feels like it was made unwillingly. This movie is not entertaining to adults accustomed to good animation movies, perhaps entertain children, but I doubt that the rhythm of this film will keep them glued to the screen.

"rannynm","10","15","36","5 November 2014"," Adorable, Funny, Clever, Action-Packed Adventure
","The movie Big Hero 6 is adorable, funny, and downright enjoyable. The movie is about a young, intelligent, robotics fanatic named Hiro Hamada, voiced by Ryan Potter, who spends his days hustling adults in ""bot fights"" until his brother, Tadashi, voiced by Daniel Henney, introduces him to his college and friends. Hiro then spends his days trying to get accepted into his brother's school to apply his knowledge of robotics to a greater cause. Hiro later develops a lovable bond between himself and an inflatable robot named Baymax, voiced by Scott Adsit. After Hiro encounters a dangerous force that threatens his future and safety of the city, he turns to Baymax and his friends to make a heroic group called ""Big Hero 6"" to fight evil. The movie takes us through an action-packed adventure that provides laughter, tears, tension and relief. <br/><br/>The unpredictable plot makes the movie very exciting and hilarious. The movie is funny within the first few minutes which is really delightful because it avoids a slow beginning. Even though this movie is about superheroes fighting evil with intense superhero gear, it does not follow the typical superhero expectations because the heroes handle situations differently than expected. The movie provides realism and surprisingly does not sugar coat certain scenarios. There a certain times where one would think ""wow, I'm surprised Disney did that"" but that surprise is good because it makes the movie stand out from the rest in a new and different way. <br/><br/>The characters are so lovable, especially Baymax, an adorable robot whose only purpose is to make others feel better. Because of this, it is easy for the audience to get attached to the characters and engage with the movie emotionally. The movie is phenomenal and appeals to adults as much as children which is a very special aspect. <br/><br/>Not only does Big Hero 6 have clever dialogue, great special effects, lovable characters and nice music, but it also pays attention to little details and messages about education and friendship that contribute to an amazing movie as a whole. I will definitely watch this movie multiple times and recommend it ages 5 to 18. Be sure to check it out in theaters on November 7th.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Harmony M., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."
"sjarja","5","42","120","9 January 2015"," your average ""teenage hero finds his place in society"" movie
","Enjoyable but without any surprises.<br/><br/>The character designs are the wide eyed Disney CGI designs seen in Frozen, Tangled etc. . The setting itself is a futuristic .. well, lets say utopian city (not sure if it may not be dystopian, but i think it leans more to the utopian side).<br/><br/>The story follows your stereotypical arc. Unwilling kid becomes hero, finds his place in society and a team, beats bad guy.<br/><br/>The bad guy is a bad guy with a twist - a twist that is sadly never really explored much (probably because it is primarily a kids movie and i daresay a kid of the target age range is unlikely to complain about such things) The good guys is your typical ""nerdy"" gang of people that are of course brilliant, rich and deeply caring for each other (especially the protagonist whom they seem to care for a lot more than i would have expected from the brief time they actually got to know each other) The bad guy is someone unsurprising that is shown a ""kind of motivation"" for his actions - but the justification of the extend of his actions is hardly justified ... at all.<br/><br/>However - even if the story seemed to have more problems than i d like to see in such a simple setup - the pacing and humor is well placed.<br/><br/>It may sound a little harsh - but all in all - the movie was kind of forgettable. A time well spent ( not boring ) but 10 minutes afterwards - the rather bland characters popped out of my mind.<br/><br/>The only thing that actually stayed was the idea of Japan and American culture (the good parts of it) merged together to become something quite exotic and amazing."

Too much death and grief for what looks like a cute and fun cartoon. <br/><br/>Don't expect levity, there is none. Don't expect laughs, you've already done all that when you watched the trailer.

","Disney and the Pixar team are back again with another gem of animations! What a great one, easily, best animation of the entire year! This one is a keeper even for adults, it has human themes and philosophies that, sooner or later, you have to address to your kid. Oh, by the way, this review is only for those who watched the movie, it contains major spoilers and reveals major plot points of the movie. If you didn't see it yet, read it at your own risk!<br/><br/>OK, so here's what you have: you get two brothers, Hiro and Tadashi, two nerd brothers with a difference, one goes for the muscles, and the other goes for the mind and heart. Hiro is the younger genius who spend his time with robot fights, while Tadashi goes to school and takes part on the annual school science projects. One can't live without the other, and together, they form the perfect balance. They're like Yin and Yang, two opposites of the same perfect circle that can't find balance without the other. If Hiro is alone, you have only the muscles, but if Tadashi is alone, you have only the heart.<br/><br/>Tadashi created a robot balloon for his school project who helps sick people. When a fire kills Tadashi, Hiro gets himself alone and wants to use the robot to help people, in order to honor his late brother. He's a genius like him, but he doesn't have the heart. The whole medicine program and the whole moral compass of Baymax was developed by Tadashi, while Hiro, develops a chip that allows Baymax to fight. At a point in the movie, Hiro removes Tadashi's chip from Baymax, so the balance gets lost. Hiro then, will have to find this balance again, in order to canalize his Yin to merge together with his Yang and overcome his adversities.<br/><br/>What a beautiful movie and what a beautiful message for kids and grown ups! As always, the animation is superb, the plot is great, the story is exciting, the dialogs I can't say, because I could only see a dubbed version of the movie, I didn't listen to the original dialogs, but I guess they might be good too, because the movie is amazing and the story is awesome. Plus, you get some superhero action! The kids, alongside Hiro form a team of superheroes to fight evil with Baymax the robot and they all rock as characters and as a team. Oh, and you also have the illustrious cameo from Stan Lee in the movie to make everything even more awesome and epic after the credits!<br/><br/>Again, the Pixar team excel themselves and deliver another fine animation. The short animation before the movie, Feast, is cute, but I don't see it as their best short. It's fun and the kids will get entertained with the dog with an endless appetite. Overall, Big Hero 6 is, to me, the best animation from 2014 and I'll certainly wait to buy the DVD so I can listen to the original dialog which I only had some minor contact watching the movie trailer. Definitely, a must watch!"

","Yet another dazzling mega-production that kept me wishing ""if only they had a plot to match the visuals"". Baymax is the main fun character who brought the most smiles with his awkward beginning and big heart at the end. Fred also has his moments but the rest of the characters were fairly dull. I couldn't relate to Hiro because he is too much of a genius with too little compassion. He turns around in the end for no apparent reason. Nothing in the plot surprised me and I kept wishing for less action and more personality--which is my typical reaction to most superhero movies. I like to see difficult challenges overcome, not merely a villain out-gizmoed, out-smarted, or defeated by stronger willpower. There is little character development here, just faster wits and superior technology."

","The special bond that develops between plus-sized inflatable robot Baymax, and prodigy Hiro Hamada, who team up with a group of friends to form a band of high-tech heroes.<br/><br/>As of now (January 2015), the Academy Award announcements have yet to be made. But the buzz has indicated that ""The Lego Movie"" has set itself up as the animated film to beat at this year's awards. And, indeed, it is a strong contender, easily outshining ""The Boxtrolls"" and edging out ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" (if only because this is a sequel).<br/><br/>But the best film of the year is ""Big Hero 6"", without a doubt. Others have called it ""well balanced"", and that is the perfect way to describe why it succeeds. There is humor, there is action, there is a serious plot (with characters actually dying). It is sophisticated enough for adults, but not so dark that it would scare off children. This really has a very wide appeal.<br/><br/>Fans of the comic book (if any exist) may be disappointed, because the book and the film have almost nothing in common beyond a few character names. Even Baymax has somehow been transformed from a dragon to a cuddly marshmallow. But perhaps the new incarnations are even better than the old ones? Especially considering how few people had ever heard of the comic book versions."
"OlieRendch","8","9","20","5 February 2015"," Pretty fun, not perfect.
","So Big Hero 6 is the first major animated film based on Marvel comics and of course it is Disney too. It's about a boy genius who, with a bunch of friends, attempts to stop a villain whom he blames for a recent tragedy. Now what makes this movie quite unique, I think, is the look; the world building in the film is amazing, it makes you want to visit San Fansokiyo and it really does look like it has blended the two cites really well, so the visuals are stunning. And of course the animation helps and as always Disney animations are really nice to watch.<br/><br/>I also loved seeing the different abilities each character had, all the different inventions and what they could do was really fun to watch and really set up the fact that science is really fun and we should embrace it, which was good; the problem is though I don't think they used their powers enough so they showed them using these abilities but only for a very short amount of time.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, Big Hero 6 was familiar in a lot of aspects but did throw some new elements in there too which kept things balanced between visual references to other films (Baymax' suit is very Iron Man) and downright predictable. In the end I felt the pacing was a bit slow, I kept waiting for the whole thing to really start and get going but, apart from a few really powerful scenes, it always felt as though Disney were holding back for some reason.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, regardless, there were some very funny scenes I laughed at, some twists I was not expecting, I loved the look and design of the characters, Baymax is one of the best robots in cinema and I think everybody wants one, the micro-bots that the villain uses look awesome and even Stan Lee makes an appearance! So as a conclusion, Big Hero 6 is a good superhero movie, just not the best."
"YJLcool","8","10","23","18 November 2014"," One of the best animated films of the year
","This year is filled with so many great animated films...The Lego Movie, How to Train Your Dragon 2, The Boxtrolls, The Book of Life and now, Disney's new superhero animated feature - Big Hero 6. Adapted from the Marvel comics of the same name which is almost unheard of by many people (including myself), Big Hero 6 is a fun, entertaining, heartwarming and emotional film that's comparable to Pixar's superhero film, The Incredibles.<br/><br/>Over the years, superhero films have become more complex and character-driven with thought-provoking, challenging messages to the audience. The same could be said for Big Hero 6 as well. This is a film about the excitement of learning and innovating new things. This is a film that's filled with complex, mature themes such as dealing with grief and loss of loved ones, making the right choices in life by letting go and forgive those who have wronged you.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 is a beautifully made film that's still incredibly charming and fun to watch despite its simple, straightforward and predictable story. The characters, even the awesome high-tech gadgets and suits are very well-designed. Moreover, the world presented in the film (the city of San Fransokyo - combination of San Francisco and Tokyo) is vibrant, colourful and futuristic, which is suitable for the story. Around the halfway mark of the film, we get to see the spectacular aerial view of the city as Hiro and Baymax were flying around to test the newly made armour prepared to fight with the main villain.<br/><br/>The key to a successful animated film has always been creating one or two memorable, lively characters that young audiences could identify with, care about and love. The film succeeds the most by putting its focus on the relationship between Hiro, the lead human character and the hilarious, cute, lovable, cuddly, friendly and adorable inflatable healthcare robot Baymax, the heart of the film. The gentle robot instantly steals the show the moment it appears on screen, providing many joys and laughters that you wish you had him by your side as a personal companion/caregiver. He's clearly meant to be the character that every kid (or the kid inside you, for adults) should love. This film did a remarkable job in balancing action, drama and comedy. There are more enjoyable action scenes to satisfy the kids who loves action and several wonderful, hilarious, moving and emotional scenes of Hiro and Baymax together on screen to satisfy those who yearn for something profound and impactful. There are two particularly emotionally moving and heartfelt scenes that brought me to tears.<br/><br/>However, the film does have its flaws. The four supporting human characters (including the villain) are quite underdeveloped and it feels like we hardly know them much by the end of the film other than they're friends with Hiro and they will always be there for him. However, it's not significant enough to hurt my enjoyment of the film. Overall, Big Hero 6 is the perfect animated film for young nerdy kids and adults alike. It's one of the best animated films of the year.<br/><br/>Rating: 8.5/10<br/><br/>Note: Be sure to stay for the after-credit scene. <br/><br/>http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/11/movie-review-big-hero-6.html"
"rondeatheater","9","12","29","15 November 2014"," Better than Frozen I'll bet.
","I wasn't really excited when Disney purchased Marvel, I mean its like two while different worlds being merged together, but the way things are going, I have no complaints, at least for now. Big hero 6 was pretty awesome for an animation film, it had like almost everything, it makes you laugh, cry, whoop, cringe, and makes you feel for the bad guy and Marvel fans, you're in for a big treat when you sit through the credits, trust me you won't be disappointed. <br/><br/>I mean Frozen was okay but this one doesn't have sappy irritating songs that continuously pop up until the end and the characters were completely lovable, even the fire breathing lizard guy. The story doesn't bore you to the point that you're aware of every passing minute and to be honest, I don't how else you could give a higher praise than that and animation wise it was quite sophisticated though not quite mind blowing, music keeps you entertained and blends in right with the scenes and most importantly it struck the right chord, touching hearts, jerking tears and most importantly makes you smile at the end and even when you're back on your bed, reminiscing back at those memorable scenes that I am quite sure will have a special place in the hearts of many, especially Baymax. The characters don't get the much needed screen development but as far as I can recall, that was the only gripe, the rest was practically flawless, and here I thought Disney died with the likes of Toy Story and Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>If this doesn't at least get nominated for the Oscars, I will build a Baymax of my own to go after the panel of judges, nah just kidding Baymax is not evil, not that I know how to build it anyway. Easily a 9/10 for me."

","Well the villain is the professor at the which was supposedly killed at the beginning but wasn't actually.

Although he actually inadvertently caused the death of the main characters big brother by faking his own death, which never gets resolved. Also the lesson of the movie is if you don't accept a greedy billionaire CEO's offer to acquire your technology due to your professor's insistence on morals and ethics, your professor's actually trying to steal your technology himself and also cause the death of your loved ones, so be a capitalist and take the damn money."
"OllieSuave-007","1","15","39","29 August 2015"," A cliché mess - Disney's worst animated movie thus far!
","As Disney acquired Marvel Comics, I guess they had to make a superhero movie, in this case, a group of computer nerds joining forces with an inflatable robot named Baymax and transforming as a band of high-tech heroes. Together they fight to avenge a friend's death and uncover the truth behind a super-villain who has taken control of a world-changing invention. I know I'm in the minority in this, but in my humble opinion, what resulted is the biggest disappointment I have seen in a Disney animated movie thus far.<br/><br/>The plot is slow and mostly boring, as there is no character development, no suspense and no heart to the movie. There is a lot of cliché sci-fi action and cliché drama - nothing original - and the characters, particularly the superheroes, were stereotypical nerds with overzealous expressions: the comic-book geek Fred, the typical bratty Go-Go, the overly nervous Wasabi, the overly cheerful bookworm Cass and the typical teenage dude-acting Hiro. Their attempt at humor was childish and failed miserably. Only Baymax had any redeeming qualities.<br/><br/>The metal music soundtrack to the movie was atrocious and the script was riddled with plot-holes, for example, how is it that easy and simple for Hiro to make operative superhero suits and machines in only a few minutes? Back at the characters, there were no chemistry between them and no likable traits, as a result, you feel no connection to them - not even in moments when they're supposed to be dramatic and heart-wrenching. And, the whole San Fransokyo atmosphere is just another poor Disney attempt to make the story hip, modern and futuristic. <br/><br/>Overall, it's just one big cliché-riddled movie with typical sci-fi fluff and with no imagination. The worst Disney animated movie I have seen, so far, and it boggles my mind it won best animated film at the 2015 Oscars.<br/><br/>Grade F"

","Big Hero 6 is another symbol of Disney making a comeback after a 10 year period back in the early and mid 2000s of sub-par and average films(with a few exceptions). Like the previous films, this captures the heart that Disney has back in the days of the Reinassance and returns with it in a new generation of kids and a welcome home party for us who grew up with the Reinassance. While the film has a major problem and couple of minor ones, this ones retains the charm. Heck it's better than Tangled and Wreck-it-Ralph, but equal to Frozen in every way(which isn't a disappointment,overrated, or a bad movie at all as a fact). <br/><br/>Now the problems, just to get them out of the way, that prevent this movie from being better than Tangled and Wreck-it-Ralph by a long shot and not being better than Frozen at all are like I said a major one and a couple of them. The story while very well written, is predictable and ruins the surprise factor that Wreck-it-Ralph and Frozen had with there well written stories. Another problem is that while Hiro and Baymax are amazing characters, the rest of the cast are underdeveloped compared to to other films in the line- up. At least they are still enjoyable to watch. <br/><br/>This movie well worth your time to see in theaters both 2d or 3d depending on what you prefer and it's worth a Blu-Ray purchase when it comes out as well. Great story, great characters, and amazing animation. Also stay after the credits cause after all it is a Marvel movie as well. Score: 8.5/10"

","I've debated this rating for a week.<br/><br/>The reader may find it trivial, but the temptation to give it 9 stars is strong.<br/><br/>As great as Big Hero 6 is, it's not as good as Frozen, Brave or Wreck-It- Ralph.<br/><br/>This is a subjective distinction, however. It's a top-notch animated flick.<br/><br/>The animated short preceding, Feast, is a heartwarming delight.<br/><br/>Which is particularly suited to the full-length BH6, this year's best animated feature. Unless this reviewer's unaware of another cartoon slated for release, here's the final list.<br/><br/>Top Five Animated Films of 2014 1. Big Hero 6 2. The Book of Life 3. Mr. Peabody & Sherman 4. The Lego Movie 5. How to Train Your Dragon 2<br/><br/>I attended the movie with three friends, all in our mid-twenties. Three males and one female; illustrating thorough enjoyment across the board.<br/><br/>Leading to the conclusion that everyone will enjoy Disney's latest.<br/><br/>Plus, the group's in agreement on seeing it in 3D; it only adds to the experience.<br/><br/>The story encompasses a number of elements from science fiction, and tackles the three major themes. Every cinematic trope resonates with classic films.<br/><br/>Theme 1) Robotics<br/><br/>There weren't any cyborgs, but everything else is heavily scrutinized. Nanobots, artificial intelligence, computerized medical systems, digitized armor, rocket propulsion, etc.<br/><br/>Baymax is a cuddly Terminator, an anthropomorphic medical bed from Elysium.<br/><br/>Theme 2) Space Travel<br/><br/>There's no alien life or venturing free of the Earth's atmosphere (so specifically no outer space travel) or even time manipulation. But interdimensional exploration and wormholes are utilized.<br/><br/>You folks have heard of Interstellar, right? How about Event Horizon, in which a man-made portal between dimensions is constructed?<br/><br/>Anybody remember the in-between realm of Pacific Rim?<br/><br/>Theme 3) Superhumanity<br/><br/>Don't expect any mutation or the development of superhuman abilities, but a completely grounded story of superheroes.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 derives its greatest strength by constructing a superhero universe, bound by the dictates of humanity's current understanding of reality.<br/><br/>There are no aliens, because we have yet to prove their existence. There are no superpowers, because no evidence suggests humans have a biological capability for their development.<br/><br/>One scene pays homage to The Hulk and the protagonist's name, Hiro, seems like a tip-of-the-cap to the TV series Heroes.<br/><br/>In honor of cinematic themes in 2014, the film even features a time-lapse of Hiro innovating in a manner akin to Tony Stark. A digitally animated time-lapse is thought-provoking, at the very least.<br/><br/>People use the word 'Disnified' as if it's a bad thing. The connotation is that something has been purified of all negative emotion, thereby creating an unrealistic product.<br/><br/>The irony in this is laughable.<br/><br/>Disney constructs a highly educated story while exemplifying a preference towards optimism.<br/><br/>Which equates to one of two criticisms.<br/><br/>The action is a little light.<br/><br/>The budget for this movie is $165M, so I was hoping for more elaborate fight sequences.<br/><br/>A final criticism is odd.<br/><br/>In my review of last year's Frozen, I mention the helpfulness of a non- specific trailer.<br/><br/>The teaser featured dialogue-less frozen pond antics between Olaf (the snowman) and a moose (who never shows up in the actual movie). Therefore the viewer learns nothing specific regarding plot details.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6's trailer spoils several beats and somehow I failed to avoid another important detail in the first sentence of somebody's review.<br/><br/>Therefore, let's chalk up the slightly underwhelmed feeling to the unripe ideas.<br/><br/>After all, the humor is solid and consistent. The characters are likable and original.<br/><br/>Especially T.J. Miller as Fred, the comic book enthusiast.<br/><br/>Unlike all characters from other superhero team-ups, Fred embraces their engagement with the lifestyle choice. Therefore, he's a satirical narrator who highlights all of the important moments during Big Hero 6's origin story.<br/><br/>It's impossible to dislike Aunt Cass, voiced by Maya Rudolph.<br/><br/>A sequel is sure to follow. Personally I can't wait for Big Hero 7, or better yet, Small Villain 5.<br/><br/>Imagine that. A supervillain team-up prequel might be the best way to go.<br/><br/>Although I wouldn't mind the introduction of a 'Green Ranger' trope. Wink.<br/><br/>Overall, Big Hero 6 is really great.<br/><br/>It distills the complexities of helping a loved one after a tragic loss. It takes a grounded look at the far future, and illustrates the true potential for superheroism.<br/><br/>Expect minor weeping, especially if you're a softy like me.<br/><br/>Stick around for a number of intriguing bits during the rolling credits. Comic fans, particularly, don't miss the stinger that follows.<br/><br/>Once again, thanks to Disney, I can add a pleasant memory to the list."
"KnightsofNi11","7","11","27","13 November 2014"," Baymax will be your new favorite thing this year
","2014 continues Disney's animation streak with the Marvel comic adaptation Big Hero 6. Big Hero 6, set in the fictional metropolis of San Fransokyo, tells the story of Hiro Hamada, a prepubescent robotics inventor who teams up with a group of college grads who are blurring the line between science and magic to fight crime in their beautiful bustling city as the superhero team Big Hero 6. Hiro and his hipster friends comprise 5 of the 6 members of Big Hero 6, with the 6th member being one of the most lovable robots to grace the screen in years; Baymax. Baymax is a big plushy healthcare robot whose adorable naivety and soft squeaky appearance will make kids fall completely in love, and they'll be raving about him until their parents buy them that $80 Baymax action figure. Well played, Disney. <br/><br/>By no means is Big Hero 6 just a well marketed cash grab that will lead to countless toys, video games, and probably even TV shows. Yes, it most certainly is that because Disney has a job to do, but Big Hero 6 is first and foremost an exciting CGI adventure that never lets up on the action, the humor, or the spectacle, and even carries enough emotional weight to well up a tear or two. Just like its robot protagonist, this movie is just plain lovable. It's enjoyable from start to finish in almost every aspect. <br/><br/>The CGI is nothing short of astounding, as is to be expected from Disney. The design in everything from the art, architecture, and especially characters is fantastic. The city of San Fransokyo is one of the more beautiful cities ever rendered, but the beauty of the scenery doesn't even stop there as our characters visit mysterious islands and mile high worlds of air balloons, all providing unique and constantly changing visuals. The technical work of Big Hero 6 deserves an indefinite amount of credit for the world pulled off here. <br/><br/>And if you're not falling in love with the scenery you're hopefully falling in love with the characters instead. Each unique character comes with their own wildly entertaining personality fueled by a cast of fantastic voice actors including Ryan Potter, Damon Wayans Jr., Genesis Rodriguez, and Silicon Valley's always hysterical T.J. Miller. 30 Rock's Scott Adsit, with the help of some voice modulation, provides the voice of Baymax, whose voice has just enough robotic charm to be one of the most believable and adorable AI's in years. <br/><br/>My only issue with Big Hero 6 comes in its writing mainly, and in part from its story line. There were a number of times where I was reminded that I was watching a kids movie when characters would do things like reiterate points from before, just to make sure the audience hadn't forgotten. There were moments when things were over explained and over emphasized so that everyone was able to keep up. The fact that this is a kid's movie makes these little screenplay transparencies slightly more forgivable, but they still irk me. The story holds strong for the majority of the film, but the third act introduces some elements that seem to come out of nowhere and could have used more setup to allow them to carry more weight, All in all it works though, and the film ends on a great big happy note that sets the stage for endless franchise milking. <br/><br/>Big Hero 6 is worth the watch, no matter what issues it has. It is a solid 102 minutes of fun that will astound you visually, make you laugh genuinely, and might even draw up some tears at the beautifully sentimental moments between Hiro and Baymax. Disney continues to strike gold at their animation department, and I have a pretty damn good feeling this isn't the last we'll see of Baymax and the rest of the Big Hero 6 team."
"shawneofthedead","8","11","27","13 November 2014"," A smart, refreshing take on the superhero film with a heart as big as its breakout robotic star.
","In the ten years since Pixar gave us The Incredibles, what is arguably still the best superhero movie ever made, Disney acquired Marvel - a canny business decision which gave the animation studio access to a host of other superheroes and villains. Of the entire pantheon of Marvel characters, then, why did Disney choose the deeply obscure Big Hero 6 for its first animated adaptation? Precisely because of its obscurity, as it turns out. As Marvel itself proved with the astounding box-office success of Guardians Of The Galaxy this summer, there's just as much - if not more - potential to breathe new, refreshing life into relatively unknown characters. Disney's version of Big Hero 6 may barely resemble its grimmer comic-book counterpart, but is smart, sweet and thoroughly inventive on its own considerable merits.<br/><br/>Budding robotics prodigy Hiro Hamada (voiced by Ryan Potter) spends most of his free time inventing unbeatable bots to make a quick buck in the underground fights that take place all over San Fransokyo. He finally settles down to invent something groundbreaking when his brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) gives him a sneak peek into the Institute of Technology's renowned robotics programme run by Dr. Robert Callaghan (James Cromwell). But, just as it seems that Hiro's bright future is set, disaster strikes and he is left with only Baymax (Scott Adsit), a huge, amiable marshmallow puff of a robot dedicated to providing the very best health care, to remind him of his brother.<br/><br/>For better or worse, the film chooses to focus firmly on Hiro and the unlikely best friend he finds in a robot with two dots and a line for a face. In most of the ways that count, it's a smart move: it ensures that the larger-than-life action and off-kilter humour of Big Hero 6 is grounded by plenty of very real emotion and heartache. Hiro's loss is acute and deeply-felt, and it's drawn with such sensitivity that it will resonate with anyone who's lost someone near and dear.<br/><br/>The relationship between boy and cuddly giant robot is also delightfully drawn. It's both charming and bittersweet to watch as Baymax tries to heal Hiro's grief, a wound that won't respond to the medication or antibiotics in his first-aid kit. To do so, the robot with a mochi for a head walks through traffic, wraps himself around the boy to break a spectacular fall to the ground, and basically deigns to become Disney's version of Iron Man. In the process, Baymax becomes the breakout star of the year - a blank-faced, seemingly expressionless droid who will have you laughing, weeping and rushing out to buy toy versions of him to be placed under the Christmas tree.<br/><br/>If anyone gets short shrift, it's the rest of the people who make up the superhero team of the film's title. The remaining four members of the team, all friends and colleagues of Tadashi - quirky chemistry whiz Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodríguez), tough-as-nails adrenaline junkie GoGo Tamago (Jamie Chung), neurotic laser-expert Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.) and laidback rich boy Fred (T.J. Miller) - are sketched out well enough that they can provide a few punchlines and witty one-liners. But they're only barely involved in the emotional arc of the story.<br/><br/>At least it's an understandable oversight - Big Hero 6 is packed with so much detail and depth that it's no wonder someone had to take a backseat. The film not only finds a surprising twist in the story of its antagonist, money-grubbing tech entrepreneur Alistair Krei (Alan Tudyk), it also creates a buzzing, busy world quite unlike anything that's been put on screen before. Hiro's world of San Fransokyo is a happy whirlwind of cultures - Japanese lanterns adorn the cable cars that trundle through the streets, and fortune cats beckon from the awnings of the café belonging to Hiro's Aunt Cass (Maya Rudolph). There's even an Easter egg or two tucked into the film - particularly in a hilarious closing-credits sequence that cheekily tips its hat to the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>Fans of Marvel's many comic-book properties were no doubt worried when Disney acquired the studio in 2009. Would Marvel's grittiest superheroes and villains be given Disney's trademark cute-ifying treatment? Would their dark, bitter backstories be lost in the translation to the silver screen? At first glance, Big Hero 6 seems to confirm their worst fears. But, even if it bears scant resemblance to the comic book from which it originated, there's still plenty to enjoy in this punchy, endearing take on the superhero film. In its own way, it doesn't shy away from difficult topics like death, grief and the extent one can and should go to seek revenge. That it does so while led by one of the most adorable robots ever brought to animated life is icing on the cake."
"Semisonic","3","28","83","18 April 2015"," An Oscar-winning boy's wet dream
","I guess there should be a rule that forbids people to review movies out of personal spite and rage. But, luckily for me, there's no such rule, and nothing will stop me from saying everything that i think 'Big Hero 6' deserves, just like nothing stopped it from brain-raping me earlier.<br/><br/>Where to begin... Honestly, i wanted to enjoy this film. I had almost no idea what it was about, so i thought that maybe there was a reason why it got that Oscar and my beloved 'Lego Movie', ""the shallow self-endorsing postmodernist junk"" as they called it, wasn't even nominated. I held no personal grudge, even though i read those interviews with the Academy people who vote for the best animation, in which they admit that they select the picture based on what their kids liked the most. I threw it all aside, wanting and expecting to receive something fresh, something that would really stand out and prove that it deserves all that praise it received.<br/><br/>Well, i guess the year 2014 simply wasn't destined to make my animation-related dreams come true. First they botched the 'How to Train Your Dragon' franchise, and now this...<br/><br/>You know, my girlfriend has a nephew, a 10 year old kid. This little fellow simply adores the comic book movies. First his favorite hero was Spider-man. He had a Spider-man costume, all the possible Spider-man toys, even a Spider-man shampoo. Then at some point he kinda switched to Iron Man, and now that dude seems to be his favorite. Well, don't know who he switches to next, but what i do know is that he could've easily written this movie's script by simply writing down any of his dreams.<br/><br/>Seriously, everything in 'Big Hero 6' is secondary, as if all the most popular animation and comic book movies blended together in one glossy banging mess. An awkward harmless robot with a bit of a WALL-E in it (the best part), who later becomes a puffy martial artist like Kung-Fu Panda, then gets seriously upgraded like Iron Man, while our main character, with only his aunt to look after him, kinda like in Spider-man, keeps inventing stuff like that dude from Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, learns to fly the robot like that dude from How To Train Your Dragon, while his posse gets all powered up like Fantastic 4, and all this to oppose the evil masked guy who mentally controls matter like ""that dude"" from X-Men. And did i mention that one of the posse members has those plasma blades like the Protoss infantry units from Starcraft?.. Ugh, i wanna vomit already, can anyone give me a plastic bag? Preferably 100% recycled, to perfectly match this movie.<br/><br/>In Russian, when we wanna say that someone's joke is old, we call it ""beardy"". Beardy is how one could call this movie's attempt to make passing gases look funny. But when the gas passing moments are the only jokes you have to offer, it's even worse. In such cases we could say ""if you shaved your joke, you could slide it under the door"". You know what i mean.<br/><br/>So, if we shave all the action boom-boom stuff from 'Big Hero 6', it falls (un)surprisingly flat. The main character, Hiro, living in some weird fusion of two coolest cities of US and Japan, is a troublesome little prodigy who's so brilliant that he creates a groundbreaking piece of technology in his garage as if it was some school science fair project, yet he fails to see the most obvious logical connections between the events that happen afterwards. His posse, a group of so called geniuses, who are in fact just zero-dimensional muppets with only a single trait of character and who never go beyond that prescribed agenda. The villain, the biggest collection of clichés one could come up with, almost forcedly placed in the right place and at the right time to create something remotely resembling a conflict. And all this - to deliver what message exactly? That friends = good, killing people = bad, even when people = bad too? Give me a break!<br/><br/>Some say that all this stuff is forgivable because 'Big Hero 6' is a kid's movie. Well, kids can love it all they want, i don't care. Because kids also like ripping wings off flies and burning ants with a magnifying glass, and it doesn't make those activities any cooler. So i really hope that at some point in the future (hopefully sooner than later, but i'm not too optimistic about it) the animation business bosses wake up and realize how full of sh!t they have become making all that cheap generic stuff nobody will care about once it stops moving and screaming. And if that really happens - i only wish they feel shame, for putting monetary gain over the artistic value, bangs over substance and for diminishing animation to its technical core - just a sequence of moving frames. Because that's what 'Big Hero 6' really is. Just a mindless, senseless, soulless sequence of frames."
"sildarmillion","8","9","21","19 November 2014"," Disneytacular!
","It's Disney, of course I enjoyed it. Big Hero 6 has the same type of feel recent Disney movies have had starting from Tangled, to Wreck- it-Ralph to Frozen (and you might have noticed that those 3 movies were highlighted in the Big Hero 6 trailers – ""from the creators of ""). I can't put my finger on exactly what these films have in common that earlier films didn't, but clearly they make up a new ""era"" of Disney movies. I wonder what it will come to be called.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 had great characters. Hiro and Tadashi were great, and I think it was a big deal that they were mixed race, and that their lives incorporated aspects of both Eastern and Western culture. Although that was also partly due to the portrayal of San Fransokyo. I've never been to Tokyo, but I've been to SF enough times to recognize the structures and it was fun to see it get a Japanese architectural twist. The concept of this mash-up city is kinda weird because it raises all sorts of questions about geography and the politics of their world, but the movie makes it not matter. The point wasn't a sound world-building with logical explanations. It was to create a great sense of East meets West. I would've loved to see more East, but hey, it's a start!<br/><br/>I loved the message of pushing the limits of what you can achieve with science. Hiro is a child prodigy who graduated high school at 13 and now is bored with life and doesn't want to go to college for more of the same. But then his brother takes him to his (Tadashi's) lab, and Hiro is amazed by the cutting edge technology that he sees there. It really speaks to him and he is really inspired to contribute to robotics.<br/><br/>You may have seen from the trailers that Hiro designs the super- suits (because this is after all a superhero movie) for the other members of the team, but what was awesome about the group is that Hiro isn't really the only brains of the team. Each of the super- suits actually incorporates tech that the respective member developed, except Fred, I suppose. But Fred is hilarious, from his slacker appearance, science enthusiasm to his family history. Gogo is funny because of her deadpan attitude and she reminds me a bit of Melinda May from Agents of SHIELD. Wasabi is fun and reminded me a little bit of Cyborg from Teen Titans. Honey Lemon was a pretty great character because she was smart and geeky and girly all at the same time. They have varied personalities, none of them stereotypes, and most importantly they each care about their tech deeply and love to expand the possibility of the uses.<br/><br/>And then there's Baymax. Easily the best thing about the movie. Baymax never ventures into the WALL-E territory of a robot having emotions. Baymax operates within the bounds of his programmed logic. We might think he gets excited when he is flying with Hiro, but he really is only reacting to Hiro's emotions. Yet, he is so absolutely lovable, and so funny in how he takes everything so literally, and can deliver emotional scenes without ever having ""free-will"". I also loved that the flying sequences reminded me so much of How to Train Your Dragon.<br/><br/>All that said though, the movie does fall a tiny bit short of packing the emotional punch we got from Wreck-it-Ralph, or the great sense of superhero team we got from the Incredibles. But it opens up exciting doors, and all MARVEL fans out there can also carry on the tradition of trying to spot the Stan Lee cameo and waiting for the after-credit treat at the end."
"emmueller95","9","9","21","17 November 2014"," Big Hero 6 is a great film for all ages
","Do you want to see a great film for the whole family? Then Big Hero 6 is the film for you. Big Hero 6 is an animated movie from Disney which is an adaptation of a Marvel comic series. The voice cast includes, Ryan Potter, Scott Adsit, Daniel Henney, among others. Big Hero 6 follows Hiro Hamada (Potter) who is a 14-year-old prodigy living in the futuristic city of San Fransokyo. Hiro, who is graduated from high school, spends his time at underground robot battles. Much to his initial dismay, Hiro's older brother Tadashi (Henney) takes Hiro to his college, San Fransokyo Institute of Technology, in hopes that Hiro will start to use his brain for better usage. After Tadashi shows Hiro the school, including his own invention, a large, white medical robot named Baymax (Adsit), Hiro likes what he sees and decides to apply. After gaining admission, tragedy strikes and Hiro enters a depression. But after finding out that one of his inventions, which he though burned in a fire, is still out there, he sets out to find out what's going on. With the help of Baymax and friends from San Fransokyo Institue of Technology, the group turns themselves into a group of super heroes, with the help of their projects from college. Big Hero 6 I feel would fall under the genre of science fiction. The use of technology and science to aid in their fight along with the constant use of science terms and the fact that they are robotic students helps define this. I feel as though the film is a mix between hard and soft sci-fi. It is hard in the sense that many of the science items they mention are actual things (such as electromagnets). I feel it is soft though, in the fact that the way they use a lot of the science is in very fantastical ways. Even though it is an animated movie, I feel as though it fits more into the realm of hard sci-fi. Because, they don't have super powers, but all their suits are based off of science. Big Hero 6 has a good subtext too. The film is not merely just a super hero origin story and fighting the villain. The film shows that even in rough times, your friends and family are there for you. To sum it up, Big Hero 6 is a great film for all ages and helps with the continuation of dominant animation films which have started to get better and better."

Great movie for merchandising and franchising purposes, it's got some laughs and the kids will love it. The shame of it is as you're watching, the laughs and cuteness fade quickly and you realize it's just a jigsaw puzzle of ideas, blatantly pilfered from other, better movies. Not to say that hasn't been done before, of course it has and I have seen my fair share of those 'B' movies, except usually they have the name 'Alan Smithee' attached to them and seldom do they get the kind of advertising Big Hero 6 has gotten. Regardless, take the kids to see it, they really will love it but don't be surprised, once things get rolling along, that your jaded adult mind hearkens back, fondly, to those other, better movies, as scene after reminiscent scene unfolds before you."

","Let's get one thing straight: this movie is not deserving of 1's and 2's. It's not a bad movie. People who would give this thing a 1 out of 10 should in no way be taken seriously. The best way I can describe this movie is it's very...okay. Nothing terrible, but nothing especially good.<br/><br/>First, the positives: the animation is great seeing as it's Disney. The relationship between the main character, Hiro, and the robot, Baymax, is enjoyable and engaging.<br/><br/>Now, the negatives: I found the movie incredibly predictable. They try to pull a bunch of twists and turns, but they end up dead on arrival. I knew who the villain was, I knew which characters (SPOILER), we've seen this all before. This movie just isn't very original. There were a lot of pointless subplots that only served to dig the writers out of their own hole.<br/><br/>The rest, I can't call positives or negatives because they're all just...okay. The characters are...okay. The action is...okay. The plot is...okay. This movie is just so......OKAY. It's a D+ movie. Average. 65%.<br/><br/>All in all, it's not a bad movie. Nobody has the right to give less than a 4 out of 10—trust me. This is a kid's movie, though, so if you have a kid younger than, say, 14, they'll enjoy it. It's harmless.

","Yes, we have yet another strong entry into the animated film category by Disney. It seems whatever they touch these days turns to gold...<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this story and the film. It was familiar but just different enough to make it interesting and fun to watch. It's actually a superhero movie but you'll have to watch to find out why. This was part of the fun and what I thought kept the story interesting.<br/><br/>The characters were interesting and fun (especially Baymax). I think Disney may have another popular character on their hands with Baymax. Children in the theatre loved him every time he came on screen and he was an interesting take on a robot. I also enjoyed how his mannerisms and programming were explained in detail which helped very much with the story and keeping things in perspective.<br/><br/>As is the norm for Disney, the effects and animation were top notch. That said, I saw the movie in 3D and I can honestly say I don't feel it added much. You could watch this in 2D and be just as impressed.<br/><br/>The the only problem I found with the movie was the villain. The whole scenario was fairly predictable. They played it a little too safe with this section of the story and it would have been more fun to have it be as fresh and original as the rest of the film."

"saint_orton","7","20","58","26 October 2014"," It's an above average animated film, and will be a lot of fun for anyone who is willing to overlook its flaws.
","Judging animated films is significantly more difficult for me than other films because there is this inherent sense that animated films are made for children, as opposed to for adults. And that in reviewing animated films, standards should be different. Now while I do think that it does make sense for animated films to follow different criteria, I also think that at its core all films should have the same standards for quality based on some fundamental aspects of storytelling.<br/><br/>My problem with Big Hero 6 is that it does not push the genre in any new or novel direction, unless you count giving your characters Japanese names a step towards globalization. Which on a side note, is probably the only thing Japanese about them. Now this might seem a little unfair, but this revolutionizing quality does consistently happen even in the field of animation. For example, Japanese animation greats such as Hayao Miyazaki or Satoshi Kon have been able to imbue their films with wondrous worlds and impeccably novel plots. We also see this in American animation such as in the films of Pixar, like Wall-E or Up or the Toy story series, in that they create fascinating narratives and fill them with insanely memorable characters. Even within Disney's own canon, they've been able to make some pretty good animated films. I wasn't a big fan of Frozen, but it did side step the trope of the princess needing a happy ever after with a man, so that was something. And even without all the novel plots and characterization, some films work so well just on their simplicity, like the French animated film from 2012, Ernest et Celestine.<br/><br/>Instead, Big Hero 6 decides to be a cliché-filled franchise-potential-heavy superhero movie. Think: animated avengers but with teenagers and gadgets. Take the best and worst things about Disney and Marvel, and cram them into one movie, and that's Big Hero 6. While that does sound pretty cool when I say it like that, the plot does get exceedingly predictable and stale. To be fair though, Big Hero 6 does also do some things pretty well . The alternate world of San Fransokyo that the animators create in the film is really gorgeously animated, and so are all the other environments that Hiro and his gang explore throughout the film. Even the technology in the film, in Japanese fashion, is very meticulously designed and fun to see. And in terms of memorable characters, Hiro Hamada is a pretty distinct protagonist, in that he isn't like the normal passive character trope that is so common in animated films. I'm not that familiar with the original Big Hero 6 comic that this film was based on, so I'm not sure how much of Hiro's character was directly pulled from the comics, and how much was new for the film. The problem though is in the supporting cast, with every other character, especially the ones in Hiro's group, devoid of any characterization at all, apart from some silly nicknames.<br/><br/>But what truly elevates this movie from being just a decent one is the character of Baymax. And he really is one hell of a character. If you guys have seen the trailers, Baymax is the name of the fat white marshmallow like blob machine thing that acts as Hiro's main companion throughout the film. I don't want to spoil anything, but Baymax steals every single scene that he is in, and there are a lot of funny gags and sweet moments that center around his character, in a sort of similar way that Groot did in this year's Guardians of the Galaxy. Baymax has a couple of similarities to Groot, not only in his function in the film as a show-stopping side gag, but partly also in his role in the plot in the second half of the film. <br/><br/>So earlier, I said that I'm reviewing this movie in context of film in general. And in that sense, I do think there's a lot of wasted potential here. However, sometimes films work in ways that are independent of supposed objective criticism. Most of the time, we just watch movies to have fun, despite whatever overused clichés and predictable plots they may have. Sometimes those ARE the reasons we watch movies, because of that safe reassuring feeling that no matter what trouble may occur, everything's going to be fine. And sometimes that's enough in a movie.<br/><br/>So when you walk into Big Hero 6, know that it's not trying to revolutionize the field of animation, know of its flaws and redundancies and clichés, and then let go of it all. And just have fun with the movie. Sometimes it's when we stop being overly critical, that we are able to enjoy what's right in front of us. Just like kids do."
"tijmenwartenberg","7","7","16","10 January 2015"," Action-packed and visually impressive
","I thought that this was a good movie with cool characters, lots of action, and a few nice emotional moments.<br/><br/>The bond between main character Hiro and the likable Baymax was well-played out by the creators of this movie. The other characters - who functioned as assisting superheroes - expanded the action in the fights with the masked super villain. Near the end of the movie, it is explained that the main villain's motives are based on a personal tragedy and that gave the movie a nice touch. The visuals of the movie are stunning due to lots of details and expressive coloring. I think that the movie looks even better than Frozen for example. The setting of the movie is an interesting mix between Tokio and San Fransico. My biggest complaint with the story was that the ending scene seemed rushed and couldtherefore be a bit confusing for some viewers. The story was also a bit predictable as is often the case with movies that target children. Other than that, Big Hero 6 is a good movie that would appeal to most children below 12 (especcially boys)."

","Reading some reviews of this movie I noticed that some of them went into tens of paragraphs and some reviewers stood on a soapbox spewing bile and insult over the movie itself and Disney. I think all the reviewers were probably adults. If you ask ANY child 12 or under to review this movie all of them would say how marvellous it is. Children take this sort of thing at face value,and take away the politics and personal gripe out of it. This is a gem of a movie if taken in context.Some people even took time to spot all the goofs and one even went into mathematical equation to prove a cgi character could not possibly pick up a large box. Incredible to think the lengths people will go to to vent their inner anger. Watched this with my 12 yr old daughter in 3D and we both enjoyed it tremendously.Just bought it on 3D Blu Ray and will enjoy it many times again.Fantastic entertainment.( It's only a movie grown-ups!)"

","Into Disney animation. A wonderful story of growing up and learning some things about adolescence. Is it enough fun enough for kids? The 4-10 year olds in the theater that I saw it sure thought so. Irritated me to no end, but I consider that a mark of fine storytelling. Does it have enough sentiment for adults. It sure does. It follows the typical Disney story outline. Which if you don't know, I don't want to mention it here. But you'll see everything there. It's not a bad model, it's a fun one. A nice distraction to a more sullen movie release times.<br/><br/>I dig the joy this movie has.

"BrentHankins","8","12","33","7 November 2014"," An exciting, refreshingly fun approach to the superhero origin story.
","Ever since the Disney acquisition of Marvel in 2009, fans of both entities have been awaiting the first true collaborative effort between the companies, and that effort finally arrives in the form of Big Hero 6. Loosely based on a limited series of Marvel comic books, the film is the story of 14-year-old genius Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter), whose considerable intellect is mostly being used to fleece other inventors in an underground robot fighting ring. This is a point of frustration for older brother Tadashi, whose own gifted mind is laser-focused on helping others thanks to his latest invention, a ""personal healthcare companion"" robot named Baymax (Scott Adsit).<br/><br/>After accompanying his brother on a college visit, Hiro is blown away by the talent and resources available at San Fransokyo Tech, and hurls himself into a new project that he hopes will gain him admission into the school's prestigious robotics program. His demonstration is a hit, garnering him attention from a sleazy corporate businessman and praise from the legendary Professor Callaghan (James Cromwell), but the celebration is cut short when a catastrophe leads to the destruction of Hiro's work and the loss of Tadashi, who perishes while trying to rescue others.<br/><br/>Months pass, and the disconsolate Hiro spends his days alone in his bedroom, until he stumbles upon Baymax, the gentle, inflatable robot that Tadashi hoped would change the world. Programmed to provide care, Baymax senses the boy's trouble and makes it his personal mission to assist Hiro in moving past the tragedy - but that assistance also involves helping Hiro investigate the sudden re- emergence of the tech he invented, which should have been destroyed in the accident but is now being used by a mysterious masked criminal to wreak havoc and destruction on the city.<br/><br/>Co-directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams, Disney's Big Hero 6 is a refreshingly fun approach to the superhero origin story. There are no radioactive spiders or genetic mutations here - the ""superpowers"" wielded by each of the wildly diverse characters are derived solely from technology. The film is stuffed full of original and innovative action sequences, and the thrilling climax is an amazing display of colors, smoke, explosions and special effects that make up some of the most striking on screen visuals of the year.<br/><br/>But at its heart, beneath the excitement and the humor, Big Hero 6 is the story of a boy and his best friend, and the relationship that develops between Hiro and Baymax is genuine and heartfelt. Disney fans should be accustomed to having their heartstrings tugged on, and Big Hero 6 continues the tradition of weaving an emotionally affecting tale inside a bright, colorful adventure. It's another feather in the cap for the animation studio, and hopefully the beginning of a long and fruitful partnership as they continue to work alongside Marvel."

"rgkarim","9","14","41","9 November 2014"," Big Hero Sick!!!!! Great Action, Emotion and Comedy for all
","The beginning of November usually means a few things, the beginning of Christmas season, lots of food, and of course at least one kids animated movie. This weekend opens up the season with another work by Disney Animation Studios, or Pixar's rival to some. With the gold mine that was their last movie, Frozen, the cavalcade of animators have once again churned out another animated feature that looks to be fun. Yet can it match the success of their last film? As always read on. <br/><br/>The tale of Big Hero 6 is about a boy named Hiro (Ryan Potter), a kid with a knack for robotics. Through the encouragement of his brother, Hiro is inspired to pursue higher education of robotic design and change the modern world. Unfortunately, an accident though, turns Hiro's world upside down, with only memories and his brother's creation Bay Max (Scott Adsit) to help him carry on. However, a new threat surrounding one of Hiro's projects rises from the shadows, and only the dynamic duo can uncover the secrets at hand. <br/><br/>So what did I think of the film? I'll start by saying this reviewer loved the film more than Frozen. Yes I know I'm probably shouting blasphemy, but let me explain why. It starts with the story. Big Hero 6 has many of the familiar elements that we love in a Disney film. Hiro's story starts out exciting from the get go, throwing pizazz and excitement into the mix early to grab your attention. But it doesn't stop there, as this story, like any good story, changes up things when you start getting comfortable. Audiences will get to see Hiro's world change as one event happens that completely changes the dynamic of the movie, yet keeps things grounded. Mystery, drama, character development, and more are all built into this tale, intricately weaved to help bring the characters to life without going into too much detail. You might be saying Frozen had that too? Yes, but what's different between these two movies is that Frozen built it's story around a soundtrack and sped through some valuable qualities. Big Hero 6 doesn't do this, and focuses more on the story, with the soundtrack supporting the film during its montage moments. What I liked even more is that Big Hero 6 had a great character development as well, which remained throughout the whole movie and wasn't lost. <br/><br/>Let's get off the plot though and talk about some other things this movie has to offer. For one thing the film has plenty of excitement. Hiro and the gang get into some thrilling situations that are packed with high adrenaline. Car chases, fights against technological baddies, and infiltration into quarantined zones are just some examples of what you get to see. Now just because there is action doesn't mean you get ninja warriors beheading their foes, or guns lighting up the city. No, Big Hero 6 has more family friendly action that has some impressive moves that will thrill all ages. What's even better is the creativity in their technology, cleverly designed to integrate science, fun, and technology into one package. Kids will get a little education, albeit a little stretched,, in science that shows how cool physics and chemistry can be. Geeks like me will appreciate each characters design, and the masses will appreciate the animation this movie has to offer. I just wished these scenes were longer and had a little more diversity to them instead of the repetitive moves. <br/><br/>However, the big thing kids will remember is the comedy of the movie. Big Hero 6 is full of moments that the younger audience members and I found hysterical. Juvenile actions like letting out air, klutzy stumbles into buildings, and well timed screams had me laughing. Of course being Disney, you can expect some clever dialogue and a few antics that will surely be repeated a thousand times by the population. In particular the fist bump joke and low battery comedy were my favorites, the latter being a cute way to integrate some adult drunk humor into the mix with some good voice work to boot. Yes some of the jokes are repetitive and simplistic, but the timing and delivery are well enough that it makes up for the limitations. To tell you the truth, it's actually the voice work that really makes most of the humor and emotions come to life in this movie. <br/><br/>Okay let's wrap this up. Big Hero 6 was a great adventure that is entertaining for all ages. The story is balanced, with an ever-changing story, emotional character development, and action to keep things exciting for you. Yes it lacks the original songs that Frozen did, but the story and creativity in this film more than make up for the lack of top of the chart tunes. Is it worth a trip to the theater? You better believe it as this movie has all the bells and whistles for the silver screen, and has a story to support it as well. So if you are looking for a movie that all can enjoy, get on down and catch this treasure before it leaves. <br/><br/>My scores are: <br/><br/>Animation/Action/Comedy: 9-9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0"

"abiartist","5","9","24","17 May 2015"," Really Really Wanted to Enjoy
","So I really really wanted to like this movie, I've heard good things from a lot of my friends and I'd seen absolutely adorable gifsets of Baymax on tumblr. But, when I got half way through I could not enjoy it any longer. <br/><br/>The beginning was absolutely fantastic (besides, you know, Tadashi's death, and a few unrealistic things) I was basically just exclaiming about how amazingly cute Baymax was and everything was amazing. But then everything started to get more and more cliché and just felt sort of lazy. Like when the bad guy was chasing them, and after their car went underwater he just disappeared???? WHY? You didn't honestly think they were dead did you? You're Tadashi's professor, you must have seen Baymax with them and you know, since you are his professor, you should AT LEAST know what Baymax does.<br/><br/>(On a side note Fall Out Boy song? One of the best parts, honestly)<br/><br/>And then when Hiro, Baymax and the rest of his crew (I don't know what to call them) are at the lab place(?) and Hiro picks up the professor's mask, WHY DON'T YOU PUT IT ON YOUR FACE SO YOU CAN CONTROL YOU OWN INVENTION???? DID THAT NOT CROSS YOU MIND, FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GENIUS? Then when Hiro told Baymax to kill the professor and every single one of his friends didn't agree with him???? LET. HIM. DIE. He deserves it. I don't care what his ""motive"" was, he was the one who let Tadashi die and did. not. even. show. remorse. You can't just let some people live in this world just because they can go to jail. Do you not think that he's probably just going to escape (oh, wow, sequel idea)?<br/><br/>Later, when the whole team is trapped by the microbots, (which, btw if he's controlling them with his mind how is it possible that he can have them all be moving in about 50 million different directions, give or take a few) and Hiro tells them to ""use their heads to think of a new angle"" and then BAM! all of a sudden problem solved! Now they can properly use their brains thanks to Hiro reminding them to look for new angles. What exactly do you think they've been doing this whole time? Twiddling their thumbs???<br/><br/>BUT, the biggest plot hole has to be when Baymax got his disk out of his port and into his fist so that Hiro could have ""the part of Baymax that makes him him."" HOW did he do that? If that disk was out, he would have only had the red disk, therefore, becoming ""evil"" Baymax. And he wouldn't have had any time to take it out anyway...being as he was too busy saying goodbye and sacrificing himself...and if he had taken it out Hiro would have noticed. It's like the directors just magically decided to have the chip appear in his fist.<br/><br/>So, 5/10 and would have been lower if Baymax was not as cute as he is."

","Walt Disney Studio's New Animated Movie ""Big Hero 6"" is based on the Marvel Comic of the Same name. It tells the story of Hiro Hamada (voiced by Ryan Potter), a 14 Year-old genius, living in the fictional futuristic city of San Fransokyo (A hybrid of San Francisco and Tokyo), who spends time participating in back alley robot fights. Hiro and his older brother Tadashi (voiced by Daniel Henney), also a genius, who is a college student, parents are deceased, and they are raised by their Aunt Cass (voiced by Maya Rudolph, of Saturday Night Live Fame). Tadahsi, in order to try to try to get his brother to use his talent for something other than robot fights, takes him to the robotics lab at his University (Where his age will not restrict him from applying), and introduces him to his friends - GoGo Tomago (voiced by Jamie Chung), Wasabi (voiced by Damon Wayans, Jr.), Honey Lemon (voiced by Génesis Rodríguez) and Fred (voiced by T.J,. Miller), as well as Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit), a personal health care robot Tadashi created. I don't want to go into too much as to spoil the plot, but in a nutshell, a tragic event spurs the plot forward, as Hiro uses Baymax to try to solve the mystery, and the Superhero team eventually forms up. Overall I like it. The film plays has major themes of dealing with loss (Parents and Guardians be warned if you think your kids won't be emotional enough to handle that – It is rated PG), and using your Brain. I like that aspect of it, sending positive messages to kids, comparable to ""Wreck It Ralph"" which had the theme that's it's OK to be different. The only major knock I could give it, is I would liked a little bit more time on the supporting players in the movie to begin with. Other than that, a fun ride, with some good laughs, a lot coming from Baymax's programmed robotic personality. 3 ¼ out of 4 Stars."

"valen060","9","11","31","11 November 2014"," Marvel-based Disney Movie Stands Its Ground
","Following from Disney's impressive box office wins that was left off with the phenomenon 'Frozen,' I was not exactly sure what I was in for, so I went to check it out with family. Since it's Disney's first animated superhero film, I expected it to reach the ranks of most recent successful superhero movies that have dazzled and graced the movie screens way before it. Upon leaving the theater, I was left bewildered and curious over it all. I know Big Hero 6's origins were initially from a Marvel comic, but the movie has proved that it can stand its ground as a Disney animated feature in its own right. With Disney's incredible winning streak of past Revival Era hits like 'Princess and the Frog,' 'Tangled,' 'Wreck-It Ralph,' and 'Frozen,' I have to say Big Hero 6 is no exception. <br/><br/>As much as I've appreciated Frozen's characters and impressive songs, this movie is certainly NO musical of any kind. Instead, it has the potential to reach the ranks like 'Wreck-It Ralph' in terms of a legitimate, yet compassionate adventure story despite it feeling overshadowed by Frozen's currently popular fanbase.<br/><br/>In a futuristic tech-based city aptly titled San Fransokyo, the story features 14-year-old prodigy Hiro Hamada with a knack in robotics that he graduated high school ahead of his peers. Hiro's life is forever and drastically changed when a mysterious masked figure threatens to use the boy's intellect for his own devious plot.<br/><br/>It has an unusual, yet interesting formula: Disney humor, Marvel-induced action, and a touch of cyberpunk with dramatic themes that strikes an uncanny resemblance to Japanese Anime. The city's setting was well-detailed and finely assembled that it gave off the vibrant concept of ""What would happen if Tokyo ever did fully go cross-culture with San Francisco?"" While 'Frozen' has the likable snowman Olaf, the scene stealer for this movie is inflatable nurse robot Baymax (done with impressive voice work by 30 Rock's Scott Adsit behind the controls) with a personality that displays innocence, but is further backed up by learning human traits around him. Actor Ryan Potter delivered well in voicing boy genius Hiro by balancing both scruffiness and intelligence into his character. That bond between Hiro and Baymax somewhat began to remind me of the one shared between Ralph and Vanellope in 'Wreck-It Ralph.' The character Yokai (though his name is not mentioned in the film) was a formidable villain who doesn't monologue and instead follows his objective in a swiftly manner.<br/><br/>The younger ones who still can't fully comprehend the intensity of Marvel's most recent live-action movies will find this movie just as engaging, yet slightly watered-down and heartwarming at the same time. I know the original Big Hero 6 comic featured a mostly-Asian superhero team as opposed to the multi-ethnic team shown in the film adaptation, but I won't bother nitpicking over that. My true nitpicks, however, were that of Hiro's comrades since they weren't further explored enough in terms of their backstories, more chemistry from them towards Hiro, and the pacing felt a little rushed. However, to avoid spoilers, towards the end is something you yourself might not have guessed happening for one of them. Nevertheless, the entire movie demonstrates that you don't have to be an avid comic book fan (like Fred) to understand it completely, but what really matters is that this is an elaborate and entirely different take from the original source material and has made its mark successfully in Disney's current Revival Era with an amazing story and fast-paced action. I acknowledge the critics were right about this movie with its charms and charisma that I'm willing to see (if possible) another adventure in store for these heroes. Am I satisfied with my care? I certainly am..."

","Big Hero 6 is a movie I could have easily missed, luckily for me I had the opportunity to see it when it went on general release. This is easily my favourite Disney 3D animated movie. The title character Hero Hamada has such an Interesting character arc, it's wonderful to see how his character shifts and changes throughout the story. His motivations are always clear and he doesn't stray away from them, that's so nice to see in a movie with the target demographic of children. Baymax as a character works really well bring out emotions in Hero and the writers know how to use this very well. He also has great comedic timing, he's genuinely very funny. The relationship that builds between Hero and Baymax becomes very compelling, you really care about the situation. The other characters on the team are a lot of fun but this movie is very much about Hero. The structure of this movie is quite strange, when you think about it it can be defined in 5 acts. I think this is interesting and refreshing to see, especially in an animated film. I'm a big fan and would reccomend this film to anyone"

Baymax is a great character and I'm sure we'll see more of his antics in the inevitable sequels. I do wonder why Disney decided to call this movie Big Hero 6, though, when it really has nothing to do with the original comic books."
"mortimerdiego","9","2","3","27 January 2017"," excellent incorporation of advanced technology
","If you're into STEM and designing cool stuff and becoming the next Tony Stark, then you'll like Big Hero 6. The technology these guys have, and the brains to use it, is insane. A telling foreshadowing of what future San Francisco/Tokyo might look like, a microcosm of a society run by technology and its continual advancement.<br/><br/>Soundtrack by Henry Jackman, the same guy who did X-Men and Captain America. Suits the setting well, and you'll love the main single ""Immortals"" by Fall Out Boy.<br/><br/>The animation is crazy; as I saw with Zootopia, I could see how much Disney has improved since Snow White back in 1937. Some pretty nice fight sequences with the heroes' upgrades, and damn! the attention to detail is exquisite. Every scene and shot is SO detailed, down to the last sprocket.<br/><br/>Unlike most modern Disney films, this one didn't really feature the theme(s) of following your dreams and/or forging your own identity. It's a hero story, and this is indeed Disney's first time adapting Marvel Comics material. (Disney bought Marvel, after all.) I liked the message of helping others and doing what is right, as exemplified by the robot Baymax. The theme of friendship and sticking together. Of revenge. (Just kidding.) Anyways, I certainly didn't regret watching this past midnight. I can always expect the best from Disney."
"paulfny","10","2","3","13 October 2016"," A wonderful film about friendship and science.
","I was compelled to post here, as I read a few reviews praising this film which mentioned negative reviews on IMDb. Well, I've just been scrolling through all the reviews and couldn't find one lower than 7/10. It's utterly heartwarming to see such a wonderful movie receive almost unanimous praise. I won't go into massive detail about the film as others have already done so, but I found Big Hero 6 absolutely delightful; funny, emotional, exciting, and just dark enough when it needed to be. I've not cried at a film as much since, perhaps, the French movie Intouchable (also about friendship). My only tiny, niggling complaint is that I'd liked to have seen the other characters get more screen time and interaction, but I'm sure that'll happen in the sequel. Nevertheless, this is quite possibly one of my favourite films of recent years, and completely deserving of all accolades."

","This is by far one of my favorite movies of all time. It has heart, action, comedy, everything. I love the character development of Hiro. I also loved the hiro/baymax friendship. The only thing that really bothered me was Tadashi's death. I found it unnecessary and it was disappointing because he seems like such an interesting character. Other than that, it was prefect. The plot, the series of action packed events and the ending. This was a million times better than frozen and deserves more attention an appreciation. I watch it with my siblings, friends and even by myself and manage to have and laugh and even a good cry. I really hope a sequel is coming our way. This movie warms my heart and i recommend it for anyone looking for a feel good and heartfelt movie. 10/10!!!"
"anguscastle","10","2","3","19 March 2016"," The. Greatest. Disney. Film. Ever.
","Okay, I know by the statement 'The Greatest Disney Film Ever', it always sounds like an exaggeration. But in my honest opinion, and as someone who's watched Disney since before they could walk, I don't see why I shouldn't consider this the greatest Disney film ever. <br/><br/>It has everything needed for a Disney movie. It has beautiful animation, fun and engaging characters, humor, emotion, originality, a strong storyline, action-packed - the list goes on!<br/><br/>First of all, I must talk about the ensemble of characters used within this film. Each one has their own steer and adds something to the film. I absolutely adore the character of Hiro and his character journey. Disney have taken a much younger protagonist who I believe is someone anyone of any age can relate to. Hiro is someone who has a major loss in his life but is taught to move on and grow up. We also see a clear maturing point when Hiro learns from his older brother when he goes into the portal to save Abigail (much like Tadashi faced similar danger when going into the burning building). Baymax is also one of the greatest characters Disney has ever adapted on to the big screen. He's charming, adorable and brings the comedy element to Big Hero 6. I can't name a single person who didn't enjoy him as a character.<br/><br/>Of course, those are not the only two characters that are engaging to view. As I said before, each character brings something new and different to the film. Aunt Cass is the fun and hip auntie, voiced by the perfectly matched Maya Rudolph. The villain of the story has completely changed the dynamics of antagonists within Disney. He may not be the scariest villain or charismatic but he certainly has mystery and menace about him. And all characters Fred, Go-Go, Honey- Lemon and Wasabi are the dysfunctional yet caring group of friends for Hiro who help Hiro to grow up and bring out happiness within him.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 is also one of the most stunningly animated Disney films ever (in fact, I only find it second best to the 1940's Pinocchio). The concept of the Hybrid city 'San Fransokyo' is new and innovative which has been created beautifully for the big screen. Yes, the animators certainly didn't cut corners when producing the image of the film. Each second of it is well detailed and a beauty to view.<br/><br/>The humour of BH6 is also brilliant. Most of it admittedly derives from Baymax and his hilarious one liners but that's not all. Aunt Cass being over the top and excited, Wasabi being ironically cautious for someone who comes across built and tough, the amazing and action-packed montages which are exciting and hilarious. <br/><br/>However, Big Hero 6, in my opinion, is the saddest and most emotionally-stimulating Disney movie since The Lion King, and I think this also adds to the strong themes of the film. Tadashi passing away was both unpredictable and saddening. But it didn't end there - Baymax's health-care programme being violated, Hiro seeing Tadashi on video, the temporary loss of Baymax etc. all added to the strong emotion of this film which is what made the entire discourse of it so brilliantly executed.<br/><br/>To conclude, Big Hero 6 was seriously the greatest of Disney's works for a long time. The constant stream of action and excitement was enough for me to at least like this movie. But the fact that it was also incredibly animated, filled with hilarity, had a strong group of characters, layered with strong messages and morals AND emotionally moving just proves it just the best Disney film title. <br/><br/>I know this film was widely criticized by many fans but I still think it's worth the watch and a great film for anyone to see."
"Christopher_Reid","9","8","21","7 January 2015"," Pretty awesome but nothing particularly original
","This movie was very colourful and creative and enjoyable. It felt very familiar though. It has many things in common with The Incredibles and The Iron Giant, from general themes to plot, style and even many specific scenes and details. The story of this movie is nothing new, but then, very few movies are truly original anyway.<br/><br/>The animation is very good, the humour works really well, the characters are likable; it doesn't go for tired, predictable jokes. Although some of the jokes are a bit obvious, they're still well executed, feel natural and fit in with the flow of the movie. The robot is the coolest character by far. Like E.T. or The Iron Giant or even The Terminator (in the sequel), he learns things and is adorably oblivious and naive. He has simple morals but grows throughout the film. He is a mirror to humanity. His relationship to Hiro is the heart of the movie.<br/><br/>But of course, those themes have been better explored in all those other films I've mentioned and this one doesn't break any new ground. In the first major fight scenes, the heroes clearly clash with each-other, they aren't harmonising, but that idea wasn't brought up. There's a thing about looking for a new angle to solve a problem but it isn't fleshed out either; it sounds cleverer than it is. The plot is actually very typical and none of the potential ideas get explored in any depth.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the quality of the visuals, the voice acting, the dialogue, the timing - they're all very good. It has a lot of young, fresh energy. It has a few very funny parts and some quite sad moments that could make anyone shed a tear. Its strength is its simplicity (and efficiency); it doesn't shoot itself in the foot with too much exposition or melodramatics like most films. But again, it has nothing new. It reminded me too much of these other, arguably superior films which I've already mentioned. Every Pixar film is at least as good looking and insightful and touching. Big Hero 6 doesn't have a strong enough pull of its own. But I certainly look forward to a sequel if they can live up to the standard set by this one, hopefully with some improvements.<br/><br/>One weakness with the action was that it was too flat. It was easy to follow and cool and crazy and well planned out, but you don't feel the speed, the movement, the flow, the build-up of tension or suspense. It's just a barrage of images. Great for kids probably but it could be much more than that. It's like a kid playing with toys. Each part of the action conveniently fits in with everything else - there's no danger (until we get to ""that part""). The good guys are struggling badly but then, of course, come out victorious. But then there's a twist and they're gonna die... and then they win again, and so on. The movie has little bits of gritty realism, but mostly it cops out with relatively clichéd set pieces.<br/><br/>So why a 9? Because it's really well made, doesn't have major flaws, highly quotable and feels like it was made with passion. And just generally it's awesome."

Baymax shows what it means to have a friendship and pushes Hiro to do better.
Hiro uses his intelligence to achieve the unthinkable and makes it possible. He creates a team to take down the bad guy and they become a superhero team.
Baymax made me laugh countless number of times.

"mitchell5954","7","1","1","25 December 2019"," Disney Animated Marvel Movie
","Big Hero 6 is essentially the animated Guardians of the Galaxy. Both movies were based on obscure comics that few people knew about but became very successful. Even the cast in this film, very much, reminds me of the characters in Guardians. All-in-all Big Hero 6 is a very fun ride with memorable characters and a brilliant looking world. However, there are a couple issues that prevent it from being perfect.<br/><br/>First of all, the film looks amazing. This really uses its 3D animation to the fullest. The designs are awesome and so is the science being employed here even if it is out there. However, this is a world where this type of science is possible so I rolled with it. The film has a great score and soundtrack which really helps get you pumped especially during the action scenes. When this film gets going it's a very fun ride.<br/><br/>However, what truly drives this movie is its characters. Now, the main character, Hero, I actually thought was rather bland. He was, by no means, bad, but I found him the weakest of the primary cast. Hero's friends are all awesome. You have a superhero fanboy named Fred, a neat freak named Wasabi, chemistry whiz named Honey Lemon, and an adrenaline junkie named Go Go Tamago. Wasabi and Tamago are especially awesome to me. Tamago reminds me of Raven from the Teen Titans animated series. Wasabi is my second favorite character. His jokes, to me, were hilarious and he can be a badass too.<br/><br/>Lastly you have Baymax who is my favorite character in the entire film. He is hilarious, badass, and just very lovable. The way him and Hero play of each other is also very well-done. His design is also great. It's simple but effective.<br/><br/>Now, I do have a couple issues with this movie. It is a Disney film and you can see their fingerprints on this. Some of the classic Disney animated tropes are here mainly in the beginning and the end. There is a character who you know is going to die the minute he's introduced. Also it's pretty easy to guess who the villain is. They try to throw you for a loop with who it is in the first half, but it wasn't that hard to guess. In the beginning it really came down to two possible people and I could easily guess which one it was long before we got halfway through which brings me to my next point.<br/><br/>The villain himself I thought was weak. I love his costume, but, as a character, I didn't find him that interesting. He has a typical revenge motive which I find tired. In Disney films the villain's motive is usually revenge or to gain power. The motivation wouldn't matter as much if he had more presence to him. Disney villains of the past had flimsy motivations but they leave a big impact on you like Jafar, Scar, Maleficent, and so on, but he doesn't.<br/><br/>Also, the ending could've been trimmed down a bit. There is one scene after they defeat the villain where they have to go save this one character that has only had one scene prior so we have no emotional attachment to. The scene only seem to have been there to have a heartfelt moment where you think one of the main characters is dead but he comes back almost immediately after which makes that scene pretty much pointless. Unless that character they save becomes important in the sequel I see not importance to that scene other than to have a token heartfelt moment that every Disney film needs to have.<br/><br/>Overall, Big Hero 6, like Guardians of The Galaxy, is a fun ride that both children and adults can enjoy. The characters are memorable, it looks amazing, the action is good, and it has plenty of funny and heartfelt moments. If you like films like Guardians then definitely give this a look."
"Dragonflame378","7","1","1","22 December 2019"," Pretty good overall
","I enjoy the story and the aesthetic of this film. It's quite well done and the main protagonist is really the highlight of the film. Following his experiences and character development, his grief, and his friendship with Baymax, it's easy to care about both these characters. This character dynamic really carries the film though, cause the ""twist villain"" is just unbelievable and doesn't work at all. His motivation doesn't seem to make any sense. Other characters were quite unlikable as well, particularly the teenage stereotypes, as they don't really develop as characters and the tropes are quite painful to watch."
"Aaron1375","8","1","1","18 December 2019"," A very good movie from Disney.
","I enjoyed this Disney film as it is a movie about a group of smart kids trying to take on a villain. However, I enjoyed the movie more when it was the kid Hiro and the inflatable robot Baymax interacting as the film was more humorous during these stages. It kind of turns into more of an action film when Hiro becomes dead set on finding out and stopping the person who stole his inventions. Still, it was good in this phase, but watching Baymax cross a room and getting around stuff was super funny.<br/><br/>The story has a young boy who has already graduated high school and instead of taking the next step to college, he instead uses a robot to win money bot fighting. His older brother tries to get him on the right path by introducing his brother to his friends from school and his invention Baymax. This does the trick and so Hiro invents something called microbots that the head of the brother's school likes enough to enlist Hiro into the school. Unfortunately, there is an explosion and Hiro's brother dies; however, the strange discovery of a warehouse mass producing Hiro's microbots sends Hiro on a quest for revenge! He soon enlists his brother's friends help as he designs suits that use the super brainy teens specialties as powers.<br/><br/>The film has a lot of memorable moments as it is fun watching Baymax first appearances. I also liked it when Hiro was designing the other's suits. After that, it becomes more of an action film as they try and find out the identity of the villain and stop him when they learn of his insane plan. I liked the characters, Baymax being my favorite, love it when his battery is going low and he is petting the cat going, ""Hairy baby.""<br/><br/>So, this one was a really good film from Disney. It came after Frozen and a lot of people seem to get angry that this one did not catch on fire the way Frozen did; however, Frozen did have songs that were really catchy so that is probably what gave it an edge. Seriously, I think both films were made by the same person anyways so I am sure he doesn't care that this one did not do what Frozen did as it still performed very well at the box office. Still do not understand why a film with no sets and no actors can cost over 150 million though..."

","One of the best modern animated Disney films out there. The setting is phenomenal, it manages to be both futuristic while also staying completely feasible in our own world. It makes a sort of superhero origin story sort of thing but has it feeling like a friendship based Disney adventure instead. The 'loss of parents' hero trick is overplayed but here it is flipped on its side where our hero starts without parents and loses family in the same story. Baymax is a lovable sidekick and each of the side characters manage to leave the spotlight to Hiro while also developing interesting and unique personalities that the audience is able to find some of themselves in. The villain has a good motive and while not amazing is still good enough to hold his own in such a fun movie."

","Manga-influenced, team-based teen superhero antics with an emphasis on engineering over fantasy and mysticism. Nobody's struck by a meteor or experimented upon by the government, they're all just classmates at a prestigious technical school with a very specific set of strengths and passions. That's refreshing, both for the way it keeps the story grounded and for the limitations it places on the core characters. They're each decidedly human, even the cute inflatable robot whose personality is dictated by a memory card. Paired with a bright, friendly sense of style and a spacious, unique world that's loaded with fun little surprises, it's a visual and conceptual triumph. Unfortunately, the greater plot runs a bit generic, its well-worn twists and turns telegraphed a mile away, so those quirks and design touches are leaned on quite often. It's well-made, good natured, unique in a very crowded crossroad of genres, but too complacent and vanilla with its storytelling. Given a little more ambition, a sequel could do really well."

"MJB784","5","1","1","21 May 2018"," I was frustrated with the tone
","First of all, it was extremely uneven where it kept changing the story every few minutes and became a different movie and secondly, the tones were equally changing from serious to action packed to light-hearted and silly. The story was about this boy who loves going to ""Bot Fights"" for money and gambling because he graduated school at 13 years old. Then he visits his brother's current college and see his brother's invention: An inflatable robot known to heal named ""Baymax"". Then there's a fire in the building and the brother goes to rescue a teacher--inevitably killing him in the fire, but somehow the robot survives and becomes the boy's only friend until the deceased brother's friends become his friend and they band together to become superheroes. The title refers to the friends, the kid and the robot as crime fighters. None of that was in the trailers. I was certain the title was the name of the robot. They should have promoted all the characters of the title on the poster and trailers and re-written this uneven mess. It felt very un-Disney and more like Dreamworks crossed with Anime."

"elicopperman","7","1","1","25 March 2018"," Delightful Adaptation of an Obscure Comic
","In 2014, Disney released their 54th animated feature Big Hero 6, a film adaptation of a relatively unpopular comic book series by the same name. Alongside being critically acclaimed, scoring big at the box office, and winning the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, what people took away from the film was how Disney did something different, adapting a superhero comic into an animated feature. I myself loved this film back when it came out and even called it one of Disney's best....now I personally just find it good but a little overrated.<br/><br/>As usual for Disney, the animation is simply breathtaking. The film is set in the fictional city San Fransokyo, a blend of San Francisco and Tokyo, and the very design of it just spills imaginative. I'm sure anyone obsessed with modern Japanese art and central Californian life will go nuts over the amount of details and buildings created for the somewhat futuristic city. Along with a city that could only be made for a comic, the characters themselves look like they were made for a comic too given their stylized and exaggerated designs. However, the true highlight of the animation are the multiple representations of robots, technology and special effects, and the animators certainly let their creative juices go to great use in crafting the multiple mechanics and graphics used for the film.<br/><br/>That being said, the story itself is nothing all that special. It centers on robotics prodigy Hiro Hamada, who lost his brother, Tadashi, only leaving behind Tadashi's robot made with the sole purpose to aid people in need. After some shocking events catch on, Hiro transforms Baymax and his other friends, Go Go Tamago, Wasabi, Honey Lemon and Fred into a band of high-tech heroes. It's not hard to figure out the outcome, and most of the characters aren't all that memorable. Gogo is the tough athletic girl who's into speed, Honey Lemon is the bubbly chemist, Wasabi is the wise albeit neurotic laser enthusiast, and Fred is every stoner comic relief in the book....but I'd be lying if I said I didn't find him funny. Also, without giving much away, the reveal of the main villain is pretty obvious, although his motivations are built on vengeance from a horrible tragedy, so at least he has a decent reason for wreaking havoc.<br/><br/>However, I will say that the relationship between Hero and Baymax is the most heartwarming aspect of the entire feature. Considering that Baymax is built to help people, it makes sense that he would help Hiro in need. Even when Hiro wants him to fight back, deep down inside Baymax knows that murder will never bring Hiro's former sibling back. It truly is touching to see the only remains of Tadashi left simply want to make Hiro move on from a horrible tragedy, as I'm sure anybody dealing with the loss of somebody could relate. Not to mention, Baymax is absolutely adorable, from his squishy design, to his subtle robot movements, to even his caring charm that would make one wish to be his patient.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, while I don't think Big Hero 6 is quite as good as most people have made it out to be, I still deem it an entertaining and at times emotional superhero movie that's fun for the whole family. Even with a predictable plot and some two dimensional characters, there's enough fun action, humor, heart and eye popping animation that make it worth a view. Since Disney bought Marvel in 2012, people have been wondering if this film will get an installment in the MCU...well, here's their chance to do so. With a potential TV series soon to have more episodes (it's just being delayed, it hasn't been cancelled) and a rumored sequel, there's always potential for further development of this world and its characters in the future."

","I'd heard about Big Hero 6 from a Marvel encyclopedia and wondered how that would translate into a movie. Some things I remember from the original oddball comic while others were less predictable. But the cast here is the main show stealer. Different heroes with their respective differences. And they all band together to fight a common threat just like the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy. That's got to be a winner. And this was one of the movies that I got to see with a friend after we had a hiatus for a few years. It was one of the best signs of our relationship's comeback. And now we're back together. I couldn't be happier."

","The superhero model gets a family-friendly animated application in ""Big Hero 6,"" the long-assumed byproduct of the Disney-Marvel partnership come to fruition. Not that these young children weren't already seeing Marvel's live-action heroes, but this way Disney- Marvel can hook them on superhero tropes at an even younger age.<br/><br/>Older kids and adults, however, might also find the world of San Fransokyo engaging and charming. The story follows boy genius Hiro (Ryan Potter), who is wasting his potential in the underground robot-fighting scene until his brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) takes him to his high-tech university and introduces him to his nerdy-but- cool friends and professor. Inspired, Hiro creates an amazing invention to gain admittance to the school, but when it's stolen and used for evil, Hiro sets out with his brother's healthcare robot, Baymax (Scott Adsit), looking for answers.<br/><br/>Writers Robert L. Baird and Daniel Gerson (""Monsters University"") and Jordan Roberts roll most of the superhero origin story conventions into their reimagining of this team of lesser-known Marvel characters. Hiro is the main character who has suffered great trauma in his formative years (Batman, Spider-Man) who is a technological genius capable of building awesome robots (Iron Man  and also Batman and Spider-Man). So the movie doesn't tackle anything new for this genre, but it does package themes of loss, friendship, family and heroism into a form that children can digest.<br/><br/>The objective is not all that different from Disney and Pixar's 2004 collaboration ""The Incredibles,"" but the difference is ""Big Hero 6"" feels much more modern and ""The Incredibles"" more ""classical"" as far as superhero movies go. Directors Don Hall (2011 ""Winnie the Pooh"") and Chris Williams (""Bolt"") create a vibrant hybrid city in San Fransokyo and let nothing hold back the imagination. Their story is steeped in the tech-driven superhero world, and even though completely implausible, doesn't feature characters with special biological abilities (like ""The Incredibles""), only smart characters that are driven and motivated (who have really good access to tech). <br/><br/>The soul of ""Big Hero 6,"" however, is Baymax, the tubby, inflatable robot who Hiro turns into a heroic fighting machine. With his prime directive being to care for those who are injured or unwell, Baymax has acute insight into Hiro's fluctuating feelings (in fact there's a running puberty joke in the film). He's also an unlikely hero in that he's a big softie who doesn't want to harm anyone. He's the best source of comic relief in the film too, especially compared with T.J. Miller's Fred, who is sort of the obnoxious, weird friend. To the script's credit, however, Fred has all the lines that wink to the adults in the audience about how closely this story adheres to the comic book movie formula.<br/><br/>""Big Hero 6"" is a fun superhero adventure with a strong moral story arc. Although it throws some curveballs in terms of plot and emotions, nothing about it is all that surprising or original; it's a well-executed use of a reliable formula.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","Big Hero 6 was the first movie I ever saw at the iconic El Capitan Theatre on Hollywood Blvd. and I honestly could not have asked for a more perfect movie at the most perfect time to be my first experience of that place. Despite being a big (hero) hit the theatre was very quiet that afternoon and I had the entire upper balcony to myself. My mind was soon to be blown.<br/><br/>In summer 2012 I had sworn off comic-book movies after being consistently underwhelmed by the repetitive formula and the fact that they ALL seem to feature a climax with a giant blue laser shooting up into the sky. Not knowing that Big Hero 6 was based on a Marvel property, I didn't immediately write it off.<br/><br/>I also L-O-A-T-H-E CG animated movies as EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. seems to be about talking animals doing easy slapstick. When I see these indistinguishable movies consistently making hundreds of millions of dollars at the box office I wonder what is going on in the world. Can no one else see that they are all the same? All of them!<br/><br/>Thankfully, Big Hero 6 avoids this awful trope, and delivers some pretty awesome 3D too. There's lots to like about Big Hero 6, but I will stick to the top 10 reasons:<br/><br/>1. Baymax 2. Baymax 3. Baymax 4. Baymax 5. Baymax 6. Baymax 7. Baymax 8. Baymax 9. Baymax 10. Baymax 11. Baymax<br/><br/>Set in an alternate, Japan-influenced California, in the city of San Fransokyo the pioneers at the institute of technology invite 14- year-old genius Hiro Hamada to join their think tank but when his older brother is killed in a terrorist attack and his own invention stolen Hiro decides it would be better to solve the crime and creates a crime-fighting team of his own with Baymax, the lovable (and inflatable) medicare robot at the very wide centre of that team. <br/><br/>Yes, it's an origin story, but it's a good one and I am already tired of waiting for a sequel. Big Hero 6 is literally, actually, completely impossible to not like. And where can I purchase my own Baymax?"
"zivsoondie","5","1","1","27 November 2016"," Baymax the robot is awkward and funny
","This movie isn't bad at all. I didn't read critics before watching it, but I was skeptical to the blobby robot theme. I didn't know this was originally a comic either, until I read a few reviews here. To me this was a 5.5 movie..I would give it 6-7 on visuals, main characters and emotional moments, but sorry, the story was too thin. I don't believe in the bad guy character, and frankly, the microbots would have been literally impossible to beat. So, to me the action scenes just became a bit boring, and that ruined the overall impression. Even though I liked the Team, I thought they were shallow, but Baymax the robot is awkward and funny. He gave me a few laughs, especially when his battery died, and he acted like he was totally drunk!"
"infoalwaysacritic","7","1","1","3 November 2016"," A Solid Feelgood Movie
","Welcome to San FranTokyo, where Marvelous action heroes are celebrated in a city with a distinctly Asian aesthetic, in an American fashion, with its unoriginal storytelling. This is not a criticism so much as it is to be expected with a Disney film, given its studio's long history of taking stories from other places and adapting them in artistic ways. In many cases this works astoundingly well for them, as with Sleeping Beauty and the gorgeous Tangled film. Efforts by the studio to do their own thing have had some mixed results, with such gems as Frozen, but even their best borrow heavily from outside lores. This is no more true than in Big Hero 6, which draws so much inspiration from Marvel characters that the cameo of Stan Lee is not so much as a comical glimpse as it is a required nod to the original artist.<br/><br/>Again, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the ideas behind the story aren't taken shamelessly for their own, but are tastefully adapted into something that tells a story that addresses issues like depression and loss. As an example, It isn't very often that we see villains redeemed, even if they are still left with the consequences of their actions and in some cases, this happens in Big Hero 6.<br/><br/>Meet Hiro, a boy genius with a penchant for getting into trouble, who is so smart that he is bored with the legitimate world to the extent that he fails to notice his brother is attending the premiere school for his specific interest - robotics. When he learns this, his interest is sparked, leading to his inspiring entry into the admission process. Not everything can continue this peachy keen for a movie to be entertaining, so catastrophe strikes, leading to the formation of a team of self-proclaimed geeks bent on stopping an evil mastermind whose only crime at the time was stealing Hiro's idea. All of this is filled with intense action and emotional tension as Hiro deals with feelings of loss and betrayal, with the help of a robot designed to help him.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with positive themes, including sacrifice, companionship, acceptance and even forgiveness. When taken lightly, this film will leave you feeling good, just don't look too closely, or think too hard about the plot.<br/><br/>There is no arguing the production quality is excellent, something Disney studios has been setting the bar pretty high on. Colour is vibrant and sharp, making every character and location distinct. Unfortunately, the is held back by an overall feeling of a giant merchandising commercial. There is no veiling the blatant attempts at pandering to specific audiences, and that feeling interrupts the flow of the film, slapping you in the face with unnecessary and illogical events or styles that don't further the immersion, but instead break it. This won't bother everybody, but for some, this may be an issue.<br/><br/>Conclusion: A solid, light-hearted, film that, if taken lightly, will warm your heart."

","Big Hero 6 is a stunning and emotional Disney movie that will leave you speechless no matter what age group you are. It ties with going through everyday life, but in someone else's view point and tomes period, as well as experiencing his own dilemmas. <br/><br/>Big Hero 6 was directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams in November 7, 2014. It is an animated, action pact movie that appeals to the heart. it also appeals to families for its in-depth story on the matter of brotherhood, as well as the importance of knowing how precious something and someone truly is to you. as well as how to cope with those felling wen said object for person is not around for you to continue in stable mind. it also dwells in how connecting with other people or finding other things that are similar to what you have lost which may help with filling in the feeling of 'dying'.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6s cinematography was very well done. its visual effect was awe inspiring, it made understand the characters that much easier. the sound was top notch, allowing you to grasp the feel of the actors and how much effort and time was placed in order to get the voices and sound in line with the animation perfectly. the plot was questionable though, as there wasn't very much build up words it, and when it did reach the point were the falling action was supposing to take place, it just continued on with rising action. though, you could say that helped build up enthusiasm and excitement as it kept progressing.<br/><br/>One of the themes of big hero 6 is how every soul is precious. how we all have value weather we are the lowest of misers or bindle stiffs, or in the 1% of the world. that value is just placed in categories that we have not explored out of fear and have tried to delve in what other people are great at and try to be good at what they are. The way as to Big Hero 6 relates to this theme is how it literally takes the concept of trying to be someone you are not and then exhibits signed of coming in terms with that knowledge slowly. In times you may stray from the path or know that it is the right path but intentionally not dwell on it for the reason as to dealing the most critical to our subconscious.<br/><br/>Thus to conclude, big hero 6 is a phenomenal movie and deserves an 8/10 for how it was like a stepping stone for what 2016 may hold for our entertainment. the reason as to why an 8/10 is mainly because of the story progression. I feel as though it was not centering on certain points long enough, as well as small breakthrough in the scene of things. overall, I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a film that will touch your heart in numerous ways."

"WilliamOTyler","7","1","1","28 January 2016"," Disney animates Marvel with great, beautiful action
","Disney steadily adds to its canon of superhero characters with the addition of Big Hero 6. Based on a Marvel comic, the film follows young prodigy Hiro Hamada and his friends as they inadvertently become a team of heroes set on saving their town of San Fransokyo. But instead of the usual fare of princesses and fairy tales, this time Disney lends it's magic by way of modern tech and high energy action sequences, all while keeping its heart in the right place.<br/><br/>The film is story driven, and there is really a lot of story. Just as you think you've settled into all the things you need to know, more characters and backgrounds are introduced to further push it along. The general story is a simple and predictable one, once you've been introduced to all of the characters. They each serve a purpose and it's not hard to figure out who is there for what reason. But the film manages to feel fresh and new, all while being authentic to the superhero tropes.<br/><br/>No superheroes would be complete without a worthy super villain to oppose them and Yokai will join the long list of dramatically menacing Disney villains. Of all of the outrageous characters in the film, he is the most visually striking, sleek and dark and formidable. He works as a nice counterpart to Baymax, who will undoubtedly be the movie's runaway star. Baymax's stark white and wholesome demeanor is a complete contrast to the villain's all black corruption. While Baymax is cute, Yokai is sinister, but he is smashingly smooth in motion. In fact, the whole movie is.<br/><br/>The look of the film is quite a stray away from what you're used to from the company. Not since Oliver & Company has Disney's animation been in such a modern and urban setting. Flashy neon lights and billboards cover the big city and the lighting is always atmospheric. Colors shift between dark and moody and vibrant and romantic. Towards the end of the movie, you'll even see the most beautiful and unexpected cotton candy clouds. And the camera moves seamlessly through all of this, following the berserk flow of the film's many engrossing action scenes.<br/><br/>When the film does take its breaks from literal high-flying adventure, it settles into moments of true sympathy and pathos. It tugs hard on the heartstrings, sometimes maybe even a little too hard, but all for good reason and to help up the anti. Not all of it works, as the artificial intelligence aspect goes for a WALL-E but doesn't quite hit it. And it would have been nice to see some of the other characters a little more, as not much time is spent on them even though they are thrust into the spotlight. Watching these newfound superheroes find themselves and their purpose is what it's really all about.<br/><br/>This is Disney proper's first real foray into animated superheroes, arguably with the small exception of Bolt, but that's going down a different route. Here, the film borrows heavily from all of its Disney brethren. Marvel is the source material, so it's mark is inherent. But the film also feels a lot like Pixar's The Incredibles, and has nods to other stable sci-fi and action flicks like Lilo & Stitch and TRON. But this isn't a bad thing; it's not at all a rehash. Big Hero 6 uses these inspirations to show a new Disney like you've never really seen it, and it's enjoyable all around."
"Scozz","7","7","18","1 February 2015"," A sense of child-like glee trumps the film's flaws.
","Big Hero 6 is the latest film to be released by animation legends, Walt Disney Animation Studio, and in recent years they have proved to be on top form with Tangled and Wreck-It Ralph being put on the list of some of my favourite films of all time. So how did their recent instalment fare?<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>Let's start by saying that this film is far from perfect: the character development is poor and inconsistent, the plot and twists aren't terribly surprising creating a lot of clichéd moments, and the ending lacks consequence. <br/><br/>However, on the plus side, the animation in this film is stunning. The world is incredibly detailed and colourful especially given its Japanese inspired style blended into Disney's typical animation style. The music to this film is brilliant too – Henry Jackman (previously used for the music in Disney's 'Wreck-It Ralph') has done a stunning job with the music, elevating the film's uplifting moments, giving tenderness to the more emotional parts, and giving it a general fun and exciting feel; the music is half the reason I was smiling through most of the film.<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>Some have considered this to be a ""kid's film"" but I feel that's very harsh. Admittedly, the film does not make you think too much but it does not patronise you in the sense that limits this film to one that parents might take their children to see and sit there wishing they were somewhere else. This film is a lot of fun and highly enjoyable!<br/><br/>Baymax is undoubtedly the best part of this film – he is adorable, quirky, funny, memorable and gives the film heart (ironic considering he is a robot). Every time he spoke, he had me smiling and the relationship between him and Hiro is quite touching. However, the rest of the characters, although Disney try to push their personalities, are very one dimensional. Don't get me wrong, the characters were enjoyable and generally memorable but the development on them was barely there and I can't say that I knew them anymore than I did at the start of the film – they're just tag-alongs there for the ride.<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>The plot creates a lot of fun moments and is quite action-centric with that Disney heart (as you'd expect from a Marvel/Disney match-up) and the action is a joy to watch! However, there are moments that just seemed far too obvious or poorly handled like *SPOILER* Tadashi's death - I would have enjoyed more build up on him as a character in order to feel the pain of his absence or even that he went tragically; He was a heroic and kind character but running into a burning building with blind hope was a little foolish and made his death very obvious. *SPOILER* <br/><br/>Again with *SPOILER* the reveal of Professor Callaghan as the main antagonist seemed poorly handled as there was very little there to present or foreshadow that it was possibly him behind this all and once it's revealed it's difficult to feel sympathy for him despite the reasons for him becoming the villain. *SPOILER* <br/><br/>Finally, *SPOILER* despite the cliché that Baymax sacrifices himself to save Hiro, this was a very touching moment for me and it was sad to see Hiro lose the biggest legacy he had left of his older brother. Baymax died a hero, and yet Disney decide to make his sacrifice redundant by making sure that Baymax was able to put his own programming chip into his booster glove so that Tadashi could rebuild him afterwards. The film constantly shows us that Baymax is not very agile or capable of great movement, so how was he able to put the chip in his hand and also keep his programming of helping Hiro without turning into Evil Baymax. It makes very little sense, as well as the fact that Hiro was able to just magically build another Baymax out of nowhere which really hinders the film and makes the ending all so anti-climactic and far too inconsequential. *SPOILER*<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>To round up, despite its plot and characterisation flaws, I highly enjoyed this film. It was a fun and heart-felt ride that was an absolute joy to watch, especially so on the eyes and ears with the animation being the best Disney has produced yet and the music being so wonderfully magical. I do genuinely feel that I enjoyed the film so much that its production values and positive moments in the film do overlook negatives. It kept a smile on my face and a feeling of child-like glee that I haven't felt in a film since Avengers. However, I could only recommend this film if you are willing to let that inner child in you have some fun – if not then the fun may be a little lost on you and flaws might crack through the aura of fun that the film inspires. <br/><br/>8/10 (4 Starts) – As long as you're willing to have a bit of fun."

","Full of obvious Disney tropes, flat characters and absurd over-the- top action, Big Hero 6 is a huge let-down.<br/><br/>While graphically gorgeous, this sometimes-funny super hero origin story is so contrived you know exactly where it's going thirty minutes before it even went there. It's not just the tropes, really, but rather how everything is so conveniently introduced to play a role later that the movie just never gets to the point of interesting. It's not moving, not particularly fun or funny. But mostly - it's just stupid. I guess suspension of disbelief is subjective but... somehow, I felt like this movie really bent it a bit too far, and for an animated super-hero movie that's saying quite a bit considering the low bar of realism it was set in the first place. Nothing makes sense, and stuff is just happening incoherently.<br/><br/>There's all the rest - the dry delivery by most actors falls completely flat, with the exception of Baymax who is excused but only because he's a robot. There is very little acting, writing or joy in this movie. It looks like the department where a ton of love was poured into is the animation, but that does not a decent movie make.<br/><br/>This is not The Incredibles for the iPhone generation. It's just... pretty bad."

Although it was sad at the end to see Beymax go, that was semi-predictable, we were glad to see him brought back to life at the end. The movie made me laugh, has some serious themes that run deep, and made me cry, so that makes a good movie- feeling a range of emotions, with some moral/emotional connections.

","(possible spoilers) I had heard good things about ""Big Hero 6"" from a friend who reported to like the movie a lot, so I had fairly high expectations for it going in - maybe too high. The movie opens up strongly, but got a little too sentimental and melodramatic about a quarter through on. It does have some cute humor reminiscent of live action robot movies like ""Short Circuit"" that was worth some chuckles, and a couple harder laughs. The ""action"" though gets repetitive and the story seemed a little stale around half-way, certainly ""losing steam"" in the 2nd half. The villain shrouded in mystery could've been done better and differently I think also. Still the movie is probably worthy of a watch. 6.5/10 - Mildly recommended."

","If not quite at the emotional or intelligence level of the very best animation, this is still fun and quite endearing. A young computer genius has his life turned upside down by a tragedy, but forges a bond with a goofy robotic blow-up nurse. This robot, Baymax, is designed only to help, not fight. But our hero equips him to be able to be a warrior machine to help take down a mysterious villain who has stolen our wunderkind's invention and is using it for nefarious purposes. The gap between the personality programming and body type of the puffy, gentle, cute robot nurse and it's re-purposing leads top most of the films biggest laughs. <br/><br/>If the film has a weak spot it's that the bad-guy is not very interesting, and makes a lot of illogical choices that let our team of good guys (our computer nerd hero 'Hiro' has gathered a bunch of super-brainy grad students to be his back-up team) get away far too easily. The best cartoons almost always have a great villain. But it does have a world class sidekick in Baymax who was created walking a great line between anthropomorphic adorableness and staying somewhat honest to its imaginary actual programming, instead of suddenly becoming a sentient creature. Not a classic, but I'm glad I saw it."

The animation was always the same as the Disney animations, story was likable and is a good story about dealing with death (the main character Hiro Hamada had his brother dead), awesome action scenes (it's not as violent as the real Marvel movies), and very likable characters with only one of them with a heart. It's not a Marvel movie, so it's more aimed for kids, but it still makes adults love it with all the heart from the movie. Big Hero 6 is a frantic movie. But with a heart, the movie will become a classic.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>P.S. there is a surprise comedy scene after the end-credits (just like a Marvel movie, right?) with Stan Lee as a member of Big Hero 6's father!"

It almost felt like watching a real movie - the story line is good, keeps you hooked all throughout, and the action and futuristic science fiction displayed in the movie is pretty cool. The characters are nice and lovable, specially Baymax!

","This movie in general was a fun family movie, but it really asks you to suspend disbelief and tolerate some pretty poorly-written dialogue.<br/><br/>The dialogue was especially bad in the early parts of the film when it felt like a lazily-written sitcom trying to economically tell you the backstory with unnatural and exposition-packed lines to explain the characters, their relationships to each other and their backstories.<br/><br/>Because this is based on robots and advanced scifi technology it is a little difficult to get a true feeling for the world of this story.<br/><br/>Character choices are a little bit confusing at times as well. For example Hiro invents the very technology that is turned against him (for reasons not really explained), and instead of making use of this technology he created to combat it, he turns to other inventions created by his brother and friends.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I guessed two of the major plot ""twists"" very early into the movie so the enjoyment factor was somewhat dampened by that as well.<br/><br/>This probably sounds really negative. It's not. This was an enjoyable movie to sit and watch with the kids, but even they were scratching their heads at some of the story elements, so more intelligent writing would have served this movie well."
"caseynicholson","7","6","17","28 November 2014"," A Fun Break from Reality that Kids Should Enjoy
","I went to see ""Big Hero 6"" primarily because I'm a lover of all things comic book related, and Big Hero 6 is based off of an obscure Marvel comic book. I also do enjoy animated movies, though I must say that as someone who doesn't have children I probably have not seen as many animated films in the Pixar era as others may have seen.<br/><br/>That said, I enjoyed this film immensely. Having not seen many computer-generated feature films like this one, I found the animation to be stunning. I'm sure that that's true of many animated features these days, but Big Hero 6 nevertheless impressed me with its attention to detail in every single pixel of the movie screen. <br/><br/>In addition to the animation, the script was fun and a nice break from reality. I also can report that there's no need for any prior knowledge of the comics to enjoy the movie--something that was not as true for me when I saw ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". In the latter movie, I had zero knowledge of the characters and their mythology, and while the film did a fine job explaining, it also left me wishing I had known a little bit about the books going into things. <br/><br/>""Big Hero 6"" is not like that. The story is clear and informative throughout, and the plot builds nicely into a good movie going experience. I would also say that the story told is fun and entertaining. One of the best parts of the film is the villain, who has a fairly unique super power (it could perhaps be compared to the ""Sandman"" character from the Spider-man books, but remains unique despite similarities).<br/><br/>All in all, I'd highly recommend the film, with just one reservation: as fun as the movie was, I did find myself thinking that I had seen other animated films that I enjoyed more, and that's coming from someone who admits to not watching very many animated features. As such, I'd say this is a great movie if reviewed purely on it's own merits, but if one starts comparing to other Disney or Pixar films, it's possible that ""Big Hero 6"" may not top the list. Still, I'd say it easily deserves 7/10 stars. <br/><br/>And do stay for the post-credits scene, especially if you are a Marvel Comics fan!"

","Ever since I read the flap from a book in the back of my dad's car, I've had a very strong business model. Good is the enemy of great, or rather prevents it. Lots of the Pixar movies are good, which is just fine, but people praise them as being great. There are plenty of great Pixar movies, though. I expected Frozen to be great from all the talk, but it was only good. It's not a dis on the movie, but I was let down because of the fans. Big Hero 6 was endlessly hyped as being great, but it wasn't even good. It wasn't okay. It was sub-average.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 introduces some fun, weird characters, but goes nowhere with them. Act I was as cookie-cutter as the term cookie-cutter. There was the great art and animation typical to a Pixar movie, but that didn't support much of anything. This story is not a bad concept, it's a good concept that set up a scenario I wanted to see. But the events and their outcomes are incredibly generic. Every time the masked villain shows up, every scene with the team trying to work together is so incredibly boring. If a scene ends in the way it LOOKS like it will end from the perspective of the start, that's a huge failure.<br/><br/>The worst of all: the ending. I saw it coming as it was happening. But the ol' boys in the story department gave us a big shock that was equivalent of whipping it out in public. They reveal who the antagonist is and...no one gives a small wet turd. It's barely even important. I stopped caring part way through the movie and the ending was great because it gave me the chance to get up and use the bathroom.<br/><br/>The voice-acting and animation was okay, but the movie was too in love with itself over how cute the audience thought Baymax was. It was too in love with itself for having a wacky cast and an ""emotional"" journey. I didn't believe that Hiro's brother was reasonable motivation for hunting down the masked dude and the worst thing that happened to him was at the beginning, thus bringing the levels of emotional conflict presented at the start down to a healthy zero. I was satisfied with the care the theater seat took in comforting me, whispering into my ear, ""fear not my sweet, 'tis but a bad film. It passes by like a dream, and fades like smoke in air, or ripples on a stream."""

There is quite a lot to love about this movie. The voice acting is spot-on, the animation is bright and defined, and there are some great jokes. I loved how they took a good portion of the film to set things up. I loved the villain's appearance, how he mostly stayed silent, only using motions of his body. And who doesn't love the mechanical marshmallow Baymax?<br/><br/>The first scenes had some bad exposition dialog, but what really prevents me from loving the movie are the side characters. These heroes had little to do with the plot and had no development. The two dudes were very annoying, the least funny aspects of the movie. I wanted more characterization with the villain, but tbh, he's fine.<br/><br/>Its a very solid movie, that I think both adults and kids will enjoy.

","This film may be for many, but surprisingly it wasn't for me. But then again, I guess that's what happens to have high expectations whenever one hears that a film is well-received and critically acclaimed.<br/><br/>The special effects/CGIs were okay and all, but it's the story that I felt was lacking something. I just couldn't put my finger on it but there was something about the plot of the film along with the characters that I didn't quite find to be fleshed out enough.<br/><br/>I really did not find myself relating to the main ""human"" character at all in this film, in fact, I found many of the supporting characters to be a lot more fleshed out and interesting than the main character was. I also found the villain of the film to be very unoriginal and not very interesting.<br/><br/>My number one problem after watching this film is that the only original take I thought it had was that it isn't a typical Disney movie. Which I don't really have a problem with. But I did not find the writing to be all that fresh at all and at the end of it, plot-wise, it felt as if I was watching another low-budget action-hero film (not counting the CGI) with many of the plot-twists being somewhat dull and predictable. Maybe a lot of heart-warming and tear-jerking moments, but this film failed to grab my interest enough for any of it to take effect.<br/><br/>So while not saying that the film is either ""terrible"" or ""awful"", will however, say that it was nothing really fresh nor special.

"RforFilm","7","7","22","13 November 2014"," With parts of creativity, design, and fun, Big Hero 6 becomes a functional film of excitement and fun
","Talk as much as you want about what kind of future we're leaving our children, I want you to consider how much we have now. We are in the middle of the biggest transition into machines (even more so then the industrial revolution years before) with more computers, more robots, and more information built into an interconnected system that is assessable to everyone. While I can't say this is making people smarter, it is certainly giving us a bigger chance to help others. The trouble with introducing new technology is that the inventor will assume that everyone will use it correctly. That is never the case. <br/><br/>A good example is robotics. By skimming some old Popular Science magazines, I see many sketches and prints of robotics acting like our personal servants. We are now in their future (or our present) yet the majority of the tech is related to industry or toys, but no robot friends. I think the big issue with human-like robots is cracking the idea of programing the emotions of a human. How would you program love and hate in the simplest of terms. For now we're just going to have to step back and enjoy the newest cinematic robot creation in Big Hero 6.<br/><br/>In the futuristic metropolis of San Fransokyo (a creative combination of San Francisco and Tokyo), a fourteen-year old prodigy named Hiro Hamada makes little fighting bots in street matches to make money as he's already gone through high school. He's rescued by his older brother Tadashi and taken somewhere where he can be appreciated; the robotics college where Tadashi goes. He meets some other students and is introduced to their Professor Callaghan (played by James Cromwell) who encourages Hiro to enter a show that could admit him.<br/><br/>Tadashi introduces Hiro to Baymax; a inflatable health care companion whose duty is to help the sick and injured. For the college competition, Hiro invents a bunch of nanobots (robots that are really small, but work together to do big things) that catches everyone's eye. The excitement is worn off fast when a building fire destroys the nanobots and kills Tadashi.<br/><br/>Hiro sulks in his room for a while and gets to know Baymax's abilities more. This causes the robot to accidentally discover that a villain in a Kabuki mask is making a ton of nanobots. This gets Hiro the motivation to build armor for Baymax to search for the man that may be Tadashi's killer.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 has the distinction of being the next Disney Animated movie after Frozen. It's a bad spot to be as most people are going to expect another major hit. Big Hero 6 managed to entertain me, but I doubt it's going to be Disney's most memorable. The best thing about the movie is the setting. San Fransokyo has a very awesome look that my inner child is screaming ""I WANNA GO!"". The balance of the American and Japanese cultures work well to the futuristic story of robotics.<br/><br/>Speaking of robots, Baymax has so much of a nonthreatening and huggable design, I have a hard time imagining someone hating him. He's curious, gentile, and always wants to help people. He plays the pet to Hiro whose story is a good one; accepting loss and finding new purpose. He's smart, but not yet fully mature to understand the need to have friends. His friends consists of the other college students that Tadashi worked with and eventually become heroes with Hiro and Baymax. They have fun personalities, but were not given enough time to know them more. This story belongs to the boy and his robot. <br/><br/>I'll give this seven Baymax robots out of ten. Though more time with the side characters would have been nice, Big Hero 6 has the mechanics to be an exciting, fast paced action that most families should see."

","First of all, I expected a bit much from Big Hero 6 before watching it. THe simple fact that it featured a health companion as star character was an interesting angle. Alas, the movie just follows the lead of most blockbusters and focuses on a very basic storyline with few or no substance at all. Would I enjoy watching this flick with my kid? Yes, if it was only for the entertainment and to tell him afterwards how much it graphically evolved over the few last years. But other than that, I would skip it without a thought. <br/><br/>What I think the movie lacks is moral value, a message your kid can use in his/her life. What the movie tells the kids is : 1) you must be driven to accomplish things 2) friends are important when coping with pain (what about family? The aunt is depicted as a lunatic but loving coffee owner, but she appears only a few times mainly for gimmicks). 3) Revenge is natural 4) Since revenge is natural so only violence can stop it. Is it what you want your kid to understand? Because that is what he/she will understand mostly, except for all the wows... But more importantly, the health companion is somehow transformed into a war machine (a cool one, OK) used as a tool by the little genius (a kid with an ego the size of a skyscraper who takes what he needs when he needs it). <br/><br/>There is so much American animation could do, especially Disney, to satisfy the viewers needs while suggesting alternatives to all-out war/hero stuff."

It does pull at the heart strings a bit, but it does not make you cry. You do get attached to the main characters. This is not as heart wrenching as other Disney movies, it is very solid. There is not the typical musical sing along type, it has a more pixar feel to the animation and storyline.

And through all the clichés we are used to (and have watched before), this is a good movie for the young ones, but also for adults.<br/><br/>There is humor for both age groups (if you only say young and old as I just did). The scene with the low power works on so many levels, that I almost fell off my chair laughing. Of course you could say, that it was silly, but you have to let yourself go at times and laugh a little bit. Especially if a movie is able to reach out and spark some emotions.

","This new Disney/Marvel movie centers around a 14 year old boy genius named Hiro (think Jimmy Neutron) who sets out on a mission to track down a man who stole one of his inventions and deeply hurt him in the process. He's accompanied by a group of zany ""nerdy"" friends and a rather large, cute inflatable robot named Baymax, and the story largely focuses on their relationship. They become more like superheroes as they strive toward their goal. You may be thinking, ""this sounds familiar"" and that's because it is. This movie covers territory that's already been treaded on countless times in recent years (in fact, it bore many similarities even to ""Guardians of The Galaxy,"" only this time for kids) and it really adds nothing new to the formula.<br/><br/>And that doesn't make a movie inherently bad. There are countless formulaic movies that are still extremely enjoyable and touching, but this one simply misses the mark. Where this movie really went wrong is how it tried to balance its tougher, more saddening themes, with light-hearted entertainment. A good example of a movie that did this right is ""Up,"" which takes segments to solely deal with hard moments and let the audience be sad, and then it provides lovable characters and funny dialogue to make them smile later on. ""Big Hero 6"" tries to soften the blow of the tough moments by throwing in some silly humor here and there, which ends up cheapening the effects of both. It's never funny long enough to be considered entertaining escapism, and it's never serious long enough to actually say anything new about its darker themes (death, grieving, recovery--I know, some heavy stuff). It just sits in this awkward middle ground. And the plot, action, and characters are not entertaining enough on their own to sustain it, either. It's the typical learning to work together to conquer plot missions as well as emotional battles--Disney and other studios have been doing it for years and there's just nothing even remotely fresh about anything on screen. <br/><br/>I know I'll be stepping on a few toes with this review. I don't think the movie is ""trash"" as another reviewer suggested, I just think it's nothing new and nothing interesting. There are still some amusing sequences, though (Baymax provides pretty consistent chuckles) and I didn't outright hate the movie. It just wasn't for me. If you're a parent of a hyped-up Disney fiend, then sitting through this won't be that bad and you'll even find yourself chuckling from time to time, but unless you're being forced to see it or really have nothing else to do, then I would stay home--maybe pop in ""Wall-E"" or ""Up"" or ""Tangled"" if you're really craving some modern Disney. Not terrible, but simply not worth the time or money."

Yet entertainment is where Big Hero 6's success reaches it's peak. Unfortunately there is really no character as Hiccup or Emmet, no multiple layers to the story and no profound message we had with these other two movies. At no point in this movie I thought there was going to be more than I expected: it's very predictable, it plays to many clichés, it has some very generic scenes, characters and montages and doesn't take any risks of any type. Weakest of these points is the climax in which I was plain out bored, when it should have instead been the high point of everything.<br/><br/>Yet, this is no to say that the movie has some big strengths, the biggest of them being the comedy. This movie is really funny, I laughed out loud a lot of times and to this contributed astonishing animation. From frame one I was surprised at the brilliance of it. Mainly because it wasn't only beautiful, but actually very, very smart. Unfortunately even here it didn't manage to beat the visual feast that were The Lego Movie and How to Train Your Dragon 2, but still that would have been something really hard. Moreover, as much as I talked about generic scenes and montages, there were some very good scenes, some great set pieces that had enough spice to keep me smiling throughout. Obviously the greatest element of this movie is Baymax, it was so pleasant to have such a captivating screen presence. He is so good that the robot in this movie might be the most interesting character.<br/><br/>Very good flick, but slightly underwhelming, especially considering the amazing streak Disney Animation had had up until now."

The animation in this movie is great.There are a lot of moments that show the scale of some scenes amazingly, especially in a car chase near the middle of the movie.<br/><br/>The part of the movie that felt a little flimsy. Most of the supporting characters just seemed to be stereotypes, for example: The trendy character, the stoner type character, the hard core extreme character,etc. Well, everyone besides Baymax. Also, I wish there were more scenes where Baymax is at low battery, that was hilarious.<br/><br/>Also this next part of the review will contain spoilers, so if you haven't seen the movie just skip to the final score.<br/><br/>The other thing that bugged me was the last act of the movie. When they were talking about the professors missing daughter, I thought that they were saying she died, which would have been a lot more effect on the viewer than what happens next. They find a way to get her out of the other dimension alive (even though in one scene it seemed like a month passed, which means she would've been in that dimension for a month without lack of oxygen). That kinda made the movie feel like there was no sense of consequence in the movie. Unless if you're the sympathetic bad guy, then you're ass can go to jail if you're in a Disney movie. Also, am I the only one who feels like the ending is a rip off of The Iron Giant. No? Just me?

I don't know about you guys but I consider that a failed comic book series. The original was based in Japan after the WWII bombings. The team was assembled to protect Japan under command of the emperor. Looking at the Characters you will actually be surprised how similar they actually are in a sense. Keep in mind they did change up specific parts to make it more kid friendly and to show kids how cool the Science is.Big Hero 6 is not only a movie that will hypnotize you with its bright colors and hybrid city of San Fransokyo but will also have you searching for careers in Science. ""A large theme of this movie is science and how it can help man kind."" This is a completely different message you would get from reading the actual comic books."

","Honestly, I was ready to swallow ""and"" enjoy the beginning of the movie. It was... well-paced, fairly acted, had music, action... well, it went like people picture it.<br/><br/>Then... I saw the test flying scene. And everything got into place. This... yucky colorful mix just became absolutely clear. Because I knew where have I seen it before... In one of my most favorite cartoons - How to Train Your Dragon.<br/><br/>And I don't mean cliché or similar scene... I mean practically line to line of script, of visuals, of ideas. And everyone knows Disney and Dreamworks are not exactly the pals to ""tribute"" each other.<br/><br/>I know this isn't the first time these two make similar cartoons, so the question is - did Disney even try?<br/><br/>Well, I am not heartless. Even worst cynics can commend Baymax and I will give it to Disney, they made Baymax... cute, funny, enjoyable. And I can't help but commend the animators. But what else to expect from bloody Disney?<br/><br/>Graphics and one character aside, that's as good as it goes.<br/><br/>A genius kid, who invents something super, and who is unpopular? Haven't heard that one before. But... apparently he has a perfectly loving aunt, caring big brother, who has absolutely positive friends, and our Hiro discovers it all in ""one day"". Quite a premise. Really reminds of the Frozen kickstarter: it took parents about 5 seconds to die in a storm to pretty much establish the plot for the rest of the movie. Oh... actually, this ex-machina brother dies in... exactly the same situation. Double strike. And this kid has to learn to control his newfound robot, assemble a team, equip them with... Seriously, if a random kid can make a superhero team in his basement, why do we need Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark again? The montage scenes from this movie really deserve the South Park song...<br/><br/>Going back to Frozen, how many people disliked the whole Shyamalan ending with the good guy going bad for a totally improbable reason? Well, apparently Disney doesn't want to do better. And how could they, if the thing Hiro created - was yet another telepathic superpower. Where have I seen that before... everywhere? Looking at Hiro's team, that consists of stereotypical characters, among which are tron-girl(c), agile beefy funny black guy, purchased HTTYD actor and a pink-loving blonde, can we expect anything other than a D-grade villain? No, no we can not.<br/><br/>Throw in the protracted finale that made about as much sense as Hiro's powers and... well, all loose ends were tied up. Even Stan Lee's cameo.<br/><br/>And, of all the cartoons, this one has to touch the puberty angle. Well, parents, get ready...<br/><br/>It's not a bad cartoon, it's quite a good watch for kids, and for any popcorn-grade adult, but after Wreck it Ralph and even Frozen, I would expect something more from Disney. From a publicly acclaimed, award-winning movie. I am... very disappointed. I can't even think of any memorable, epic, climax scene that would remind me of this cartoon later. There isn't even anything to copy, because it already hasn't had any bit of originality.<br/><br/>If they had worked the character angle, mixed up characters, made them surprising, not clichéd, removed the terrible scenes, like flight scene or ""through the portal"" scene, reworked the villain, either giving this one a far more reasonable outcome, or changing him altogether... and, honestly, made the final battle actually inspiring - I'd say Big Hero 6 is a good watch. But as it stands - it's a hollow Disney moneymaker with almost no creativity."

","Big Hero 6 is a Walt Disney Studios animated film made in partnership with Marvel, based on the comic of the same name. I very much enjoyed it. I'll admit the trailers didn't really impress me all that much but to be fair this is a difficult film to make a trailer for. It really felt like it captured the best of both the Disney and Marvel worlds.<br/><br/>Set in the futuristic city of San Fransokyo (San Francisco and Tokyo combined), 14 year old Hiro Hamada is a robotics genius who forms a team of superheroes to combat a masked supervillain from causing destruction. Aiding Hiro and his fellow heroes is the lovable robot Baymax, built by his older brother for personal healthcare and companionship.<br/><br/>There was so much going on in this world the film has created. San Fransokyo felt alive and like a realistic city. Hiro is a likable protagonist and Baymax is such a fun character as well. He reminded me a bit of Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy, albeit, with a wider vocabulary than just saying who he is. This film also features probably my favourite Stan Lee cameo of all time.<br/><br/>I rate it 8.5/10.

The whole setting is superb and must have taken a lot of research and animating to achieve the spectacular setting. As for Baymax the inflatable side kick to Hiro, this is an absolutely perfect piece of writing and the imagination of the writers on this one is so inspired.

","Big Hero 6 (2014): Dir: Don Hall, Chris Williams / Voices: Ryan Potter, Scott Adsit, Daniel Henney, James Cromwell, Alan Tudyk: Inventive animation about the future of creativity and humanity. Ryan Potter voices young Hiro Hamada who specializes in robot wars, an illegal game. His older brother Tadashi introduces him to some sort of Nerd university where inventing is celebrated. Hiro is overwhelmed and desires to have a future there. His brother created an inflated robot looking health care companion named Baymax. He looks like a robot beach ball that is all white but Baymax has charm and brings much of the humour through the voice of Scott Adsit. When the lab is destroyed and burned down, Tadashi dies while trying to rescue the head professor. Now some masked villain has stolen Hiro's ideas and is using them for a complex revenge scheme written well into a back story. Directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams and aided by a clever screenplay with a brilliant ending where self sacrifice opens the door to life and opportunity. Baymax is a hilarious character bent on preserving life as he is programmed. Hiro is so bent on revenge that he loses focus on what's important as well as how Baymax was programmed. Other characters are unfortunately flat from Tadashi to the seemingly young aunt whom they live with, to the professor, to the interchangeable nerds who create their own superpowers but fail as personalities. The heart of the film is what Baymax is programmed with. He is a health care companion and reminds us that despite loss and setbacks, life eventually leads to greater and grander scales.

","Today I went to see Big Hero 6 with some friends. It's based on a weird Marvel comic of the same name and it's pretty good. I saw it in 3D too which I couldn't quite know if made it more engaging. The movie takes place in San Fransisco and is about a kid genus Hero. He makes robots as well as his brother which made a robot that kinda looks like a balloon. I'm not going to mention much because I don't want to spoil the plot too much. The animation is amazing and the story can have some touching moments as well. Even some slight twists here and there too. At the end I was surprised that Man of Action helped make it. To those who don't know he made cartoons that tell a great story like Ben 10, Generator Rex, and Avengers: Earths Mightiest Heroes to name a few. Most of his work is on Netflix if you ever want to take a look at them. Anyway it's a pretty good movie from Disney and Marvel. Almost up to par with Guardians of the Galaxy for comic adaptations so far. Anyway it's a good movie and the balloon robot is pretty caring and kind too."

","My almost 6 year old son was very excited to see this movie. He loves robots, superheroes, sci-fi (especially Star Wars and Transformers) and Disney/Pixar. He was confused and scared by the amount of death and destruction. I think it may be because the movie seems so much more realistic than others. The animation is very life-like and unlike Wreck it Ralph/Incredibles/The Lego Movie, etc, the setting, while futuristic, isn't cartoonishly fantastic, which I think makes the character's grief, fear and anger seem very intense. We had to leave the theater early.

Paired with a bright, friendly sense of style and a spacious, unique world that's loaded with fun little surprises, it's a visual and conceptual triumph.

","Big Hero 6, based on one of those small time Marvel superhero teams no one has ever heard of, is Disney's first foray into moving some of its acquisitions into its animated movie canon. Marvel was a really big purchase on their part and it makes sense that they would want to utilize their newly acquired intellectual property in some capacity.<br/><br/>And they chose a really small-time Asian themed group with almost zero fan base. Which was exactly the right choice. They still got to play with Marvel themes and styles without being tied to the expectations the fans had built with the success of Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie was allowed to swim or sink based upon its own merits. And, I'm glad to announce that we have a swimmer.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 bets upon many of Disney's known strengths. To be specific, the visuals are fantastic, the family relationship between the two brothers is unbelievably strong, the characters are phenomenally creative and the whole story has a good feel of an adventure driving it. Hiro is a young child prodigy, who has gotten a bit cocky because ordinary life really offers no struggle for him. That is until his big brother Tadashi introduces him to his university, and for the first time Hiro is truly challenged to achieve something just beyond his considerable grasp. And then tragedy strikes.<br/><br/>Though, to be fair, it's not a perfect film. The villain is pretty weak, first of all. You can easily guess who they're going to be and from there it feels pointless and pandering. Plus, while the team Hiro puts together, the whole Big Hero 6, is nice and all, I don't think that we really get to know any of them. They are a collection of quirks and nothing more. Hiro is fully fleshed-out, as is Baymax, his robot assistant, but none of the rest are.<br/><br/>Still, it's a solid superhero film, visually gorgeous beyond belief and the first act is some of the strongest stuff Disney has ever done. Easily recommended."

Alas, now I knew that I would have seen it because it was Disney animation, not because it was a superhero movie. Big Hero 6 does feature some formidably dazzling action and an interesting array of characters, with some well-executed humor for a superhero movie (who knew that squeaky air releases could sound so hysterical?), but it suffers from being ""a casserole of other movies' ideas"" as CinemaSins pointed out.

"Ofisil8-850-238679","7","0","0","22 October 2015"," Disney's first superhero-themed film is no more, no less, a rough diamond
","A typical fanboy/hater behavior in review sites is to give 1s and 10s on a whim, although that's rarely fair, like in Big Hero 6, where that behavior became the norm in IMDb, while it's just a pretty good animated movie, that could undoubtedly be a lot better. The story revolves around Hiro Hamada, a young tech genius who wants to find the one that killed his older brother Tadashi, and all this with the help of the later one's college friends, and, most importantly, his recently completed science project, a cute medical assistant robot named Baymax, whose deadpan reaction to everything around him is simply hilarious. Disney is certainly not an expert in the superhero field. In fact the best superhero title of the company was actually developed by Pixar, and it was none other than the critically acclaimed The Incredibles, however, it's first tread into the genre resulted in something very good.<br/><br/>Now, while a great film, it's just not worthy of the golden medal. Why? For starters, while all its aspects are well-implemented, they seem to never fully embrace their potential. Case in point, the overall look of the movie. The animation is simply flawless, the character design is very good, the background extremely detailed, and so on, and yet, it's all forgettable; like the superhero costumes of the gang, which look great and all, but also far from iconic enough to go down in history. The same goes with the pacing. The first – and mostly comedic - 30 minutes are as fine-tuned as possible, with each scene seamlessly leading to the next, and with not a single millisecond thrown into waste. From there on, however, it's a bit of a letdown.<br/><br/>The film never gets bad or anything, but it could use some work – especially two out of the three available action segments, which look cool, but lack that extra something. The biggest strength of Big Hero 6, however, are its characters. For starters, Baymax is not just another obligatory cute-and-funny Disney sidekick, but the backbone of the plot, since, besides being a great tool for comedy, he also serves as the connection between Hiro and his dead brother, making sure that he is never forgotten throughout this adventure. Additionally, while Tadashi has been criticized by professionals as a ""bland, hunky dude"" that has a useless death scene, he is actually a genuinely kind and extremely likable character that serves as Hiro's father figure in a very good way, and whose death (let's get ready for some fanboy flame), is quite possibly more effective than the death of Mufasa, which, frankly, never left much of an impression to me.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the theme of loss is not explored adequately here, and the same goes for the rest of the good stuff. Hiro's new friends are fantastic, and each one's personality trait adds much to the comedic aspect of the movie when they decide to appear on screen, that is, because this is mostly about Hiro and his inflatable buddy. In conclusion: if I were to describe Big Hero 6 in one sentence, I would say that it's more like a pilot episode of something much bigger than this. In many ways it is very similar to The Incredibles, and in some aspects (mostly the comedy), much better, however it feels incomplete, while Pixar's masterpiece does not. That isn't to say that it should be avoided, though, since the disappointment stems not from how bad it is, but from how much better it could be."

","Hiro Hamada is a young robotics genius in San Fransokyo. He spends his time in underground robot fights. Hiro's brother Tadashi takes him to the robotics team at his university mentored by professor Callaghan and shows him his inflatable medical robot Baymax. To get onto the team, Hiro creates a swarm of microbots. It impresses sleazy businessman Alastair Krei and he offers to buy them. Hiro refuses and then a fire engulfs the convention center. Both Callaghan and Tadashi are presumed dead. Using Baymax and a leftover microbot, Hiro discovers a masked man has copied vast numbers of his microbots. With Tadashi's friends and Baymax, they battle the masked man.<br/><br/>This is a fun superhero animated movie. The colors are brilliant and the animation is top-notch. It's full of action and it's emotionally dense. Hiro is a reasonable lead. The rest of the team is even better. They are a memorable diverse group. Baymax is super cute. The villain is where the movie falls down a little. While the masked man looks cool, the twist reveal leaves a lot to be desired. There are a lot about the identity of the villain that doesn't make sense. I'm not going to comment further about that so as to not spoil anything. This is still a solid superhero origin story."

Everybody has lost somebody and everyone has felt that pain of losing someone; people have honestly wanted to exact revenge like Hiro wanted to. <br/><br/>There are also a lot of clichés throughout the film, but honestly what movie has no clichés whatsoever. Every single movie has a cliché somewhere; some more than others. It has the cliché of parents dying and meeting the new person that makes them happy after their grief. The clichés honestly made the movie much cuter.<br/><br/>If you look at the movie in an open minded way you'd realize that the robot, Baymax, is gaining real emotions in a way. Hiro is realizing that even when someone is gone they're always in his heart. There are good symbolizing messages in the movie and that's what I fell for.

","Since their merge in 2009, it was but a matter of time before Marvel and Disney made their own animation movie. Big Hero 6 is completely produced by Disney (with some members of Marvel's creative team), but the story is based on a Marvel Comics superhero team. This is the 54th official Disney Animation Studios film and thereby following last year's Frozen. Unfortunately, Big Hero 6 is too much Wreck-It Ralph (which I didn't particularly like) and too little Tangled or Frozen (which I fairly enjoyed). The Japanase manga iconography in an American production is probably the most interesting aspect of this film which takes place in the fictitious San Fransokyo. Besides that it was quite funny and had some truly interesting moments, but in the end it was all too conventional and missed the Disney components I like most (songs, a fairy tale atmosphere, talking animals or creatures,...). I understand there's a new generation of kids who are more acquainted with superheroes, computer games, flashy new technologies and the likes, but this movie sometimes feels like propaganda for Silicon Valley and that I can do without. The post-credits scene seems like a reference to the Marvel habit for announcing a sequel, but as far as I know I don't think this'll be the case any time soon. Hopefully Disney's next feature will be more my cup of tea again."

","Thought I'd write a mini review of this film since I heard it got mixed reviews. I'll just break things out to a few points to make it easy. <br/><br/>Presentation: The film presents itself as a super hero film hinged on the wings of a ""can do"" attitude for aspiring intellectual folk. While I didn't care much for the perpetuation of the somewhat negative ""nerd"" theme, the film does go to a little bit of a length to show ""nerds"" as just as cool as anyone. The fusion of San Francisco and Tokyo was interesting. There's heartfelt moments, a few chuckles, but the overall delivery was fairly average.<br/><br/>Plot: There isn't too much to the plot. Main protagonist suffers tragedy, goes after ""villain"" in an effort to make sure the lost life means something and is not forgotten. Along the way, our antagonist goes through stages of emotion, including loss, anger, sadness, and elation. The formulaic plot is nothing new, but the robotic component to the 6 making up ""Big Hero 6,"" is what makes the film stand apart. The big guy is just lovable. I found myself grinning from ear to ear watching his actions and character development. Above I surrounded villain with quotes. Why you say? I didn't really consider the main antagonist a villain, simply due to the fact he wasn't out to get everyone, destroy the world, or generally cause random harm to people. While his actions were wrong, he didn't go all ""son of the Green Goblin"" and wreck havoc on the city. Like our main protagonist, he was hurt by someone, and harboured anger, instead of showing restraint. Hiro actually came close to being the exact same thing, if it wasn't for the heartfelt video Baymax plays for him after his first encounter with Dr. Callaghan. Overall, the plot is predictable, but fun for everyone.<br/><br/>Visuals: Nothing too spectacular, but the animation was done well for the style of the film. Emotions were projected well, and details were thought out around the city. Decent job here.<br/><br/>Characters: Most characters get little time in the realm of character development, aside from Hiro and his brother. While we get to meet several other people, we don't get to see their background all that much, but that is quite alight. Baymax is the obvious star, and without him, the film would have felt much more flat. I hope I wasn't the only one who seemed confused by the seemingly odd switch-on-a-dime English/Asian inflections Honey had. It's pretty noticeable when she speaks Hiro's name. Other than that, pretty standard affair of rag-tag bunch, with flat villain-type. <br/><br/>I was fairly pleased with the film, but it's nothing to shout home about. It has charm for the kids, and some good imagination, but I felt they could have done a whole lot more with the plot. At times I felt like I was watching The Incredibles, but with a different cast. The overall experience is worth a viewing, and a buy if you have kids, or are a kid at heart."

","The first animated venture from Walt Disney studios that sees them unleash some of their Marvel material, Big Hero 6 is most certainly a young child's fantasy come to life (and a parent's wallet emptying nightmare, the film was 2014 largest animated earner at the Box Office) and an often inventive experience, yet it's also a strangely hollow and instantly forgettable colour filled adventure that isn't even a touch on last year's more deserving Best Animated Feature Oscar nominee How to Train Your Dragon 2.<br/><br/>A big problem for the ""big"" film is that is just doesn't do enough to make us really care for any of the characters and as all of us know it's not hard for an animated movie to make us care, they've been making us laugh, scared and yes even cry since the dawn of animation and Big Hero just can't really win us over in any of these stakes, even though at times the film feels as though it hits a new gear, only to be once more bought down by some below average storytelling and a finale so unoriginal even the little ones may find themselves starting nap time early. With a seen a million times before plot line and a seriously uninspiring villain, what makes Big Hero 6 worth your time is everyone's new favourite robot and some truly fantastic animation designs.<br/><br/>The lovable lump of huggable goodness that is Baymax the robot is the clear winner here in Big Hero 6. Baymax is both adorable and interesting (something that can't be said for lead whiz kid Hiro) and his animation design mixed with characterisation by Scott Adsit is a sight to behold. I'd go as far as to suggest that if Baymax was even half the creation he ended up as the film would've been far less popular. The other winning element of 6 is the fantastic design and animation work that sees Tokyo and San Francisco mould into one in the newly minted San Fransokyo. When the film sets flight through the streets or the skies above this city, 6 feels like a totally different film and a far more eventful one than it ends up being.<br/><br/>With a sluggish central story and some pretty tepid characters, bar a particularly awesome slacker college mascot in the form of T.J Miller's Fred, Big Hero 6 feels like another over-hyped Marvel adventure that is saved by a lovable robot and some visually arresting set pieces in a wonderfully designed futuristic city. Likely to be a favourite of young superhero loving boys in particular, Big Hero 6 is a sadly disappointing slice of CGI that for most of us will be utterly forgettable.<br/><br/>2 and a half fist pumps out of 5 <br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check into - <br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"
"misterphilipj","10","4","13","8 February 2015"," Silent sleeper film of 2015, perfect for kids and adults.
","This movie, believe it or not, is about to become the number one animated sci fi of all time, beating out wall-e. It will likely stay at the number two spot, but i know that it is still out in theaters, it is possible it just might pull through. I was shocked to learn this after seeing it because I hadn't heard much about it. No chatter from friends or family, no posts on Facebook, no ads on billboards, just one trailer I saw a few months back. <br/><br/>Well, I am glad that is has proved to be a rampant success at the box office, even though no one seems to be talking about it. The film deserves its spot as the number two domestic grossing animated sci-fi film, although it really doesn't have much to compare itself too. Looking at the list on box office mojo, Monsters vs Aliens, Lilo and Stitch, Chicken Little, Mr Peabody, and Meet the Robinsons fall behind it. As the list goes on, I see many movies that are more action than sci-fi, suggesting they had to push movies that don't belong on this list into this list. And where are films like Monsters Inc., Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs, and all the other mega hits that could fall into this genre? Possibly because they are more fiction than science fiction? <br/><br/>Even though there may be some missing from their classification, I am ecstatic that this film has done really well, hoping it opens the door for more future films that are more sci-fi than complete fiction. Promoting science, creativity, and intelligence as a desirable trait to our youth is something that we don't see enough of these days. When I was growing up, I wish I had been blessed with the opportunity to see movies promoting these core values, rather than the animated films in my youth which promoted acceptance of self and tolerance of others... I'd probably be a successful scientist by now :) <br/><br/>Overall definitely suggest the movie, humor had me laughing out loud and chuckling to myself throughout. There are some dry spots in the middle and drawn out scenes, but I really cared for all the characters and they didn't do any thing too cliché or over the top. Good for kids and fun for adults, teenagers should even love this movie since the main character is 14."
"acorrick","5","2","5","24 January 2016"," The absolute definition of average
","This movie has to be a prime example of of an average film. I have been forced to watch this movie about 3 or 4 times and can't see why people love this so much. Not even the majority of professional critics can see the why I dislike this film. Anyways, I'm going to go ahead and say that this film had wasted potential. An abundance of Morden day superhero flicks have been the exact same movie just with a differences and Big hero 6 had the chance to be unique but, it's the same thing we have been getting just with animation. Not only is the plot all too familiar however, the its also boring and predictable. I don't have problems with movies being predictable as long as it's entertaining but, like I said it's boring. The villain also sucks complete with a generic personality, generic motivation and a nonsensical plan (see hishe version of big hero 6 to see what I mean). Beside the kid named hiro the rest of the members of the team are cookie cutter cutouts. You got the tough girl, the geeky chick, the loser stoner guy and, the black guy who is just there for the sake of having an African American character ( without actually giving them a interesting personality). They serve Meryl as weak comic relief and aren't that interesting. I will give credit where credit is due, the animation is good though I have seen better making average. The comedy revolved around Baymax is pretty funny though it doesn't always make sense like how is somehow able to pull a lollipop out of thin dust. Overall Big Hero 6 is an average movie. In my opinion at least, if you like it then that's great."
"baroncoco","5","2","5","31 July 2015"," Cute movie, but yes, essentially a ripoff...
","Sorry, those who so vehemently protest that ""Big Hero 6"" was not a ripoff of ""How to Train Your Dragon"" -- in its core plot elements, it is. ""Big Hero 6"" is cute, no doubt, but the central elements -- the oddball but talented boy who has suffered loss and finds redemption in a creature or creation that is essentially innocent, but devoted to him, and who then forms a team of similarly young misfits who will use their individual talents to save their respective worlds from destruction at the hands of an angry super-creature whose motives are sympathetic but who has lost sight of those motives, or anything else but the desire to rule all he sees and inflict punishment -- well, that's really enough, although there's far, far more. I don't know why Lasseter didn't see it: moving the story to the world of high tech instead of the Middle Ages really doesn't change the basic elements. It's like updating Shakespeare or opera productions: ""Big Hero Six"" is interesting and fun, but does it have the heart and heartbreak of ""How to Train Your Dragon? Not by a long shot. They should have really caught the similarities and changed them and made the story and the movie their own. Bad move."

","I absolutely love this movie. It's cute, it's funny, it's adorable and it's sad. It has everything a good childhood movie needs. Even adults will like it. Baymax is my favorite character, and it's obviously because of how adorable and funny he is. He looks so squishy and I just want to hug him. When he died but came back, I almost started crying.<br/><br/>This movie is about Hiro and his brother's death. Hiro is extremely smart and after his brother dies, he and his brothers friends, along with their robot, Baymax, team up to track down the evil man who has stolen Hiro's invention.<br/><br/>Best part of the movie: When Baymax says or does anything.<br/><br/>Worst part of the movie: When Baymax dies.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Everyone.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous."
"lucasversantvoort","7","2","5","5 May 2015"," Entertaining, but nothing extraordinary
","Big Hero 6 is the most recent film by Walt Disney Animation Studios. By the way, don't you think it's interesting how we refer to them as 'Disney' films rather than looking at the writers and directors? After recent successes like Frozen, you can't blame people for considering these past years as symbolizing a second resurrection of Disney. Whether or not Big Hero 6 can be considered as befitting this remains to be seen We're introduced to the east meets west city of San Fransokyo where fourteen year-old Hiro Hamada (get it? Hirohero) spends his time partaking in illegal robot fights. His brother Tadashi and mother worry for him and his future. Tadashi casually introduces him to his friends in the robotics department of his university and Hiro is immediately entranced by the possibilities. Tadashi also shows him Baymax, a lovable, huggable robot who specializes in providing medical aid and know-how. Hiro decides to enroll and showcases his microbots during a convention, but that same night, a tragic accident (or was it an accident?) changes everything <br/><br/>If I was asked to sum up the film in a few words, it'd be 'fun, but decidedly mediocre.' Make no mistake, it's a competently made film, but it contains little to no real surprises. You've got the not-so interesting melodramatic plot, the comic relief, the sidekick, etc. Go Go Tomago is the silent female badass 'who don't need no man.' Fred is the self-aware comics nerd who sees everything as a materialization of his comic book fantasies. After being asked during a car chase why they're being attacked, he says: ""it's classic villain. We've seen too much!"" As for Honey Lemon, wellshe's just Honey Lemon. All I remember about her was that she was the only one who pronounced Hiro in a very Japanese way and that her purse was the source of her superpower. And Wasabi does have a few humorous moments, but he's mostly just the token black guy. If this all sounds demeaning, that's not my intention. The supporting cast is fun, but they're so underwritten. Instead, the film's more concerned (quite justifiably so) with Hiro and his relationship with Baymax which is fine, but it makes the rest of the crew feel like an afterthought.<br/><br/>The storyline's also quite simplistic. There's a tragic accident. Hiro teams up with the crew and chase the Big Bad who, of course, has his own highly emotional but still underwritten and uninteresting motives. And along the way Hiro learns some highly important life lessons. All in all, it's quite 'meh.' By far the best part is Baymax. There's not a moment that's not a success when he's on screen. The film makes perfect use of his design in all kinds of ways that remind us of the old days when physical comedy without any sound was all we had. It really emphasizes the strength of modern technology when there's so much detail in a few seconds that it's nigh impossible to keep track of it all. Perfect example is the short scene where Baymax tries to make his way to Hiro from the other side of the room. And of course, there's the fistbump scene which is probably the first thing people will quote to get their friends to see the film.<br/><br/>I also quite liked the messages for the kids spread out across the film. Of course, since feminist debates are becoming popular again (see GamerGate and so on) it's easy to see how Tomago is supposed to function as a typical Strong Female Character which is fine, but haven't we reached the point where this kind of stuff doesn't need verbal emphasis? I mean her catchphrase is an inversion of 'man up,' namely 'woman up.' I'm of the opinion that if your goal is to create strong female characters, then you should emphasize action not sex. If characters are badass, people will like them regardless of gender. Emphasize action, willpower and strength and all that instead of the female aspect. If Tomago's just doing cool stuff, the audience will be thinking, 'fuck yeah, Go Go's a badass!' But if you let her say lines like 'woman up,' the audience will be thinking, 'oh yeah, I see, she's intended as a female badass' which isn't what you want. On the other hand, we can add Tomago to the growing list of Disney 'princesses' who's still single by the film's end, so there's that. <br/><br/>One last thing I want to mention about Baymax is that he's defined by the desire to ensure Hiro's physical and emotional wellbeing. Even in stressful situations, when asked to do something, he'll ask if this will help Hiro's emotional state. This line is also very nicely used during a scene that emphasizes the pointlessness of revenge.<br/><br/>So, in the end it's Baymax and the little moral messages that make the overall disappointing story easier to swallow. Big Hero 6 doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it does enough things right for it to be fun watch. As for whether or not we'll still be talking about this film years from now"
"ninjafire336","8","3","10","28 February 2015"," Loved it but predictable
","Just went to see this movie today in the cinema with a couple of friends and all three of us cried. Definitely a story to watch when you're in a sad mood. does have a few laughs and is definitely a funny tale as well as a woeful one. The only thing I would say is it was quite predictable, especially when it came to guessing who the villain would be, although even then there was a slight twist which I didn't quite guess until it actually happened. Also it has a childish theme to it so I would only really recommend it to people who are into the Children and Family genre. Overall I think it was very well done, an emotional roller-coaster as some would say from beginning to end, and I would happily watch it again if I was offered the chance."
"r_massey","8","3","10","10 February 2015"," Weak plot but plenty of action, humour and emotional moments
","Revolving around a boy who suddenly befriends and takes a great liking to a superficial being amongst a generic group of friends, the plot of Big Hero 6 is considerably weak and cliché, subsequently leaving its plot twists predictable, therefore having very little impact on the viewer.<br/><br/>That being said, it is the tone and 'heart' of ""Big Hero 6"" that makes it such a thrill to experience. Even in the thick of the thin plot, its only major downfall, the film feels wonderfully fresh, especially with its fictional location of San Fransokyo, a bustling city that is comprised of awe-inspiring visuals, all thanks to the advances in animation, aiding to bring even the most generic characters just a little bit closer to real life. Whilst it can be easy to miss a lot of it when being immersed in the film, the attention to detail in the animation is wonderful and makes this film pop in a very vibrant and lively way that we have not seen in a Disney film before.<br/><br/>The humour, for the most part, is light-hearted and though not extremely witty, it is guaranteed to make you laugh at the innocent (and even not so innocent) jokes scattered throughout. This innocence is definitely present in the film's more emotional moments, which it handles with great delicacy and is one of the key factors in making ""Big Hero 6"" feel so human, making us able to relate to the characters even more and enjoy their story in the film's otherwise predictable plot line.<br/><br/>I have hammered this point excessively but while the plot is much too simple, the movie's execution is pinpoint and I believe that ""Big Hero 6"" succeeds in being the film it wants to be; containing the action usually found from a superhero movie genre but coupled with Disney's more magical and yet down-to-earth 'human' moments. The fresh take on the superhero genre and the beat followed in the tender 'heart' of the film will create a long lasting impression and inevitable love for the characters at the end of the cinematic journey, leaving you yearning for more.<br/><br/>""Big Hero 6"" is so close to being on par with Pixar's ""The Incredibles"" but that obviously does not mean that you shouldn't watch this film, I would highly recommend it."

"FilmMuscle","6","5","21","19 November 2014"," Disney's Latest Gorgeous, Yet Formulaic, Offering
","Despite any dissatisfaction I generally have with Disney's recent stream of films, they always deliver in the visuals department. There's no doubt that Big Hero 6 is absolutely visually beautiful, further pushing the boundaries of realistic animation. Everything from the subtle muscle movements to the utter skin complexion is ever more impressive. The vibrant colors of rainbow variety and the stunning attention to the setting's many details surely represent Disney's masterful technique and way of extravagance in animation. <br/><br/>The movie opens up with an intriguing first thirty minutes that exposes the audience to a fascinating world of battling mini-bots and a genius 13-year-old kid who gets accepted into a prestigious science university —a white kid with a Japanese name, for whatever reason. Well, actually, this totally fictional city is part of an apparently hybrid world that blends Tokyo with San Francisco—a world that's never explained in the story but only clarified by the filmmakers themselves. Anyway, Hiro (Ryan Potter) shares a very intimate and encouraging friendship with his older brother, Tadashi (Daniel Henney)—two brothers perfectly getting along in a Hollywood picture. Who knew that archetypes don't always have to play a part in these stories? Tidashi is another talented scientific mind who has created a personal healthcare assistant in the form of an intelligent, useful marshmallow- like robot named Baymax (Scott Adsit). It's only later that some very exceptional code programs this innocently-designed robot to suddenly transform into a ""superhero."" <br/><br/>As a matter of fact, Big Hero 6 does an outstanding job with character development—an outstanding job in properly fleshing out its multitudinous fun characters, especially in regards to turning Baymax into the sympathetic pet of the year and also giving life to a group of ""nerdy"" college kids who befriend Hiro along the way (all with their own distinct personalities, including T.J. Miller's usual dude-bro goofiness). Most of all, the story prioritizes the heartwarming dynamic between the kid in need of assistance, Hiro, and his new compassionate pet robot, Baymax. <br/><br/>With all that being said, the story is largely formulaic and unoriginal as we've come to expect from Disney's recent crop of storytelling. A checklist is practically floating around, checking itself off with every emotionally manipulative moment and primitive, predictable turn. ""Okay, now smile; now laugh; now tear up; and now smile again!"" The ending is also very deceivingly sad and ultimately misleading...not unlike what Disney has done with every one of their endings as of late, including the Marvel ones. Either stick with your route or go with an alternative one instead. <br/><br/>By now, it's become already apparent: gone are the mature, creative days of Pixar who consistently found a way to appeal both to adults and children, or even classic Disney who still had their inspired, magical tales to tell. Nowadays, you have predominantly juvenile comedy—solely consisting of body humor and outdated quips—that always gets the naively-minded mom and her exuberant child laughing off their seats. One can argue that Disney still makes entertaining pictures, but no way will I ever understand any adult that considers their animated work particularly humorous (like, say, the actually hilarious animated films we used to receive in Shrek or The Emperor's New Groove—I honestly think DreamWorks Animation just has a sharper sense of humor)."

","Whenever I watch movies on my own time, I typically like to pick ones that will help me prepare for the next film I will be seeing in theaters and reviewing for this column. Before ""Fury"" I watched some war movies, before ""Lucy"" I watched some action flicks, etc. I suppose I forgot to keep that in mind this week considering the three movies I watched most recently before ""Big Hero 6"" were ""The Conjuring,"" ""Interstellar,"" and ""The Godfather: Part 1."" So when an animated walking/talking inflatable white robot walked onto the screen, it was certainly a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>""Big Hero 6"" is advertised as and makes up the perfect movie to take your kids to this season. Focusing on an intelligent, inventive, 14-year-old prodigy name Hiro, ""Big Hero 6"" is a wonderful example of how heroes can come from anyone and anywhere. After losing a very close friend in an accident, Hiro and his newfound companion and best friend Baymax, a gentle healthcare robot who looks like what inflatable sofas are supposed to be, go on a search to try to figure out exactly what happened. By circumstance, they end up in the lair of an evil mastermind and, with the help of some friends, do their best to foil his evil plan while learning the importance of friendship along the way. <br/><br/>Young actor Ryan Potter provides the voice of Hiro, the hero of the story. His work was fine, nothing noticeable to criticize or give extra praise to, which is fitting with a lead character. The real credit for impressive voice work goes to Scott Adsit and his hilarious portrayal of the huggable robot Baymax. Even through an auto-tune-like filter, Adsit was able to give character lovable life. Many extra hilarious moments were given to us through Adsit's work, along with the very comical physical actions that were given to this talking balloon. T. J. Miller was another highlight of the film, as he was allowed to let loose with his character. Over the top at times, but overall very funny. James Cromwell, Jamie Chung, Damon Wayans Jr., Genesis Rodriguez, Maya Rudolph, Alan Tudyk, and Daniel Henney also lent their voices to the life of this film.<br/><br/>Between the two directors and three screenplay writers of this film, there are loved Disney credits such as ""Monsters Inc."" and ""Monsters University,"" ""Tarzan"", ""Cars,"" ""Meet the Robinsons,"" ""The Emperor's New Groove,"" and ""Mulan,"" along with others. An excellent team was put together to make this film, and with a storyline and character ideas like these, it would have been a surprise if this film had not turned out well. What I didn't expect though, was that it would turn out this well. The story was excellent, the messages were brief but good, the characters were hilarious, a level of emotion was achieved, and the score was fun, exciting, and different. Everything about this film made for an excellent ride, perfect for kids, and a top choice for parents forced to see a ""kid's movie."" <br/><br/>There were certain moments and ideas that I wished had been embellished even more. One of my favorite parts of the film was the invention of San Fransokyo: an ingenious crossover between interesting Japanese culture and standard, relatable American culture. The idea for this semi-fictional city was perfect, though I felt like they almost went halfway with it. It appeared as though the final creation of it wasn't a clever combination of the cultures, but rather that they took American culture and made only major things like names and structures Japanese. This is no way reflected on the final result of the film, but it is an area I would have enjoyed a little more thought.<br/><br/>Directors Don Hall and Chris Williams did a particularly excellent job of making this film unique. They were given a very stereotypical storyline and they created a world and characters that succeeded in standing apart. Along with having the classic superhero versus supervillain plot, ""Big Hero 6"" also features the current favorite 'unlikely friendship' story. Back in 2010, Dreamworks and Dean Deblois came out with ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" my personal favorite animated film and the 'unlikely friendship' idea created and perfected in an animated film. Hiro and Baymax provided extreme similarities to Hiccup and Toothless from ""Dragon,"" even to the point of having a relationship-bonding flight sequence. ""Big Hero 6"" could have very easily been called a copy of ""How to Train Your Dragon"" had it been done wrong. Thankfully, this film was executed very well, and we have a result that sets itself apart from the formula animated film that is made so often.<br/><br/>There were few flaws in this movie, other than that it was too short. When the credits began to roll, I would have been more than content to remain in my seat for another thirty minutes. A collective contribution of excellent animation, fun story, great score, and quality voice work. In the end though, the best part was the marshmallow. So as I walked out of the theater, I couldn't wait for the sequel.<br/><br/>I give ""Big Hero 6"" an 8.2/10"

The humor is simple and sweet. It makes you laugh and say ""Aww"" at the same time. Even the story is pretty touching. not to talk about San Fransokyo: a touch of pure genius and proof of great creativity. great animation, great effects, great voices, great feeling altogether! Then the first act finished. Big Hero 6 showed its Disney side by steering its plot towards the Knight, the Dragon and the Princess to be saved. A strongly stereotypical fairy tale that focused on the narration instead of making the best use of those awesome characters introduced in the first act. Real pity, because until then an Oscar wouldn't have been enough to reward the astonishing work done by the studio.

","There was an interesting cinematic juxtaposition that occurred on the weekend of November 6th, 2014.<br/><br/>Just as the silently sputtering and problematic Pixar announced yet another sequel, this time a pointless one to a masterpiece of a trilogy that ended perfectly, we see the Walt Disney Animation division deliver yet once again another surprisingly powerful and entertaining film. Continuing a quality streak that began with 2009's Princess and the Frog, Walt Disney Animation Studio has essentially created a second Renaissance that has delivered quality Oscar-winning films (Frozen) as well as a few surprises (Wreck-It Ralph). With Big Hero 6, we see a great animated film devoid of a love story or princesses that is full of humor, heart, action, and overall entertainment.<br/><br/>The Disney formula is alive and kicking in Big Hero 6, as we have the themes of heavy loss, the strong villain, the essential supporting cast that steals the show, and of course minimal surprises that doesn't deviate the movie too far from its main course of entertaining the kids and adults alike. And although the Disney formula prevents Big Hero 6 from reaching the necessary shock in your better comics and comic book inspired movies like The Incredibles, it's still a fun flick that becomes a nice departure from your recent influx of animated and superhero sequels.<br/><br/>Part of the requirements of making the ultimate comic book film includes a unique look and feel that distances itself from other works—whether it's the toxic dark Gotham City or mythological-laden Asgard. One of the best aspects of Big Hero 6 is how deep and engaging the world of San Francisokyo is, as the visual range of the city is just as expansive as the environments of recent Disney movies like Frozen, Tangled, and even Wreck-It Ralph. This gives the added visual flair to the chases and action sequences sprinkled throughout the two hours.<br/><br/>Just as spellbindingly good as the animation was, it was the powerful and quick-moving script that propels Big Hero 6 to the next quality level. Although it is based off of a Marvel comic, the adaptation is extremely loose, extremely watered-down, and toned down to appeal to a wider audience---while at the same time giving it a necessary dosage of likability that was absent in the original comic. The trio writing team crafted a screenplay that acts like an origin story but paces like a complete film. There just isn't enough time to give the correct amount of attention to the delightful supporting cast of characters (and its crafty anime-influenced villain) but luckily our well-rounded hero (aptly named Hiro) and his robotic pal have strong personalities, and a strong friendship to propel the movie forward. Beymax has layers of depth that the trailers and commercials could never convey.<br/><br/>Although the tropes and current financial strategies of the Disney company (and suddenly Pixar) prevents Big Hero 6 from truly reaching the stars (Because we all know what happens to successful Disney animated movies), we are still treated to a well-directed wholesome blend of comedy, drama, and action swirled around a cool comic book setting wrapped in a Disney bow. From beginning to end this film will entertain, will move you, will make you laugh, and will make you cry. Even if it's a few feet from reaching 1999-2009 sans-Cars Pixar level (then again, this epic run may not happen again from any film studio), Disney Animation is doing a fantastic job fully recovering from Eisner's attempted murder of the animation studio.<br/><br/>After spending years following in Pixar's footsteps, it looks like the Walt Disney Animation Studio has just about caught up."

","This movie is the perfect combination of laughter, fun, and emotion. Plenty of Disney feel trips to go around to start the emotional roller coaster but luckily Baymax is there to steal the show with his non- stop antics. This movie is fun for all ages. I went as an adult with my significant other and we both loved it. It's amazing how Disney has the ability to make you fall in love with robots (e.g. WALL-E, Beymax). Plenty of action and excitement for the kids. Lots of laughter for the adults. This movie has great character development and the special effects are out of this world. I highly recommend it and will definitely watch it again. This is one of my favorite movies of 2014 for sure."
"digitalbeachbum","5","10","57","17 February 2015"," I have mixed feelings about this movie
","I'm a very analytically person. So when I watch movies I often see things which people do not see. I also can not disconnect from what is rational or scientific. And with that I tend to ruin movies for myself and those who will listen to my observations.<br/><br/>The movie is entertaining. It has some cool, creative ideas. The animation was great and the characters were amusing. However that is where I stop liking the movie.<br/><br/>***With that being said you should not read any more of this review if you do not like spoilers.***<br/><br/>#1) spoiler - Make another mask/headband which is more powerful the original one. Since our hero character made the mini-bots he could make a more powerful band to control them. Or Hiro could have made a device to block or hack the head band. The bad guy would be wiped out in the first encounter. End of movie.<br/><br/>#2) Why did Hiro's headband fit Robert Callahan's much bigger head?<br/><br/>#3) Where did the teleporting device get the power from in the final scene?<br/><br/>#4) If the mini-bots had no power source, then the headband must have been a telekinesis amplifier. With that being said, the head band would need to be modified to work on Callahan.<br/><br/>There are other spoilers which ruin the movie for me too but there are too many to mention, such as the ending fight scene and the ""portal"" scene to the alternate dimension scene. All really flawed logically.<br/><br/>I have to agree with the others on the board who posted that the character development was extremely weak. This movie is more like Big Hero 1. It is all about Baymax. The other characters where weak and never developed. The villain was weak. The story line sucked.<br/><br/>Good for the family. 5/10 for the animation."
"SquigglyCrunch","7","3","11","28 April 2015"," Enjoyable but cliché
","Honestly, I loved big Hero 6. The characters were easy to love, the action was actually really fun to watch, and who can't love the marshmallow doctor/hero Baymax? However, this movie suffered from the usual clichés of modern movies and was very formulaic. We had our cliché cast of characters with a formulaic event set-up. Its extremely formulaic, but with a twist that I didn't see coming. The jokes in the movie are actually very well done. I found myself laughing several times throughout the movie. The characters, although quickly, are well-developed and even just by seeing what inventions they created you can tell what kinds of people they are. This is probably the best superhero movie I've seen recently. I've been very unimpressed with a lot of superhero movies lately, but this one takes the cake as the best one I've seen in the past year at least. Overall its a very enjoyable movie. If your looking to be critical, don't bother with it, but if you just want to watch something, then look no further than Big Hero 6."
"cruis9","7","3","11","20 March 2015"," Minor setbacks (spoils ending)
","Yesterday, my mother rented 4 movies. We watched them at night and Big Hero 6 was the third on the list. I'm not much of a night owl, so by the time we watched the movie I was groggy and tired.<br/><br/>So before I begin, let me just say that I may be biased with my review, as we all are. Certain aspects of my life at the moment have most likely affected the way I have seen and interpreted the movie, let alone my mental state at that moment.<br/><br/>Anyways, the movie was great. Children would love it.<br/><br/>However, I had a few minor problems with the movie: Hiro had just met those people and they were already considered friends. They were his brothers friends to begin with but now they are his. Within moments in fact. I understand that they are young but most people do not befriend every person they meet. Second, Tadashi (Hiro's brother) had a wish. He wanted to help the world with Baymax but Hiro fulfilled that wish in a different context.<br/><br/>Instead of replicating Baymax (in turn saving thousands), he chose to keep Baymax to himself. Granted, he did save people with Baymax but a group of 6 can only do so much in comparison to the replicas he could have made. <br/><br/>Now let me just say that I was sleep deprived, I was even waking and falling out of sleep at one point (sometime after the halfway point BUT I did watch the ending)So for someone who hadn't been fully awake, maybe you shouldn't take my word. I do plan to watch the movie again one day, just not today. Let me clarify this before I receive any complaints about this. I LIKE the movie, I just feel bothered by these MINOR things. (to me they are minor, I don't know about you) <br/><br/>Watch the movie and tell me what you think.

Everyone keep saying ""Mars Needs Mom"" is bad but I like it though. Its better than 'Big Hero 6"". The CGI animation is great as always, as expected from Disney but what lack is its story. Its just some plain story though, we can really predict what will happen next, who's the villain, who's gone. Its not exciting at all, then I think the big factor here is comedy, its really lack in sense of humour, its not funny at all, I don't even laugh a bit with fluffy marshmallow, weird Fred or confusing Wasabi. I think this one is really purposely made for kid only. We adult can enjoy ""Frozen"", ""Wreck-It-Ralph"" and ""Bambi"" but we can't take Big Hero 6 though. I mean not all of us because I think some adult still like this movie, but seriously with just one time viewing is enough for all of our life. Its OK."

It holds a 90% ""fresh"" rating, and I think that that is an accurate rating. (It should have been 100%, though. Who are these critics who caused it to be less than 100%? They need to see it again.) I will definitely see this again when it hits our discount theater, and then buy it on Blu-ray the day it comes out. This was apparently based on a Marvel comic, and I wish this movie great success, and hope this will convince Disney and Marvel to open the floodgates for more lesser-known Marvel properties.

","Hiro Hamada is a fourteen year old robot designer who is entering illegal robot fights rather than continuing his education then his older brother Tadashi takes him to the research lab at the university he attends. Hiro is immediately impressed and determines that he will go there too. To do this he demonstrates his 'microbots' at the science fair. He wows them and afterwards is approached by shady industrialist Alistair Krei but declines his offer to buy the microbots. As he leaves there is a fire and his brother rushes back in to save his professor, Robert Callaghan an explosion occurs and Tadash and the professor are apparently killed and the microbots destroyed. Hiro goes into a depression but later activates his brother's healthcare robot, Baymax. It then becomes apparent that the microbots weren't destroyed; they have been stolen by a masked man whose motives are unclear. Hiro determines to defeat the man. To that end he updates Baymax and turns Tadashi's friends, who are now his friends, into heroes. Together they uncover the identity and motives of the thief before the final stand-off.<br/><br/>If you think Disney animation means songs and princesses then this film will come as quite a surprise. It demonstrates that Disney can make an exciting, action packed film that isn't afraid to get quite dark at times. One might expect a murderous villain but seeing the hero go into a murderous rage was a surprise. The animation looks fantastic with amazing detail. The characters are really good; Hiro is a fine lead but it is Baymax the robot who steals the show; he is cute and funny without being twee. The supporting cast of characters are great to and their 'powers', actually hi-tech gear they have invented, are fairly original. The identity of the villain isn't exactly a surprise but his motivation is quite dark for a Disney film. The film has an ending that may reduce some viewers, children and adults alike, to tears even if we then get a 'happy ending' after. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody wanting exciting, animated, superhero action."
"Animated_Antic","9","1","2","28 August 2017"," A very exciting and funny adventure.
","Most famous computer animation studios have tackled an original superhero film. First Pixar did one with ""The Incredibles"", then DreamWorks did another with ""Megamind"", and now Disney Animation Studios has tackled the genre with ""Big Hero 6"". For those who don't know, Disney famously acquired the comic book publisher Marvel in 2009 giving them ownership to many famous superheroes. The team Big Hero 6 was one of them, however the artists decide to take a risk and make a loose adaptation of the heroes by making an original story and also redevelop the characters. That risk sure payed off. This movie is fantastic. It's both heartwarming and thrilling which is what I expect from an animated superhero movie.<br/><br/>In the futuristic city of San Fransokyo (which is a combination of Tokyo and San Fransisco), fourteen year old Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) has recently graduated high school and has been participating in illegal robot fights. Being a genius in robotics, his older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) wants him to enroll in the Institute of Technology. The only way to get in, however, is to create an invention that show his talents and also impress the head of the institute, Professor Callaghan (James Cromwell). After impressing him with microbots, Hiro is accepted. However, his happiness is short lived as a fire breaks out in the institute killing both Callaghan and Tadashi. Weeks later, Hiro accidentally activates his late brothers healthcare robot Baymax (Scott Adsit) and also finds out a mysterious person wearing a Kabuki mask has stolen his microbots and is planning to attack. After Tadashi's friends Fred (T.J. Miller), GoGo (Jamie Chung), Wasabi (Damon Wayans, Jr.) and Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez) also discover the secret, the six decide to try to take down the mysterious Kabuki mask person with high tech superhero gear which results in some of the movies thrilling moments. It may sound confusing from what I wrote, but once you watch it you'll find that it's easy to follow.<br/><br/>The story is what I love most about this movie. Despite being a loose adaptation, the film felt very original as if the people at Disney and not Marvel created the characters. The story also had some heartwarming moments involving Hiro and Baymax. The friendship between the two is genuine and you really feel for both of them. The animation is also spectacular. The cityscape of San Fransokyo was really appealing to the eye in my opinion. It didn't look like any city I had seen in any animated movie I have seen. I also think that action is very well handed which makes the film lead to a very exciting climax. The characters are also very likable, partially Baymax. He leads to some of the films funniest and emotional moments. I think the only other animated robot character that was both funny and emotional was Wall-E. As for the other characters, they're also a lot of fun. They have very relatable personalities and also have funny moments which is what I want to see in a Disney movie.<br/><br/>""Big Hero 6"" is not only a great family movie, it's a great superhero movie as well. With it's humorous, emotional, and thrilling moments, it will probably be remembered as one of the best animated super hero movies. Considering that most superhero movies nowadays are mostly Marvel and DC films, it felt refreshing to watch an original superhero film with original characters and an original story. I really enjoyed it. Also, for those Marvel fans, Stan Lee does have a cameo appearance in the film. You just have to stay after the credits to watch it."
"chrispschuch","10","1","2","27 August 2017"," My review on Big Hero 6
","This is going to be my review on A the best Disney movie in my opinion. Big Hero 6 is one of the greatest movies ever made in my opinion. The movie starts off with A little robot fight made by some people doing some robot fight to get lots of money. The main character Hiro has beaten the the guy that is good at mini robot fighting. Hiro & his brother got in trouble & now back home. A couple days later they went to some college like place where people can do advance science stuff & make new stuff. Hiro's brother made A robot named Baymax who is nice & recovers people who are hurt. He is one of the best characters in this movie in my opinion. We barely see inflatable robots in sci fi movies & all of this stuff. Hiro invites A little things called Micro bots that are small but million & million of them work together. But someone stole Hiro's invite & made A lot of them for himself & they are trying to figuring out all of the crimes & all of the Micro bots. Until Hiro & his friends become heroes & will defeat the villain. But i'm not really going to tell everything else because I don't want to spoil it sense they are people that haven't seen this movie. But the animation is great, the voice acting is cool, the quality runs well, everything else about this movie is fun to watch. I give this movie A 10/10. You should be proud for yourself's Disney."

The east and west coast mash up of San Fransokyo combines to make such a spectacular scenery, that the city may as well be a character to the film.<br/><br/>The cast is also fun to watch. The cast is truly dramatic, whether you are precise like Wasabi, positive like Honey Lemon or just a guy who loves media like Fred. It still be a great Disney movie of all time. I don't care what the critic reviews say this movie is a true masterpiece. Showing that no matter what happens in your life you need to do whats right. Also introducing the most lovable character in movie history.

Honestly, this would have been a tremendously better film if they didn't shoehorn it into a team superhero film. I know the Avengers and upcoming DC BS was all the rage just before they came up with this movie but just because it worked for something else doesn't mean it is going to work for you. So long-story short, this would have been a classic if they just kept it the bot and the boy. The film is about a young tech- head who lost is brother but found his robot and became part of a superhero team in a very rushed fashion to get the bad guy using his tech. Don't get me wrong, I like the film but it could have been, should have been better."

","Although it all starts with a heartbreaking story, that would make a grown-up sob, Big Hero 6 manages to spin it all around and make it a great story about almost all emotions a human being experiences through life. The best thing about this movie is that it manages to find a way to make you laugh even in strange circumstances. Baymax is one one the funniest, dearest and lovable characters ever created. Also, although it is a non-human character it manages to depict all the qualities of mankind as well as what can go wrong if ""used improperly"". All the experiences the group of friends are going through in order to fix the wrongs in the world, as well as the family experience (even more powerful message since it is not the perfect/standard family type) shows us that through love and determination everything can be achieved. I highly recommend this movie to both children and grown-ups."

","Are we soon coming to a time when the truly life-like actions and representations of objects by animated films are taken for granted? I hope not.<br/><br/>""Big Hero 6"" tells the story of a young boy and his robot,amazing ""cinematic effects"" created via animation. These animators repeatedly fool the eye into thinking the images are created through the lens of a camera. To further this illusion, the point of view is what one might see through a camera. It is almost tempting to compliment the camera's movement, until you realize there is no camera. In the same vein, I love the ""shots"" through translucent (but not clear) glass, the slow-motion, and the depth of field created by ""unfocused"" objects in the background.<br/><br/>The overall style of the film is reminiscent of anime and classic sci-fi. And it starts with a mystery that our hero (Hiro) cleverly--with the aid of a clue that is genius in its simplicity and design--sets out to solve.<br/><br/>Time and again, the characters look and behave in very human ways. And since I am not yet ready to just accept such technical artistry as de rigeur, I say ""Bravo!"" If you liked ""The Incredibles"" or ""Wreck-it-Ralph"", you will probably like ""Big Hero 6""."

","Absolutely wonderful film from the Disney studios! I can't say enough great things about this movie. Heartwarming! Stunning! Incredible! AWESOME! This was one of the best movies I have seen in years.<br/><br/>This movie had some of the best character development I've seen. All the characters got along very well and helped Hiro when he needed it. I guess if I only had one complaint though, it is that poor Fred came across as a big weirdo to his friends. He invites them over to his place at one point for a hideout. They are very apprehensive to enter first wondering what is on the other side. Once they find out he lives in the lap of luxury everything is fine. I often wonder how they would have treated him if he was poor. One of the friends says, ""I thought you lived under a bridge."" Okay, so maybe that was my only complaint of the film.<br/><br/>We even get to experience heartache with 2 deaths in the film. This movie had me laughing, smiling and crying the whole time. I was intrigued from the very beginning and did not lose interest. When I am able I am going to buy this movie on DVD. This was fantastic! If you haven't seen this film yet, please do!

","I think it would be so ideal to have a robot like Baymax to cheer us up when we are down. What made me want to see this film alone was of course the Sky Movies Christmas advert. I don't think America or outside the UK would know who are Sky Movies. Well anyway for the ones who don't recognise the ad, Sky Movies shows a little girl named Rosie who won't eat her Brussel sprouts so she decides to hide under her table. She then goes into different movies such as Cinderalla (2015) , Night of the museum, Big Hero 6 and the Hulk. She just throws the sprouts in the movies so she would be able to watch her movies. Yeah check it out because I'm not really a good storyteller lol.<br/><br/>Back with the film, I thought it was kinda stupid that Disney just killed off the main characters brother. He really would do great with the team id he didn't have to die so early. I find that Disney loves killing off good characters in their current films nowadays. It's not really fair in my opinion but there ya go! I really liked the animation on this, it looked very well like the Frozen movie did. The soundtrack was brilliant too, I love how Fall Out Boy had a song there attached to the film. That's awesome!<br/><br/>Even though not my favorite Disney movie, it was good!"

There are also dark sides to this movie and the emotional roller coaster is very real here.<br/><br/>Overall, a solid superhero movie that has all the components that will make every viewer happy.

","Don't worry! This movie definitely lives up to the standard Frozen set last year. Marvel and Disney do a great job at creating a movie that's both heartwarming and action packed. This movie reminds me of all the great Marvel movies, all the great Disney movies, and How to Train a Your Dragon all combined into one. With the heart of Frozen (not the Frozen one), this movie tells the tale of 2 brothers...sound familiar? The characters were charming, funny, and lovable all at the same time, especially Baymax. The animation in this movie was just gorgeous especially the underwater scene. Congrats to the whole Disney and Marvel team on a great follow up to your masterpiece! ""On a scale of 1 to 10"", I give this movie 8 stars! Oh and make sure you wait after the credits for an extra scene. I mean it is a Marvel movie too right?"

","Big Hero 6 is a film for children but adults will easily enjoy watching this animated superhero action-comedy too. In fact, it's so entertaining that it's easy to overlook that the story is practically incoherent. The typical lessons about sacrifice and the importance of forgiveness seem forced as well. But the characters are a distinct and likable group. There's been much talk about how cute and lovable Baymax (Scott Adsit) is. And Baymax is certainly a clever creation. Considering the robotic voice of this warmhearted machine it's a big success that Adsit never makes this simple character seem repetitive or boring. Baymax is such a likable character that one genuinely begins to care about the robot long before the film is over. The other characters, however, are just as interesting. It's a formula of appealing to just about everyone in the audience. I mean, of course, the Big Hero 6 team. The genius boy Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) suffers a big loss and goes on a compelling mission to find out what happened. With him are Fred (T. J. Miller), GoGo Tomago (Jamie Chung), Wasabi (Damon Wayans, Jr.) and Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez). They're cool characters. In the hands of the voice cast and directors Don Hall and Chris Williams they're often funny too. In addition, the comedy is surprisingly clever, going above what's usually shown in animated fare these days. Since the film is an origins story it's actually very similar to other superhero movies if you take a closer look at what's happening. But because of the setting, comedy and action (let's also not forget the fitting music by Henry Jackman) it's easy to overlook this. The city of San Fransokyo is a futuristic metropolis that just has to be seen. Like everything else in the film it's beautifully designed. The colors are bright and the designs are fresh. I guess it's no secret that the filmmakers drew inspiration from Japanese anime and Japanese culture. John Lasseter, who's been overseeing the projects of Walt Disney Pictures for years now, is known for being a fan of Japanese animation. He's honestly managed to improve the quality of Disney films. Bolt (2008), Tangled (2010), Wreck-It-Ralph (2012) and Frozen (2013) were all terrific, memorable releases. Big Hero 6 is no different, and it may be the craftiest, most appealing release yet. I recommend it."

Along the way Hiro learns to never confuse Justice with Revenge and learns with the help of his friends into learning how to become a real Hero My kids loved it. The movie was full of comedic moments and some sad moments that truly wrench at the heart. But the more important aspect here is the life lessons you learn along the way. You don't need a inflatable robot or powers to be a hero. You can find that power inside you. The movie was wonderfully done the animation was perfect and flawless.

"Aerora","10","5","27","10 November 2014"," Beautiful, touching, and larger than life.
","As someone who loves animated films, I was not surprised when Big Hero 6 rocketed to the top of my list of movies to look forward to this year. I'm very please so say I was not disappointed. This is the story of a 14-year-old robotics prodigy named Hiro Hamada, his science- loving friends, and--of course--Baymax, a lovable, inflatable robot whose only concern is with the care and well-being of others.<br/><br/>One of the first things of merit is the way the film looks. The vibrant city of San Fransokyo may occasionally make you forget it isn't real. The opening shot is particularly beautiful, and a great way of letting the audience know they're in for some gorgeous scenery. The animation itself throughout the film is quite stunning, too. The subtle movement-related details enhance the experience even though it isn't right up-front.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie really, truly stand out. There's plenty of diversity--not only in race, but in body types, interests, personalities, and dialogue. The Big Hero 6 become a team of people all distinctly different from one another, but that doesn't hinder their teamwork or the care they have for each other. While you don't get to find out too much about the stories of Wasabi no Ginger, Honey Lemon, Gogo Tomago, and Fred, they're bound to stick with you regardless. <br/><br/>The heart of the film is Hiro's relationship with Baymax, and how that develops during some rather difficult times. These two are written beautifully, and in a way that stayed true to who they were even while so much happened and changed. There's a good chance you'll get a bit teary-eyed at least once (or twice).<br/><br/>The story is also hilarious and action-packed, but perhaps one of the most meaningful parts of this film is the themes it deals with: loss, grief, and the importance of mental health as well as physical health.<br/><br/>Overall, Big Hero 6 is a movie I can't wait to watch over and over again. There could be multiple Oscar wins in its future, too. Highly recommended--you will be very satisfied with your care."

","People haven't been cutting a lot of slack for this film despite its sticking to its PG rating (unlike some of the violence in Tangled or Wreck-it-Ralph) and being supremely awesome.

"Sergeant_Tibbs","6","6","35","23 January 2015"," Sweet at times, but reeks of bandwagoning and cashgrabbiness.
","Disney seems to be having a third renaissance at the moment. Tangled may have relatively flew under the radar, known mostly for its notoriously ballooned budget, but it was a very pleasant surprise. Wreck-It Ralph is the best Disney film since the 1960s, and everyone knows the immaculate success of Frozen. Now that Pixar have taken a stumble, they finally compete with their close contemporary cousins. Now comes quietly Big Hero 6 with a soft landing rather than a loud boom. Are they trying to repeat the legs of Frozen? Nevertheless, it's a swing and a miss as far as trying to implement another film into pop culture despite their different appeals. Big Hero 6 is far too derivative of its inspirations from the comic book movies these days. Instead, it reeks of bandwagoning and cashgrabbing on the Marvel success to sell toys and make video games. It feels like the only reason it's a San Francisco/Tokyo hybrid is to sell Japanese tickets. Why can't they commit to one instead of shamelessly compromising?<br/><br/>The intentions of the film are obvious, it's trying to get kids high on science and innovation, but it does it on the standards of Saturday morning cartoons. Granted, I did like the lead character a lot more than I expected, though it's annoying to have him be more magician than inventor. The film's emotion works and it's very sweet, though nothing new. Unfortunately I found its poster boy Baymax more irritating than endearing. Perhaps it's because I've watched too much 30 Rock and I'm used to Scott Adsit as Pete, but the conviction didn't work for me besides a few moments. Also the writers only seemed to put effort into implementing contradictions for two of the sidekick characters, incidentally both male. However, the pleasure of Disney is the detail in the nuances, an aspect which really improved in Frozen and is demonstrated here tenfold. Big Hero 6 is still an entertaining and ultimately poignant way to spend an hour and a half, but it doesn't live up to Disney's new standards.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Big Hero 6 is a cute animated film that will make you smile, even if it has one of the most unoriginal and worn out plots ever to exist in film.<br/><br/>Set in the far future in the city of San Fransokyo is the setting for the Disney film Big Hero 6.<br/><br/>Hiro Hamada is fourteen years old, he is also a prodigy. That is a bit of an understatement – he is a super wiz kid genius with a knack for robotics who graduated high school at the age of thirteen and even for the future, that's impressive.<br/><br/>Hiro is smart which means one thing – he is bored and getting into trouble! His older and smart brother Tadashi wants to keep Hiro out of trouble. So, he piques Hiro's interest by showing him his work, a super high tech and innovative science lab at a top university. While there, Tadashi shows Hiro his latest creation: an inflatable marshmallow shaped health aide robot named Baymax. After a series of events, Hiro must turn to Baymax for help and in the process befriends the robot and a team of Tadashi's friends.<br/><br/>The star of Big Hero 6 is Baymax and only Baymax. The robotic puff ball that is only concerned about its owners well being is the only original device in the entirety of Big Hero 6. He is sweet, funny and his character dynamic plays well with the protagonist Hiro's predicament. It's like the film's creators had an Idiot's Guide to Animated Films and followed the How-To in Chapter 3. The characters, the story, erry-thing is done and done better in an earlier animated film.<br/><br/>Of course, children won't notice these glaring flaw of the film though the adults who pay for the tickets will and it will suck the fun out of the experience.

"DareDevilKid","6","6","39","1 February 2015"," The Robot, Baymax, is the Only Reason to Watch ""Big Hero 6""
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 2.5/5 stars<br/><br/>Given how advanced computer animation has developed and continues to develop, and considering that Walt Disney, the king of animation, now owns the film rights to nearly all of the Marvel Universe, it's a bit surprising that this is the first big-budget Marvel superhero animated film to be produced. Perhaps because it's something of an experiment, they chose to do it with a more obscure title like ""Big Hero 6"".<br/><br/>The story is based only loosely on the comic book group. For instance, in the comic, Baymax (the lovable inflatable robot featured on all the posters and marketing material) is a synthetic bodyguard capable of metamorphosing into a dragon, created by 13 year old computer genius Hiro, using the brain engrams of his dead father. In the film, Hiro is still a teen prodigy, but Baymax is built by his older brother as a medical robot. Hiro, who graduated high-school early, decides to go to the same university as his older brother where he hopes to join the robotic department, which his brother and an eccentric group of students inhabit.<br/><br/>A fire breaks out at a science exhibit for university hopefuls where Hiro is demonstrating his own invention called Microbots. His brother and a professor die in the fire. This kick starts the plot into motion when later a super-villain emerges using the same microbot technology, and Hiro gathers his fellow robotic students together to form a superhero team. The central mystery, which is merely identifying the villain, is the film's weakest aspect. It's pretty obvious who he is. As in a lot of mysteries, you simply have to look for the minor character played by (or voiced by in this case) a popular actor.<br/><br/>A computer-animated mash-up of Japanese and American cultures (it takes place in San Fransokyo - a dream rendering of San Francisco and Tokyo), ""Big Hero 6"" is a friendship tale and an action flick that winds up lost in translation. The story initially centers on Hiro (voiced by Ryan Potter), a kid genius, and his relationship with Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit), a puffy bag of air who resembles an un-toned version of the Michelin Man. Baymax is a lovable, hugable inflatable robot — who doesn't want one of those? — and he belongs in a movie more lovable and hugable than ""Big Hero 6.""<br/><br/>The world already has plenty of superheroes, of course, and ""Big Hero 6,"" falters as a superhero movie. The relationship between Baymax and Hiro provides enough to play with, and ""Big Hero 6"" didn't need to turn into a loud, cluttered action film, but that's where the story goes. Hiro teams up with the previously-mentioned group of brainiac students, and convinces them to use their amateur inventor skills to become superheroes themselves, so that they can take on an evil genius in a Kabuki mask who is threatening, naturally, to take over the world.<br/><br/>In our pro-nerd, tech-heavy, superhero-obsessed culture, ""Big Hero 6"" hits on all manner of popular themes. It favors brains over muscles and celebrates the power of friendship — good messages, all. But the big heroes who make up the ""6"" feel like bit players instead of full-fledged characters. Only the slacker-type Fred (voiced by T.J. Miller) stands out; the others aren't memorable enough to even be remembered once the credits start rolling, leave alone become popular enough to merit their own action figure molds. They're like the Avengers' not-very-interesting nieces and nephews.<br/><br/>Directors Don Hall (co-director of 2011's ""Winnie the Pooh"") and Chris Williams (co-director of ""Bolt"") start strong, but ""Big Hero 6's"" inconsistent script builds to an overly busy, standard action movie climax that detracts from the simple story about a boy and his cuddly robot pal. The action, too, is a letdown - even though the visuals are great, but that was expected from Disney - and the big battle and chase sequences call for some major suspensions of disbelief, even by animation movie standards. Also, since the tone is kept light, there's never much of a true sense of danger, adding to the film's many problems.<br/><br/>""Big Hero 6"" does make strides in terms of diversity and setting, and it's refreshing to see a movie for kids that acknowledges a world bigger than America. It may have more to do with worldwide box office potential than education, but it's a start.<br/><br/>Kids will leave the theater wanting their own Baymax, and who can blame them? It's the rest of the ""Heroes"" that don't measure up; the robot full of air is the most real thing in the movie. As with its live- action counterparts, this Marvel-based feature comes complete with a post-credits scene that sets up a sequel. It likewise includes an animated cameo by Stan Lee. So long as Baymax returns for that sequel; the rest of the team is given more depth; and the story doesn't trade coherence for unnecessary, messy action scenes, I'll still be game for it."
"jhester9614","7","2","8","11 March 2015"," It's no How to Train Your Dragon or ParaNorman in ways of originality, but it's a solid family movie
","Final Assessment of Big Hero 6 (No spoilers for the movie, but MILD plot points for How to Train Your Dragon 1 and 2, ParaNorman, and Rise of the Guardians.): I'd give it 3 stars. 5 stars being HtTYD or ParaNorman and 4 stars being Rise of the Guardians or HtTYD2. It was fine. Not really NEW, you know? And I get it, ""Wow, what an old fogey, why are watching kids movies?"" Uh, because I like movies? I love animations, and this was a great aesthetically, but wow, was I bored, and when I wasn't bored, I was trying to catch up. <br/><br/>This movie MOVES. No pauses, no breaks, no plot turns that you wouldn't see a mile away. Plot-wise, eh. But it was definitely for kids and not their parents this go around. I didn't feel connected to any of the characters, and I found Baymax and Fred to be my favorites just because they livened up the droning dialog.<br/><br/>Was I supposed to care about Hiro's dead parents (and that's not even a spoiler, it's so boringly thrown out there that I feel like it didn't even matter) I didn't GET it, with Hiccup, his mother's death was an actual plot device, the whole purpose of the first movie and a turning point in the second. With Hiro... I guess to make it more, IDK, superhero-y? Which, btw, they aren't. They're no more a hero than Batman, and Batman destroys more than he helps. <br/><br/>I like the cast, but the bad guy was meh. What's with that, having no real ""bad guy""? At least with ParaNorman, the bad guy was ignorance and bigotry. And even RotG got a classic, Boogeyman. But this was... a letdown, especially since a lot of scenes I was going, ""Oh, yeah, I remember that from (insert HtTYD, Avengers, The Incredibles, any movie where the team isn't a team until they team up by some obscure saying given to the main character at moment where it was relevant but now it's not (the Hope scene with Amazing Spider-Man 2, the ending of RotG, Norman and Aggie's scene in ParaNorman, etc)) it felt cheap in the end. Who was the real villain? A man who watched his daughter die and felt angry that no one was punished? Big corporation? Who was it? What was the conflict? <br/><br/>But my stance aside. If you've HAVEN'T seen any of those movies, and you really don't care about plot devices or generic dialog, this movie is FINE. I smiled here or there (mostly at Fred or Baymax, and Wasabi was pretty funny too), and the animation is beautiful, but don't expect to come way with some moral lesson or changed attitude or even awe at the mechanics or technical marvels. It's kinda there. <br/><br/>I mean, I guess they can't all be amazing wonders of new innovation? It was fun movie, but not one I would watch twice."
"ikrani","8","2","8","24 January 2015"," An Otherwise Perfect Movie Marred by Disney Feel-Good Contrivances
","Now, let me say that I am a HUGE Disney fan. Two of my Top 4 favorite films (Muppet Treasure Island at #1 and The Great Mouse Detective at #3) are both fun Disney family films that I happily watch again and again. I feel that Disney's film quality has dipped a bit since they went entirely the 3D animation, but I still think they put out great stuff. Anyway...<br/><br/>I didn't give this much thought when I first saw the trailers. Ever since I was so horribly disappointed by Muppets Most Wanted, I made a rule not to go see a movie unless its trailer got me interested. Big Hero 6's trailer did not.<br/><br/>However, after hearing all the positive reception it was getting, I finally decided to go see it no more than two hours ago at my local college theater. And, for the most part, this reception was well- warranted.<br/><br/>All of the characters are likable and memorable, which is the essential part of making a movie work: if no one likes your characters, no one will care what happens to them and therefore no one will care about your story. Baymax and Fred, who are easily my favorite characters for how lovably awkward Baymax is and how much of a fanboy Fred is, are probably the best of the cast. I can relate to both, and I love just how mindlessly optimistic Fred is about everything he does, even when he's in immediate danger.<br/><br/>The story is pretty simple: Hiro suffers a tragic loss, wants to apprehend those responsible, and recruits his friends to help him. Like the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the story's nothing special, but you came for the characters, so it's adequate.<br/><br/>However, what's NOT adequate are two of the most bullsheit Disney ""bad things don't happen here"" decisions I have ever seen.<br/><br/>SPOILERS BEGIN HERE.<br/><br/>The first comes during the climactic battle with the main villain, who is out for revenge after his daughter was sucked into a wormhole machine. As the wormhole machine starts to collapse in on itself, a scan from Baymax reveals the daughter is still alive within the pocket dimension of the wormhole ""in hypersleep"". WHAT?! First of all, this revelation comes completely out of nowhere. It was never set up, ""hypersleep"" was never even mentioned during the movie, and as such it comes off like Disney didn't have the balls to leave a tinge of sadness in their movie. And they had the groundwork laid out so well! It was never said outright that the daughter was dead, per say, so that ambiguity could've been enough to warrant the villain being sympathetic. But, no, can't have ANYTHING bad happen in a superhero movie, right?<br/><br/>This leads to the next bit of asinine Disney bullsheit. While Baymax and Hiro (who didn't build a superpowered science suit for himself some reason) try to escape the wormhole, Baymax's thrusters get damaged and he is forced to sacrifice himself via Rocket Fist in order to get Hiro out of the wormhole at the cost of his own escape. This, you'd think, would be a very tragic but also perfect way to cap off Baymax's arc throughout the movie, right? WRONG! As it turns out, Baymax was somehow able to eject his hard drive with all his programming on it (without us seeing him do it) during the time he was dodging debris and pushing a pod inside the wormhole. When I saw him drift off, I was pretty saddened despite being miffed about the previous hypersleep contrivance. Then, this new contrivance slaps us in the face since Disney never allows any kind of bittersweet ending to its movies (*cough* Muppet Treasure Island *cough*). Plus, it makes Baymax's final farewell completely nonsensical, since by the movie's own logic, Baymax should not care about Hiro's wellbeing, having ejected that part of his programming. Stupid Disney executives...<br/><br/>But the last bit that was distractingly off-putting in this movie was when Hiro first has a shot at catching the bad guy, and he tells Baymax to kill him.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, WHAT?! I know he's torn up about his tragic loss, but this seems so out-of-character for him. He always came off as a tragic but still energetic character. Him acting so blood-hungry came out of nowhere. It was never foreshadowed or built up to, he just suddenly wants the villain's head on a spike. And I know the villain kind of pushed him to it when he hits Hiro with the ""Too bad, so sad, who cares?"" bit about his loss, but that still doesn't excuse Hiro from lowering himself to the villain's level just so the movie can draw parallels between him and the villain during the climax.<br/><br/>SPOILERS END HERE<br/><br/>With all that said, I still think this is a good movie with plenty of potential for sequels. I'm just glad they didn't try to push another movie in their post-credits scene.<br/><br/>On that, I would've rated this movie a star lower, but thanks to Big Hero 6, STAN LEE IS NOW OFFICIALLY A Disney CHARACTER. WOOHOO!"

","Big Hero 6 Review<br/><br/>I literally just got back from seeing this movie about two hours ago with my younger brothers. One of my favorite parts of taking them to a movie is getting their reactions afterwards. I remember when we went to see ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"" they were simply in awe of the film. And to be fair, the movie actually was not half bad. However, I usually am not as enthusiastic about a movie as they are, as the ones we see together are obviously meant more for them than for me. Their reaction towards this film was that it was, and I quote, ""The best movie I've seen this year."" While I would not quite go that far, I actually agree with them that it is a very, very well done film.<br/><br/>Let's face it, Disney (love them or hate them) are a very successful company, and there is a reason for that. As of the last few years, Disney has really been able to successfully blend both child and adult content into their films. Much like this years ""How to Train Your Dragon 2,"" a film which I gave a GLOWING review to, ""Big Hero 6"" is not afraid to be a bit more blunt when trying to get across how the world works. So many children films tend to gloss over or ignore the tragedy part of life and only include it to create the story's conflict. More child movies need to stop being afraid to bring a little reality into them!<br/><br/>Another great element of the story was the way that it was literally a hybrid of a handful of some of the most awesome superhero films of the past few years. This film was pretty much ""Spider-Man (2002),"" meets ""Iron-Man,"" meets ""The Avengers."" This makes sense as this is technically a MARVEL film. However, this film was able to throw a few creative wrenches into the story, keeping it interesting from start to finish. Also, there is a Stan Lee cameo in the film.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best element of the film for adults was the way the film comments on science and where it is going in the future. The story did a great job showing how science can be either a wonderful tool for humanity, or a weapon with consequences. This is one of the larger morals of the story, and it is handled really well. It never comes off as preachy, and is actually a very welcome addition to the story.<br/><br/>The animation in this film is very reminiscent of ""Tangled,"" ""Wreck It Ralph,"" and ""Frozen"" and I am on board 100%. This animation style never really tries to be super realistic, but it looks great in a kids' film, and I thought it was great. However, the best animation truly did go into the characters, particularly the ""robot"" named Baymax. The fact is that Baymax is quite possibly the most lovable character on screen from the last few years. There are a number of moments with him that will tug at your heart strings, and they all work brilliantly. <br/><br/>Also, one of my favorite film critics made a comment about how Baymax's humor hit more times then Olaf's did in Frozen. I have to agree wholeheartedly. Baymax and his relationship with Hiro is what keeps the movie feeling different and fun. Olaf was a fan favorite in Frozen, but most of his big moments came from his complete ignorance to the ways of life. This is not the case with Baymax. Baymax is a robot who is programmed to be a certain way, but is taught and programmed to learn and do more throughout the film. This, naturally, makes him more and more human as time goes on. <br/><br/>Now, for the many positives of this movie, there are a few disappointing elements. One of these is that, apart from the two main characters, the rest are left a little underdeveloped. Sure, they all play a very important part in the final conflict, but personality wise, I wished they had been fleshed out a little more. Also, the story is indeed one we have seen before. It does have a few unique twists, but it still can be predictable at times. I think the solution to this problem would have been to add a little more to the run time. Yes, I know the film is geared towards younger audiences, but the fact is they going to be into this movie anyway, so what would be another five minutes? Seriously, just with another five minutes, the side characters could have a bit more story and the end would have felt a little less sudden. <br/><br/>All in all, ""Big Hero 6"" was much more than I was expecting it to be, and I very happy with the way it turned out. It just got in theaters today, so if you want to see it, you have plenty of time. Because let's be honest; kids movies stay in theaters a LONG time! So, if you enjoy superhero films, Disney films, kids' films, animated films, or even family films, ""Big Hero 6"" will have something for you. This is one of those few movies that actually will have a little something for just about any audience. I would recommend seeing this film, even if it is not a matinée. This film is worth a few extra dollars.<br/><br/>I'm going to give ""Big Hero 6"" an 8.75/10 for now."
"nairtejas","6","5","33","12 January 2015"," Makes Nerds Look Cool. ♦ 60%
","I enjoy animation movies not because they help us dive back into our childhood memories as cartoons, but because they often speak volumes about world issues. While Big Hero 6 doesn't particularly point at any issue, it may inspire children to embrace science and technology.<br/><br/>It is basically a superhero film and as all superhero films go, it says almost one and the same thing. A bunch of heroes with powers defeat the villain. Period. In here, the story revolves around a teen who takes the help of his friends and a robot to avenge his brother's death.<br/><br/>The bot Baymax is very adorable and children will love it. It is the only new thing that managed to intrigue me. How 14-year-olds manage to invent hybrid technological marvels is beyond my understanding, and that is why I do not appreciate the friendship of East & West here. The Japanization troubled me a little. The plot is about robotics, science, and ideas. Its audience will stay spellbound at how marvelously the writers have added color and creativity in the story. With a great comic timing, Big Hero 6 keeps you engaged on a thread.<br/><br/>The chief issue it addresses is that of the perils of technology and how everything is based in the programming. The film, as a whole, makes nerds, an ilk mocked by many, look cool. It is nicely directed, has great sound effects, good score, and brilliant art setup.<br/><br/>But, too bad, Big Hero 6 struggles with its clichés. The story goes literally unbelievable sometimes and slightly jumps the line as it starts its narration. Visuals effects reminded me of Spider-Man 3 and if you stop and think for a moment after the climax, the whole shindig looks like a goofy, child's play.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Of course not the best animation movie of the year. The makers have evidently failed to acknowledge the fact that, since the boom of computer animation and its cinema genre in the 90s, animation films are mostly fables than comedy-dramas.<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"

Haha!<br/><br/>Furthermore, it has cool soundtracks, nice plot, interesting characters, unpredictable stories, it's super cool.<br/><br/>But the thing I love the most about this movie is that it teaches audience to kill prejudices and stereotypes. Why? Look at the characters, nerd people are unattractive...? Oh hell now. You can see this movie breaks many judgements we're having in the society. There's this tall slim blonde girl, Honey Lemon who's really smart in chemist engineering. And another black man (Wasabi) who is really into following rules (says who they're misdemeanor), and Fred the super rich man who's not that ""materialistic"". I love all of them.<br/><br/>I don't know this was an adaptation from a comic book, I've never read one. But I think this movie is pretty well done.

If you have little ones, you may wish to know which movie has more death scenes--BIG HIRO SIX or INTERSTELLAR? When you count presumed off-screen demises, it probably comes out pretty close to a tie. But, since the latter feature is about an hour longer, the wee ones may get more nap time bang-for-your-buck with the space fantasy than they would with this cartoon. Another obvious question is which of these two films feature the most realistic science? Here the answer probably is BIG HIRO SIX, and certainly its assumptions are far less controversial. (Polls prove many if not most Americans think ""global warming"" is a bogus concept--particularly when New York gets eight feet of snowfall in a couple days--and nothing to worry about; INTERSTELLAR does not have a leg to stand on without this alleged straw Bogie Man.)

I've watched it 3 times, and this movie sets me flying every time.<br/><br/>I'm not an expert, but the sound effect is phenomenal, every tone is subtly written and weaves into a symphony with the development of story. The cooperation of movie and the music feels like breathing and walking, the audience can easily ride on it and take a wonderful tour around the fantasy world. Also the variation of the camera angle is close to undetectable, but when the highlighted parts come, like the scene when Hiro first displaces his microbes, the camera is flying freely like a bird up and down the hall; and when they finally encounters the professor, the camera is dashing up and down like a drone;but when Hiro first appeared in the robot battle, camera angle is a similar to that of Fast&Furious. I'm an amateur, but I know what a grand achievement it is to accomplish such a flexible transition, especially for animations.<br/><br/>The animation at the ending turn me into a huge marshmallow.

","If you ever had to deal with the pressures of growing up a nerd, this movie feels your pain. It will wrap its big white fluffy arms around you and say, ""you belong"". So sit back with some hot popcorn and let this fantastic cinematic confection press all your awesome buttons. You're in for a dose of roller-coaster therapy.<br/><br/>Let me begin by saying the animation in this movie is beyond fantastic, and this movie plays out much like any live-action film would, as opposed to following the traditional structural formula of animated films, and I think its Japanese influence has a lot to do with this. The influence of Tezuka and Miyazaki are strongly felt. The visual environments at times are so photo-realistic it actually looks as if our animated characters are inhabiting a live action world. I was so swept into it, there were times I honestly forgot I was watching animation.<br/><br/>Which brings me to our Hiro. If you don't recognize this character from your school days, you were this character in your school days. Let me say, he brought back memories, and I haven't identified more with an animated character, ever. Allow me to explain:<br/><br/>In fourth grade I formed a club called The Technologists where we'd take apart old computers and appliances to see how they worked. As a kid, I was obsessed with the concept of human flight and one day being an inventor of flying machines. Hiro's circle of friends are extremely relatable as well. I hung out with kids like these. In middle and high school we had to form lunch groups in empty classrooms or computer labs to escape the wrath of the student body, while we played some of the first online multi-player games, or discussed the likes of JRR Tolkien and Frank Herbert, or whatever fantasy worlds we inhabited. But a certain loneliness nevertheless came with being a nerd. One that led to a longing for adventure, which in turn typically led back to Middle-Earth, Narnia or Arrakis. Which brings me to the most beautiful and touching point this movie makes - adventure is therapeutic. Hiro's entire journey, as facilitated by Baymax, is medicinal, and no matter your mood, there are moments in this film that will make you forget your worries and cry tears of awesomeness. You're along for the ride, and if you're like me, you're going to come out exhilarated and empowered.<br/><br/>Yes, you'll catch whiffs of other classics, such as Terminator 2, E.T., Stargate, and How To Train Your Dragon. But that doesn't drag down the movie for me. The only thing I would have loved more than what I saw would be if the movie had a classic-rock soundtrack.

Like most animation films Big Hero 6 will appeal the kids a lot, still its refreshing enough for adults.<br/><br/>The story is set in futuristic hybrid city of 'San Fransokyo'. 'Hiro' a teenager who is very bright with technology and robotic stuff but uses most of his talents in back-alley robot fights. His brother 'Tadashi' worried of Hiro's plans decides to take him to his university with robotics labs and futuristic gadgets. Tadashi shows Hiro 'Baymax' an inflated health care robot created by Tadashi. Hiro also meets Tadashi's friends each one good in a particular tech-field and also the head Prof. Callaghan who is impressed by Hiro's talents. Inspired by all this Hiro gets enthusiastic about joining the university. With help of his brother Hiro starts working on a project called 'Microbots' which are tiny programmable robots whose swarm can form any shape and can be controlled with his mind. He presents it at the university exhibition impressing everybody. But every new-tech stuff attracts villains wanting to misuse it and that's how the story follows. No spoilers.<br/><br/>Apart from of few twists, the story is pretty much predictable. The relation between Baymax and Hiro is very endearing and is the strong-point of the film. The huge inflated hug able robot Baymax will be loved by kids and adults alike. Also the brotherly- bond between Hiro and Tadshi is nicely put forth. Well the typical robot tries to fit in human environment is used, still the cute interactions between Hiro and Baymax keep us engaged. The second half of the film is more of superhero-action like The Incredibles but it lacks the same humor and thrill. Towards the end it goes into the cliché revenge bandwagon and the ending could be easily seen coming. On the positive side, the animation is incredible like most animated-movies these days and is briskly paced. The music is also good for the superhero theme. Voice-cast does a nice job, Scott Adist's Baymax being the best without any doubt. I had never heard of these superhero characters before wacthing the film, as a origins story I think it does a good job.<br/><br/>Overall, I feel the kids will like it a lot more than adults and will be wanting to have a Baymax of their own at the end. I too loved him a lot especially with all the iron-man like upgrades which Hiro gives him, which made him impressively cool besides being adorable already. Other characters apart from Hiro lacked a bit of focus yet were pretty much entertaining. In the end, Big Hero 6 falls slightly short of this years 'The Lego Movie' and 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' for best animated feature, but its just my personal opinion.<br/><br/>RATING: [3/5]"

","'BIG HERO 6': Three Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Walt Disney Animation Studio's first adaptation of a Marvel comic book is this 3D computer-animated film about a team of superheroes, led by a 14-year-old robotics genius and his inflatable robot sidekick. It was directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams and written by Robert L. Baird, Dan Gerson and Jordan Roberts (based on the comic book series created by Steven T. Seagle and Duncan Rouleau). It stars the voice talents of Ryan Potter, Scott Adsit, T. J. Miller, Génesis Rodríguez, Damon Wayans, Jr., Jamie Chung, James Cromwell, Maya Rudolph, Daniel Henney and Alan Tudyk. It's a huge hit at the Box Office and has gotten mostly positive reviews from critics and movie fans alike. As far as animated kids' movies go, I think it's a pretty good one but it's still too full of stupid kids' jokes.<br/><br/>The story takes place in a futuristic city called San Fransokyo. Hiro (Potter) is a 14-year-old genius, who specializes in robotics and already graduated from high school. He spends most of his time, and wastes most of his talent, competing in illegal robot fights. His older brother, Tadashi (Henney), takes him to see the robotics lab at his university; in hopes it will inspire him to do something more with his skills. Hiro is especially impressed by an inflatable robot, designed to assist people with health issues (his brother created) called Baymax (Adsit). He meets the professor in charge of the school, Robert Callahan (Cromwell), and asks to join the school. Hiro then amazes everyone at a science exhibition, with his microbots project (tiny robots that combine together in multiple different forms) and is accepted to the university. Then his brother and Callahan are killed in a school fire and Hiro wants to get to the bottom of what happened, He teams up with Baymax, and his brother's friends, to do so. The five young scientists, and robot, become a superhero team. <br/><br/>The film does feel a lot like an anime action movie and it's pretty different for a Disney film. It's great to see Walt Disney Pictures diversifying itself, and doing different things with their kids' films, but it's not different enough. While the action and visuals are cool it's still full of stupid jokes and is made to appeal mostly to grade-schoolers. It's too bad because there was potential here, to make a really cool movie, and I like the idea of Disney adapting obscure Marvel comic books (since they own the rights to them now). If they really want to make films that compare to the level that Pixar is putting out, they'll need to do a lot more though.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/D17O2xOoOCw"

"dfa120374","6","3","31","23 April 2015"," A Decent Animation But Still Misses The Mark Somewhat
","Big Hero 6 was more like The Humdrum 5 for me, because there was nothing really all that fantastic about this movie, and it ended up being just an average run-of-the-mill animation, which is a pity because from the previews it looked like a really enjoyable film. For $165m I'd have hoped for something better too.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong...this isn't an awful movie, and it IS a decent watch, but I think it just lacked any real character depth, the plot (even for an animation) got a bit too ridiculous, and it was pretty dull in places. I think the younger audience (the 8-13 range) will enjoy this movie more because of the super hero element, but most adults may find it a bit lackluster.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 actually started out quite well, but it just got to a certain point where it ended up being a completely different film to how it started off, and the end was too much like Stargate (which was a boring movie itself).<br/><br/>It all just kind of stagnated in parts, and none more so than the majority of the main characters, because apart from Baymax really, they were pretty bland and just lacked any sort of real depth. Fred was OK and was quite funny in places, but as for Go Go (who annoyed the Hell out of me with her stereotypical ""chick with attitude"" trait), Wasabi, and Honey Lemon, none would have been missed if they were suddenly not there.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Baymax was the true highlight of this film, and a lot of scenes involving him were pretty humorous. One scene being when Baymax's batteries were low causing him to act ""drunk""...that whole scene was played out like a sober person trying to get his drunk buddy home to bed. I also enjoyed the scene where Baymax casually used Scotch Tape to patch up some punctures he received. The humour was simple but it worked so well with him. It's just a pity the humour was lacking elsewhere.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 is definitely like Frozen & Tangled...it's not a bad film but it's vastly overrated.<br/><br/>Pity it couldn't have been great like Wreck It Ralph."

The city of San Fransokyo suffers a devastating event that jeopardizes the safety of its citizens. Hiro joins forces with his friends adrenaline junkie Go Go Tomago, neatnik Wasabi, chemistry whiz Honey Lemon and fanboy Fred to form a team of high-tech heroes called ""Big Hero 6."" Together they must uncover the mystery of who's to blame for the damage which has befallen the great city.<br/><br/>""Big Hero 6"" is filled with likable characters who contribute something to the team. Each one has their own unique look and attitude towards their heroic actions. Every child in the audience will find something in common with one of the different members of the group.<br/><br/>The visual concepts for ""Big Hero 6"" are breathtaking. The city of San Fransokyo is a clever mash-up of its namesakes. It's a futuristic metropolitan bringing together American and Japanese culture which doesn't seem all that far off from where we're headed in the real world.<br/><br/>The animation of ""Big Hero 6"" is a clever blend of Disney's signature CG look with an anime flavor injected into it. It's a smart move at a time when younger kids are into Asian movies and shows like ""Fairy Tale,"" ""Pokemon,"" and Disney's distributed Studio Ghibli properties. The combination of styles is a perfect way to attract a broader audience to the film.<br/><br/>The unofficial ""mascot"" of ""Big Hero 6"" is an inflatable robot named Baymax. His design is based on real world technology doctors have started using to treat patients that are sensitive to the touch. They take this idea and run with it as the lovable Baymax believes his teammates to be patients he needs to take care of and keep safe.<br/><br/>""Big Hero 6"" is rated PG for action and peril, some rude humor, and thematic elements. All of these minor issues aside, it's a great movie for the whole family to enjoy together. I'm sure some younger children will find certain points scary for them. They might be frightened of the main villain's mask and look as well.<br/><br/>Everything about ""Big Hero 6"" points to it being a perfect movie to launch a new franchise for both Disney and Marvel. I find it strange that Marvel has gone out of its way to visually distance itself from the movie. You can't find a logo for the company anywhere in it. A surprise appearance in the post-credits scene definitely cements the comic book publisher's imprint onto the film, even if it isn't through the use of the familiar fanfare seen at the beginning of every live-action Marvel movie."

","Inspired by the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, this cute 2014 American 3D computer-animated superhero action comedy produced by Disney follows a robotics genius named Hiro (Potter), who forms a superhero team to help stop his invention from being used for harm by pioneer entrepreneur Alistair Krei (Tudyk). Baymax (Adsit), the white inflatable robot, is the movie's ""poster bot"" and for good reason—but let's not forget Mochi (Hiro's affectionate fat cat), who comes in second place for stealing the show.

"jadepietro","6","2","22","10 November 2014"," We All Need Another Hero
","This film is mildly recommended. ☆☆ ½ <br/><br/>Disney and Marvel have joined forces to beget Big Hero 6, a computer animated film about a boy and his pet robot. They have created wondrous worlds and interesting enough characters only to place them in the most mundane plot. The film starts off promisingly with plenty of awe and joy but finally dissipate into one action chase sequence after the next. Now this may sell toys and merchandise at a hefty profit but the cost of their own creative ingenuity and soul is the price paid. <br/><br/>Most animated features nowadays feed into the video game frenzy with its loud aggressive action and pop spectacle sacrificing fully developed characters and the remains of a plot for large screen destruction. Big Hero 6 is once again that type of film showcase. As in the past, just like other well-crafted predecessors (Wall-e, Brave, Frozen, Cars, and Planes, for example), this film is wildly (and unevenly) entertaining before it falls victim to this malady. (Some animated films like Ratatouille, Up, The Incredibles, and the Toy Story franchise have successfully sidestepped these pitfalls with stronger and more cohesive scripts with a satirical bent.) <br/><br/>In Big Hero 6, we are somewhere in the future, in SanFransokyo to be more precise, a mash-up of both metropolises. Living there is our main human character, a teenage gamer and bot fighter named Hiro. Hiro is an intelligent but aimless computer geek, unlike his big brother Tadashi who is a robotic whiz and has created a cutting edge robot named Baymax. After tragedy befalls Hiro, he is forced to join forces with Tadashi's lab mates and battle an evil mastermind. (Parents, be forewarned that on a scale from 1 to 10, the emotionally scarring damage of this sad event to your child psyche could fall midway between Bambi's mother's demise as 1 and the traumatic killing of Old Yeller as a 10.)<br/><br/>The moviegoer is taken on a diverting journey, but it's one that never lives up to its clever beginnings. Big Hero 6 doesn't achieve its true potential when the end nears. It wears itself out with too many well-staged but dramatically inert chase scenes. The results are predictable and so formulaic. The film reads like a rejected X-Men comic, far too simplistic in structure and pacing.<br/><br/>Literally, the heart of the film is the lovable and huggable Baymax, the most distinctive character in the entire film. The animators have done wonderful things with him, from his sluggish movements, sound design and his rubbery latex exoskeleton. All of the others in the film pale by comparison. In fact, the characters, as drawn, lack any real presence. However, kudos go out to the detailed and creative background designs of San Fransokyo which show a lot more imagination than this woebegone script. (Surprisingly, six writers are credited with this lame story and its semi-plot that is more concerned with action than characters.)<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 is strictly a heroes vs. villain by-the-comic-book affair. It could have been so much more rewarding if it would have just focused on the relationship between Hiro and Baymax and their bonding instead of veering uncontrollably off-course for the sake of action. As it is, the film is still visually strong and has some charming humorous moments, mostly due to our walking marshmallow of a hero's fish-out-of-water existence. However, Baymax will make a nice expensive toy for parents to buy this Christmas...a win-win strategy for Disney/Marvel, but a win-lose situation for the more sophisticated lovers of film animation.

","I took my 8 year old nephew and he absolutely loved it! I as a 28 year old man also loved it and planning to watch it again. For me this was the best cartoon since Despicable Me. It had the emotion of Finding Nemo and UP. There are a few sad parts with the climax being fairly sad for a cartoon. I could definitely hear sniffles in my theater from many people. Don't worry though, the movie doesn't end on this sad note! Otherwise it has amazing animation and action, lots of humor and plenty for the kiddos to enjoy as well as for the adults. My only caveat would be is the villain is a little dark and may be a little creepy for the youngest viewers but nothing horrifying happens. Other reviewers have covered the plot so I'll just say it's definitely worth the money spent on movie tickets!"
"zetes","7","2","23","13 November 2014"," Fun but kind of cliché
","Disney's latest animated feature is an enjoyable comic book movie based on an obscure Marvel property. The story and characters are fine but nothing particularly interesting, but it makes up for that with beautiful design and well-directed action sequences. Ryan Potter plays teenage inventor Hiro in the futuristic city that is a mixture of Tokyo and San Francisco. To make his way into his older brother's robotics program at the local college, he invents miniature, nanotechnological robots that can change shape via his own thought. Months later, after a tragic event which he thought destroyed his invention, Hiro discovers a supervillain has stolen it. With the help of his brother's medical robot Baymax (Scott Adsit) and his friends in the robotics department (T.J. Miller, Jamie Chung, Damon Wayans Jr. and Genesis Rodriguez), they use their various inventions to become superheroes to try to stop the villain. Baymax makes the film. He's so adorable and fun with his big, inflatable body. I also really loved the designs of the characters as superheroes. James Cromwell, Alan Tudyk and Maya Rudolph co-star."
"joeravioli","5","1","9","24 March 2015"," Big Hero 6 was almost a great movie. But no.
","In many aspects, Big Hero 6 is conventional. It follows a linear, action-packed plot with a reasonably likable protagonist and his also reasonably likable friends as they battle a dangerous threat to the world as we know it, smashes the tears out of us with a beautifully animated climax scene, and leaves us feeling emotionally fulfilled. However, Big Hero 6 falls short of its greater predecessors, an acclaimed, almost cultish list that doesn't seem to ever leave us alone with its catchy songs and memorable plots, a list that includes Frozen, Tangled, and Wreck-It Ralph. Its dialogue is clunky, its story is slow and slippery, and it has no catchy songs (I actually hate it when movies have songs so I guess this is a good thing). It feels awkward at times, especially at the beginning, which has the constricting appearance of a plea from parents all across the globe for their children to show an interest in post-secondary education.<br/><br/>The film follows Hiro, a young robotics prodigy directing his talents toward the illegal (""But lucrative!"") world of bot fighting whose future suddenly brightens when his brother convinces him to go to post-secondary. But, as with every great Disney movie, things fall apart just when they start looking up. Hiro suffers a devastating tragedy, leaving him bereft of any ambition that he once had. He deals with the pain of loss (which is a rather mature theme for a Disney film) with the help of his brother's healthcare robot, Baymax. Baymax, a white, pillowlike robot, is an attempt at making an adorable memorable creature that everyone loves, but he falls slightly short of classic Disney characters, like(the first coming to mind being) Stitch. His lack of ""adorableness"" is mostly due to his serious, completely non-robotic, 50-year old man voice. But he has his moments.<br/><br/>The villain is great. He is sinister (almost too sinister) and one-sidedly cruel. Although, when the mask comes off, you find yourself sighing at the obviousness of what was under it in the first place.<br/><br/>There is no denying it, however. Big Hero 6 is beautifully animated, its action scenes are spectacularly choreographed, and it is easily one of the best animated films of the year."

","I was really really impressed by the start and expected that to continue until the end. <br/><br/>But alas, every good thing comes to an end; and this one long before the movie itself ended. Turned out to be those Power Ranger kids in (questionably) upgraded costumes at the end of the day.<br/><br/>Honestly, I would have rated the movie a 10 until before the blast: inspiring, innovative, unique and innocent. The flow of the storyline was exceptional. The characters were building up pretty good, and so was the chemistry.<br/><br/>To round it off as beautifully, I expected a super intelligent bot fight-off for the last scene (well nothing of the sort as it started off with). They had certainly built up the ground for it, with a pretty smart face-off to start with.<br/><br/>But then, there comes the cliché! The oh-awful villain with a grudge for a team of unassuming nerds to take on. All the brilliant plot build-up simply goes down the drain with the stealing & the mask! <br/><br/>I might even guess that these are two stories by two different authors.<br/><br/>To top it all, an absolutely unrelated storyline pops up promising a sequel!! <br/><br/>Demotivates me to look forward to the sequel!"

","I can give good comment for this movie, not because I really enjoyed but because I think this is decent movie for a family. Actually it reminds me of another animation film 'Incredible'. But Big hero 6 is definitely behind the 'Incredible'. It has less distinctive character, so it gives us less fun. I can say that it is semi-hero movie. But they are not that impressive to me besides the Baymax, because their skills look pretty poor.<br/><br/>Anyway, If you didn't watch the 'Incredible' or if you find some proper movie for family night, specially with kids, it could be nice choice.<br/><br/>I give 8 out of 10."
"jcv2","Null","2","32","3 March 2015"," Should have been rated G...
","... because only a kid less than ten years old would enjoy this movie. And this movie is proof that Academy Award voters often don't watch the movies they vote for.<br/><br/>The movie is riddled with clichés almost from the beginning. When the brother is running into the burning building you see his hat fly off and conveniently land in front of Hiro. When I saw that, and before I knew what was going to happen had actually happened, I asked myself if I really cared at that point if he died? The answer was no because like every other character in this movie, they're all carbon copies of one another. There's nothing about them that makes you care.<br/><br/>So after seeing that cliché dropped at my feet, I knew this was going to be bad. And it was.<br/><br/>The main character makes absolutely no sense when you stop to think about it. He graduates from high school at 13 and creates a small robot that every non-genius can't create in a lifetime. Somehow, despite this massive intellect, he seems to have flown completely under the academic radar throughout his shortened jaunt through school because he has received what appears to be no job offers to top flight companies, no scholarships to top universities, nor any of the other trappings that intellectual prowess over your peers provides. His mother only gently urges him to make more of himself and treats him as a pet, basically.<br/><br/>As a result, he seems to have become completely devoid of any ambition after graduation other than to use his amazing robot to become the nerd equivalent of a pool shark. Even less-than-geniuses realize that stealing money from people who have much less concern for the law than you is not a way to make a living.<br/><br/>With just a little brainstorming and a single trip to a robot shot he devises an even more spectacular robot that has a hive mentality, something I can safely say nobody, not even in his cartoon universe, has ever achieved, especially to the degree he has. If that's all it takes to get him going, the obvious question is ""is he a shut-in?"" I mean, does he ever go outside? Did he not realize such things existed before?<br/><br/>After the scene where the robot was basically acting drunk, I fell asleep. I admit I didn't watch the rest of it until I woke up and he was, I don't know, going crazy and trying to get the robot to kill someone and everyone was of course trying to talk him out of it. Who didn't see that coming? That was the Academy Award moment there, and I almost missed it. Phew! /s<br/><br/>Glad I rented this rather than buying it. I was tempted to just outright buy it because I usually love computer animated films, but something didn't seem right about this one. It had a high rating on basically every review site but when I watched the trailer I wasn't impressed at all. Even the trailer was a cliché. And hey, I was right, it wasn't funny in the least. I didn't laugh even once.<br/><br/>The characters are all one-dimensional. They're all carbon copies of each other which makes them all basically just props that you can have no emotional investment in. The bad guy is obviously bad and there is no subtlety to his character at all. Oh and of course one of them is black.<br/><br/>Their parents are dead? Why? It isn't explained. Are we supposed to feel more attached to a character just because he's an orphan? Puh-leez. What Disney-fied pandering nonsense.<br/><br/>It wasn't until after I'd lost interest that I went back and looked at how this was different than the other animated features I liked, and there it was. This wasn't made by Pixar or Dreamworks, no, it was made directly by Disney. The same company that ran out of ideas decades ago and started cranking out carbon copy films. The same computer animation studio that made the other animated feature you have to be ten to enjoy: Frozen. I'm just amazed there's no singing in this one.<br/><br/>Note to self: don't watch anymore movies made by Disney. Buy the stock, not the films."
"actionstudiosco","5","2","38","14 November 2014"," Big Hero Sucks
","First things first: this isn't a terrible movie. It's just bad. Just your average, everyday, fairly common, bad movie. If you don't agree with me, I'd be happy to tell you why...<br/><br/>The characters in this film are a stereotypical, cookie-cutter, sitcom cast (You've got your Shaggy, your Lara Croft, your white girl, and of course the manly-looking one who acts like a baby), the writing is garbage, the jokes aren't funny, the dialog is clichéd FOR DAYS, the plot devices are overused, the plot twists all seem forced, the soundtrack is forgettable, the cinematography is minimal at best, the visual design seems a little too similar to The Incredibles, the addition of the superhero team in the movie is completely unnecessary and doesn't help the film at all, not to mention all the superheroes seem like Ben 10 ripoffs, and finally, all the story arcs and major plot points seem to be directly stolen from films like ""The Iron Giant,"" and ""Brother Bear.""<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 is a bad movie. That is a statement that can be backed up with factual evidence. It definitely isn't a horrible movie, but it certainly isn't any good. So then why does everyone worship it like it's the arc of the covenant? The answer is simple: Baymax.<br/><br/>Baymax is Big Hero 6's money machine. He's their Olaf. His role in the film is trick people into thinking the movie is good so they'll recommend it to their friends. And I'll admit it, he won over my heart. He won over everyone's heart. You can't deny it, Baymax is a lovable, cute, hilarious character. The thing is, one character doesn't make a film good, and with his character aside, the film sucks Baymax's big squishy toes. The movie hides behind Baymax, and when people walk out of the theater thinking about how much they enjoyed the film...they're really just thinking about how much they enjoyed Baymax. Disney can be an evil genius when it wants to, and apparently in this case their master plan worked, because everybody seems to love the film.<br/><br/>I leave you with this final question: if Baymax wasn't in the film, would you still like it? Most people probably would say no. Those who say yes would either be lying, stupid, mentally impaired, or under seven years old."
"james_reid605","8","1","14","16 November 2014"," Marvel and Disney's love child, Big Hero 6!
","I was already a huge fan of anything Disney, but as soon as I heard of a Disney movie based on a marvel comic, I had to see it. I went into Big Hero 6 expecting a quality action packed family film and I got just that, and for the most part I loved it. There were however a few things that disappointed me a bit. First of all, the movie is based around a group of university geniuses and a lovable robot who team up to face a mysterious kabuki mask wearing foe, using the leader of the team, Hiro Hamata's invention as a weapon. The movie is intended to be about a team of superheroes, but at times tends to feel more like a duo rather than a team. It spends a lot of time focusing on the relationship between Hiro and Baymax, the lovable robot. You will definitely find yourself laughing and getting emotionally attached to the two and their relationship, but what about the rest of the team, the other four in Big Hero 6? When the rest of the characters are initially introduced they give off a great first impression. They're a very colourful and hilarious group, each with their own completely different personalities, but their characters never go beyond that first impression. Don't get me wrong, they're great supporting characters but due to the focus being on Hiro and Baymax, they don't really develop and thus become a little forgettable. Their poor development and lack of screen time compared to Hiro and Baymax makes it a lot harder to think of this as being a ""team"" movie. My main disappointment with this movie however, is less about the characters and more about the storyline. It is a great movie with a good storyline, it was just.. predictable. I found myself figuring out things long before they happened, I guessed a major event that happened towards the beginning of the movie and I figured out the identity of the main antagonist long before it was revealed. This was a disappointment to me seeing all the incredible and original story lines like Wreck-It Ralph (from the same creators) and how this one didn't really meet those standards, it was still really good, just very predictable. With the few negatives points aside, there is one aspect of the film I thought was nearly flawless, San Fransokyo! As lame and almost cringe-worthy that name sounds, the world of San Fransokyo is incredible. Like the name of the city implies, the movie is set in a cross between Tokyo and San Francisco and it is truly unique. It has all of the classic sights of San Francisco like the Golden Gate Bridge, skyscrapers, etc, while also incorporating traditional Japanese houses and temples, all made with that gorgeous Disney animation we all know and love. It really creates its own world that is truly unique and interesting. All in all, it's story may be a little predictable and if it were to ever have a sequel they should definitely develop the rest of the team's characters more, but it is a great movie. It does get a bit more of that wholesome Disney feel overall but definitely gets the action pack marvel components mixed in there too. With a bit Rise of the Guardians feel to it and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of that or other animated movies, like Wreck-It Ralph. I loved this movie and would definitely go see it again."

","*SPOILERS AHEAD* Big Hero 6 is definitely must see for any Disney and Superhero fans. It's light hearted, well executed, humorous and excellent even with it's flaws.<br/><br/>Baymax shines as the movie first introduces him. The theater were bursting out of laughter, yet he hasn't even started talking. He had such a simple and funny design that any kid or any adult will come to love him. The way he physically looks and the way he talks and walks is just downright hilarious and entertaining to watch. Hiro's character was just an extraordinary kid with an intellect that is beyond comparison. Sometimes his intellect becomes unbelievable to the point where you ask if this kid is even a 13 year old. His friends like GoGo, Honey Lemon and Wasabi were quite underdeveloped. The only character which I found interesting from the group was Hiro, Fred and Baymax. It was almost like as if the screen writers were pointing out to the screen that this is the goth chick, that blonde is the super nerdy and awkward chick, and that's the big nerd. Hiro's brother Tadashi was a total eye candy for girl audiences, yet he was great in his role as a sympathetic brother who cares a whole lot for Hiro. The animation was the high point of the whole movie. There were some parts where you are left wondering if you are watching a real live movie. The texture for the characters perfectly blended with the surroundings and background of the city. The animation is a clear landmark from Disney and it will sure be expected for future animated films. The plot was simple, yet enough to keep you engaged throughout the movie. The villain however, had a ludicrous and stupid motivation. The reveal that the villain was Callaghan was shocking, but when you further more think about his motives and why he is doing it, it was beyond stupid. To see a man go to great lengths just to get revenge and not do something more resourceful like trying to find a way to save his daughter is absolutely ludicrous. <br/><br/>Overall, with the flaws aside, it still was heck of an enjoyable movie. It will be sure to give you laughs and brighten up your family's day. The Oscars are gonna have a hard time picking the Best Animation for next year. +With Baymax completely stealing the show +Hiro's character was equally entertaining -Hiro's intellect is too much to the point where it is questioned. -Underdeveloped characters (GoGo, Honey Lemon, Wasabi) +Top notch animation -The villain's motive was stupid considering the stuff that he did for it.<br/><br/>Verdict: 8.3/10"

","""Big Hero 6"" delivers on its very specific promise of being a somewhat comedic (although the family member death toll is quite high), loud, kinetic action-adventure film. The fun mostly comes from its ""Real Genius"" or ""Revenge of the Nerds"" hyperactive brainiac superheroes reacting against ""The Dude""-like ""Baymax"" played by Scott Adsit (of ""30 Rock"" fame). His Spock-ian rationality and calm acts as the perfect comic foil against which to contrast collapsing buildings, dastardly Steve Jobs-modeled villains and very implausible technology weapons (wouldn't have telepathic controls been way more than enough to win the science fair without needing the cooperative robots?). Baymax charms more than any of the human characters all of whom are polite and with a heart of gold other than the juvenilely named ""Go-Go"". The characters are winning than the plot which pulls its punches in the same way ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" does by given the bad guy a good reason for his evil actions (in both cases to same their families). Takes some of the sting of the revenge fantasy angle. Beyond the standard Disney killing off of the mother, the movie goes a little overboard by taking out other family members as well - thought this was a kid's popcorn flick screenwriters? However, lots of Easter eggs, nicely- paced action and some clever dialog make you forget about the plot weaknesses. In short, while you won't remember the film by the time the inevitable sequel rolls out, you'll retain a vague sense of having been entertained."

","Frozen leave you in the cold, why not check out Big Hero 6? While not getting stale, Big Hero 6 leaves the normal Disney fairy tale trappings for an exciting super hero adventure full of twists and turns. This feels more akin to the recent Marvel super hero movies if anything but with the extra care and polish to design that Disney is know for. Characters are fun and compelling especially main character Hiro Hamata. He is helped on his journey by his robot companion Baymax who is both adorable, heart-breaking, and heroic all at once. It's got a little something for everyone in the family and offers a powerful message about science and responsible future engineering. I hope we get to see this team of heroes again in the future. P.S. This is a Marvel movie so make sure to stay for the post credits sequence."

And, of course, Marvel isn't forgotten. It's a wonderful combination, giving us a movie that you'll want to see again just to take the ride one more time.<br/><br/>Baymax had me cracking up so many times, and I'm sure I'll be quoting him for days. You'll want to be best friends with Hiro, he's that relatable. And the rest of the group isn't as cliché as I was afraid of--I was dreading another movie where the group of friends contains ""the nerd"", ""the girly-girl"", ""the tough guy"", you get the picture. They made the characters individuals and you feel like you're there with them, kicking butt and having fun. <br/><br/>The only complaint I had was that it was slightly too short. Certain parts felt a little rushed. It was fun, I was getting into the story, and then suddenly ""oh, OK, we're done with that now"". Another half hour spread across the story world have been about perfect for me.<br/><br/>All in all, I will definitely buy this the moment it comes out and watch it forever, just like all other Disney stories.

It was good, I'll first start by saying that, however it was predictable. I could literally see every twist and turn from a mile away. For those of you who have not seen it I will not go into detail as to be sure I do not spoil it for you. The plot was about 20% originality 80% recycled from other films.

","With the huge success of Wreck-it Ralph and Frozen, the mouse house seems to know that an animation production will only work if the theme, culture and background are connected to the modern lifestyle of the society. Although it feels like the plot itself lacks some originality and a bit formulated with easily predictable twisted climax, the combination of bouncy actions and motions, amusing development in between the cool characters, usual family, love and certain emotional-driven moments and colorful 3D visual effects are brilliantly enough to allow kids to enjoy, but this Marvel's adaptation seems to aim at the older teens and adults. It is a little bit transformeric and Bayish-style by starting off with some familiar scenes in ""Real Steel"" and having electronic pop-rock style scores from the composer Henry Jackman. However, setting in a background of American-Japanese culture might lead to the thought of targeting Japan's market after enormous profit from there, but this adorable, kind-hearted, friendly robot Baymax reminds us of good moral values, and certainly, it will easily be one of the most lovable character among the audiences."

","The way I viewed ""Big Hero 6"" is that it's the answer to all of the little boys who may have enjoyed ""Frozen"" but didn't couple themselves to it as passionately as maybe the females in their age group. What ""Frozen"" was to young girls is what ""Big Hero 6"" is to young boys, except it is not as deftly written as the former was. <br/><br/>The writing is clever even if the dialogue feels hammy and as artificial as they could have made it. The screenplay solidly emphasizes the vitality of intellect in the life of a teenager, as well as a theme of technology's growing power and capabilities. ""Big Hero 6"" most aptly expresses to younger males a sensitivity than can exist within the gender and does it in a way that is not extreme but a relatively understandable level.<br/><br/>The bright visuals and speeding energy awaken the picture. It's a jolting experience of modern fun. Kids will have a blast and laugh until their stomaches hurt. Baymax is the selling point of ""Big Hero 6"" and he doesn't disappoint as a children's story character: he's like the epitome of a light-hearted, honest, articulate, tubby, inflatable hug.

It's based on a Marvel comic book about computer nerds that become a super hero team called Big Hero 6. I have not read the books but you can tell the Japanese influences; It takes place in the not too distant future, mostly in a city called San Fransokyo-a combination of San Francisco and Tokyo-that has elevated trains and little flying blimps over the city, that look like those Japanese lanterns. Ryan plays a young genius that knows his robotics. His brother gives him a medical robot named Baymak-voiced by Scott-that looks like a big marshmallow. Maya plays their aunt that they live with. When a villain wearing a Kabuki mask comes to town, Ryan and some fellow nerds, including Damon and T.J., form a computer based super hero crime fighting group. They all have science to thank for their abilities and Baymak even gets some enhancements. The animation is good, as is the story and, as with most Marvel movies, you need to stay for the end credits, because there is a scene. There was a short Disney cartoon about a puppy before the movie began. There is a 3D version, which is the one I saw.

"FairlyAnonymous","7","1","19","7 November 2014"," A very entertaining film that doesn't try to do anything particularly new
","Big Hero 6 is fun. Big Hero 6 is entertaining. Big Hero 6 is emotional. Big Hero 6 is straight-forward.<br/><br/>I went into this movie with no expectations at all because I didn't watch any of the trailers for it except for the first teaser. The movie is very beautiful. It has lots of impressive lighting techniques and has excellent textures at certain times. Overall, the movie looks fantastic. It is nearly on par with this year's How to Train Your Dragon 2.<br/><br/>But animation isn't the most important element. The plot itself is what is most important and is probably the biggest issue with the movie. The movie feels like... a cartoon... like a Saturday morning cartoon. You know exactly where the plot is going and certain lines of exposition are almost unbearable to hear. The movie doesn't throw any twists or turns into the formula except for possibly one scene during the beginning. Even worse, the movie takes direct shots from the Iron Man flight sequence AND from How To Train Your Dragon/Avatar. The whole ""bonding flight experience"" is done in this movie and while it looks nice, it is pretty much a formula by now. However, there is more to a movie than originality.<br/><br/>The dialogue is probably one of the stronger aspects of the movie. While it isn't hilarious or Oscar worthy dialogue, it is spoken very well. The voice-actors did a terrific job of getting into their characters. The characters themselves are well written, but the side-characters (you know... there are 6 heroes...) don't really effect the plot that much. It is strange just how little the side- characters actually effect the plot. They are there... and do stuff... but they don't really change the outcome of the plot. There were much less contrived ways of doing what they did.<br/><br/>Long story short: Big Hero 6 is a fun and entertaining movie. The first half of the movie had me hooked, but the second half is pretty much a formula. The funny thing about this movie is that I found it much more interesting BEFORE the villain actually showed up. Yeah, getting to learn about the character's and their everyday struggles was much more original than the villain's arc.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing since it does have a rich atmosphere that is worth the price of a ticket alone."

","""I just want the future to happen faster. I can't imagine the future without robots."" <br/><br/>-Nolan Bushnall <br/><br/>Walking into the cinema... There is an electric feeling in the theatre as we wait for the film to start. The anticipation of a new Disney/Marvel film was exciting for all in the family. It seems to have it all: drama, action, humour and, for the sake of the male audience members, no musical numbers. We did not want to succumb to the hype, but this film looks to be fun. <br/><br/>Overall rating: 4 stars Cinematic value: 4 stars Family value: 4 stars<br/><br/>Hiro Hamada is a brilliant, but bored, 14 year-old genius who builds robots and takes them to fight in back-alley robot fights in the fictitious, future city of San Fransokyo. His brother, Tadashi, sees his younger siblings talent is being wasted and wants to recruit him for the robotics team at the local university. Tadashi is a skilled robot inventor himself and has created Baymax, a special healthcare robot. Hiro is challenged to qualify for the local robotics programme and rises to his brother's challenge. He creates a new type of robot that could change the face of the robotic industry, but then tragedy strikes his family, the university and the city. Hiro, Baymax and the university team of Go Go Tomago, Wasabi, Honey Lemon and Fred have to work together to save the city from a new threat. without giving away the fascinating twists to this hero's tale, the team has to challenge themselves to become more than the thought leaders behind the robots, but to utilise the technology to serve as heroes, albeit unwillingly at first. Hiro works to transform Baymax from healthcare to heroics. He equips the lovable marshmallow-like creature to battle against the new evil in the city. The mystery behind this new villain and how to stop him gives the story a needed depth and builds to the inevitable climatic finish. This high energy adventure is full of new characters to spearhead a new Disney/Marvel franchise. <br/><br/>It is always a risk to introduce a new animated concept, even for Disney. Big Hero 6 was worth the risk. How original can you get with the superhero genre? This film has whispers of many robot/hero/coming of age films of the past, but the characters are fresh and the story delivery is on the mark. Don Hall and Chris Williams direct a well-crafted animated film. In this era of animation, John Lasseter's involvement with a project seems to have the qualities for a breakthrough hit. Like most of the films of the past decade, his fingerprints seem to be all over this film while developing new directorial talent. The other challenge to this film was the addition of the Marvel label. This is another adaptation from the multitude of comic book series. Disney will have to carefully manage the exposure to their new financial behemoth of a sub-brand. Fortunately, Stan Lee's inclusion in the storyline was the only real Marvel touch. Otherwise this merely comes across as original animated material and they continue to go from strength to strength with the animation. <br/><br/>The film might be a bit too dark for the youngest audience members, but overall this was a film for the whole family. The villain can be a bit scary and the action pretty intense, but nothing that would exceed other animated films, such as the The Lego Movie or Tarzan. You would have to be hard pressed to find objectionable material in this film. If you are looking for something to talk about with your family, this film is full of opportunities. Conversations about revenge, heroes, salvation and sacrifice will fill the family car and dinner table for hours after seeing this film. Not to be misunderstand, Big Hero 6 is an entertaining and action packed film, but you do not have to look too deep into the story line to find worthwhile points of family conversations. <br/><br/>A small note of consideration, Pixar helped to re-introduce the short animated film to the theatrical experience. These films help to move the audience beyond their everyday lives and gently progress to the upcoming feature. A cinematic clearing of the palette. With Lasseter's move to Disney, one hold over is the tradition of the short film prior to the feature. Feast was a joy in itself and helps to develop another great animated storyline. Winston's story of a dog and his owner is reminiscent of the opening sequence of Up. Many times the common thread in people's lives are their dogs. Feast manages to help audience members to move into the animated world that is full of emotion, humour and heart. Big Hero 6 is a wonderful film, but Feast is a wonderful compliment to the cinematic experience. Both films make for a good day for anyone at the theatre. <br/><br/>Leaving the cinema... Reviews like this are harder to write than one might think. When a film is this good, it is hard to strike a balance in the comments. It is a rare film that can be recommended to anyone, but this one makes the cut. Take the family and enjoy a fun film with a strong message and potential for great conversations with the family. <br/><br/>Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Is revenge the answer to injustice? (Psalm 37: 27-29, Romans 12:17-21) 2. What is biblical justice? (Psalm 7:9, Romans 3:5-6) 3. Who determines right and wrong?

","The review: The final product here is another creative, entertaining animated family adventure from this studio. There is humor, action, character empathy and development, some great animation, and some great heart. The initial surface estimation is pretty much what you get, but that's not a necessarily a bad thing. Hero's brother has been looking out for him ever since their parents died long ago. Hero is going to turn his life around and his brother dies in a tragic explosion. When Hero learns who is behind the explosion he and others are tasked with stopping the culprit and bringing them to justice. So not a LOT of twists and turns here, but the ride is fun. The characters are amusing. Although Hero and the team are just a bunch of college students, they come together as a family and are there for Hero when he has nothing else. What I did not LOVE about it was the notion that these smart kids were able to put on some gadgets and sail through the air stopping crime. When Hero's brother dies so quickly and realistically, many other parts of this movie are far-fetched. After getting past that and just trying to enjoy the movie, it is difficult to do anything but that. Baymax is also a very fluffy, enjoyable main character and brings a lot of robotic heart to the movie."

The two are joined by other superheroes in a quest for justice. There are some really cool super powers happening on the screen.

So beautifully portrayed! Winston is a true hero. Besides does it get better than this, when you get to watch two movies in a single ticket.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 starts with rad humour and some cool story build up until we reach Tadashi's so-fluffy-that-I-am-gonna-die invention. The giant wonder is a health-care robot who is goofy without trying. Things that it does just by being itself, packs up another layer of fun. The button-faced fluff might be the face of the flick, but the true hero is the genius Hiro. The child prodigy is really good when it comes to presentation or kicking some robo-ass. Also watch out for the funny Fred who will jiggle you for sure. And StanLee? What were you doing here?<br/><br/>""I don't wanna lose you too."" The drama is enriching to the script. Screenplay is pretty good for an animation movie. CGI is also pretty amazing. <br/><br/>Downsides: There isn't a lot of background bustle when it comes to showing ruckus on streets. The focus is always on the main characters of the movie. And sometimes you wonder - Where is everybody? Even the story ends up with clichés and a predictable sojourn. <br/><br/>Not looking at all of that, it still is a complete entertainment package, with action, drama and some great decent laughs on its way to become a franchise I surmise.

Nothing was going on except for some comedy scenes that baymax was pulling off (like not fitting in some places due to his fatness and giving cheesy straight forward answers to hiro). At some point in first half i thought like nothing was going to happen. They are going to end the movie saying saiyonara or something but second half did attract my concentration just because some progression was going on the story.<br/><br/>Coming from me who have watched many animated movies it didn't contain anything serious and thrilling moment like in Toy Story 3 Or the hype which generated while watching Wreck It Ralph. The movie's primary focus was mostly on comedy.<br/><br/>As for the animation every little things were detailed and it seemed gorgeous and i advice you to watch it in 2D (it is an 3D animation not talking about the stereoscopic 3D ). There weren't any WOW moment in 3D visual just added 3D depth not focused on pop up like Gravity.<br/><br/>As a whole its an okay movie while comparing it with big tiltes from pixar and dreamworks but its enjoyable as fun comedy and lite story telling."

","""Big Hero 6"" is kind of a misnomer as the movie really focuses on two team members and relegates the other 4 to set dressing. Know that going in and you'll be fine. For me, the heart of the story lay in the relationship between Hiro and Baymax (mostly because they pumped the big white airbag so full of charm and personality, he's a great character). But that's where the movie started to feel a lot like ""How To Train Your Dragon"", and not just because the hero is perched on the big guy's back. Hiro/Baymax, Hiccup/Toothless; the 4 remaining superhero team, the viking background players. It's not a deal-breaker, I guess, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't nagging. For all I know, it was like this in the original comic. But either way, I hope they give some thought to the other four in the next movie and make them actual characters.<br/><br/>This is a pretty movie, to be sure. They did a great job with San Fransokyo. But between the undercooked characters and the lame villain (easily pegged from the beginning), there's plenty of room for improvement.<br/><br/>6/10"

The message of this movie I guess can work for some and not for others in my opinion. Maybe audiences that has gone through vengeful hatred could either agree or disagree with the main message of this movie. I noticed that there was slight elementent of Japanese anime in this movie as well. Which can work for some and not really for others who want to see a straight Disney style animation. What is lacking however is that I couldn't really get attached to the characters or the story. Mainly because of the generic and cliché direction of it all.

Which gives the film a horrendous back story that it never intended, but still infiltrates the viewers mind. Could they not have kept them in Japan like in the comics? That said the animation team should be patting themselves on the back, this is a masterclass in human emotion and natural movements which most animated films still have yet to get right two years later. Which if one were to view solely for the animation then yes it was deserving of its Oscar. However if we take the writing into account, then this is a cliché within a cliché that leads to a point where the villain gets rewarded for his endeavours, while the good guys might save the day, they are the one's who ultimately lost more. The work was predictable as predictable gets and one could see everything before it happened, so if you are a future animation student watch and enjoy, if you are anyone else, then it is average at best."

The best parts were in the trailer, but they're still hilarious when you get to them.<br/><br/>The movie scores a 9/10. While not doing justice to the comics, the movie makes these characters its own, and distinguishes itself from other recent Disney movies (like the one trick pony, Frozen), not in originality, but in style and in execution. To only care about how well it did the source is cynical (because, while doing the source justice is very admirable, adapting the source to work with a different audience and making it work is even more so), as I shall point out, now legions of eight and nine year old's will go out and read the comics for more Hiro and Baymax.﻿"

It is an extremely simple film, cheesy at times, jokes that don't quite hit home - you know, typical Disney.<br/><br/>While a shorter runtime usually condenses a movie into an acceptable story that is not too long, I feel like this film needed more content. I'm not sure what I would recommend for the story to extend it, but there are definitely parts of this film that are rushed. Take Callaghan's turn to evil - we learn that his daughter is the one who became a victim of an accident in a matter of seconds, forcing upon the audience the motivation for Callaghan's actions without much thought to it.<br/><br/>I am not surprised this was not a great Disney Animation film since many of my friends were shocked that it took the Oscar over How to Train Your Dragon 2. I now understand the frustration. While enveloping us in a universe of awesome and easily adaptable technology, this movie falls just a little flat of wondrous."
"siderite","7","0","10","10 April 2015"," How to train your robot
","I cannot say that the movie was not nice. The animation was good and the feelings expressed in it were what kids probably need. However, the story was a melange of various concepts, just like the name of the fictional city the plot is supposed to take place in: San Fransokyo. It's How To Train Your Dragon with robots.<br/><br/>In this world where 14 year olds can use the resources of a single mother/aunt to build plane like flying robots, microrobots that can link with each other and perform whatever task the mind of their controller can think of, Hiro (said 14 year old) has to impress a teacher in order to get into a robotics university. Things go well until his brother dies, which pushes the little kid into a quest for justice and revenge. A lot of wondrous 3D graphics later, it all just comes into place.<br/><br/>I cannot imagine why this mediocre film with a predictable story and really unlikable characters has the high rating it has on IMDb. For me it wasn't a failure, but it was a severe disappointment. There was absolutely nothing in the movie that was above average."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","7","0","5","1 March 2015"," An interesting first entry for the Disney/Marvel duo
","Much like Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) released the same year, this movie is too based on a comic book property that is rather obscure. The title itself is also comparatively vague in its description. However, it seems that Marvel knew what they were doing because for their add campaign all they had to do was stick their soft round mascot as the main attention grabber. The actual story behind these two things is a young boy named Hiro who lives in the future city of San Fransokyo. There, he earns money by competing in illegal robot fights. Upon being rescued by his brother Tadashi time and time again, Hiro didn't want to do anything else. That is until his brother introduces him to the college he attends where robotics and science join hands to improve the way of living for future generations. This immediately catches Hiro's interest and he ends up meeting new friends along the way including Baymax, the white marshmallow looking cuddle balloon. Together, they form a group of six super heroes to stop a mysterious threat.<br/><br/>With writers Jordan Roberts (March of the Penguins (2005)), Daniel Gerson and Robert L. Baird (Cars (2006) & Monsters Inc. (2001)) penning this story, the end result was bound to be something worth while. The overall play out is almost what any viewer would expect but there are a number of traits to it that make it a family movie that stands out from the other generic films. The biggest differences are the characters. Instead of Hiro having a hard time fitting into the college he decides to attend, his brother's friends immediately welcome him with open arms and have quite a distinct personality for each. The supporting human character audiences will probably enjoy the most is Fred; mostly because of his goofy spontaneous nature. Then again, people will obviously fall more for Baymax. The character of Baymax is innocent and harmless and this is pretty much what makes him so likable.<br/><br/>The voice cast behind these characters is noteworthy as well. Baymax (Scott Adsit) and Hiro (Ryan Potter) both display genuine emotion for their roles, it sounds well done. The rest of the cast includes voice work from Daniel Henney, T.J. Miller (Fred), Jaime Chung, Damon Wayans Jr., Genesis Rodriguez, James Cromwell, Alan Tudyk and even Abraham Benrubi (George of the Jungle (1997)). Also mixing well with that is the animation, which is very fluid in movement, and the coloring of everything is bright and visible. Another satisfying fundamental piece that works with the animation is the action sequences. Hiro and his friends end up making body suits with powers that relate to what they are best at in the school. This leads to some very intriguing and creative fight sequences that aren't normally exploited when it comes to super powers.<br/><br/>Henry Jackman who has proved he has enough experience producing music for family friendly genre and action related films provided the music for this movie. The best moments to this movie are when Jackman focuses more on the emotional moments between Baymax and Hiro. The action cues are appropriate but there isn't a main theme for the character(s), so it doesn't stick out as much as one would think. The only issues this animated/superhero film has are the usual things that come to mind. The usual are continuity errors and convenience of plot points. Some of these moments really are just thrown in order to avoid smart writing. And of all things, how does a piece of equipment work by putting it back together if it's not connected to the power source that initially made it run? The only other complaint some people may have is the message of sidelining school for superhero business. It's hard to say if the main characters really dropped school but they did forget about it for a while. Not a gigantic problem but it is a bit misleading.<br/><br/>For Marvel and Disney's first shared animated feature, it doesn't stray far from its usual formula to attract audiences. Its action, animation, music and characters are developed properly to entertain any audience. However its message of being a superhero over getting an education and the usual animation/story errors are somewhat predictable."

","It is hard to say why I am not giving this film more stars, but there is something unexplainable that does that I can't give it any more. It is a good and entertaining film, with great new characters, but maybe it is something about the fusion universe that just doesn't add up for me.<br/><br/>There are some fusion going on, actually two ones and they are interesting, the big thing is the city where all of this takes place, it is a mix between San Fransisco & Tokyo (San Fransokyo) and there are many great relations between them but it is a strange combination in many ways. The second fusion is between the hero universe (Marvel) and the more kids universe (Disney), it is also a bit special, but very colorful with great and sweet characters. It also have a lot of the technical and nerdy parts as we find in Iron Man and this combination of Marvel and Disney is actually also working out well.<br/><br/>Baymax is a great character, he is sweet, big, bouncy and clumsy for a hero anyway, but he gets ""whipped"" into shape and have some of the funniest moments of the film. This is a very entertaining film and can be enjoyed by both kids and adults in many ways, but I think it has most for the kids and the more nerdy comic book reading adults :)"
"phubbs","7","0","6","8 February 2015"," Big Hero 6
","So who knew this was actually based on a Marvel comicbook?...be honest. Yes this is indeed an adaptation although not an entirely accurate one, is that a problem? no not really. None the less I must report that the comicbook does appear to be very different from the movie. Firstly Baymax seems to be a huge green thing that turns into a dragon, one or two characters are out (most notably Silver Samurai) and one or two characters seem to have been created (or changed) for the movie, plus the plot has of course been altered.<br/><br/>So who knew the movies title of 'Big Hero 6' was the name of the superhero team we see? well I didn't! Up to this point I always thought that was the name for Baymax (didn't know he was called Baymax). Its only at the point when the team come together I sat there counting and suddenly realised...oooh...I'm an idiot.<br/><br/>OK so I won't natter about the plot seeing as its a formulaic ordeal involving the creation of a superhero team, coming to terms with the death of a loved one, battling an evil baddie (with obvious twist), the team realising their potential and friendship and finally saving a damsel in distress. There is nothing new to see there whatsoever...fact. The characters though are a well thought out and well designed bunch that touch on every type of superhero trait whilst utilising some older movie ideas. <br/><br/>Fred (in the comic) is a typical beanie wearing skateboarding type dude who's costume is a fire breathing Godzilla-esque affair which I personally didn't like much, it didn't fit in if you ask me. In the comic he can transform into a Godzilla type monster sooo...yeah. Wasabi (in the comic) is now a well built but very nervous black man with dreads which kinda loses the emphasis of the original character if you ask me (after doing some homework), but lets not go down that route again. He has some very cool plasma wrist blades that look like they've come straight outta the Halo universe. GoGo Tomago (in the comic) does look quite similar to her comicbook counterpart but in this movie her suit has a very Tron-like appearance with the glowing frisbee disc things and her speed abilities. Honey Lemon (in the comic) again is very much like her comicbook counterpart, the closest of the lot actually with her silly super powered nano-purse faithfully recreated here. Hiro (in the comic) is a 14 year old teen and apart from his glasses going AWOL he also looks quite close to his comicbook roots whilst his sidekick Baymax looks like a giant Super Bomberman (its a video game).<br/><br/>I'm unsure but I believe the main baddie character of Professor Callaghan was created for the movie. Although I must say this characters look with the Kabuki mask, long dark trench coat and seeing him ride around on his legion of black micro robots was really cool! All the characters looked admittedly very slick considering this is advertised as a kids flick, I certainly didn't expect it at all, an ice cool blend of Disney and Marvel. Speaking of slick the visuals overall were excellent, I loved the architectural/cultural combination of San Francisco and Tokyo despite the name of San Fransokyo being God awful. That also got me thinking...why the hell has San Francisco basically been invaded by the Japanese in this world?? to the point where they have actually changed the cities name!! Jesus! immigration much! Bit odd, doubt that would ever happen but it looked good here...well more like Tokyo than Frisco but anyway. <br/><br/>I'll be honest and say that the movie starts off slow. Once we reach the critical sequences where the plot evolves you pretty much know what's gonna happen for the rest of the movie, its all very predictable stuff. Even though this is a kids fantasy film and its based on a comicbook the story is very questionable, I mean in this universe literately anything can be built or invented...anything! The game changing, earth-shattering, human race altering micro robots Hiro creates were just a pet project to get him into a college for flips sake! Plus those things are way more incredible than Baymax...whom I might add is actually a bit annoying from time to time.<br/><br/>I found myself liking this movie mainly because of the characters, their look/designs and the visuals in general, I adored the Japanese culture on show. The story was kinda weak and generic with a generic but (as already said) cool looking bad guy...if it wasn't for that sweetass yet completely unexplained Kabuki mask he wouldn't have looked half as cool. When I say unexplained I mean why a Kabuki mask? I know he used it to control the micro robots but why use a Japanese theatrical mask? Other than that the action was standard superhero fair, a big car chase through a mysteriously deserted San Fransokyo...seriously where the hell was everyone?? All the characters seem to become top notch fighters and highly proficient with their weapons in no time, post credits scene which is typically Marvel etc...usual stuff.<br/><br/>So even though everything I've seen here is completely and utterly unoriginal bringing nothing new to the table at all...I still enjoyed it. There is decent camaraderie, heart-warming moments, its fast and frantic, it balances humour with a semi-serious tone and its easily accessible for all. It has all that yet its still clearly a very colourful toy/action figure advert, I have no clue how the hell they came to Baymax's look if you see the comicbook version, and still...still we can't escape the Stan Lee cameos.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","Get ready to fall in love and fist bump with the cutest plus-sized inflatable you'll ever meet this side of San Fransokyo in Walt Disney Animation Studios first release since the still popular FROZEN. <br/><br/>Inspired by Marvel's comic book series Big Hero 6, BIG HERO 6 is a colourful and highly entertaining anime sci-fi that will have even the most bored parents and escorts put their smartphones away and sit back transfixed.<br/><br/>Set in the bustling metropolis of San Fransokyo, the thematic tale of love and loss tells the story of orphaned brothers Hiro (voiced by Ryan Potter) and Tadashi (voiced by Daniel Henney) Hamada whose shared love and prodigious talent for robotics leads them in different directions: Tadashi to design for the greater good and Hiro, to hustle for cash in underground robot fight clubs (a rousing homage to REAL STEEL). <br/><br/>In an attempt to inspire and encourage the disillusioned Hiro to attend university, Tadashi takes Hiro to his robotics laboratory at the university and introduces him to his robotic design project Baymax, a personal homecare companion that can identify and treat medical problems. Impressed by the technology designs created by Tadashi and his think-lab friends Honey Lemon, Go Go Tomago, Wasabi, and Fred, Hiro decides to modify his microbot design that links together telepathically in any arrangement imaginable and present it to the university which subsequently becoming a hit. <br/><br/>A terrible tragedy ensues that sends Hiro's life spiraling out of control until he accidentally activates Tadashi's Baymax (Scott Adsit). After a delightful re-introduction, Baymax and Hiro discover that the microbots were stolen and now controlled by an evil-doing masked man. <br/><br/>Seeking revenge, Hiro brings Baymax and Tadashi's nerdy think-tank friends together to form a group of techno-enhanced nerd avengers who can bring the kabuki-masked killer to justice.<br/><br/>Whilst BIG HERO 6 can be a bit clunky at times, the film's visual style is a clever mash up of anime and manga that just draws your attention further in to the field depths. But the real draw to this film is Baymax. Logical and literal, this character is both endearing and hilariously funny without meaning to be. He doesn't know how. And yet, maybe that's why it works so well and why you'll sit with bated breath waiting to see what he'll do or say next.<br/><br/>With this scan complete and on a scale of one to ten, the rate of painfully entertaining viewing sits at around a seven or eight."

","I almost never come to the IMDb reviews prior to seeing a new release because I don't want to be influenced by either the positive or negative ones. This time I missed out on learning that there's an after credits cameo by the legendary Stan Lee, Marvel Comics' all time go-to guy for everything super-hero. Had I known ""Big Hero 6"" came from an all but forgotten Marvel property, I would have hung around.<br/><br/>In the execution though you'd never know it. The characters are ones I'd never heard of before, and my understanding is that they don't really represent the ones from the comic book. So strictly speaking, it didn't really make a difference one way or the other. I guess for kids this will be a fairly entertaining flick, the characters are colorful with cool names like Honey Lemon, Wasabi and Fred. Baymax reminded me of the marshmallowy looking guy at the end of ""Ghostbusters"".<br/><br/>The concept that intrigued me the most was all that business about microbots and how mind control might eventually play a part in shaping reality the way it was portrayed here. It's kind of a scary thought actually but you know someone's working on stuff like this behind the scenes. After all, cell phones started out as communication devices on 'Star Trek' back in the Sixties, so who knows what's coming down the pike.<br/><br/>For me at least, the film didn't break any new ground in the way of story telling or animation. There was a minor twist identifying the real villain of the piece, but essentially, this has all been said and done before, so toward the end of the picture I was getting kind of antsy. Seeing the picture was part of the day's festivities for my granddaughter's birthday. She and her friend are six years old and it looked like they were getting a kick out of it along with the big box of popcorn and soft drink. Neither one knew anything about Stan Lee."
"wolfneck","6","0","12","20 November 2014"," Not Disney's best work, but Baymax and Hiro delights
","Let's start with the basics. This is a Disney film regarding Marvel characters and as such, nods towards both franchises are littered throughout the film. Many people caught on with the Disney part with cameos from Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen's Hans and Chicken Little to name a few. <br/><br/>The Marvel part was a bit more subtle. Baymax (Scott Adsit) seems unable to comprehend expressions and metaphors, similar to Guardian of the Galaxy's Drax The Destroyer. Also, Baymax's initial flight parallels that of Tony Stark in the 2008 Iron Man, straight down to using his hands to stabilizing himself and flying high up into the sky before crashing down. However, I saw more nods towards Marvel's top team, the Avengers, with Baymax in angry mode chasing Callaghan similar to the Hulk chasing after Black Widow and the portal in the sky used in Big Hero 6's final fight akin to that conjured up by the Tessaract.<br/><br/>With that being said, Big Hero 6 would probably have been what the Avengers would look like if Marvel released it before Iron Man.<br/><br/>Introducing a team of 6 to an audience with no prior knowledge of them takes considerable skill. The Avengers went about this problem by first having stand-alone films for its characters, giving much more time for character development and a reason for us to care. Then when the big crossover happened, the characters are already well established and you head in knowing what to expect. Big Hero 6 unfortunately does not have this luxury, and in putting Hiro (Ryan Potter) and Baymax in the spotlight, it reduces the rest of the team to bland stereotypes.<br/><br/>Gogo Tamago (Jamie Chung) is the tough one with a devil-may-care attitude. Honey Lemon (Génesis Rodríguez) is the naive optimist. Wasabi (Damon Wayans, Jr.) is the sassy black guy and Fred (T.J. Miller) is the stoner comic relief. Now tell me you haven't seen this before in a teen movie somewhere. My point is the characters are so underwritten just to fit the purpose of having six heroes in Big Hero 6. Wasabi and Honey Lemon takes the short end of this already short stick and does so little that they can actually be removed from the film without repercussions.<br/><br/>The whole film just feels so rushed, with the movie's short runtime. The team went from scientific nerds to full-fledged superheroes in what appears as a day. All throughout the film, we only saw glimpses of advanced robotics, with current technology, like cars and subway, still in use. Then the film takes a dive to the extremely imaginative with teleporters and another dimension just so Disney could fit in their time-tested tropes<br/><br/>a) find a motive for our shock villain (Surprise!) b) the need to create a tear jerking moment at the end of the film. <br/><br/>The affair with Callaghan losing his daughter was extremely forced. Callaghan was portrayed as a charismatic professor who faked his death about twenty minutes into the film. Majority of these twenty minutes was spent on Hiro and Tadashi's relationship (more on that later) and we only saw glimpses of Callaghan and even less dialogue then. Nothing was hinted about him having a daughter or the fact that the daughter is lost. Coupled with the horrendously little screen time, you really don't sympathize with Callaghan's plight when they finally reveal it later in the film<br/><br/>It comes down to the two main heroes, Hiro and Baymax, and boy, did they steal the show. Baymax's role of surrogate brother, faithful companion and personal healthcare assistant is heartwarming, and the cuddly robot shows more emotion that every character in this film (save maybe Hiro) despite having an expressionless face. Also of note, Baymax's innocent nature ensures laughter every time he misinterprets statements or discover something new, even though the rehashed jokes threaten to run thin. Hiro appears to be on the other end of the emotional and logical spectrum, with his angst from losing his brother and superior intellect featured mostly in the film. His relation with Tadashi was well established despite Tadashi's early death, and Hiro's eventual acceptance and bonding with Baymax results in the highlight of the film.<br/><br/>One thing I must commend Disney on is the incredibly gorgeous landscape of San Fransokyo. I found myself marveling at the sights during the fight and flight scenes more than the action itself. San Fransokyo allows you to first spend time in predominately westernized sector before moving on to an eastern sector in the blink of an eye. Yet both sectors are not individual as they weave in minor elements from the other, creating a futuristic and colourful east-meets-west city.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Big Hero 6 is not a bad film. However, this is supposed to be the story of a team, not just an individual. Disney's inability to produce that resulted in them not being able to showcase their finest work."
"bendy392","7","0","15","15 November 2014"," When Disney and Marvel collide.
","Well, it was time for Disney to make its own Marvel movie seeing how Disney bought Marvel Entertainment. And we have it—Big Hero 6, which of course is a Marvel comic series. And as everyone expects from Marvel and Disney, it's big, fun, upbeat, action-packed and all sorts of awesome. With this movie, I think it's pretty good. I wouldn't say GREAT, but it's definitely not terrible or awful. I liked it. The characters can be fun to watch and the action is entertaining and can also be pretty deep.<br/><br/>Here's the story. Hiro (get it? Like ""hero""? Haha) is a teenage science geek, who spends his time building fighting robots and uses them in duels on the streets, which are illegal. His older brother, Tadashi, is impressed with his work and takes him to the university he works at, which is full of other students who share Hiro's gift of creativity. Hiro takes the opportunity to apply there to put his skills to the test. Later on, an explosion occurs at the university and kills Tadashi. Hiro decides to investigate the occurrences of his death and teams up with his fellow students as well as a healthcare robot named Baymax, which was built by Tadashi. From there, it's laughs, action and all that great superhero stuff.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 is a fun movie for kids and adults alike, but of course, it's got some problems. Like, for example, the first five minutes of the film is WAY too rushed. The pacing is so fast, you have to really pay attention otherwise you'll be scratching your head. But after that, it dies down and the pacing's reduced to normal. Also, SOME, not all, of the jokes are pretty lame. But there are some laughing hard moments too, so I think it overshadows that. Another problem is that I think the jokes are maybe a little too distracting. For instance, the jokes are all over the place and while they're funny, they kind of take us away from the drama. Like almost immediately after a dramatic moment, there's a joke and everyone's laughing. If they gave the dramatic moments a little more time to soak up more of the inner conflict of what's going on, as well as their own scene, it would've been more effective that way. However, the dramatic moments are really good. It goes to pretty dark territory later on, when Hiro gets more and more desperate to stop the main villain even to the extent of abandoning his friends.<br/><br/>How are the characters? Wellthey're pretty likable, but I wish they got more focus. I mean, yeah, we know who they are, but they're played for laughs most of time, other than seeing them in action. Also, yeah, Baymax is just friggin' adorable. I mean, come on, you just want to give the guy a big hug. And his moments are pretty funny. Hiro's interesting because, like I said, the dramatic moments do give the character moments to dwell on his personal tragedy.<br/><br/>So Big Hero 6 does have its problems, but NEVER to an extent where it's boring or lazy. It's entertaining and kept me intrigued in the plot. It's got good action and a fun story for all ages as Disney provides with the help of Marvel. What will Disney come up with next?"
"iva_mikulic","7","0","15","14 November 2014"," It's like Avengers but for kids
","I liked it but I thought it was nothing special. I think it is a good movie for kids but not for adults so that's why I am giving it a 7/10. To me it was exactly like Avengers but for kids. There is a lot of action in it but there is also a couple of ""awww"" moments so I'd say that it is nicely balanced. The story has depth but not enough in my opinion. Hiro is a likable character, a bit unrealistic but then again I keep forgetting that this movie's targeted audience is kids. It's just that I expected a bit more. There is a lot of animated movies I love like How To Train Your Dragon, even Tangled but this just isn't one of them. It left kind of a bland impression on me but I still liked it and I still had some laugh out loud moments while watching it. Overall enjoyable movie, in my opinion not interesting enough for adults but a good movie for kids! :)"
"brent_or","7","0","16","14 November 2014"," Good, Not Great, Points for the Animation
","Context on perspective: I think that Frozen is way overrated, much prefer Tangled, and think that The Incredibles is the best Pixar film.<br/><br/>Big Hero 6 has a lot going for it. Fantastic animation as expected, some inspired futuristic fusion design and an iconic new friend-type character and source of comedy in Baymax. I think that it is better than Frozen, if only because the story makes more sense and the setting is more interesting.<br/><br/>Hiro is a good protagonist, but the film's focus kind of meanders. As someone mentioned in a review that I read elsewhere, there is a really good robotics-focused theme here, but as the plot plays out, that theme gets kind of buried under a business-as-usual villain- driven plot. Which is to say that BH6 doesn't manage the same sort of transcendence as the best animated films, the early Pixar installments in particular.<br/><br/>That being said, there is a lot of eye-candy and inspired visual design to enjoy here, and for that reason alone, I think that there is appeal for older/adult viewers. The supporting characters really could have stood some more character development as they are an interesting group, but if nothing else, they'll make fun action figures.<br/><br/>If you don't expect too much out of this one, it won't let you down. It's a good time, and hints at the potential of the computer animation medium to tackle truly expansive, futuristic material in the sci-fi vein."
"Red_Identity","Null","0","17","12 November 2014"," Good fun
","Big Hero 6 is certainly solid, if maybe very good. It's extremely formulaic, maybe even moreso than I would've guessed or wanted, but it's solid entertainment. The animation is really, really boring, but it has some good comedy. All of the comedic scenes revolving around Baymax are gold, sometimes incredibly hilarious. Overall, good, but certainly nothing special, definitely not as great as some of the other animated films this year. Certainly not as memorable as the film I saw right before it. But then again, its ambitions were always going to pale in comparison, and I'd like to see how it fares when watching it on its own, maybe better."
"sesht","Null","0","17","8 November 2014"," For your well-being
","The key element that remains with one after a viewing of this flick is one of irony, based on how it all plays out. Not just limited to how superheroes and arch-nemeses function in their respective universes (think 'The Incredibles'), but also extends to how Disney and Marvel are feeding off of one another after the merger/takeover (there's an almost casual nod to an FF4 kinda team-up, that was a little too on-the-nose for comfort, but might be considered inevitable in a flick of this sort, considering the overall context).<br/><br/>The dark elements are all there, with this being another animated flick to take on themes of death and loss, and not being too subtle about it (which is perhaps good, when contrasted with the way 'HTTYD2' handled it - rather awkwardly, and how 'Frozen' chose to handle it). Death and loss arising therefrom is a part of life, and this is the only window to that aspect of life for the little ones who are this flick's target demographic (for my money, 'Up' and 'Finding Nemo' and perhaps even 'The Lion King' handled it with dignity, and it's perhaps a bit much to expect everyone to match up to those standards, or maybe not). Would I want my little one to watch it and field awkward questions after? No, absolutely not. But hey, it's no longer my choice to make, since other kids in school are gonna watch it, and you gotta face it, one time or the other, or have some stranger explain it to your near-and-dear. I'd rather deal with it firsthand.<br/><br/>While most of the first act is very endearing, esp. the kids' relationship with their scatterbrained aunt (there should have been much, much more of Maya Rudolph's Aunt Cass, and this flick would've been all the better for it, more Disney-like, in any case, but no one asked me), the camaraderie and joie-de-vivre among the college nerd gang (again, cut short rather abruptly) and the budding relationship between our (kinda) lovable 'Hiro' and his healthcare companion, who's absolutely endearing, and yes, huggable. A lot. <br/><br/>And then it all derails in the final act (might have been required, but there was a movie of this genre, the animated superhero genre, that is, that did it wayyyyy better). The Incredibles. Actually, there was one other, a lesser, more underrated work, that still comes to mind in a way that almost banishes this one to be it's really lesser cousin - Megamind. I am surprised at this, since closure is one of Disney's, and Disney-Pixar's think-tank's strengths. They really missed the boat with this one, and it calls to mind (mine at least), the misfire that was this year's HTTYD2 (How to train your dragon 2 - oh, how I'd looked forward to that one). Even the arcs that various characters in 'Bolt' had (one of the helmers of this one made that one too) is far better than the clichéd way in which plot contrivances pile on in this one, and the angsty emotions go on for far too long in a kids flick. I get it - I am one of the adults that the studio wants to court, but there are better references that have done the job, and though the people in charge try hard, they don't quite pull it off. <br/><br/>Conclusively though, it's a big-screen experience, and though it has quite a few pitfalls on its way to its conclusion, there are moments that seem quite inspired, and perhaps that is worth the price of admission. 3D for sure, though there are audience members out there that do not understand the concept of depth (wanting everything to be thrown at them, and only then feel it's 3 dimensional) who might wanna choose the 2D option. Not another Disney classic in the making, though not for lack of trying."
