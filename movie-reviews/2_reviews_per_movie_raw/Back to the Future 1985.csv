"ivo-cobra8","10","177","191","17 April 2017"," A classic masterpiece the original the only best my favorite time travel film of all time
","What can I say about this movie that was already said? It is my favorite time travel sci-fi, adventure epic comedy in the 80's and I love this movie to death! When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE the 80s. It's simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it! <br/><br/>I firstly saw this movie in the early 90's as a kid on VHS tape and I was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. This movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic at acting. Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.<br/><br/>Back to the Future (1985) <br/><br/>From the Academy Award ""- winning team of Steven Spielberg"" and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.<br/><br/>At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car ""DeLorean"". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.<br/><br/>After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.<br/><br/>What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.<br/><br/>They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.<br/><br/>More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost ""chewed every scenes"" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.<br/><br/>Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs ""The Power of Love,"" and ""Earth Angel"".<br/><br/>The rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as "" A Modern/Classic Masterpiece! """

","Back To The Future (1985) is my all time favourite movie. It's a thoroughly feel good film, accessible to all ages and enjoyable from the 1st to the 45th time of watching and never fails to bring a smile.  Humour for all ages and a kick-ass car to boot, what more could a young kid want? Or those young at heart?<br/><br/>From Marty's ""Johnny B Goode"" to Doc's classic ""Run For It Marty!"" You'll find that even though you know what's coming next, you'll still laugh. It is the ultimate feel good movie, the weed overcomes the bully, the dreamers wishes come true and all because a nosey old bird thrusts for a nickel ""Save The Clock Tower!""<br/><br/>It's popularity spawned 2 sequels and although it got decreasingly good in terms of quality as a film, Back To The Future remains the best film in my repetoire and a safe bet when you need to feel good.<br/><br/>It gets a solid 9 out of 10, comedy, fantasy, the gorgeous Lea Thompson, the insane but comic Doc and the typical teenager Marty make this film a must for all young at heart."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","469","527","1 June 2000"," How could anything be more fun than this?
","Back To The Future is such an inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking that it is impossible to forget about it. The casting of every character involved was absolutely perfect, and the performances were spectacular. I first saw this film when I was six years old, and it is the only movie that I know of that I don't think I could ever get sick of.<br/><br/>
One of the best things about Back To The Future is that it really makes you think. You can have in-depth conversations about the plausibility of the story-line and spend hours discussing the film. The story is awesome, it is delivered cleverly and entertainingly, and the movie as a whole is just so much FUN that it can be forgiven whatever number of time-travel discrepancies that may be found in the plot. <br/><br/>I cannot recommend this movie enough. I have never found a movie other than this one that provides such a huge dose of great fun, and it has the desirable quality where you are able to see something new each time you see it. The only problem is that they stopped at part III."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","113","124","29 July 2008"," A Time -Travelling Classic
","Zemeckis's 'Back To The Future' trilogy has been a childhood favourite for a long time. Having revisited it today, brought me to a nostalgic state. The 80's saw a lot of excellent original fun 'young' films like 'Back To The Future' (of course), 'Better Off Dead', 'Heathers', 'The Breakfast Club' etc. What really made these films immensely enjoyable then, and classics today, is that they really reflected what it was like being a young person in the 80s. The movies themselves were well written, well executed, well acted and they cut straight to the point.<br/><br/>Back to 'Back To The Future'. This one is sheer fun, even today. There's an incredible energy about it but it still manages to stay an 'innocent' film. The music is very effective. It's slick and follows a steady pace. The special effects are decent. Though people might pick on the plausibility of the time travelling, I think this is really a very minor flaw because it is overall a well written movie and the point was to entertain. Yet, this is not to say that it's brainless entertainment. I think it cleverly brings forth some interesting themes and I liked how they funnily used some ideas of Oedipus Rex's story.<br/><br/>The acting is superb overall. Christopher Lloyd as the over-the-top mad scientist is a laugh riot. Michael J. Fox totally owns Marty McFly with his natural charisma, raw energy and brilliant dialogue delivery. Lea Thompson is cute and vivacious and Crispin Glover is good.<br/><br/>'Back To The Future' is one of the most enjoyable time-travelling classics. It's over 23 years old and it still hasn't gotten old. Sadly, they don't make it like this these days but then again we always can revisit them. That's why they're classics."

","A funny sci-fi? Unusual but here it not only works but does so spectacularly. A whimsical but very clever time travel story that bedazzles you leaving you wanting more.<br/><br/>The charasmatic Michael J Fox plays a wonderful bumbling high schooler searching for love, a guitar gig and his existence which he himself threatens to erase.<br/><br/>Clever and humourous references litter this fun flick; references which are further improved upon in the sequels. Views of the same scenes from different angles, different perspectives and different timelines abound.<br/><br/>Fun for the entire family."
"mm-39","10","157","182","28 November 2004"," Great movie
","One of the last movies I went with sister to see back in 86. The film blew my mind. My friends never wanted to see this one. I was happy I went. Many year's latter, I bought ""Back to the Future"" at Mc Donalds for $2.99 or for some other low price with a meal. The film ages well, and I love it just the same. The director and screen writer mixes science fiction, humor, and action perfectly. A big component of the script is time line theory which drives the story. Marty has many problems to fix, and finds out more than anyone wants to know about their parents. Michael J Fox and Christopher Loyd were excellently casted. Marty and Doc what a chemistry. With the film series one see the many dualities with time travel, that become a constant with the movie. The town clock, being awoke in a strange place, and letters. Keep this in mind when watching the 2 other sequels. The theory that time repeats itself is evident. What a time machine, the Delorian adds to this movie. Worth watch over again. 10 out of 10! Thank you TBS for showing all 3 films."
"hannahsutcliffe","10","47","52","21 July 2015"," Absolute Classic
","As a child, I used to watch this movie religiously. I loved the chemistry between Doc Brown and Marty McFly, I loved the all too familiar soundtrack and the ridiculous way in which George McFly laughs. This movie has become such a nostalgic and feel-good film for me. I had the good fortunate to see all three 'Back to the Future' movies in cinema last year and it was such an experience to watch this timeless classic with people who enjoy this film as much as I do. Everyone has to see this film at least once in their life! Such an amazing, funny Sci-Fi from the 1980's. I just can't get enough of this movie - it will just never get old. Cannot recommend it enough!"

","BACK TO THE FUTURE (1985) **** Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, Thomas F. Wilson, Marc McClure, Wendy Jo Sperber. This generation's ""It's a Wonderful Life""?  Think about it.  Very popular and very entertaining sci-fi comedy that made Fox a movie star after success with tv's ""Family Ties"", casting him, after Eric Stoltz was dropped, as Marty McFly who winds up in a nuclear-powered DeLorean time-machine and is sent back in time to 1955 by his quintessentially eccentric friend Dr. Emmet Brown (Lloyd doing a fine Art Carney).  There he meets up with his parents to be and realizes his chance encounters have changed his future and he must see history repeat itself or perish.  High-concept hilarity and some truly ingenious schematics thanks to screenwriter Bob Gale and director Bob Zemeckis.  Wondering what it would be like to never be born and/or what it would be like if things were different...see what I mean.  Oscar-nominated song ""The Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis (who has a fun cameo) fuels this dynamo gem of a film.  Classic."
"Big Movie Fan","Null","126","159","4 June 2002"," Time Travel Movies Are Always Brilliant
","Time travel movies never disappoint-that is because the concept of time travel is a very interesting one which most people must have thought about at one time or another. What would happen if you went back in time and an innocuous act changed the course of history for better or worse? It's something to think about.<br/><br/>I won't reveal any plot details for this movie because it will spoil it for those who haven't seen it. Let's just say that Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly ends up back in 1955 where a sequence of events inadvertently orchestrated by Marty threaten his very existence. He is aided by Doc Brown played brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd who tries to get him back to 1985 without causing any damage to the fabric of time.<br/><br/>The movie is great-and I feel it can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their individual tastes in film genres. In fact, I find it hard to believe anyone could dislike a film like this. It has action, adventure, plenty of humour and some cool moments. All the actors involved in the movie play their parts great.<br/><br/>Anyone who watches this movie will love it."
"DMP-2","10","26","30","11 January 2007"," Best Part of a the Best Movie Ever
","When you talk about Back to the Future, you have to talk about the whole trilogy. Because Zemeckis and Gale didn't make sequels they extended the length of one film, which is very different than a sequel.<br/><br/>The ultimate film must allow the audience feel part of the film and relate to the characters. This film is the best because it takes a fantasy story and makes it adaptable to real-life. I don't know how soon anyone will be able to time-travel, but you can relate to Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox) reaction to the change. Even if you're not a teenager you can believe it in someway. Back to the Future is the perfect and its been extended into a masterpiece with 2 sequels or extensions as I see it. Definitely a must see, if your pathetic enough not to have seen in at least the last 8 years.<br/><br/>Amazing story by Gale and Zemeckis. Great acting especially by Michael J. Fox, but also great work by Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Tom Wilson. Such an exciting an involved story."

","A young man (Michael J.

The movie has had such a strong impression on everyone, whether they have seen it or not, as it completely permeated pop culture.<br/><br/>The script is genius, not only how it parallels 1955 and 1985 (some of the references are dynamite), but how it set the scene for the sequels (despite allegedly not intending to have any). This is just one clever gag after another, and may require repeated viewings to catch them all."

Ha ha! I'm back on track! Well, obviously, this is my first review for the first Back to the Future and when I came her to IMDb, I knew this was a well loved movie, I was just amazed at it being on the top 250, but I can't give it a lower rating because Back to the Future was an excellent film that was ground breaking for it's time and still today.<br/><br/>Marty McFly and his good friend, The Doc, are two science nuts. Marty isn't really happy with his home life and the fact that he and his parents are very square and strict, The Doc calls Marty and shows him his latest invention, his De Lauren that he built into a time machine. When the government go after The Doc and Marty has to get away, he jumps in the car and goes back to the year of 1955, when his parents met. Instead of the way his mom and dad met happening to his dad, he ends up being in the position and mom ends up falling for her son, not even knowing! But he has to make sure his parents are together in time so he can get back without altering the future.<br/><br/>Back to the Future to this day is still a timeless treasure that I notice more and more is becoming part of a newer generation. Michael J. Fox should be proud, his work will be remembered for a long time. Back to the Future worked so well because of the great story and the humor was great, the whole cast worked together and made a terrific movie that will be looked back on thirty years from now and still be considered cool.<br/><br/>10/10"

"Angry_Arguer","10","163","233","3 July 2003"," The Lost Blockbuster
","Back to the Future is one of those rare, almost forgotten, pieces of pop culture that, surprisingly, draws little attention to itself.  Unlike such notable gimmicks as Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jaws, and Independence Day, there aren't any low-budget leeches trying to imitate off this work and cash-in on its success. This is due to the near flawless script.  Why it didn't win an Oscar, you're guess is as good as mine.  Making a time-travel storyline as in this movie that doesn't fall into plot holes the size of Terminator's is exceptionally difficult.  I'd know.<br/><br/>The film starts slow, and gradually accelerates as it progresses.  You could almost call it a Jerry Bruckheimer movie for kids with Spielberg's trademark nostalgia.  The characters themselves are typical stereotypes for a movie like this and none of them, not even Marty himself, gel with potential.  In some ways it's as if MAD magazine made the film in an attempt to be serious.<br/><br/>With such an automotive obsession as this film has, one must wonder if George Lucas was involved.<br/><br/>Overall, I have to praise this movie for its inventiveness and originality, even if it created most of our time-travel cliches.  4 out of 5 stars.  Well worth your time."

","When I was little, my mom bought this movie on DVD for my dad. He turned it on one day and I brushed it off as ""one of those weird old movies daddy likes"". Eventually, I came out, sat down, and watched it. And the rest was history. I was so in love with this movie, that for 80's day at my school, I dressed up as Marty McFly. Nowadays, I love the movie more than ever. My favorite thing about this movie is the relationship between Doc and Marty. Most of the time, when a kid or teen hang out with an older person in movies and TV, people think they're more than friends. How many jokes have you heard involving Batman and Robin's relationship? However, Marty and Doc's relationship is pure friendship. I'm really good friends with one of my drama teachers, so I know how strong that type of friendship is. What else can I say? I love everything about this movie! If you haven't seen this movie, go see it now. Like...right now. Stop what your doing and go see it."
"hines_mark","10","15","18","22 April 2015"," Best ever. Period.
","What else needs to be said? Anyone that knows anything about filmmaking knows that this is the best film ever made. Try watching certain movies over and over and see how quickly you get sick of it. This movie is different. The depth and richness of storytelling, the characters, oh my, the characters. Doc Brown is easily one of the best and most memorable on screen characters in any film ever. Biff, Griff, Buford...best on screen bully ever! Compare this movie to other epic movies, such as Star Wars - while those types of movies are great in their own right, Back to the Future is different. There is a warmth and comfort to the way that Bob Gale and Bob Zemekis crafted this screenplay. It's pure genius. And for all of you fans that always have to mention ""plot holes"" or ""minor flaws"" - please make sure you have seen every second of the 25th Anniversary set of the trilogy that has an entire bonus disc, as well as more bonus features and two different commentaries on the main discs. Bob Gale is aware of every little detail about his script and talks about it in the commentaries. My true love of this film came as a result of watching all the behind the scenes material - which if you haven't seen, you must see it if you're a fan of this movie. It will give you a whole new level of appreciation for this film. As someone that is into filmmaking and a total nerd about directing, cameras, technical details, I can't get enough of watching and listening to these guys talk about how everything came together just right for this masterpiece to happen. I can't say enough about this film, its actors and all the people involved in making it. Truly something not to be rivaled and we will probably never see anything close to it ever again."

","Synchronize your watches! If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88mph, you're gonna see some serious s***. Directed & written by Robert Zemeckis, this movie will forever remind me of what good-feel movie is supposed to be. The movie is about a teenager from 1985, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) whom is sent back in time to 1955. While, he was there, he meets his future parents in high school and accidentally becomes his mother, Lorraine (Lea Thompson)'s romantic interest, causing a time-rip. Marty must repair the damage to history by trying to get his parents to fall in love, and with the help of scientist Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown (Christopher Lloyd), while, also finding a way to return to 1985. I love the fish out of water history time-travel comedy, with the high-stakes action scenes. It was very entertaining. I love how the film has its running gags, and inside jokes of historical pop culture events; of Robert Zemeckis's work, and what was happening in the 1980s at the time. The movie has everything for every audience member, at the time. While, most movies were risqué and adult-aimed at the time; this movie balance it, enough to make it watchable for both family and single house-hold settlings. Parents went to go see it for nostalgia reasons. While the movie is mostly set in 1950's, it's truly a mark of the 1980's. I have to give the movie props with its controversial movie dilemma, with the Oedipal relationship with his mother. In any other movie, this might be tasteless, and turn people off, but Back to the Future made it work. I can also buy that, teenager Marty McFly would be friends with an older mad scientist, Doc Brown without it being creepy. Both have this father/son relationship that I love from this film. Mad praise to Christopher Lloyd for creating this character for his own. I can't see, anybody besides him. The production was indeed challenging. There were some changes that help the film, a lot. First off, is the title of the film, the film was almost call, 'Spaceman from Pluto'. Gladly, somebody came to their senses, and went back into the title, 'Back to the Future'. Another is that, while, Michael J. Fox was the first choice to play Marty McFly, but he was committed to the show Family Ties. So they hired Eric Stoltz. I wouldn't say, Eric Stoltz would be awful in the movie, but indeed, Michael J Fox was the best choice for the film and they wait on production, until Fox's schedule opened up. The supporting cast is well-acted. Crispin Glover that played George McFly got all George's nerdy mannerisms, right. Lea Thompson is just amazing, and beautiful actress to play Lorraine McFly. Thomas F. Wilson as the bully, Biff Tannen was just hilarious. Every scene with him, made the film, so much better. You'll love to hate him. The set use for the film is one of the most famous movie backlot, previously being used in such works as 1962's To Kill a Mocking Bird, 1960's Inherit the Wind, and others works. The movie had a pretty good pace. There weren't a lot of slow or boring moments. Maybe, the beginning, it does take them, forever to get the time travel part of the film. Eight minutes were cut, including Marty watching his mom cheat during an exam, George getting stuck in a telephone booth and Marty pretending to be Darth Vader. Thank God, they cut the 'Nuking the Fridge' idea. An early draft of the Back to the Future script saw Marty travelling through time in a fridge and being caught in a nuclear bomb detonation. Spielberg would later use this in 2008's Indiana Jones & Kingdom Skull. Zemeckis almost cut out the ""Johnny B. Goode"" sequence as he felt it did not advance the story, but the preview audience loved it, so it was kept. The visual/special effects are just ground-breaking for the time, and it's just beautiful to watch. The opening scene, flawlessly sets up the film's central themes of time and space, provides heaps of exposition. The music by Alan Silvestri is emotional, epic and intense music. It's give the feel of two friends alone, fighting alone against two of the greatest forces ever know to humanity; time and fate. About Huey Lewis and the News, ""The Power of Love"". It's a product of its time. It doesn't hurt or help the film. It's just there. I do love the 'Earth Angel' song. It's romantic as hell. There are some nitpicks that I could focus on, like the time-travel plot-holes, but trying to understand the logic of all the time travel paradoxes, would take you out of the movie, and give you a headache. It's not worth it. Still, how his parents never find out that Marty McFly look like the kid, Calvin Klein from their childhood? Other faults of the movie are, the Pepsi product placement and its over used clichés. The movie also one of those films that would audience would see anything in it, as people see symbolism from 9/11 tragedy, JFK assassination conspiracy, Aliens, and others. Others see the film, themes taken from ancient and spiritual myths such as Kronos vs Zeus, the Bible, and others. One thing, it did influence is the skateboarding culture. The movie occurred during the 1980s infancy of the skateboarding sub-culture. The film was such a success, that it create two sequels, 1989's 'Back to the Future Parts II' and 1990's 'Back to the Future Park III'. It also create an animated series, theme park ride, several video games and a forthcoming musical. As with all great movies, Back to the Future, has stood the test of time. It never gets old. Overall: Power up the DeLorean, turn the time circuits on and get the flux capacitor! Where we're going, we don't need roads."

","I watched this movie again for about the seventh time after a 10 year lapse or so. If there ever was magic on screen, Back to the Future has it. By the end of the film, I was only thinking, ""Wow, Hollywood was once capable of putting magic on the screen."" It really makes you wonder if the best of Hollywood is behind us.<br/><br/>To summarize a few components of the movie: The storyline and plot are superb, even with the minor plot holes. The acting is spot on in every scene. Today's film editors should watch this film a hundred times to see what editing should really be like, nearly flawless. The direction is unbelievable in my opinion. The screen writing and script are perfect as well and will make you laugh and smile throughout the movie. Every line by the awkward McFly family, every crazy rumbling of ""Doc"", and even the cheesy bully taunts of Biff fit together so well.<br/><br/>When I sat down to watch this movie a few days ago, I expected to see an aged movie that I remembered being much better than it actually was. I'm so glad I was wrong."

Dr.Emmett Brown a crazy, funny scientist invents the time machine, the biggest dream of his life. And Marty who is his friend gets to be a part of this awesome adventure by mistake. The best thing about this movie is how it shows whatever happens is bound to happen whether you want or not. And how with change in your attitude or with some help you can completely change your whole life. ""If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything."" - Dr. Emmett Brown Back to the Future is an amazing movie. This 1985 movie is so much better in quality as compared to the movies nowadays which have a shallow impact on the audience. You will actually feel connected to the movie and glued to your seats till the end There are not many movies of 8.5-like rating which are packed with Comedy, Drama, Adventure of such level... It's a MUST WATCH for all.<br/><br/>Hope you all enjoy it too. Cheers!"

","I feel that there is no such thing as a perfect film,but in today's cinema,""Back to the Future"" comes amazingly close.It has laughs, AND thrills,always a great combination.I am amazed at the attention paid to nearly every single detail here.For example,at the start of the film,Doc and Marty are in the parking lot of the ""Twin Pines Mall"".Then,shortly after Marty arrives in 1955,he accidently runs over one of old man Peabody's beloved pine trees.Toward the end, after Marty returns,the name of the mall changes.This is something you just don't notice until you see the film several times as I have. Excellent casting,particularly Christopher Lloyd as the unforgettable Doc Brown,the humor of the Ronald Reagan bit and the Johnny B. Goode sequence,along with the ultimate heart pounding ending and the attention to detail as I mentioned make this film as close to perfect as you will see in modern cinema.The sequels? Forget them.This is the only one of the trilogy you need to see."

","Plot<br/><br/>Marty's good friend, Dr. Emmett Brown, invents a time machine in the form of a sports car and because of unforeseen circumstances Marty finds himself trapped in 1955 where he ends up meeting his parents and inadvertently fowls up how his parents come together and fall in love. This blunder endangers Marty's very existence because if his parents don't become an item he will never be born so Marty must move heaven and earth to get his parents on a road to romantic bliss. Meanwhile the younger version of Dr. Emmett Brown must find a way to get his time machine working so he can get Marty back to his own time.<br/><br/>Character Development<br/><br/>The lead character Marty McFly doesn't experience much character development, but he is able to influence others dramatically. Only these developments aren't the focus of the story and mostly happen off screen<br/><br/>Acting<br/><br/>One of the ingredients that are equal to the magic of the story itself is the acting. The characters come to life on screen and carry over to everyday life. This has become an event film that has worked its way from pop culture to film history that has helped mark a decade. There is nothing second rate when it comes to the acting for there are no false moments in any of the cast's performances. Though there is a lot of action and racing about, much of what makes repeated viewing of this film possible are the humorous situations that Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) keep getting themselves into and how they react to them. All the lead actors do stellar work and make the trouble that Marty and Emmett get into very believable.<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>There are a lot surprises that are both humorous and entertaining. Again the writing is on a level all to its own where one scene snaps perfectly with the next. There never seems to be a moment in time that doesn't connect to a later moment. It is quite brilliant and the transformation from the cast's older to younger selves is really amazing. Mix this with the energy of the soundtrack and this has got to be one of best movies of the 80s if not that of all time. Top marks all around."

","There are though films, that you need to force yourself to pay attention to, before the payoff (the ultimate example being Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev) and there are films that you can simply enjoy effortlessly, such as Back to the Future, one of the best films ever made! Yes, that's right, it surely belongs to the top 100 best films ever, perhaps top 30. I would rank it as among the top 5 comedies ever made and among the top 10 science fiction films ever made as well!<br/><br/>Why? It is so freaking good! The 1980's were indeed the peak of pop culture: films and music only got better and better until they peaked in the mid 1980's and this is the peak right now: the coolest film ever made.

","Time travel is a difficult subject to cover in a movie, but Spielberg pulled if off with the Back to the Future trilogy.<br/><br/>Michael J Fox in his finest role as Marty Mcfly and Christopher Lloyd as Doctor Emmett Brown make an unlikely pair, then again a DeLorean makes an unlikely time machine, so i guess it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>OK so there are some plot holes (Marty the youngest Mcfly, dissapearing from the photo last) for example, but the overall impact of the film is so entertaining that bigger plot holes could have been allowed and the film would have been just as good. It's hard say why this movie is so great, or why it still looks as good as it does, even by modern standards (don't forget this is 20 years old) but if it has escaped your viewing then just see it as soon as possible and i'll bet you'll want to see the rest of the trilogy the second you finish watching it.<br/><br/>I think it's just entertainment in its purist form.<br/><br/>A big 9/10"

"philip_vanderveken","8","12","16","2 August 2005"," One of the finest Sci-Fi movies ever
","Even though I'm still convinced that the eighties are one of the worst decades in recent history when it comes to movies and music and even though I never liked Sci-Fi movies, there is one big exception to that rule. In my opinion ""Back to the Future"" is not only one of the best movies in the genre, it's also in my list of all time favorite movies. When I saw it for the first time, I remember to be blown away by it. But than again, I was only 10 years old, not exactly an age on which you've already seen many really good movies to which you can compare another one. But even now, 20 years after its first release and after I've seen hundreds of movies, I still like it a lot.<br/><br/>It's 1985 and Marty McFly is a typical teenager who doesn't like his parents and who has some problems at school. His best friend is Doc Brown, a weird inventor of all kinds of (useless) machines. But this time he has invented something that is much more interesting. He has created a plutonium-powered time machine based on a DeLorean. But when something goes wrong, Marty is accidentally sent back to 1955, the time in which his parents still were young. Not only has he got to adapt to this entirely new environment, he also has to make sure that nothing is changed, because that might have serious consequences for the future...<br/><br/>I guess the best reason why this movie works so well and feels so timeless is because they don't use the time machine to go forward. Instead of showing us the future, which wouldn't look exactly like it is right now, they have chosen to go back 30 years, a time period which they new very well and could recreate perfectly. If they hadn't done this, the movie would have felt dated one day and no-one would have liked it because it was far from possible. Another good thing about this movie is the acting. Take for instance Michael J. Fox. Not everything that he has done in his career was very successful, but in this movie he shines. I truly believe that this is one of his best performances ever. The same for Christopher Lloyd. Even though his Dr. Emmett Brown looks like if he could have come out of a cartoon, his acting gives the character something likable and makes you forget about that 'problem'.<br/><br/>Overall I really liked this movie a lot. It's one of the finest examples in Sci-Fi movies and I can keep watching it time after time. That's why I believe that this movie doesn't deserve a rating lower than 8/10."

","SPOILERS When you build a time machine, it just has to be a Deloren really. The corrupt car manufacturer's ultimate advert for his death trap vehicle, ""Back to the Future"" was your regular 1980s classic. Well written, entertaining to watch and with a killer soundtrack, it's a film which has managed to survive the test of time. Released midway through one of the most irrelevant decades in history, this Michael J Fox driven piece is great.<br/><br/>When Dr Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) creates a time machine, he's made his greatest, and most risky invention. Shot for stealing the plutonium power source, Brown's invention undertakes it's first major expedition with young Marty McFly (Fox) behind the wheel. Travelling back thirty years to the 1950s, Marty finds himself in his home town of Hill Valley and in the company of his lovestruck mother (Lea Thompson) and useless father (Crispin Glover). Destroying their entire relationship, Marty manages to completely screw up his entire future. Still, with no way to get home, and a school bully on the prowl, he's got all the time in the world to fix it.<br/><br/>Perhaps the one set of films that Robert Zemeckis will ever be remembered for, ""Back to the Future"" and it's two sequels will forever be remembered as an entertaining piece of cinema. From the opening of the film where Fox glides around the fictional town of Hill Valley to the sound of Huey Lewis' ""Power of Love"", you can tell what decade it is, and yet you continue to watch.<br/><br/>It might be harsh to really slate the 1980s as much as we do, after all, we did get entertaining films like ""Ghostbusters"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Out"" and ""The Breakfast Club"", but for every one good film, there were so many dire productions. A bit like the current box office climate, you knew that the majority were a disappointing mess, but there would always turn up one rare beauty. ""Back to the Future"" is one of those.<br/><br/>Led by some straight forward but solid performances, the film just has something about it. The witty notion of the hypocritical mother and her secret youth, that one magnificent scene where Michael J Fox performs ""Johnny B Goode"" at the school prom and Marvin Berry (Harry Waters Jnr) phones his cousin Chuck, all add together to leave you with a huge grin on your face. It's an icon for an age, and for once it makes you grateful for the decade.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis has never really found the highs of the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy (1994's ""Forrest Gump"" is his only other major success) since the final part was released in 1990. Ultimately though, there are worse positions to be in. A rare joy in an otherwise dire decade, this film and the continuing parts, was an entertaining piece of cinema which left you happy and content. It's perfect afternoon viewing, and the one surprise is that it isn't shown more often."
"jcbutthead86","10","8","10","23 November 2015"," One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent And Unforgettable Classic.
","Back To The Future is one greatest films ever made,an excellent and unforgettable classic that combines terrific direction,a wonderful cast,an amazing score and soundtrack,a fantastic script and great special effects. All of those elements make Back To The Future one of the best films of the 1980s that is Popcorn entertainment at it's best.<br/><br/>Set in the fictional town of Hill Valley,California,Back To The Future tells the story of teenager Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox). who is asked by his friend eccentric scientist Dr. Emmett Brown(Christopher Lloyd)to help him on experiment a time machine made out of a Delorean car. After an unfortunate incident Marty gets into the time machine and is accidentally transported back to 1955 where he not only meets Dr. Brown but also meets his parents George(Crispin Glover)and Lorraine(Lea Thompson)as teenagers. With the help of Dr. Brown Marty must find a way to get back to the year 1985.<br/><br/>Released in 1985,Back To The Future is a brilliant and entertaining film that was without a doubt the biggest Box Office hit of 1985 grossing over 300 million dollars world wide and is just an instant classic from the moment you watch it and is one of those movies that is the definition of what a blockbuster should be and where everything from the direction,the cast and story work to absolute perfection with no false note or missing beat. I don't think director Robert Zemeckis or the cast knew what they had was something that was special,magical and timeless and can be enjoyed by people of all ages and will continue to be enjoyed by past,present and future generations. The movie is also the first feature of one of the most beloved movie trilogies of all-time and while all three Back To The Future films are classics as a whole the first is still the best. What Back To The Future does so well is that it takes the time travel movie and gives it style and creativity mixing together different movie genres Comedy,SCI-FI,Action,Romance and thrills giving viewers everything but the kitchen sink but the movie never becomes uneven or confusing making Back To The Future one of the best genre mash-up movies I have ever seen. Although there are some serious moments Back To The Future is lighthearted with non-stop fun From beginning to end,Back To The Future has an energy and flow that just never stops and keeps you glued to the screen with relentless pace and excitement that makes the film re-watchable and iconic to this very day. The screenplay by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale is incredible and quotable with tons memorable scenes and dialog that are funny done with perfection and fun as well with ingenious style and rapid fire delivery that is wonderful. The Comedy and laughs in BTTF are hilarious and fun with moments that are over the top and great thanks to the actions and reactions of Marty and Doc Brown and the main characters. The SCI-FI scenes in BTTF involving the Delorean are so dazzling and are done with imagination and beauty that will make your jaw drop and it doesn't matter how many times you see BTTF you will be blown away by the Delorean sequences. There have been many classic movie duos throughout cinema and among the great duos are Marty and Doc. The scenes between Marty and Doc are truly funny with terrific back and forth banter and have some of the best scenes in the film that are unforgettable. While the two are different in personality and are separated by age the two have a friendship that feels genuine and real where you feel that Marty and Doc would have each other's back at all costs. The friendship between Marty and Doc is further cemented in Part II and III where you feel they will be friends forever whether it's in the future or in the present. Marty and Doc are two amazing and memorable characters that will never be forgotten. The ending of Back To The Future is terrific,thrilling and filled with surprises that will leave viewers laughing and smiling. A fantastic ending.<br/><br/>The cast is wonderful. Michael J. Fox is excellent and funny as Marty McFly,with Fox bringing laughs and charisma to the role. Christopher Lloyd is brilliant as Dr. Emmett Doc Brown,with Lloyd being delightfully over the top and having a fantastic chemistry with Fox. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are wonderful as Lorraine and George McFly,Marty's parents. Thomas F. Wilson is terrific and fun as Biff,a neighborhood bully. James Toklin is great as Mr. Strickland,a hard nosed principal. Claudia Wells(Jennifer),Mark McClure(Dave McFly),Wendie Jo Sperber(Linda McFly),Jeffrey Jay Cohan(Skinhead),Casey Siemaszko(3-D),Billy Zane(Match),George DiCenzo(Sam Baines),Francis Lee McCain(Stella Baines),Harry Waters Jr.(Marvin Berry),Donald Fullilove(Goldie Wilson),Will Hare(Pa Peabody)and Norman Alden(Lou)give good performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by Robert Zemeckis is amazing,with Zemeckis always moving the camera while giving the film with great camera angles,pace and atmosphere.<br/><br/>The score by Alan Silvestri is outstanding and one of best scores in movie history,with Silvestri's score being epic,suspenseful and uplifting. Incredible score,Silvestri. There is also a great soundtrack featuring songs by Huey Lewis And The News(The Power Of Love and Back In Time).<br/><br/>The Special Effects by Industrial,Light and Magic is dazzling and visual stunning and will blow your mind. Great effects,ILM.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Comedies,SCI-FI,Robert Zemeckis or Films in general,I highly suggest you see Back To The Future,one of the greatest films ever made and an excellent,unforgettable classic that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."

","Back To The Future and Parts Two and Three – Review <br/><br/>Release Dates: Part One:1985 Part Two: 1989 Part Three: 1990<br/><br/>Directed by Robert Zemeckis, Written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, Starring Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd<br/><br/>Memorable Scene: Marty's rendition of ""Johnny B Goode"" at the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance<br/><br/>Memorable Quotes: ""Manure, I hate manure"", ""Roads, where we're going, we don't need roads""<br/><br/>Back To The Future was the first film that I did any written work for – way back in a year 9 English class, the task being to analyse the opening scene of the film, still one of the greatest opening sequences in movie history in my opinion, (the fantastic introduction of Doc Browns chaotic science lab through long panning shots and close ups), so I thought it fitting that it would be my first Movie review. ( I have since gone on to complete a BA Honours in Film Studies, and am just reigniting my passion for cinema).<br/><br/>30 years later, and now that we have reached the milestone 2015 (the year Marty travels to the future in part two) this is still one of the most entertaining and well written movies of recent history. Everything fits perfectly into place from the script, camera-work and score, with memorable characters who each produce consistently great performances throughout the trilogy. <br/><br/>Back to that opening sequence, a true example of fine film-making, this sequence inundates us with information and references, all vital to the plot, but at first glance, these visuals and sounds seem to be a random mix. The panning scene of the numerous clocks being an obvious reference to the major theme of ""time"", the newspaper clippings documenting the history of the Brown family, and the TV in the background, first advertising the Toyota pickup truck, the vehicle Marty pines for, and which becomes his eventual reward for fixing and rehabilitating his family through his actions in the film, to the news report of missing plutonium.<br/><br/>You just have to look at how props, imagery and fashion from the movies have entered our own popular culture to see the impact this film has made on our generation. This ranges from the iconic Delorean Time Machine, the Nike Air Mag ""power laces"" trainers which Nike are due to release commercially, to the time old question we have all asked ourselves ""when are they finally going to invent hover boards?!"" Surely it can't be that hard!<br/><br/>Apart from the afore mentioned , I believe one of the main reasons for the films continued success and impact, is the main concept of the film, that of time travel itself. Our desire to travel through time, the endless options of dates and locations, which I'm sure have sparked many debates amongst friends and family, along with, of course, the plausibility of time travel, and the mind bending science behind it - ""Time circuits on, flux capacitor....fluxing"".<br/><br/>If I was to make once criticism of the film, it would be this. It is never really explained why a High School kid, Marty, spends so much time with an ageing ""mad scientist"", how they came to meet, and how they formed such a friendship. It could be understood if Marty was a shy, retiring ""nerd"", but his apparent popularity with women (note him waving to an entire aerobic class of women at the end of the first scene) make this friendship even stranger. But the on screen chemistry and comedic interaction between the characters is so great and genuine, that we accept this bizarre friendship for what it is, without asking further questions. <br/><br/>In conclusion, how ever many times you watch this trilogy of films, you will never cease to be entertained, will probably notice something you didn't in a previous viewing, and will always want to ride a skateboard holding onto the back of a cop car."

","You can't review each movie alone, the trilogy is so bond together that it's impossible.<br/><br/>Must say that this is one of the most memorable Sci-fi comedies or movies related to time- travel in the whole film making history. The story's great, you'll love the plot. Dr. Brown's explanations make sure that even the most complex things could be understood by everyone. You'll get excited for all the high-tense scenes like never, even after seeing it several times. That's one of the best things about the movie. Alan Silvestri's score is just great, gives an emotional touch like not many scores do.<br/><br/>Now, a little problem comes to the fx. instead of using models like in star wars (what also made star wars win Oscars for the effects) they started using CG, just CG technology wasn't yet so perfectioned in 80s-90s like nowadays. That's a little problem though, the movie's not overloaded with these FX at all."

","Fresh off the success of ""Romancing the Stone"", Robert Zemeckis parlayed his newfound clout into the highest grossing movie of 1985 - ""Back to the Future"". A combination of science fiction and nostalgia, the movie touched a chord with contemporary audiences and continues to resonate with viewers thirty years later.<br/><br/>The movie's protagonist is Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), a teenager who is accidentally sent back in time thirty years. After he unwittingly prevents his parents' first meeting he must make things right or else he'll nullify his own existence.<br/><br/>Although the premise is science fictional, the treatment is more or less fantastical, with only a superficial attempt to explain the technology behind time travel. Regardless, the souped-up DeLorean and its flux capacitor make for an iconic time machine.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Oscar-nominated original screenplay offers something for everyone. In addition to the overall element of science fantasy spectacle there's action, adventure, romance, comedy & even surprising dramatic depth at times.<br/><br/>However, the story may not have come to life so vividly without the movie's well-assembled cast. Replacing Eric Stoltz after shooting had already begun, original choice Michael J. Fox was thankfully able to accept the lead role at that juncture. Today, it is difficult, if not impossible, to envision anyone better suited to the role of Marty McFly. In support, Christopher Lloyd is likewise irreplaceable as Doc Brown. The icing on the cake is Marty's parents, enthusiastically played by the lovely Lea Thompson and the always interesting Crispin Glover.<br/><br/>Zemeckis's direction also leaves little to be desired. The movie has an attractive look throughout and even the thirty year old special effects have held up pretty well. Musically, the movie benefits greatly from Alan Silvestri's rousing orchestral score. The pair of soundtrack contributions from Huey Lewis and the News are also memorable.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Back to the Future"" offers high concept thrills backed up by considerable film-making prowess. Iconic in many respects, the movie is among the best, and the most entertaining, of the 1980's."

The direction is good and the script is fast and very funny--I LOVED Lloyd's reaction to Reagan being president and Fox dealing with 1950s life. Also the 1950s outfits and cars are incredible. SPOILER!!! It does go a little too far at the end with Fox supposedly inspiring Chuck Berry--but that's a small complaint. END SPOILER!!! <br/><br/>The acting is good. Fox and Lloyd are both great and play off each other very well--some of Fox's dead pan expressions to Lloyds ravings are quite funny. And Fox is so YOUNG! Lea Thompson was excellent playing Fox's mother--she convincingly ages herself AND looks like a teenager. Crispin Glover overdoes it though as Fox's father--TOO over the top. Also great to see Frances Lee McCain playing Thompson's mother--this woman is a great actress and played mothers through many great 1980s film (like ""Footloose"", ""Gremlins"", ""Stand By Me"" and into the 90s with ""Scream""). Also Billy Zane (in his first role) appears as a bully--but has no dialogue.<br/><br/>Only two things spoil this a little. The open ending (it ends with ""to be continued..."") and the constant product placement--I know a lot of movies do it but here it was virtually nonstop! When it starts calling attention to itself that's a problem.<br/><br/>Also Huey Lewis and the News (remember them?) had a big hit with the opening song ""The Power of Love"". And don't miss Lewis' cute cameo as a teacher at the beginning. I give this a solid 9."

","Back To The Future is a movie about a boy who's 16 and his name is Marty McFly he lives in Hill Valley. He has a friend, a scientist named Emett Brown (a.k.a Doc') and a girlfriend named Jennifer. Marty's dream is to become one of the best guitar players in the world but he thinks about giving this dream up when his band is rejected for the high school prom night. The same day, Doc calls Marty and asks him to come at 1 a.m on a car park in town and at this point, the movie knows an unexpected turn... This movie is one of the best ""sci-fi comedies"" that I ever seen because it has all the elements to make you laugh and give you some suspense with an extraordinary soundtrack."

","Back to the Future (1985) is an amazing film that everybody needs to see. It is almost impossible not to like this movie.<br/><br/>The story is about a 17 year old teenager called Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) who is friends with a scientist named Emmet Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Doc Brown builds a time machine made out of a Delorean and Marty is sent back to the year 1955. Whilst in the 50s, he meets his parents (Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson) and accidentally ruins their chances of getting together. Now, if Marty does nothing to bring his parents together, then he will never be born. On top of all that, the Delorean needs plutonium to run, without it, Marty can't get back to 1985.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale give us an excellent movie with spectacular acting from Michael J Fox, Christopher Lloyd and Thomas F Wilson. The soundtrack is great too, by Alan Silvestri, and the songs by Huey Lewis and the News are great too.<br/><br/>This film is full of nostalgia and it is timeless."

","The hero of the film is named Marty McFly, though his mother insists, when he ventures back in time 30 years, on calling him Calvin Klein. The film's observation that, in those days, a name sewn onto the back of one's pants was probably one's own is only one of the shrewd, rueful contrasts it draws between 1955 and the present day. Once Marty (played winningly by Michael J. Fox) steps into the specially equipped DeLorean owned by a mad scientist friend of his and floors the accelerator, he finds himself in a much simpler world. The neighborhood where he will someday live hasn't even been built. The local soda jerk thinks anyone who orders a Pepsi Free (''If you want a Pepsi you gotta pay for it!'') is being a wise guy. The town's movie theater is playing a Ronald Reagan film, and when Marty announces that Mr. Reagan will be President some day, he is met with a stare of disbelief and a sarcastic remark about Vice President Jerry Lewis. One of the things all teenagers believe is that their parents were never teenagers. Their parents were, perhaps, children once. They are undeniably adults now. but how could they have ever been teenagers, and yet not understand their own children? This teenagers by being one. But ""Back to the Future"" is even more hopeful: It argues that you can travel back in time to the years when your parents were teenagers, and straighten them out right at the moment when they needed help the most. Great movie!!! Absolutely to watch!"

"Leofwine_draca","10","4","5","9 May 2016"," An '80s classic that never disappoints
","I admit to having grown up on 1980s films and thus having a special admiration for them. Whichever way you look at it, BACK TO THE FUTURE is one of the most intelligent of the Hollywood blockbusters from that era, a film which perfectly merges crowd-pleasing entertainment with a complex and well-written storyline that gets to grips with the thorny subject of time travel.<br/><br/>The underrated Michael J. Fox stars in the role of his life as Marty McFly, a guy who unwisely gets involved in time travel thanks to the machinations of his kooky inventor buddy, Doc Brown. Christopher Lloyd essays this subsidiary character and, again, it's the role of his life; he's over the top in it but nonetheless his character is thoroughly endearing and never less than hilarious.<br/><br/>The time travel aspects of the storyline are carefully worked out and hold together very well even today, some 30 years after release. What I particularly liked about this film is the calibre of the writing: there's no slow spots or simplicity here, just one suspenseful sub-plot after another. There are small moments, big set-pieces, cutting edge special effects, action, chase scenes, romance, and of course plenty of humour, and a quirky supporting cast who make the most of their roles. BACK TO THE FUTURE is a classic - and for good reason."
"lukemccarthy-20921","10","4","5","30 April 2016"," Amazing!
","Just watching this got me hooked in! It was very good from the start to the finish. Once i watched the rest i wanted them to release even more of the film like maybe a forth and fifth trilogy. I think that the best has to be so far episode 3 because it is the most exciting with all of the time travel. I could watch it over and over again. I would definitely watch this as it is an amazing film and that there is even more to come in the next episodes of back to the future and that is why i rate it a ten. If you are into an action packed film and want to get up with the family then this is a perfect film to watch. I have been very engaged with it."
"thebluttboy","10","4","5","26 April 2016"," Perfection
","When it comes to not only incredible storytelling yet a truly great example of what a film should be, this and the entire trilogy define an undeniably 'timeless' experience that are forever lasting. Few times does a story introduce characters the way in which this does while at the same time delicately setting up what will become larger plot points. At every turn, there's another little surprise that lures the viewer in more and more. I think what's most profound here as opposed to other films similar to the genre is that although it's about time travel, it's moreover about people and relationships over anything else. Somehow, the writers prevent the story from getting bogged down in technical jargon and instead have smartly allowed the story of these characters to be present above all else. In summation, constantly entertaining and forever remarkable."

","With recent events in the real world coinciding with events predicted in this movie (timing wise) I thought it would be fun to go back and watch this.<br/><br/>This movie is still really entertaining and Michael J Fox is always a delight to watch. I know some of the predictions clearly don't come true but so what? Any movie that has a time travel theme that references modern times is always fun to debate with family and friends and I still like the humour and the characters in this movie.<br/><br/>I still think this is a good family movie even decades later. Nothing violent, no nudity just fun."

Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd are a perfect comedy duo and play off each other so well backed by an incredible supporting staff who really take you on an action-packed, thrill ride through time.<br/><br/>But all of that can only be possible through the amazing design and production crew that delved into the 1950's era with a flourish and took you to the unknown future with creative flare.

","It's a teenage movie, it's a comedy, it's a science fiction adventure... and there's nothing better.<br/><br/>Back to the Future is a smart inventive all-time masterpiece and I have never known any other movie that I have seen that I have watched over and over again and again, that's how much I love this movie. The cast and their chemistry on screen are unforgettable: Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly is an energetic teenager with a passion for music and someone who does not want you to call ""chicken"".<br/><br/>Christopher Lloyd as Dr. Emmett Brown is a scientist who wants to invent something unique that works and to change the world. With his new invention of time travel that he made out of a DeLorean. Christopher Lloyd's performance was not nominated for an Oscar because his performance was the most fascinating part of the movie and one of the most interesting performances in a movie that I've seen in a long while. More praise goes to Chrispin Glover's performance as George McFly. He was my favourite part of the movie, especially the two scenes where he tries to woo Lorraine Baines and says ""I'm your density"" one of my favourite movie quotes. The moment in the film (SPOILERS just in case you haven't seen it yet) where he stands up to Biff surprised me and showed me that he could stand up for himself and the woman he loves. Lea Thompson was fantastic as well as Lorraine Baines.<br/><br/>Back to the Future was something that surprised me because I never knew now how much I would love it. I don't know if I've ever felt this good about a movie in a long time since I first watched Jaws or Whiplash.<br/><br/>10/10"
"mmallon4","10","4","5","21 October 2015"," Spaceman From Pluto
","An aura of 'cool' permeates everything about Back to the Future. I could imagine seeing this film when it came out in 1985 (of course I wasn't alive) and watching Marty McFly riding through Hill Valley on his skateboard while holding onto the back of a truck to The Power of Love by Huey Lewis and the News and thinking to myself, ""omg, this is just the coolest film ever"". To me Marty McFly is the personification of cool, he rides skateboards, has a hot girlfriend, plays guitar. Yet his life is far from perfect; his dad is a dweb, his mum is an alcoholic and his uncle is in prison. This brings him down to a relatable level, plus he hangs out with a crazy old scientist. Why? I don't want to know. I like the mystery of not knowing how this unconventional friendship came to be. The technical jargon between Marty and Doc is a never-ending pleasure to listen and even lines which shouldn't be memorable are somehow highly quotable (""Wait a minute Doc, are you telling me that it's 8:25...dam I'm late for school!""). Likewise taking the coolest looking, commercially available car and making that the time machine is yet another stroke of genius. Notice the scene in which we see the DeLorean for the first time; it's impossible for Doc Brown to get inside the DeLorean while it is inside the truck so he would have had to get into the car and drive it into the truck and just wait there until Marty would show up and then drive it out and exit the car. I guess Doc thought he had made a time machine that looked so badass he really had to give it an impressive introduction to Marty. The whole movie has the best uses of product placements I've seen in a film; never before have I been happier to see advertisements for Pepsi and Texaco. The pacing of Back to the Future is perfect, the film never lets up; the odds keep stacking up against Marty and the suspense towards the end of the film is crazy.<br/><br/>Even though most of the film takes place in the 1950's, Back To The Future is the film which defines the 1980's. The ending in which Marty finds his family has been changed for the better and he gets the 4x4 vehicle he wanted; it's a wish fulfilment fantasy and very much a capitalist, 80's ideal. It's an uplifting ending, providing you ignore the fact that Marty now has to adjust to living with a family he has no previous memory off. It makes sense that Marty goes back to the year 1955, the time period of when adolescence had a voice and began an economic force for the first time in history; plus just take a look at the title of what won Best Picture that year. Marty's mother being attracted to her son is weirdly funny plus his mother being the opposite of her adult herself; makes you question your own parents claims about their day. I'm always struck by the moment when Marty tell his relatives in 1955 he has two TVs and they think he's joking yet if you told someone in 1985 that households today own upwards of 6-7 TVs, they would have the same reaction.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Back To The Future; to me these are the trilogy of trilogies. The three film sagas I can watch again and again, always notice something new on each viewing, discussing every character to no end, coming up with crazy fan theories and trying to find an explanation to any possible plot hole. I'm sure there are still plenty of subtle gags, use of foreshadowing and who knows what lurked within this film which I still haven't noticed. Is it possible for a film to be 100% perfect, one which has absolutely nothing wrong with it no matter how minuscule? I can't think of another film (or series) which has a better use of repeating images and motifs. If I could only bring one DVD to a desert island, it would be my trilogy box set so I could spend my time uncovering every last secret in the trilogy. I love how self-contained the movies are; there are so closely connected to each other and the perfect film trilogy to watch in one go (as I have done several times).<br/><br/>But what is it that makes Back to the Future immensely beloved by such a wide audience? I can tell you why I love it but I have a weird and eccentric film taste. Perhaps it's due to time travel is something we all fantasize about, as well as the idea of seeing your parents when they were young. The themes the film explores such as family, coming of age, the generation gap and the optimistic message of free will, that our future isn't written; it's whatever you make it.<br/><br/>To Be Continued..."

","One of the most iconic movies in cinematic history, where, in 1985, young Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) travels back to 1955 in a time machine (named the DeLorean) invented by his scientist friend, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). In meets his high-school-age parents and inadvertently disrupts their first meeting; therefore, he must unite them in order to save their eventual courtship and marriage, and ultimately, Marty's own existence.<br/><br/>Despite being an '80s film, the special effects team really did an awesome job in making the time travel elements seem spectacular but realistic-looking, especially the DeLorean.<br/><br/>The direction by Robert Zemeckis was well-paced from start to finish, making the film engaging throughout, from Marty traveling back in time to save Emmett Brown to him meeting his future family. Seeing the transformation from the characters in present time to the past with Marty trying to patch things up in the past for a better future outcome are things that make time travel films brilliant. I also especially liked the dialog from the 1955 time-line, ""He's teasing you, nobody has two television sets!"" <br/><br/>Spot-on acting by Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover and Thomas F. Wilson. They all made the film fun and entertaining.

","Now here's a film that manages to engender nostalgia for two different decades, while still remaining timeless. You don't see that every day. <br/><br/>Strip away the ILM effects, space-time wrinkles and polished veneer and ""Back to the Future"" is really just about a kid witnessing his loser middle-aged parents during their high school years. It's such a novel idea and the movie that builds on that is just so precisely tuned. This was never a big effects movie and never promised huge Summer spectacle, but it does offer the honest thrill of going on an adventure. And that's tough to beat. It's got everything: action, science fiction, comedy, a teen movie subplot and (most importantly) an endearing relationship between two memorable characters (and let me say this right now: Christopher Lloyd steals every one of his scenes).<br/><br/>For me, this is the total package of pure entertainment. It's lodged itself into the cultural lexicon and for very good reason. ""Back to the Future"" has been my favorite for years, and I just don't see that changing anytime soon.

","I want to add my voice to the many who have reviewed this 1985 classic positively. It's a simple and fun movie with a wild and far-fetched story. Marty McFly, with the aid of his mad scientist friend, is able to travel 30 years into the past, where he meets his parents when they were his age. He both prevents history from being changed and yet changes it for the better. A lot of the laughs comes from comparing the town in 1955 and 1985. <br/><br/>The film has fully fleshed out characters and a heart-warming, satisfying feel.

It's always a pleasure to see Christopher Lloyd steal the show. In this film you get a true overview of the 80's and how hard it is to make it seem like he's in the 1950s because it's truly an 80's classic.

This is my only review for this series but I loved all of them and give them all a solid 10 out of 10 because it's just the perfect example of how a true trilogy should be.

It's great, the geek gets the girl, the bully is taken down, there's a crazy doctor and the kid fixes his parents' past. It's pretty amazing. The characters themselves were true to the setting and represented the 1980's and the 1950's perfectly. The DeLorean was the coolest time machine ever. If I learned anything from this movie, it's that you have to ride in style. It had a great plot, good camera work, some scientific accuracy, and a smooth ending. While I loved all of those things, there are a few things I would change. There were a few questions that weren't answered. What happened between 1955 and 1985 that made things the way they are? There are too many things that happened in those thirty years that weren't explained. Biff, George, and Loraine still had lives and their stories weren't explained. And then, on top of that, unless you see ""Back to the Future Part II"", the ending is just a huge cliffhanger. Why does the DeLorean suddenly fly? Who what's wrong with Marty's kids? What does Doc mean ""Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads!""? I guess ending it that way was a good move because then, you want to see Part II, you NEED to see Part II, or else you'll be left with a million questions that are left unanswered. It was the greatest, strangest, and most confusing two minutes of the entire movie, but that's what makes it so great. All in all, it was a great movie and definitely a science-fiction classic. I loved and I would recommend this movie to every one. If you're not a science-fiction fan, you will be, after experiencing the magic of ""Back to the Future""."

The DeLorean has become such an icon, and it's no wonder! The film sets up great jokes and entertainment throughout the entire story, and fantastic one-liners. ""Great Scott!""

The cast is fantastic and one of the most vital parts of making this movie work, they didn't seem like easy characters, particularly Marty and Doc, they have a lot of layers and certain requirements for portraying them accurately, but every actor nails their role, the script has some very funny bits, but also dramatic parts, and the cast succeeds in all areas of acting. The story is quite complicated, it has the concept of time travel involved, thrown in with a complicated love story, as well as a lot of necessary character development, but it manages to perfectly bring all of this together in a movie that isn't even two hours long, and it dosen't manage to feel any bit cluttered or overlong. Memorable lines, historical movie moments, outstanding performances, a beautiful script and stellar directing from the great Robert Zemeckis, I consider Back to the Future to be my favourite movie, I think all moviegoers should see it, it's a must watch. <br/><br/>After ending up in the year 1955 through his friend Doctor Emmet Brown's time machine, Marty McFly must make sure his parents get together to ensure his existence after ruining the moment they fell in love. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Christopher Llyod Worst Performance: Wendie Jo Sperber"

","I love Back to the Future. While having a typical 80s feel to it, which I like, I love how fun, irresistible and original the film is. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time travelling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film, or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis's direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting, Michael J Fox is really appealing in the role of Marty McFly, the role that propelled him to stardom, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are also great. Overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

Since then I've been fascinated with the possibilities in time travel (worm hole anyone), Delorean's, Pine Trees, and of cause the 50s culture.<br/><br/>What i love about Back To The Future is the whole vibe. Its first Sci Fi/Family/ then Comedy/Action/. It has everything.<br/><br/>The story is a gem. Marty (Michael J Fox) is stuck in the year 1955 after escaping from a group of terrorists who were out for revenge after their plutonium had been stolen by Doctor Emmett Brown for his new invention, a time machine. Marty in 1955, is without plutonium and has to figure out how to get back. Fortunately for him, he ""knows"" his history and devises a plan with the doc from 1955 to get back to 1985. Oh, did i mention his parents. That is another story in itself.<br/><br/>It doesn't get anymore original than that. The writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale did an incredible job.

","It's 1984 and director Robert Zemeckis, fresh from the success of Romancing The Stone, is trying to film Back To the Future - a film about a young teenager called Marty McFly who is accidentally sent back in time to 1955 and inadvertently risks the future of his family. Zemeckis is troubled by his leading man, Eric Stoltz, who just isn't capturing the youthful teenager exuberance that he wants for Marty McFly. Stoltz is jettisoned and in comes Michael J. Fox who was busy wowing audiences in the hugely popular sit-com Family Ties. Fox had been first choice anyway but couldn't get a release slot from shooting with Family Ties. Luckily the wasted time with Stoltz created an opening for Fox to play Marty McFly as well as work on the show - the result of which would turn out to be one of the most beloved fantasy trilogies of the modern era.<br/><br/>It's honestly hard to find anyone who seriously doesn't like Back To The Future part one. The second one has its critics, because, lets face it, it's a bridge between two better films, while the third film loses some people because of its Western themed plot (the heathens that they are). Yet really this trilogy opener is as near perfect cinema for all the family as you could wish to view. It's a water tight script from Zemeckis and Bob Gale that not only encompasses witty time travel paradoxes, but also dares to be dramatic into the bargain. The first 15 minutes contains a real shocker that is as cheeky as it bold, something that really gives Marty's 1955 quest a real urgency that the audience can buy into as the comedy relief then comes in spades. The set pieces are first rate - hello skateboard - hello rock ""n"" roll 101, and the makers have fun in winking towards other notable sci-fi pictures along the way. Hell they even manage to deal in an Oedipal strand that is tasteful, handled superbly and garners guffaws aplenty. No mean feat that last one actually. Alan Silvestri provides a whirring & pleasing score and the theme song, The Power Of Love, by Huey Lewis & The News, is infectiously enjoyable. Finally it's the cast that seal the deal for why this is as good as it gets for fantasy escapist cinema. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson & Crispin Glover are the perfect quintet, each feeding off each other and doing justice to the excellently constructed story.<br/><br/>Made for $19 million, Back To The Future went on to make a worldwide gross of over $381 million, and those are the kind of figures you really can't argue with. It's snappy, happy and down right funny, so really, if you don't like Back To The Future then seek medical help immediately. 10/10"

"Coventry","10","4","5","29 June 2008"," Brilliant Scenario!
","Few things are as difficult to accomplish as a movie dealing with time-traveling. To take on themes as risky as paradoxes and time loops you primarily need a healthy dose of courage and ambition, but most importantly loads of writing talent and cinematic vision. The scenario of ""Back to the Future"", courtesy of director Robert Zemeckis and co-producer Bob Gale, is honestly one of the most brilliant ones ever penned down and, thanks to the financial support of several acclaimed producers (including Steven Spielberg and Frank Marshall), it also became one of the most massively entertaining films of all time, with sublime special & sound effects, diversity of genres and some of the greatest casting choices and acting performances ever. ""Back to the Future"" is quintessentially speaking a Sci-Fi comedy, but Robert Zemeckis admirably also hints at the more emotional and melodramatic aspects regarding time traveling. Also, even though the film boosts some of the greatest effects ever, their use merely remains functional and occasionally, so that the emphasis continuously lies on the story and the development of the characters instead of on flamboyant machinery and overlong speeches about scientific theories. The DeLorean is a stylish and original piece of scenery, but other than the fantastic and already legendary vehicle there are no giant laboratories with thousands of flickering lights. Marty McFly is a typical mid-80's teenager with a skateboard he knows how to use and a delightful high school sweetheart that loves him very much. His parents George and Lorraine, however, are a pitiable and hopelessly old-fashioned couple and thus he spends most of his free time with his genius but slightly eccentric friend Doc Brown. The latter invented a time-traveling device and, following a series of bizarre events, Marty accidentally travels back to 1955; the year his parents met and fell in love during the school prom. Marty has only one chance to return to the future, but in the meantime he has to correct the events he tampered with in order to save the future and even assure his own birth. The script is very well constructed and literally stuffed with witty little details that refer to earlier events and/or events that have yet to appear, either later in the film or even in one of the sequels. The humor works, the light-headed tone and atmosphere puts a big smile on your face, you come to care for the characters and the awesome soundtrack even makes it difficult to remain in your seat. Michael J. Fox, Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson all give away excellent performances, but my two preferred roles are for Christopher Lloyd (with his confused looks and bizarre facial expressions, he makes a superb mad scientist) and Crispin Glover. The latter appears to be born to depict weirdos and uncanny freaks, so the role of introvert and mysterious George McFly fits him perfectly."

","This film is classic, and has stuck with me from childhood, and i am guaranteed to watch it again and again. The story line is tight, the idea original and the performance from all is amazing. Ranging from the stereotypical bully played by Thomas Wilson, to Marty and the similarities between him and his dad, played by Michael J Fox who at times, sums up a teenager precisely, but most of all the manic facial expressions and insane dialogue from Christohe Lloyd, who plays the mad Doc ""Einstein"" character with such vigour it just makes me smile when he's in the shot, let alone doing something. A great performance by Lloyd capped this film off for me as being one of the best i've seen.<br/><br/>But the film itself is great stuff too...!"

","HAve you ever had a movie experience from years before(let's use as an arbitrary number,five years or more)that was so vivid,so exhilarating that you could recall what day,time and even things as seemingly easy to forget as the smell and tastes of the popcorn and soda you had at the movie?<br/><br/>For me,that was this movie,and I recall seeing it on a Sunday afternoon in July,1985. The noise and visuals were so electric that I enjoyed this film immensely. My only regret about the experience was that I didn't get a chance to redeem the ""Free Pepsi with purchase of large popcorn""discount coupons they were giving out that day!<br/><br/>In a pleasant,average California suburb,ordinary teenager MArty McFly(Michael J.Fox,who was a youngish 24 when he filmed this) dreams of being a rock guitarist as he works his way through school,helping out brilliant-but-fringe local scientist Dr.Emmitt Brown(Christopher Lloyd,adding to his wide range of characters). When an unforeseen crisis interrupts Doc Brown's breakthrough time-machine revelation,MArty is thrust into the machine and becomes the unwitting first participant in time-travel. As if that weren't harrowing enough,he's just found a way to break up his younger parents BEFORE they met and now he has to feverishly find some way to get them back together,lest he and his sibs will never be born.<br/><br/>If you can suspend some level of disbelief while watching this(and,really,when SHOULDN'T you suspend some disbelief when watching Spielberg/Lucas/Zemekis style of sci-fi films?),this film is as smooth as silk and one fun ride! Besides Fox and Lloyd,Crispin Glover(lovably strange and pathetic as Marty's once and future dad,George),Lea Thompson(cute and vapid as once and future mom Lorraine)and Thomas Wilson(thick-headed bully Biff,who is a lost treasure here,too) are excellent in fleshing out the characters that stick in one's mind regarding this film. Heck,Old MAn Peabody,Goldie Wilson,Jennifer PArker,MArvin Berry(cousin of Chuck)and the persistently bald and serious-as-heart-attack high school principal all add their own flairs in this movies persona. Robert Zemekis parlayed his ""Romancing the Stone"" success to create an even larger-than-life action-fantasy-comedy,with help from plenty of sight and sound FX and a hugely energetic soundtrack anchored by Huey Lewis and the News(remember them?). This film isn't just a renter,this is a keeper! Most people with a sense of fun who long for the eighties movies that accented style over dark or haunting substance should definitely buy this one,tape or DVD."

","There are certain films that you grow up with. You see them on TV all the time and feel compelled to watch. I have seen Back To The Future more times than i care to imagine. Each and every time i watch it, it never fails to get me hooked straightaway. What is it about this film that makes it endlessly watchable? The main character is a kid i wanted to be. I even tried to copy his famous skateboard trick on a number of occasions- each time managing to hurt my shin in the process. The film centres around Marty Mcfly played by Michael J. Fox. He is accidentally transported back in time to the year 1955 where he inadvertently prevents his parents from falling in love-hence threatening his very existence. It may sound complicated but the genius of the film is the simplicity of the script. In short, Marty just wants to get back home. To assist him in his quest is the man who helped him get there in the first place (you still with me? good). Doc Brown is as eccentric as they come but Christopher Lloyd makes him lovable with his great performance. The chemistry between Michael J. Fox and the afore mentioned Lloyd is the key to the entire movie. It works a treat, making the film come to life. Watching Marty and Doc struggle to put their well thought out plan into action at the film's climax is as exciting as anything seen. The scale of this movie is not huge. It's not a big special effects film. Yes it does involve time travel and yes it's a big adventure. However, it's the characters-not a big budget- that make this film special. The score makes the film jump out of the screen.. The Back To The Future main theme is one of the most recognised in cinema. Only very special films tap into popular culture and this movie sits proudly alongside the Star Wars' and Indiana Jones'of this world.. The phrase 'Back to The Future' will be with us forever- just as this classic movie will be. 'Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads'"

","When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE that 80s. IT'S SIMPLY THE GREATEST TIME TRAVEL MOVIE EVER HAPPENED IN THE HISTORY OF WORLD CINEMA.<br/><br/>I firstly heard about this movie on Discovery channel, I didn't know much about it's importance, even it's title, then one day I happened to read television listings and was struck by a title named ""Back to the Future""..? Man what was that? Months later unexpectedly watch that on AXN channel. WOW, I was thrilled by its idea. Huh,.. I almost lost in that future..<br/><br/>Back to the future (Spoilers******) <br/><br/>Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.<br/><br/>At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car ""DeLorean"". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.<br/><br/>After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.<br/><br/>What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.<br/><br/>They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.<br/><br/>More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost ""chewed every scenes"" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.<br/><br/>Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs ""The Power of Love,"" and ""Earth Angel"".<br/><br/>All in all it is the GREATEST SCI-FI, ROAMANTIC MOVIE OF THE ALL TIMES. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as "" A MODERN/CLASSIC MASTERPIECE! ""<br/><br/>"" I gave this movie 10 thumps up out of 10 stars."""

","If you're looking for a movie that you can watch over and over and not get tired of it, this is it. Teenager Marty McFly comes from a weird family. His dad, George McFly, is a huge nerd who is always getting pushed around by his boss Biff Tannon. His mom is a controlling, hypocritical, burned out alcoholic. His brother is an air head that works at Burger King and his sister is doomed to the same fate as her mother so it seems. But Marty finds release in his lovely girlfriend Jennifer and his wacky scientist friend Dr. Emmit L. Brown. Marty dreams of making the big time with his band but is held back by the criticism of others, his fear of rejection, and the short comings of his family. But one day Doc Brown calls upon Marty to assist him in the testing of his newest invention, a DeLorean converted into a time machine. This movie is a fabulous adventure with good acting, special FX, and humor. The characters are very well written and very likable. This movie is brought to you by the first class director who is credited with Forrest Gump and Who Frammed Roger Rabbit. This is a true American classic movie that will be remember for many generations to come. If you haven't seen it, if you like good movies, buy it. Believe me it's worth it."
"Ben_Cheshire","10","4","5","21 May 2004"," The cleverest of the three.
","Part I is certainly the cleverest of the three. A rip-snorter of a premise: Marty (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally sent back to 1955 in the time machine that his friend Doc Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd, in a zany, unforgettable, over-the-top performance that creates one of the best characters of all time) has built, and he accidentally interferes in the meeting of his parents, so that instead of his grandpa hitting his father (Crispin Glover in another over-the-top but crucial and memorable performance) with his car, he hits Marty instead. So instead of Marty's mother falling in love with his father, she falls in love with him! Controversial and awkward though it may be, you can't deny its greatness. The real aim of this, though, is not incest, its learning what his mother was really like in her youth, compared to how she tells it. Plus, it lends a certain urgency to what Marty must do to set back the course of time, which makes us need to watch till the end to see he does it: he must somehow make his parents meet and fall in love, or he won't be born!<br/><br/>The second main quest in the movie is the technical problem of getting Marty back to the future: since in Part I the time machine runs on plutonium, and plutonium doesn't exist in 1955, they have to find some other way of generating the 1.21 gigawatts needed to get the car to 88 miles per hour and send it into time.<br/><br/>The third main problem of the movie is that on the day when Marty got sent back in time, in 1985, Doc will be shot by Libyan terrorists for stealing their plutonium to run the time machine, unless Marty does something about it. A terrific feature of these movies are their climaxes: Part I is a terrific scene where Marty must hit the power line connected to the clock tower at 88 miles per hour at the precise moment lightening strikes it, involving a reference to a famous silent movie image, of Harold Lloyd hanging from a clock high on a building in Safety Last (1921).<br/><br/>Back to the Future pulls a lot of old punches, uses a lot of traditional storytelling gags and devices that feel quite familiar, but its unabashed sense of fun, larger-than-life tone and ripsnorter premise make it the kind of movie you treasure and watch time and time again."

","Back to the Future is popcorn entertainment brought to its absolute pinnacle in fun, color, romance and gorgeous, spirited music that has helped this movie become an all renowned classic that stands out from every other film in the 1980s. Robert Zemeckis directs the hell out of this masterpiece, and he sees time-travel as a fun and conceptual playground for character exploration and never ignoring any one line of dialogue. It's all just so... GOOD! Back to the Future has been referred to many times as one of the finest and most fun movies ever created by human talent, and I think that the praise is well-deserved for this funny, character-centric, feel-good and adventurously exciting movie. 80s galore at its absolute finest in this movie, and a movie that has aged beautifully; a movie truly ahead and outside of our time.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen Back to the Future yet, then what the hell are you doing reading this? Get to work!"
"phantomrider95","10","5","7","9 August 2016"," Impossible for anyone to not like!
","Even 31 years after its initial release, Back to the Future has stood the test of time! There is absolutely no possible way ANYONE could hate this movie, and there are 3 reasons why!<br/><br/>The first reason why Back to the Future is an impossible movie to hate is that its story is very original and doesn't seem to be hard for anyone to understand! A small-town California teen named Marty McFly is thrown back into the '50s when an experiment by his eccentric scientist friend Doc Brown goes awry. Traveling through time in a modified DeLorean car, Marty encounters young versions of his parents, and must make sure that they fall in love or he'll cease to exist. Even more dauntingly, Marty has to return to his own time and save the life of Doc Brown. One of the greatest aspects of the story is the idea of a teenager and a scientist traveling back in time in a DeLorean, which I have to imagine is the only instance of a movie making heavy use of a car as a way to travel through time. Another great aspect of the story is its message which argues that you can travel back in time to the years when your parents were teenagers, and straighten them out right at the moment when they needed help the most.<br/><br/>The second reason why Back to the Future is an impossible movie to hate is the amount of memorable scenes and quotes that anyone who has seen the movie knows the most about! One of the most memorable scenes is when Doc tests out his time machine while Marty uses a video camera to record it. Doc tells Marty that if his calculations are correct, ""when this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious s***!"" <br/><br/>The final reason why Back to the Future is impossible to hate is the amazing design that delves into the 1950's era with a flourish and takes you to the unknown future with creative flare. Robert Zemeckis sure did a great job at directing every single aspect of the movie, but he was more efficient in directing the visual style of the film was that allowed audiences to experience the culture and nostalgia of the 1950s in a humorous way!"

"BobbyT24","10","5","7","3 August 2015"," MUST-SEE!!!! This is better in 2015 than when it came out in 1985...
","I've watched this movie so many times, I can quote the entire movie. I'm not giving anything away by saying it was/is still ahead of it's time. Although the characters' belief that 2015 would be significantly different than our current 2015 actually IS, is irrelevant (actually, it's a comedy so the guesses at reality just makes it funnier!). Robert Zemeckis directed a legendary movie mocked and satirized in many movies afterward. That's the highest praise a picture can garner. This is as near-to-perfection as screen comedy/time travel gets in my book.<br/><br/>To put the writing/directing in perspective, I will tell you what my screen writing teacher said about this movie a few years ago when she screened just the opening sequence for our class... She said the opening sequence of nearly five minutes long with few editing breaks sets the stage for what is to come. She said this was how professional screenwriters dream about opening a movie. It's just... flawless. The opening reveals layer upon layer of story themes with very few words, just visuals and a few key noises in the background. Without a single actor in the midst. It's just the setting and a moving camera. We have just been treated to circa-1985 without ever even seeing an actor walking across screen. THEN the actor walks in. It only gets better from there. Magnificence in direction.<br/><br/>Watching it again last night made me realize how special of a movie it really was. I simply enjoyed the experience. It transported me back to 1985 all over again. Knowing everything there is to know about the story. And it STILL makes me laugh. The fact they set it in 1985 was a stroke of genius. People in 2015 can only joke about what they believed the future would look like. But the writers/director so very wisely chose to say ""1985"" and not ""Present Day"" -- a date-reference killer once a movie reaches an age where current present day looks nothing like the movie we're watching. That 1985 date also allows for a perfect anchor to bounce around in the future two sequels in the series.<br/><br/>I remember watching this in the theater when it was first run in - yes, I was there - 1985. My best friend sitting next to me in the theater watched Michael J Fox stumble along 1955 Main Street and his comment at that moment in the movie was, ""Nobody could play this character better than Michael J Fox."" I have to agree. MJF IS Marty McFly personified. He carries the picture effortlessly and heroically, along with the hilarious and severely underrated Christopher Lloyd as the genius/basket case, Dr. Emmitt Brown. Two genius actors playing off one another, along with the perfect supporting cast, makes this a must-watch movie at any time in history. It is genuinely funny, sweet, nostalgic, witty, beautiful, and exciting. Every scene has something to do with another scene. There is literally not a single wasted frame in this movie. Later episodes of the series aren't as perfect as BTTF1 but that's a different story... If anyone ever creates a time-capsule, PLEASE make sure to include this movie. Future millennia of species will enjoy it too. :-)<br/><br/>If you haven't watched ""Back to the Future"" before, regardless of your age or generation, please reward yourself with this near-perfect time-travel comedy. I loved it even more this time around. I couldn't recommend it highly enough. 10 out of 10."

","Back to the Future (1985): Dir: Robert Zemeckis / Cast: Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson: Inventive science fiction comedy about regret and change. It involves a time machine car that can propel into the future once it hits a certain speed. This is all explained through the crazed rants of Doc Brown before he is gunned down. Michael J. Fox stars as Marty McFly, a regular high school senior who dreams of success as a musician. At home he frowns on the fact that his father, George is constantly bullied by his high school rival Biff. Central plot regards Marty transporting back to 1955 to locate Doc and then reintroduce his future parents in a method that allows his father to sustain some dignity. The problem is that his future mother falls for him. Creative and charming with grand humour to boot. Director Robert Zemeckis gives it a nice appeal in the same vein as the famous Frank Capra classics. Fox brings a great innocence and desperation in his securing his parents as well as his own future. Christopher Lloyd as Doc, frizzy gray hair and all steals the film in his attempts to conquer time travel. Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson play the McFly folks in need of heavy reparation. Thomas F. Wilson provides much humour as the ruthless yet brainless school bully. It brings light to the fact that our parents were indeed teenagers once. Score: 9 / 10"

","Time travel and the possibilities it offered, of altering the past, knowing the future, meeting people/beings from the future, has always fascinated people. Renowned authors from H.G Wells and Isaac Asimov to Charles Dickens have given their interpretation of time-travel. Hollywood too brought out movies like Terminator and the Star Trek franchise. They had all used it on a grand scale, to explore things like ethics and/or future societies. Nobody thought of placing it in a simple high-school setting and using it to comic effect until Back to the Future came along.<br/><br/>A teenager, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally transported to 1955 (which is 30 years ago since the present day for this movie is 1985). There he interferes with the moment his high-school-age parents meet, to fall in love later, thereby endangering his own existence. To prevent that from happening, Marty has to play match-maker to his parents. <br/><br/>What we have is a very entertaining comedy full of enjoyable characters like the eccentric scientist, Doc (Christopher Lloyd), the school bully, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) and his sidekicks, Marty's parents, Lorraine (Lea Thompson) and George (Crispin Glover) and the school principal Strickland (James Tolkan). It also manages to have a few tense moments towards the end. It's funny, it's intelligent, and it expands the scope of time-travel by focusing on smaller events."

","Back to the future is one movie that contains excellent visual effects, a nice story plot and the directing is just excellent. The movie has a beautiful screenplay, and the movie puts the full stop in the statement, ""never a dull moment.""<br/><br/>Michael J Fox was the desired man cast to play the lead role Marty McFly, but he turned it down due to scheduling conflicts, so Eric Soltz was cast in his place. After filming had begun, Zemeckis and Spielberg felt Soltz was not portraying the character well enough and knew this was a casting error, so they had to re-cast and ask Fox to try and make time to be in the movie. So Fox had to re-arrange his schedule time to be able to shoot Family Ties (TV Series) and the movie at the same time, this recasting meant, an extra 3 million production cost, as all the scenes that Eric had done had to be redone and Fox was so busy, that it was said that he only got 5 hours of sleep a day at the time.<br/><br/>Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) is a teenager from the Eighties who befriends a slightly coco scientist Doctor Brown (Christopher Lloyd). During one of their meetings Doctor Brown mistakenly (due to an accident) sends Marty 30 years into the past, 1955 to be exact. <br/><br/>Marty while in the past, mistakenly interrupts his parents meeting and he must find a way to fix it or else he will no longer exist. He also has to help the Doctor Brown of 1955 get him (Marty) Back to the future.<br/><br/>Back to the Future was a financial success the movie's 100 days production cost was 19 million dollars (including the recasting cost) and it made over 380 million dollars in the box office. It was also a critical acclaim winning an Oscar for Best Sounding Editing.<br/><br/>The balance in this movie is what makes it a most watch the movie's transgression from comic to science fiction to romance/drama, is what makes it such a most watch, it takes its time to explain even the complexity of time travel, that at the end even with the slightest of details that made no sense I actually was convinced and doubted not that Doctor Brown did it.<br/><br/>Back to the Future is a movie hit for all to see and enjoy, it was that good that two sequels were added to it, Back to the Future II and Back to the Future III although the release dates for the sequels were 1989 and 1990 respectively all maintained the time of 1985 when the first time travel happened.

Basically; everything's in the DeLorean sports car. After that, what is needed is an authentic representation of the 1950's. I'm no expert, but the period seems believable to me.<br/><br/>Camera-work, lighting, and sound-effects are top-drawer. There are some wonderfully realised ambiences. Music - both incidental and theme are well chosen. Huey Lewis And The News supply the anthem 'Power Of Love' in fine, thumping riff, whilst additional pieces give a tremendous sense of urgency. It really is spot-on.<br/><br/>This movie brought the unfortunate Micheal J Fox into deserved prominence. His acting skills and comic timing are excellent, here. It's so sad that incurable illness has blighted such a promising career. He and Christopher Lloyd make excellent foils. They are naturals as a comic duo.<br/><br/>Young McFly goes back in time to find his young father as a bullied wimp, a failed writer, and a peeping-tom. He also accidentally upstages his father in his mother's eyes and risks a dose of temporal incest. Somehow he has to put things right before going back to the future. He does - but some details get overlooked, with funny and happy consequences. Relationships are handled with a light and deft touch. It never plods. It never becomes maudlin or lachrymose or excessively sentimental.<br/><br/>There are several plot-holes in the story. And if you get hung-up on the stuff about time-travel and paradox crap, you're missing the point. You're not supposed to take it seriously. It's a fun movie! And it delivers in spades.<br/><br/>Some have described this as the best time-travel movie and I'm inclined to agree. If you can't find something to laugh at then you're a lost cause.<br/><br/>Being so successful, two sequels followed. But the surprise was gone and the humour grew progressively stale. they paled by comparison.<br/><br/>Check-out the original. It's a collectors item and a truly great feel-good experience. I ought to give it 10 stars."

","I literally made an account just to give a review to this movie and express my appreciation. I have to start by saying that the actors were absolutely amazing. They captured perfectly that revolutionary atmosphere of the 80's. I actually feel what is like to be a teenager in that period just by looking at the way they act. The script and the way it is made OMG i seriously don't know where to begin. All the jokes and punchlines are so carefully implemented, this movie has so many references to both real things like the joke with Ronald Reagan and things from the bttf universe, to give an example it would be the continuous repetitions that are always placed cleverly and even if you get a feeling of what is next you always end up satisfied. What this movie really tries to emphasize is that history repeats itself and that we create our own destiny. The amazing thing about this movie is how Marty travels back in time, a place where we believe we know everything about and we are somehow still mind-blown by every character and action and feeling .You just cannot not get that chill when u think of how irreversible time is and the way this movie captures all these emotions is simply extraordinary. The best movie experience i've ever had!!!"

","Marty McFly is a teen living in Hill Valley who is called a slacker for hanging out with Dr. Emmet Brown, whom his principal says he should stay away from for being a nut job. His family is falling apart, as his father is bullied by supervisor, Biff Tannen, and his mother is an overweight, depressed alcoholic. All that changes when he meets Doc at the Twin Pines Mall, who reveals to the youth who is his only friend his latest invention: a time machine built into a DeLorean. However, Doc is gunned down by Libyan nationalists he ripped off to get the plutonium needed to power the vehicle, and when Marty takes it to escape, he ends up traveling back to November 5,1955, a date Doc put in while showing Marty how the time travel mechanics work, where he immediately puts his existence in jeopardy by getting his mother to crush on him, leading him to find the younger Doc in order to set things right before he no longer exists, and get back home, as the time travel depleted the plutonium.<br/><br/>This is one of the cult classic films of the 1980's. Michael J.

BTTF does an incredible job at explaining how time travel works without making it overly complicated.

Out of all the TV Series and Films Michael has stared in, my favourite of all times being, Back To The Future both I, II & III, they are the best ones of all films of all times, as with the story line, set up, editorial work and mostly acting from all actors, there wasn't one single mistake whatsoever. Family Ties is a TV series that should be back on TV in the UK too, as some of the shows they have on TV could do with being wiped off altogether, after all with Happy Days being on, which my little girls love, I'm sure if they were to bring on Family Ties, they'd be just as happy, as they're also fans of Back To The Future as well."

Messing with things that happened he altered the future and was forced to keep doing everything so he could still be alive. Emmett is very funny with his unusual behavior and overall joy, also his excitement about everything and his troubles that he constantly experienced made him an very memorizing character. While messing with past after going back to the present and hoping to prevent killing of Dr., Marty found that some of scenes changed and Emmett was alive after shooting. Ending was probably most exciting thing in the whole movie as Marty found out that everything is changed and also when Emmett arrived back he took him back to future to prevent something that happened to their children. Music was fantastic with some of very popular songs. Movie is funny at many way but also creates this extraordinary situations that constantly need to be fixed. 4/4"

","!!!!!!1.21 JIGA-WATTS!!!!!!<br/><br/>""If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 MPH...you're gonna see some serious sh**.""<br/><br/>""Calm down Marty I didn't disintegrate anything, the molecular structure of Einstein and the car are completely intact - Yeah, well where the hell are they - The appropriate question is WHEN the hell are they"".<br/><br/>Back To The Future is one of the most original films ever made and also as one of the most entertaining and this masterpiece of Sci-Fi has long stood as a collective triumph for the careers of Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd and Robert Zemeckus. Released in mid-1985, met with rousing popular and critical acclaim, which proved to be a goldmine for Universal Studio, who made two more (less good) sequels some years later. In this movie you'll see a combination of some of the best and most lively acting ever captured on film by a perfectly chosen cast, many of which play dual-roles to great effect. Plus, for this sci-fi classic, a profoundly brilliant and singularly witty screenplay masterfully guides the flow of things to come (and that which what has already happened - in the past), which is a confoundingly complex and interwoven series of twists and turns, so many, in fact, that only a mere handful of movie's have more. Largely due to it's brilliant writing (and great line readings) Back To The Future is easily one of the most quotable films ever made (perhaps only GHOSTBUSTERS packs more quotes) and that particularly holds true for Doc Brown, who not only has most of the movies best lines, but also puts the most enthusiasm into said lines. At the heart of the film is a unique, one-of-a-kind vehicle (a HEAVILY MODIFIED DeLorian) of Doc Brown's creation, (without it there would be no Back To The Future) that enables it's operator to travel any where in time AND in highly dramatic fashion an unlucky Marty McFly does just that - and not exactly by design. I find that the car makes some of the sweetest sounding vehicular sounds ever and I always wondered if were hearing the live sound or was it over-dubbed in post production. Either which way, a plethora of amazing engine sounds (do I detect a turbine whine?) emanate from under the ""trunk"" as DeLorian's are indeed a rear engine design; especially after Doc Brown's handy-work!<br/><br/>For a Sci-Fi film, the special effects in Back To The Future are unusually sparse in their application (though brilliantly effective when they are used), you might even say that their under-used, but if at any time you sit back and analyze what you're seeing, eventually you'll realize it's really more of a ""human drama"" than a Sci-Fi film. Musically speaking, along with Huie Luis and the News, Back To The Future is powerfully enhanced by an amazingly effective and mostly up-beat score by a young Alan Silvestre; just listen to how grandly effective his music is during the finale when combined with, A: the variety of sounds from the car and B: the crushing and unrelenting thunder from the storm that rages over Hill Valley (another early triumph, from yet another artist who had a leading hand in the making of this iconic and universally popular film). Speaking of THAT finale, Back To The Future's rip-roaring, high-voltage, thunder n' lightning finale, is easily one of the -most exciting- sequences ever devised (year after year it's the ONLY part of ANY movie that routinely makes the hair on my arms stand up - every time I see it). Unfortunately the two sequels that followed in 89' and 90' are not as good as this, but are pretty good for sequels.<br/><br/>Brilliant in every conceivable way, this time-travel-blockbuster-spectaculaire remains one of cinema's brightest triumphs of creative film-making."

Michael j fox is absolutely fantastic as marty, he was so lovable as the character and just straight away you want to like marty. He has allot of charisma to him that makes you truly care about his situation. Christopher Lloyds performance as doc brown is pretty iconic and he is great in this film.

All the rest of the characters are great, whether its the bully biff or the younger versions of martys parents they all do a great job.

"The Grand Master","10","2","2","22 December 2015"," 30 years on, Back to the Future is still a timeless classic and a joy to watch.
","Back to the Future is one of those movies with everlasting appeal that everybody loves to watch. Who would have thought when this was released 30 years ago back in 1985 that it would forever remain etched in everyone's memories and in movie history as one of the greatest blockbusters of all time. With its cleverly intelligent story and the perfect blend of science fiction, comedy, adventure, and romance, director Robert Zemeckis struck gold with this one of a kind movie that can never be duplicated. It also goes without saying that nobody can go past Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown. Mention any of those actors and without a doubt Back to the Future will always pop up as one of their most memorable movies.<br/><br/>Back to the Future takes place in the fictional town of Hill Valley, California. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is an aspiring musician who is dating Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells) and lives with his dysfunctional family. His weak willed father George McFly (Crispin Glover) is bullied mercilessly by his boss Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) and his mother Lorraine McFly (Lea Thompson) is an unhappy alcoholic. While she disapproves of Marty's relationship with Jennifer, Lorraine recounts how she met George when her father hit him with his car. On 26 October 1985, Marty meets his friend the eccentric scientist Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd in one of his most memorable roles) at a shopping mall parking lot. Doc unveils a time machine built from a modified DeLorean and powered by plutonium stolen from Libyan terrorists. When the Libyan terrorists track down Doc Brown, Marty manages to escape however inadvertently finds himself transported back to 5 November 1955. Marty finds himself in a time where his parents George and Lorraine are teenagers and are yet to meet, Biff is still a bully, and Doc Brown is still developing the very early stages of a time displacement machine but is still the same eccentric scientist only 30 years younger. Not only must Marty find a way back to 1985, but he must also not tamper with history otherwise he may never be born.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are tailor made for their respective roles as Marty McFly and Dr. Emmett Brown. Both of them will forever be remembered for this movie. They are just fantastic! Writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale have put in a lot of attention to detail with the comparisons between 1985 and 1955 as well as how the timeline may be affected for the McFly family and Hill Valley. With its quirky take on the time travel genre, the whole thing is cleverly written. The special effects for its era are top notch and Alan Silvestri's score is very memorable. Huey Lewis' theme song for the movie The Power of Love fits perfectly with the movie.<br/><br/>I could go on forever how Back to the Future is one of the best movies of all time. What more can I say? 30 years on Back to the Future has not lost its timeless appeal and audiences everywhere get a thrill out of watching the movie. Even whenever people approach Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd the main topic of conversation will always relate to Back to the Future. Followed by two clever sequels, Back to the Future will still remain a timeless classic.<br/><br/>A well deserved 10/10."

","""Where were going we don't need roads"". Back to the Future is full of 80s nostalgia, and is surely one of the most entertaining films of all time. Between the rocking soundtrack to the retro fashion(the life preserver!) Back to the Future is jam packed with everything 80s. <br/><br/>The story follows a young teenager living in 1985, Marty McFly, who, accidentally is teleported back to 1955, using a Time Machine out of a Delorean. The most is extremely entertaining, and whether you enjoy the humour, the Sci Fi or both, you are sure to be entertained either way.<br/><br/>Roberts Zemeckis direction helps the film reach fullest velocity. His script, which he also wrote, is very original and creative. Just Imagine if Back to the Future was never made, it's almost impossible to think about. The film is great entertainment for young and old, and sure will be a memory in your mind forever."
"moviemattb","10","2","2","21 November 2015"," One of the best, if not the best about time travel
","It has been thirty years since this movie came out, and has now become a household name as everyone around the world makes references from each scene they reenact, quote lines from each character they say and make parodies out of it. ""Back to the Future"" is one of my favorite movies, and it is one of the best if not the best about time travel. There have been plenty of movies about time travel, but when it comes to time travel movies I think of this one. So with said, the movie is about Marty McFly who accidentally goes back in time to 1955 as he alters history by saving his father from getting hit by a car, and his mother for falling in love as well as his existence. So Marty has to put it all back as how things should be, while Doc Brown tries to get Marty back home to 1985. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd do work well together like bread and butter. Lea Thompson looks lovely and she really plays her role really well. The rest of the cast all did great. The movie itself is really funny, and it is also exciting too. The movie doesn't feature that many special effects by ILM, but I love the effects for the car traveling through time just as what it appears in the movie without any time travel sequence like having a portal or something. The design of the DeLorean for being used as a time travel vehicle is really iconic, and loved the way how it looks. The music by Alan Silvestri is so unforgettable, and loved hearing the theme that he created. The movie is very well scripted, and I thought Robert Zemeckis does a really good job on directing this movie after making another movie that is also good ""Romancing the Stone."" The production design for the 1955 scenes are outstanding, and I thought the pacing of the movie is top-notch. I really hope Hollywood doesn't try to remake this or the sequels, because they're fine for what they are; just like what everyone says ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" I have nothing against remakes, but sometimes it just gets lazy for Hollywood to try to come up with some new stories, and new ideas for what movie is there to make. So please, for one last time as I say this ""DON""T REMAKE THIS MOVIE OR THE SEQUELS!"" Now I got that out of my way, so now I need to wraps things up with this review, ""Back to the Future"" is definitely a classic movie, and really can't say no more about it. I give this movie a 10 out of 10."

","This film is most definitely a classic, one of the best Sci-Fi films ever made. Prepare yourself to take the biggest adventure Back to the Future when you watch this film. I think this film will always be known as one of the big movie classics for years to come. <br/><br/>I wasn't born when this film was first brought out in the cinemas but I remember from an early age watching this with my family and being completely awestruck by how great this movie was. I remember it made me want to go and build my own time- machine (sniggers) and head back to certain times in history, as well as speeding forward into the future to see what my future self would be like. Well, if there's one thing that is guaranteed, throughout my future from my early age, I have always been a massive fan of this film."

","I recently celebrated October 21, 2015 by re-watching the Back to the Future trilogy. And they were amazing. I had quite honestly forgotten just how good they were, just how funny, innovative, crazy, fast and quotable. And this is the one that started it all, and is easily the best film in the whole trilogy, which is saying a lot, keeping in mind the utter amount of quality all of them have.<br/><br/>We all know the story. Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) has invented a time machine, and wants his young friend Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) to act as a witness for the first trial run. But things don't go as planned - do they ever - and Marty is flung back into the past where he has to figure out how he can get, you guessed it, back to the future. Great, amazing basic story, but what really makes this one of the most iconic time travel films ever made is the amount of detail they put into the world and the characters. The very first scene, for example, of Marty stepping into Doc's house looking for him is filled with vast amounts of little touches that all tell a story, both about Doc and Marty.<br/><br/>And the movie just keeps going. All of the characters are very memorable and just the right amount of over the top and exaggerated. From Marty's ultimate wimp of a father George (Crispin Glover) to Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), who's such a massive Hollywood bully that it's a wonder he hasn't spontaneously combusted from sheer stereotypicality. But all that's part of the fun and the characters are played so well and the movie is so light in tone that their over the topness actually works for the film's advantage.<br/><br/>The score by Alan Silvestri is also fantastic, one of the most iconic movie soundtracks in cinema history. Whenever the main theme blasts from the screen you're flung straight into an adventure. The special effects are also surprisingly decent. Sure there are some obvious computer effects, but they were very good for their time and luckily the film relies mostly on practical effects.<br/><br/>Saying anything more would frankly spoil the movie too much. But trust me when I say that this is one of the finest adventure films ever made. It's cinema enjoyment distilled into its purest form. It's a sin I hadn't seen it in such a long time. A mistake which shall not be made again."

","This fusion of sci-fi, action, romance and comedy could have been a dreadful mess, were it not for writer-director Robert Zemeckis and co-writer Bob Gale's refusal to let a loose line or idea escape their pens. The funnies come thick and fast – Doc excitedly describing the forthcoming high-school dance as ""a rhythmic ceremonial ritual""; Marty's hapless dad (the incomparable Crispin Glover) tremblingly telling his ma ""I'm your density..."" – but more satisfying still is the intricate interplay between past and future. It turns out that Marty's Uncle ""Jailbird"" Joey loves, as an infant, to stay in his cot (""Better get used to these bars, kid""). The young Doc's incredulity on hearing of actor Ronald Reagan's next job – ""Who's Vice-President? Jerry Lewis?"" – spoke for the world, and Marty's means of returning to 1985 is a stroke of narrative genius. Scheduling clashes very nearly led to Marty's being played by Eric Stoltz, but (with all respect to the very capable Stoltz) thank heavens a solution was found, as the film would have been immeasurably the poorer without Fox's uniquely energetic charm. It's particularly cruel that so physically nimble a performer should since have been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, but he continues to approach it with a hero's grace and humour, and has become a major figure in increasing awareness for the disease."

","Ah, distinctly I remember, it was my grandfather (may he rest in peace) who first showed this film to me, on video when I was a very small child. It was him and his second wife, and two of their friends, and me, and distinctly I also remember vividly immediately after the film was over, I said, ""I want to watch it again!"" <br/><br/>30 years after its initial release, this is still a hilarious, wonderfully wacky sci-fi/ comedy/ romance/ action flick, and one of the very few films which even attempts to cover all of those bases, and does so extremely well, as it sends a 17 years old 30 years into the past in a DeLorean built by a nutjob inventor, Doc Emmet L. Brown, brilliantly played by Christopher Lloyd. An over-the-top satire of mad scientists, when he shouts, ""It works!"", it reminded me of Dr. Frankenstein shouting ""It's alive!"", upon seeing his creation. Even the film's ending still had suspense, I was still on the edge of my seat (as the cliché goes) when Doc was on the edge of the clocktower, lightning bolts crashing and crackling, again similar to film Frankenstein's creation of the monster. There is also a sad, tragic feel to a few scenes, as Marty fears for his friend's life. <br/><br/>As Biff, Thomas Wilson is hysterical also, the kind of over-sized nitwit most of us knew in high school, who we waited to see get their comeuppance. A childish baby, stuck in a large man's body. <br/><br/>Some well selected and timed oldies, and original score was perfect, not a single note misused, nor was there a single line of dialogue misused, out of place, or unnecessary. The same can be said about the cinematography, which includes several of Dean Cundey's long takes (opening shot in the Doc's garage, and the unveiling of the DeLorean. <br/><br/>One of my all time favourites, 10/ 10, easily. Upon seeing it again in the cinema yesterday (21 October 2015, Back To The Future day) me and the entire audience were in stitches all throughout, and the film actually received a standing ovation when it finished."

","Back to the future — it is a movie made by Robert Zemeckis, which gave rise to one of the most iconic franchises in cinematography about time traveling teenager Marty McFly and his friend and inventor Emmett Brown. Impossible to pick one thing, what exactly I like, because of the advantages this film has. In General, the plot of this film is laid out very good , in the most minute detail. The cast is really great: Christopher Lloyd gave us the image of the eccentric, but undeniably brilliant Doctor Brown, Michael Fox who played the character Marty McFly, Lea Thompson, who played 17-year- old girl and her 30 years later. Crispin Glover - all of his roles completely different from each other, even in ""Back to the future"" — there was one person, but he was reincarnated three times. So, the film ""Back to the future"" — one of the best representatives of its genre, wonderful exciting fantastic comedy that in many ways defined the further development of the genre. As for me, this film is really great."

","Had to have been one of the greatest films I have witnessed. Watching this when I was younger had such a great impact on my life growing up. By far, this is the best movie to ever cover time travel, and maintain a realistic path. I encourage any movie goer to first watch this film before any that bend the time barrier. Some of Michael J Foxx and Christopher LLoyd's best work. This is when Universal Studios and Sony realized that there was something to control in order to move the people and they ran with it. This film is one of my top 10 to watch and re-watch. Timeless and for the ages will forever be watched/remembered. I will be sure to show this film to my children. If they do not witness this movie, they may never know what it feels like to travel through time and still connect to the present. I thank producers for making movies as such.

","Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is a typical teenager growing up in the 80s. He hopes to make a man out of his milquetoast father, the middle-aged George McFly (a deliciously funny sad sack as played by 20-year-old Crispin Glover) who is still groveling at the feet of his former high school classmate, a perpetual bully named Biff. Marty's prim mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson) appears to be drowning her frustrations in vodka. The movie does not really catch fire until, when testing out a souped-up DeLorean as a time machine with his eccentric, wide-eyed, wild-haired stork of a mad scientist friend Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown (played by the hilariously frazzled Christopher Lloyd), Marty is whisked back to 1955. Here, he comes face to face with his nerdy teenage dad and also his unrecognizably gorgeous mom. After inadvertently causing his own mother to become infatuated with him – who finds him an absolute dreamboat, it is left up to Marty to repair the course of time and ensure that she falls in love with his future father, George or face being erased out of existence altogether. To do so, he gets in touch with a young Doc, who is as much a fish out of water in the past as he is in the present, and persuades him to send him back to 1985. Can he put things right and return to the future before it's too late?<br/><br/>Director Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future represents that rare perfect matrimony of everything a film needs to succeed, from the adroit direction, the immaculately styled performances and the scintillating visual effects that never swamp the film. The constituent elements would not operate without the film's biggest triumph – its screenplay – which is among the most economic and brilliantly composed, for there are no disposable lines of dialogue; everything spoken is either cuttingly funny and heartfelt (check Doc excitedly describing the forthcoming high-school dance as ""a rhythmic ceremonial ritual""), or employed to foreshadow a temporal event later in the film.<br/><br/>Anchoring it all is Fox's stumbling charm. The boyishly good-looking Fox is charming as the lead, exuding cocksure – yet never arrogant – buoyancy. Lloyd, meanwhile, nails his Einstein-on-acid role perfectly, never venturing too far into caricature, yet spinning the archetypal mad scientist role with a wink and a nod, making it unquestionably his signature performance. Together, they make an idiosyncratic couple, for sure, but a perfect one at that.<br/><br/>In Back to the Future, there is an effervescence to the filmmaking, a bubbling, giddy effortlessness that's almost addictive. It's ingenuity, time-traveling twist ups and wonderfully vibrant characters resonate in ways few films ever achieve. It is an unadulterated cinematic experience!"
"fatherchristmas89","8","2","2","30 December 2014"," Timeless
","This film is timeless because it is about a topic that will always intrigue us, time travel and what would life be like if history was changed. It has aged very well, and I think it will continue to do so. The film is about a teenager, Marty, that is having trouble in school, his father is being bullied by his supervisor and his mother constantly reminisces about the past. He is friends with a mad inventor, who stole plutonium for a time machine, as was shot because of it. Marty, to avoid being shot himself, climbs aboard the time machine and is accidental sent back in time to when his father met his mother. As he prevented his parents meeting, Marty then has to get his parents together so that he can be born. I loved the ending 'you need to come with me, back to the future'. A perfect way to set it up for a sequel. I thoroughly enjoyed it!"

","Marty McFly, an aspiring musician and teenager living in Hill Valley California in the year 1985, takes a trip back to the 1950's using a Time Machine invented by his close friend Doc Brown. While there, he encounters his parents young selves, thus changing the futures events, Marty has to then insure that his parents fall in love to remove the damage he himself has caused to the past.<br/><br/>Directed by Robert Zemeckis, who is often associated with 1994's Forrest Gump which he won an Oscar for Best Director. Made his mark in Hollywood with 1985's comic science fiction Back to the Future, which became the most successful film of the year and received critical acclaim. However, it could all have been different. This is due to the fact that Robert Zemeckis was four weeks into shooting the movie itself, with a lead actor who did not make the final cut. Originally, Eric Stoltz was cast as Marty McFly. Michael J. Fox, then the star of TV sitcom Family Ties, was disallowed time off to work on a film as he was Zemeckis' first choice to take the Lead Role of Marty McFly. Meaning that Zemeckis looked elsewhere, specifically at Ralph Macchio and Eric Stoltz. Macchio declined the role, before Eric Stoltz took it on. However, Zemeckis decided that Stoltz had been miscast. Michael J. Fox was eventually cast and it proved to be a success. Michael J. Fox is now completely type-casted and identified as Marty McFly and no other. This shows that even though Robert Zemeckis did end up, going three million dollars over budget due to re shooting. His original idea of casting Michael J. Fox was the correct one. This is due to the fact that Fox found his portrayal to be very personal because within High School, he skateboarded, chased girls and played in bands. Very much like the character of Marty McFly. Michael J. Fox himself excels in this role, cementing his status in Hollywood, before going on to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2002. Now in the spotlight due to his battle with Parkinsons, in the 1980s Fox established himself as one of the most promising and charming actors in Hollywood. Other actors include Christopher Lloyd who previously collaborated with Zemeckis in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, which is now regarded as one of the greatest films what combine both animation and live action, continues his formidable work in a role he is most recognised for, that of Doctor Emmett Brown, which he should of received more critical acclaim for than he did. In regard to this, the casting of every character involved is perfect and all performances are of the highest standard. <br/><br/>Personally, Back to the Future is one of my favourite movies of all time. This is due to its inventive and compelling storytelling as well as the tremendous talent it shows from Actors, Actresses and those who were involved in both Editing and Special Effects. Back to the Future is like no other and in comparison to its sequels, it is a whole level above them. The Original Song ""The Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis and the News is superb as a whole and all though it does not reveal what the movie is about, the end credits song ""Back in Time"" does. I also love the use of Chuck Berry's ""Johnny. B Goode"" and how it is portrayed in the movie. It also think it is very creative, that Zemeckis shows that Berry himself got the idea of the song and his sound, from this very song as it was released in 1958, where the movie is set in 1955. Of course this is not the case, however I think it is a very inventive way to produce light comedy out of a scene. As well as Marty being named Calvin Klein for a good part of the movie.<br/><br/>The only problem I have with the movie itself, is that there is one major plot hole. Surely, George and Lorraine would recognise their child as Calvin Klein or Marty in the years to come? Or does Lorraine think that it is coincidence that her crush and the main reason why herself and George are brought together, looks exactly like her son? Nevertheless, um sure Zemeckis knows the true answer and simply decided not to bother including it in the Script. After all, it is a movie.<br/><br/>I would recommend all ages to watch Back to the Future, especially those who have an interest in Time Travel or just simply movies at all. If you dislike the movie itself, I find it hard to believe that like movies at all. This adventure, comedy, sci-fi is great for families, children and even adults. Even though the Special Effects may be a little dated, it doesn't suggest that you should not watch the movie as they are not the major selling point of the film itself. Other than that, I would recommend that you should watch Back to The Future and it should definitely be included on your bucket list and/or watch list."

When Marty went to Dr. Emmett L. Brown's (Christopher Lloyd) lab to mess around with some amplifiers he is asked by Doc to help him with his latest invention the time machine that he made with an old DeLorean. Marty was accidentally sent back to 1955 where he meets his parents when they were teenagers. Marty interrupted their first meeting and now he has to try to get them back together. Marty and Doc get into series of unfortunate events. At the end of the movie Doc again gets Marty to go on another adventure when he tell Marty and Jennifer that they have to solve a problem with their kids. <br/><br/>Society plays a big part in this film. The differences between 1985 and 1955 cultural is that in 1955 the teenage culture just started to forge its own identity. In the movie George is a wimp then with Marty's help he turns into a stronger person which makes him a confident writer with determination. This point is that if you put your mind to it you can accomplish anything, which is still how it should be. Marty states in the film that he thought his mother was like a nun, and then going back in time and seeing how she really was and how he was like his father lead him to a better understanding of himself. At the end of the movie Marty is carrying his bands audition tape to mail even though earlier he didn't want to because of the fear of rejection. The movie Meet the Robinsons also has a similar theme as Back to the Future. One Motif that this movie has is time, Marty is constantly late and the movie begins with clocks and time and this throughout the movie, time, and time travel. This really is a good movie. It is about life more so that the Sci-fi time traveling, which is just the setting for the movie. I have watched this movie tons of time and really never gets old. I do watch the sequels but the original 1985 is the best."

","This is the 3rd time I watch a franchise in 1 single day after LOTR and Spiderman. I started BTTF at 16'o clock and finish around 23 and it's the only trilogy that I get stuck from the beginning up to the end. <br/><br/>In comparison to the next ones, this first movie is indeed a pure comedy and its appeal comes from the playground being the two decades most iconic in America: the 50s and the 80s. For whatever reason too long too explain, this theme is repeated over and over into American entertainment: read ""IT"" by Stephen King or watch ""Twin Peaks"" by David Lynch for examples<br/><br/>The next great thing is the exceptional reunion of talent. Silvestri found a simple, fun main title that is easily recalled and played even today. The cast is wonderful: sure, Marty, Doc are big names but Georges, Biff and Lorraine should have a mention too. As for a fox, don't think to Michael J but rather to Lea as she is the best ticket ever to a night prom.<br/><br/>The famous Bobs (Gale & Zemeckis) are totally complementary as they know first how to find ideas and then to realize them. The thing that was clear during this first movie is that it had a plot and that the audience was followed it without pause. In today movies, the story is often too obscure and the storytelling can be tedious with nothing else to offer except than big visual effects! <br/><br/>A last note to say that I have never seen this one in a theater. In 1985, it was our parents that made the list. My first time on TV, I have to leave for an appointment before the end and when I asked my brother to tell me, I was really perplexed by his details (Marty rejoices his family turned wealthy and then goes to the future with Doc to save their children!).

The issue I have is with the IMDb ratings system that ranks this picture in the number #48 spot as I write this, with ""Citizen Kane"" at #45 and ""Vertigo"" at #51. For me, this doesn't compute. No one can justify to me how this comedy, sci-fi flick gets honored as one of the Top Fifty movies of all time.<br/><br/>Well hopefully, my minor little rant doesn't spoil things for you. I do like the film for it's players and the clever way Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) manages to navigate his way through the Fifties. I became a Christopher Lloyd fan right from the get-go when he made his debut in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and his Reverend Jim character in the 'Taxi' TV series was one of the most original ever. He's got the perfect look and attitude for a crazed scientist and it would have been cool to see him work with classic icons of the horror genre like Karloff, Lugosi and Chaney. That would have been something.<br/><br/>The thing that bugs me about the characters a bit are the way George McFly (Crispin Glover) and Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) are portrayed. They're really more like caricatures, though Biff as the town bully had a certain amount of credibility even if he was annoying. I had forgotten how attractive Lea Thompson was as Lorraine Baines, Marty's future Mom but sporting a major crush on him that conjured up all kinds of potential icky situations, but they were handled tastefully for the most part. The biggest kick for me was when Marvin Berry (Harry Waters Jr.) called his cousin Chuck to check out the new music sensation.<br/><br/>So yeah, this is a fun movie and a generally family friendly one that would have been better served if some of the language had been toned down a bit. Some of the time travel stuff goes over the top, like the scene where Marty returns from 1955 and sees himself in the present about to do the time jump. Stuff like that just makes me think about the concept too much. As for the very ending scene, that has got to be about the most blatant set up to scream 'sequel' that I've ever seen."

","Back to the Future is just one of those movies that no matter how many times you've seen every time you flip by it when channel surfing you always stop on that channel and watch it again. I've probably seen this movie a 100 times since I was a kid but if I stop on HBO and its playing I just can't help but at least watch a few minutes of it before returning to my channel surfing.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox was the absolute best actor to choose to star in this movie, he has great screen presence that whenever he's on TV he grabs your attention. It's such a shame the health problems he has had that such great skills are going to waste.<br/><br/>The movie has so many great lines that I still quote to this day."
"oneguyrambling","8","2","2","27 December 2011"," Effortlessly entertaining and incredibly creative.
","About once a decade a film emerges that is so original and new that it immediately raises the bar for the rest of mainstream cinema to aspire to, films that are both critically espoused and well supported at the box office.<br/><br/>The 70s brought us Star Wars and The Godfather (1 & 2), the 90s The Matrix, Toy Story and The Sixth Sense gave us the 'big twist' ending (for better or worse), the dubbos The Lord of the Rings trilogy (seriously, how many times has it been ripped off already?) and perhaps Avatar, and this decade so far has Inception, which although flawed is an admirable attempt at breaking the mould and creating something distinctly original.<br/><br/>The 80s was all about the adventure (Indiana Jones), Blade Runner must be mentioned and the introduction of the macho action hero (Arnie, Bruce, Sly) but at equal 4th on the IMDb Top Ranked 80s titles is a 'little' film called Back to the Future, it didn't need big explosions, huge car chases and thousands of rounds of ammunition, just a creative plot and some likable characters to inhabit it.<br/><br/>And really that's the entire Back to the Future (BttF) trilogy in a nutshell. The films don't have a huge number of jokes, the action is OK but not mind blowing and there is essentially zero sex and violence. What it does exude in abundance is charm, charm which starts with the most likable 5 foot tall guy of the 80s and 90s, Mr Michael J Fox.<br/><br/>Fox plays Marty McFly, a typical 80s 'teen' from Hill Valley obsessed with girls (namely his girlfriend Jennifer), skateboards and music. His family are also typical and loving, his Dad (Crispin Glover) is a nervous and timid wallflower and his Mum is slightly strict but well meaning. The entire family – especially Dad – is pushed around by a local moron named Biff who has tortured him since school age.<br/><br/>To blow off steam McFly has a friendship with a local eccentric scientist named Dr Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Doc's dabbles in everything scientific and has hundreds of wonderful inventions, none of which have set the world on fire.<br/><br/>But all of that is about to change.<br/><br/>Doc's latest creation is a time traveling car (a DeLoreon to be specific) that when gunned to 88mph can FF or rewind to any pre-programmed point in history. McFly is dubious but he agrees at the insistence of Doc Brown to show up at an early morning (actually late evening) trial run in a supermarket car park.<br/><br/>Using Doc's dog Einstein as the test pilot they give the car a try, and lo and behold the thing actually works! But before they even have a chance to high five and discuss how this new invention will benefit the world Libyan terrorists unexpectedly show up and gun down the Doc, with McFly only just managing to escape in the DeLorean.<br/><br/>This one act sets in chain a series of incredible and intricately plotted events that span 3 centuries and several generations of McFly's (and 'Biff's' for that matter) Marty initially is transported back to 1985 where he is hopelessly out of place. While there he manages to meet his two parents before they even have a chance to get together, his actions inadvertently prevent this from happening, meaning that he must somehow play matchmaker to his own folks else he remove himself from existence altogether.<br/><br/>There's a whole lot more to the original BttF, aside from literally justifying his own existence Marty manages to invent skateboarding and rock 'n' roll in his limited stay in 1955, all the while striving to avoid actions that somehow alter the future along the way.<br/><br/>I obviously can't go into too much detail but the ending was excellent as well.<br/><br/>Now some 25 years later time travel in films is commonplace – even Red Dwarf and Futurama have produced excellent episodes dealing with time travel paradoxes – and yes I know about The Time Machine and the 'classic' older films dealing with the topic (that I can't name). Back to the Future managed to take a science fiction core and make it interesting to the everyday movie watcher who just wants to be entertained for a couple hours (I am trying to say 'non-geeks'), the original BttF was/and is immensely original and creative, with solid performances plural by Michael J Fox as, well many McFly's.<br/><br/>It isn't laugh a minute or gasp inducing but you'll go a long while before you find a mainstream film this innovative and enjoyable, and the sequel was even better! Final Rating – 8.5 / 10. Somehow I admire the 2nd film more, but without the elaborate set-ups structured in this film that wouldn't be near as effective, and this film is effortlessly entertaining in any case."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","2","2","2 June 2011"," A classic for a reason
","Marty, a young slacker is sent 30 years back in time, and now has to worry about not only returning, but not changing events that have already happened, including that his parents met and fell in love. Whilst this is rather 80's(and granted, that has a charm of its own... it can, however, also be really off-putting), it does stand up well enough, with few jokes and gags having aged poorly. ...is one of those bullies seriously wearing 3-D glasses? The characters tend to be well-done, if there are some really obvious stereotypes(but it seems intentional). Humor works pretty well, if it can be really silly and goofy at times. The dialog is good, some really memorable lines. You always understand the ""science"" aspect, without a lot of wordy explanations, and there is no technobabble. The music is catchy. Acting is great, other than some over the top performances(again, they didn't happen by accident). It's a fun, rewatchable High School comedy flick with time-travel. The climax is also surprisingly tense, for how predictable parts of this can be. I recommend this to any fan of the decade, the cast and the concept itself. 8/10"
"BA_Harrison","10","2","2","20 November 2010"," A film you can watch time and time again.
","My DVD of Back To The Future is like my own personal time machine: I hit play on the remote and I'm instantly whisked back to 1985, when hair was big, fashion was fugly, films were fun and I was a mere 17 years of age with my whole adult life ahead of me.<br/><br/>Nostalgia certainly plays a big part in my continued enjoyment of the film, and was clearly at the forefront of the minds of producer Steven Spielberg and director Robert Zemeckis, who delight in recreating the 50s of their youth, but the film is much, much more than a simple trip down memory lane: it's a rollicking adventure, a charming love story, and a brilliant comedy, with a career-defining performance from Michael J. Fox as time-travelling teen Marty McFly, fine support from the lovely Lea Thompson, quirky Crispin Glover and crazy Christopher Lloyd, amazing special effects (for the time) from ILM, and a rocking 80s soundtrack.<br/><br/>A wonderful film that is as fresh and entertaining today, despite its inescapable 80s style, I have no doubt that Back To The Future will continue to captivate audiences young and old well after my generation is history: my kids sure loved it, and I hope that when they have kids of their own, theirs will too. And theirs, and theirs, and theirs..."

","Sometimes a film comes along and the timing of its release turns out to be absolutely perfect and in my opinion this is one of those films. Everything about this film feels right and it is nearly two hours of inventive comedy and pretty much anything else you would want from a really entertaining creation. All of the people involved in the making of this film should be congratulated on a job well done. I always enjoy watching it again and I will never lose my enthusiasm for this film. The film could have been released five years before or five years after 1985 and for some reason I do not think it would have had the same effect. We will never know but suffice to say that it is a splendid romp that does not fall into the trap of being too serious and therefore works remarkably well. I would recommend this film to anyone providing they are prepared to tune into the humour and if that happens it will be guaranteed to be an enjoyable experience."
"gcd70","8","2","2","29 May 2007"," All time favourite
","""Back to the Future"" is the most entertaining, fun-filled movie of all time. Not to mention the fact that after first seeing this at the age of fifteen (and going back for more ten times), it remained my very favourite film for years.<br/><br/>Absolutely wonderful balance of humour, drama and fantasy that finds teenager Marty McFly accidentally transported back in time to 1955. There he inadvertently prevents his parents from meeting, and thus sets off an hilarious chain of events; all of which he must fix before he goes ""Back to the Future"". Fox is perfectly cast as Marty and Lloyd is in outrageously funny form as 'Doc' Emmette Brown. Alan Silvestri's music and the incidental pop soundtrack are very enjoyable. The script from co-writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale is pure genius. Special effects are brilliant! Pure entertainment!!<br/><br/>Monday, June 10, 1991 - Golden Twin Cinema, Bendigo<br/><br/>Once again pure adventure and entertainment. A perfect combination of comedy and fantasy. Filmed well and great fun to watch!<br/><br/>Wednesday, January 15, 1992 - Laser Disc<br/><br/>I still recall the first time I ever saw this pic. It was September the 14th, 1985, and as an unsuspecting fifteen year old, I went along by chance to see ""Back to the Future"" at the Balwyn Cinema (then only a single cinema complex). I was totally blown away, and rushed out to see it again twelve days later, at the old Forum cinema (remember that place?), being bedazzled once more. Several excursions later (including a few to the Australia Twin in Collins St.) and I still couldn't get enough.<br/><br/>This was my twelfth trip to the movies to see this blockbuster of 1985. Eleven and a half years on, it is now difficult to fathom what attracted me so inexorably to this highly entertaining, yet hardly classic film. Perhaps Rob Zemeckis and Bob Gale's ingenious story of bewildered teen Marty McFly's journey back in time is finally wearing thin on me. Oh what sacrilege.<br/><br/>The fact remains though that this film is, as I've said many times before, pure entertainment. Visual and sound effects during the time traveling sequences are dazzling, art direction and set decoration both brilliantly recreate 1955 (they received an Academy Award nomination) as do costumes. Zemeckis and Gale were also nominated for their script.<br/><br/>The pop soundtrack, including Lindsay Buckingham, Eric Carmen and Huey Louis and the News, was instrumental in the film's success, and Alan Silvestri's music is an unsung hero in the proceedings. Finally, the cast are a real delight. Fox is the perfect choice for the fish-out-of-water McFly, and Christopher Lloyd is superb as the nutty Doc Brown. Lea Thompson is suitably smitten as Marty's mom, Lorraine, and Crispin Glover is a scene stealer as the geeky George McFly, whether he is under a ton of make-up - aged forty-seven - or bumbling around as a seventeen year old in 1955. Thomas F. Wilson is fun too as Biff Tannen, the bane of the McFly's existence.<br/><br/>One hundred and twelve minutes of absolute fun!<br/><br/>Monday, March 31, 1997 - Astor Theatre"
"Isaac5855","8","2","2","21 March 2007"," The Instant Classic from Robert Zemeckis that's lost none of its juice in 20 years....
","BACK TO THE FUTURE is a roller coaster ride of an adventure that firmly established Robert Zemeckis as a director to be reckoned with and officially made a movie star out of sitcom star Michael J. Fox. Fox replaced Eric Stolz in the role of Marty McFly, a misfit of a teenager whose friendship with a loopy inventor named Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) gets him into quite the pickle. The Doc has actually invented a time machine that transports Marty back to the year 1955, where he meets his parents as teenagers and must unite them romantically in order to exist and return to the year 1985. This film is expertly mounted thanks to detailed direction and a rock solid screenplay. Fox is energetic as Marty McFly and gets wonderful support from Lloyd as Doc Brown and from Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson as his parents. Kudos as well to Thomas F. Wilson, who scores as a perpetual bully in Marty's life. The movie is full of laughs, scares, and even a touch of genuine warmth here and there. If you've never seen it, treat yourself. Follwed by two sequels."
"tedg","Null","5","8","25 March 2010"," Zemeckis Flies
","This year, John Hughes died, and we were reminded of the depth of his insight into subadult suspension. Being reminded of his work impressed me. What will we think when Zemeckis dies?<br/><br/>Certainly we will be reminded of how he balanced fantasy and reality in all of his projects. Possibly it will be noted that he softened the Spielberg approach by unintuitively adding incoherence.<br/><br/>I think I will remember two films: this one and ""Roger Rabbit."" These both are deceptively trivial. Was this the first mainstream movie that played as cleverly with time travel conundrums? <br/><br/>It was not intended to spawn a sequel, and you can see that certain conventions were established that hurt the successors. But seen by itself, the idea of superimposing actors, characters and times in the same package works well. Makes this a gem.<br/><br/>Notable is once again the scientist. You have only two types: pipe smoking, chin stroking blackboard thinker who explains, or what we have here. Lloyd is wildhaired, wild-eyed. A hardware guy, not an idea guy. An active risktaker, frantic in demeanor, but with apparently no sense of scope. For instance, he spends more time on a model of how to explain catching lightning than on the apparatus itself.<br/><br/>The film revolves around his instabilities and mirrors those as instabilities in the world. It all starts when he bumps his head getting off the toilet, folded into his minute of death from jilted terrorists. Everything that follows is his wacky vision, joined by Marty when knocked out by the nuclear guitar amp.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

"tjsf-04239","10","3","4","26 October 2016"," Marty Mcfly heads back into 1955 and has to find his way back and not risk alternating the future.
","Back to the Future Back to the Future is a great movie for parents and their kids with a PG rating. It is a great movie for its originality, the soundtrack, and the setting from the time changes. The setting takes place in 1985; Marty and Doc test out a time machine, but after complete chaos Marty travels into 1955 and has to find his way back! This film is full of action, comedy, and lots of science. This movie is well known for its actors and special effects, and also the famous director, Robert Zemeckis, who directed Forrest Gump.<br/><br/>The movie has been out for over 30 years and is an instant classic. This is not your average everyday science fiction movie; it has a blend of action and comedy mixed in. With the effects of explosions and lightning bolts; you see lots of action. Also there is lots of comedy, there is a scene where Marty wakes up in his mother's room and she starts calling him Calvin because his underwear says Calvin Klein. The history behind this movie is outstanding, winning nearly 20 awards and being voted 23rd greatest movie ever in 2008.<br/><br/>The soundtrack went perfect with the movie with hit songs like, Back in Time and Johnny B. Goode. The songs represent the time frames throughout this film and add a little irony to some of the lyrics, like in Back in Time. The soundtrack has a lot of upbeat music so it makes the film feel more happy and exciting.<br/><br/>The setting swiftly changes from a rundown town in 1985 to a beautifully decorated 1955. You notice big changes, like: the cars, the way people dressed, and how new the buildings looked. Marty gets laughed at throughout the film because he wears a life vest and people think he is afraid that he is going to drown. There is also a scene where Marty is being chased by thugs and takes a kid's scooter and ""transforms"" it into a skateboard.<br/><br/>This movie was filled with block busting actors, such as, Michael J. Fox, who performed as Marty McFly. Michael, after this film, got huge into acting and also performed in films like: Stuart Little, Teen Wolf, and the Frighteners. Christopher Lloyd played Doc and he also performed in other movies and TV shows. He was in the TV series Taxi, and films like the Addams Family, Dennis the Menace, and Who Framed Rodger Rabbit. Crispin Glover, who played George McFly, performed in films like: Alice in Wonderland, Friday the 13th, and Beowulf. All three of these actors are only a select few who contributed to this great film.<br/><br/>The genre is a mix of action, comedy, and science fiction. You will see scenes of cars exploding, chase down scenes, and some explicit language, but still is safe for families to watch. There is a scene where the time travelling car vanishes into thin air and bursting into flames after reaching eighty eight miles per hour. There are lots of parts throughout the film where Marty is being chased down by terrorists and a high school bully group.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this film to anyone who loves science and wants to see an epic adventure about time travelling. It is a great film for families and the pace of the film is steady and the plot picks up quick. It is highly action packed and has scenes where you will not stop laughing. If you enjoy science and want to see a film with action, then this is the film for you; I give this film a rating of 10 out of 10."

"joshuafagan-64214","10","3","4","31 August 2015"," An Eighties Classic
","This may not be the best movie of the eighties. But it is the movie that I deem to best represent the cinema and spirit of the decade. If you're wondering, that movie for the fifties is Rebel Without a Cause. For the sixties, it's Planet of the Apes. For the seventies, it's Apocalypse Now. For the nineties, it's the Truman Show. For the 2000s, it's The Dark Knight. For the 2010s, it's... I don't know. The Social Network? Anyways; let's dive in to this film, possibly my favorite true action-comedy of all time. If I want to be entertained for two hours, this is the film I'll pop in. There are two kinds of excellence in film; the kind that appeals to what 'normal people' want in movies and the kind that appeals to those who deal probably deal far too much in the esoteric. While I firmly belong in the second group, I am a film-goer, and as such, I do enjoy the first kind. And no film offers more of the first kind than this one.<br/><br/>The comedy, the action, the tone, the stylings; they're all here. It does not try to be a big, emotional artsy movie. Instead, it just takes you for an enjoyable ride. The eighties did this kind of movie better than any decade. When you think of eighties movies, you likely think of these movies. This is the best one, but the likes of The Goonies, Ghostbusters, Gremlins, and likely any other movie in this decade with the involvement of Steven Spielberg comes to mind.<br/><br/>Not to say that the eighties didn't try to make serious movies too. they just weren't very good at it. If you're interested, look up a list of Best Picture winners. Watching them is a bit weird; they have some eighties stylings but are dead grim and often depressing. It's like watching a film from a different dimension. Some were fine (Terms of Endearment) some were not as good (Out of Africa).<br/><br/>I like the lot of them as a whole better than most. And the ones that people really like (Amadeus, Platoon, etc) that people love, I likely love more. But I will admit that they aren't exactly foremost on most people's eyes. There's a reason that there aren't talks to remake Driving Miss Daisy. And it's not because it's artistic blasphemy. They would remake The Godfather if they thought that it would make them money.<br/><br/>Here's a novel idea: how about I actually discuss Back to the Future? A high school kid named Marty McFly, down in the dumps from his high school life, where he is bullied by Biff Tannen and is under the control of the aptly named Principal Strickland (strangely, growing up, I had an insurance agent with that last name around by neighborhood. It was weird.) His home life isn't much better: his dad is a wimp, his mom is prudish enough to make one shrivel up, and his siblings are layabouts. But his life changes once his friend Doc Brown makes a time machine (2015 here. still waiting for one). As he stole plutonium form Libyan militants, they chase and kill him. While escaping in a DeLorean, Marty transports them back to 1955.<br/><br/>Thus begins the best use of nostalgia for the fifties in an eighties movie I've ever seen. Their cleverness in weaving in it is matched only by what they do with their setting. Where as a lesser movie would just throw up scenery and call it a day, this film uses every opportunity to use its setting for purposes both comedic and dramatic.<br/><br/>Whereas films like Dirty Dancing couldn't even immerse their film completely in one decade (if you're gonna be a fifties movie, don't use an eighties soundtrack), this movie somehow manages to immerse you in two decades. Their version of the fifties is solid and fully fleshed out. It does not use pandering or too many rosey tones but still manages to capture the sensation of time traveling there.<br/><br/>All this is only likely noticed on a third viewing. The first time, you are too immersed in the perfect blend of action and comedy, a trademark of Zemeckis at his best, from Forrest Gump to Who Framed (not Killed, no matter what my brain thinks) Roger Rabbit, as well as in the tight writing. The second time, you are two invested in the characters and one of the best and catchiest soundtracks of the decade. But if you watch this movie as much as I do, you notice that it is there.<br/><br/>What else is there to say? there is a reason that I have such a personal attachment to this film. The only bad thing is that we don't have a time machine that would allow this film to be watched an infinite amount of times without any real time passing. But maybe someday. After all, where we're going, we don't need roads."
"PepeGranja","10","3","4","4 November 2014"," one of the best films ever!
","Steven Spielberg is a genius for Produce Back To The Future, he strikes the perfect balance between superior quality and self- depreciation. Robert Zemeckis directs with brisk pacing, making every scene count and sharply defining the key characters. While the film never aims for more than two dimensions, Marty is eminently likable, and Lloyd makes Doc Brown, with his wild white hair and perpetually wide eyes, one of the more memorable mad scientists in movie history.<br/><br/>Lea Thompson gets the least showy but most delicate role. The film handles the potentially precarious covetous relationship between the young Lorraine and her teen-aged son with a playfully steady hand, and steers it to an unexpected but in retrospect obvious resolution.<br/><br/>The DeLorean leaving flaming tire marks as it launches into time travel is one of my favorite scenes and i love Elisabeth Shue :)"

","Time travel. Has there ever been a sci-fi concept that's gotten more mileage? H.G. Well's famous novel THE TIME MACHINE may have started it all. But to this day, imagination still booms at the possibilities of traveling through space and time. To witness historic events. Or even see where our world is heading in the future. Pop quiz: How many films can you name in 30 seconds that deal with time travel? Quite a lot, right?! In 1985, along came Universal Studios. Taking the well-worn ""Time Travel"" formula, they set out to make one of the greatest sci-fi/action films of all time. In a word, BACK TO THE FUTURE is cool! The story: Cool kid Marty McFly (played by Michael J. Fox) is friends with quirky scientist Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Doc has just built a time machine. Through a series of mishaps, Marty winds up back in the year 1955. Now, Marty's forced to track a much-younger Doc and convince the budding scientist to help him get back to 1985. Along the way, he's also bumped into his future-parents. Thus screwing up his own future. So now, he's got to find a way of getting his dad George (Crispin Glover) and mom Lorraine (Lea Thompson) to fall in love. But that's not going to be easy with the local bully, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), hanging around. The rest I'll leave for you to discover. It's an instant classic with eye-popping special effects and a stellar cast. Followed by two equally-strong sequels. So if you haven't seen the BTTF trilogy yet, what's stopping you?!"
"Hitchcoc","9","3","4","15 July 2014"," So Much Fun
","Lots of tongue in cheek. Some great characterization. A chance at redemption. These movies showed Michael J. Fox to be a wonderful comedic presence. It is sad what happened to him, but can there be a more impressive example of a person who has overcome the tribulations that life has given him. Whenever I see him in ""The Good Wife"" as the slimy, underhanded character lawyer he plays, I love that I can ""not like"" a man who is dealing with devastating Parkinson's. As the principle character in this movie, Marty is shoved from one situation to another in a time he only can guess at. He has to face the youth of his father, a febrile wimp who gets pushed around. Then, of course, there is the wonderful Christopher Lloyd as the professor. While one could never accuse this film of being true science fiction with all the implications of time travel, there is a kind of suspense that works very well. It's pure fun and is the best of the three films in my opinion."
"vanburen-sama","10","3","4","17 February 2014"," An original and inventive film
","Back to the Future is an amazingly executed science fiction comedy that pulls the audience into the world of time travel. Marty (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally sent back in time in a time machine that his friend, the mad scientist Doc (Christopher Lloyd), invented. Once in the past, Marty meets his parents when they were teenagers. He accidentally messes with the time line and his mother falls for Marty instead of his father. Marty must fix this while Doc from the past finds a way to send Marty back to his own time. If Marty cannot get his parents together in time, he will disappear from existence.<br/><br/>Director Robert Zemeckis creates an original and inventive film that that entrances the audience. However, he does not pull this off on his own. He has a wonderful cast that truly brings the script to life. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd make an amazing team. They both embody their characters and when you put them together, movie magic happens. Their facial expressions, vocal expression, and physicality make their performance interesting, believable, and likable. Their interactions verbally and non-verbally when they are sending the DeLorean back in time for the first time is priceless, because of the way their eyes speak to each other and to the audience, and their physical actions magnify the intensity of their emotions. Through this, they create a scene of suspense but one that the audience can still laugh along to. Without these two actors the movie is just that, a movie; but, they create an adventure, a comedy, and overall a story that has become a classic. <br/><br/>The music selection for this film is spectacular and plays an important role. This movie incorporates the big hits of each time period, and this does not only appeal to the audience, but also sets the mood of the movie. ""The Power of Love,"" by Huey Lewis and the News was written for this film and ended up giving the band its first number-one hit. This upbeat and overall fun song to sing along to gets the audience ready for a light hearted rocking good time. Another big hit, ""Johnny B. Goode"" by Chuck Berry is performed in this movie and is now considered to be one of the most recognizable songs in music history. Music truly can bring you back in time and this is what makes Back to the Future a hit even now. <br/><br/>This is a movie that can be watched over and over again and something new can be learned every time. Everything that is said and shown in this movie has a purpose. Whether that is a newspaper clipping, a license plate, or a phrase that is said, the director put them each there on purpose, to make the audience think. The attention to detail is amazing. One example is how the mall sign changes from ""Two Pines Mall"" to ""Lone Pine Mall"" later in the movie because when Marty was back in time he ran over one of the pines. Back to the Future is a movie that will never get old. It was a masterpiece of its time and is still a masterpiece today."

","This is one of the few movies my nerdy sci-fi self never cared about if the science was right or wrong, or about any plot inconsistencies or whatever, because it is just an incredibly fun movie from 00:01 to credits. I have seen this movie literally hundreds of times since I was a kid. I can tell you which clock in the opening sequence had the wrong time on it. I can tell you Doc Brown's address both in the past and the present. I know what kind of dog food Einstein eats. I know this movie better than ""Holy Grail"", and that's saying something. This one, part 3, and to a lesser extent part 2 are three of the best comedy/adventure/sci-fi/feelgood movies of all time, in my opinion. One simply cannot watch this movie and be disappointed. Whether you are ten or sixty, you will enjoy this movie, and continue to enjoy it every time you see it. Another Z-man classic. Go '80's!"
"ja227","10","3","4","31 March 2013"," A generational epic disguised as a sci-fi comedy
","In the movie Back to the Future, we follow Marty McFly, a typical American 1980s teen (performed by a 24 year-old Canadian...) who has big dreams. Much of his ambition is driven from his underachieving family, headed by an alcoholic mom and a nerdy beta male dad. His two older siblings aren't much better. He just can't seem to make sense of how he, a seemingly cool guy in a garage rock band, with a hot girlfriend, can be related to these losers. It is easy to see why he was drawn to a persistent dreamer, an inventor by the name of Doctor Emmett L. Brown. This relationship leads him on the adventure of a lifetime - not just his, but those of his ancestors and descendants.<br/><br/>Over the course of the film, Marty finds out that his loser, hopeless parents, once had the same hope for the future and dreams that he had. He finds out that his dad got that way that he is by suppressing his dreams to become an author due to fear of rejection, much like Marty himself is afraid of taking his guitar talents all the way. He also finds that his seemingly traditional ""nun"" of a mom was actually quite the opposite in her earlier years. It turns out they aren't that much different from himself as he had imagined.<br/><br/>This is a major theme of the film. It was very relevant in the era of the 80s, where so-called ""generation gap"" alienated teens from parents who came from an era before the cultural revolution of the 60s and 70s. Often many young people of that time thought what they saw in 50s reruns (also referenced in the film) was the way life was really life back in the 50s. This is natural. For whatever reason, younger generations paint a picture of previous generations. Some of this is their own imagination based on a lack of experience, and some is the idea that parents have of making sure their kids don't repeat the same mistakes that they did. Either way, it is an issue that kids of the ""Generation X"" or ""MTV Generation"" dealt with, and also covered in John Hughes movies like the Breakfast Club.<br/><br/>Another theme is that of the wise sage and his protégé. This goes back to ancient times, Alexander and Aristotle, David and Samuel, Arthur and Merlin, and so on. This relationship is also used in the Star Wars movies, with Luke and Obi-Wan. Of course in the modern frame of reference, a wizard, philosopher or prophet becomes a mad scientist aloof to the world, and the young protégé is a high school kid who plays the guitar and rides a skateboard. The basic idea, however, is still the same. The old man, declining in years, passes on some wisdom to the next generation and helps the hero come of age.<br/><br/>Back to the Future is, after all, a coming of age story. It is perhaps *the* coming of age story of the generation. While some come to the realization that their problems are not ""unique"" to their era through contemplation, Marty came to this realization based on first hand experience. Marty starts out somewhat immature and naive about the world. He thinks every parent started out as a parent (with maybe a few less gray hairs) and that for him it will be different. He starts to realize that the way people are in their adult life are the direct result of their choices as dumb teens, when they think that they know better. Back to the Future is a trilogy, of course, so Marty doesn't learn all of his lessons in the first movie, but he does learn a lot of them.<br/><br/>Of course this is not all that the movie offers. There are perfectly-executed action sequences, the stories of Marty's parents getting a second chance at life, and one of the best villains in a teen movie - Biff Tannen. A lot can be said about the small town of Hill Valley, with its repeating generational problems. However, I don't think this message is as universal since most today live in different towns and neighborhoods than their parents did. Still it an amusing plot device to see how these small town families repeat the same patterns over the generations. Even the manure haulers are not left out of this generational gag.<br/><br/>I call Back to the Future epic, because it is. It deals with a ""heavy"" issue - time, and plays with it in ways no other movie has before or since. The heroic scale of preserving one's own material existence seems to me to be worthy of being called epic. The isolated three-dimensional location of Hill valley is purposely small and obscure. It is not a sprawling land like Tolkien's Middle Earth or a vast space empire like Lucas' Galaxy far away. Its is very unlikely it has had many newcomers in its 100+ years of history. This isolated spot is not to give the movie a quaint feel, as small towns are used in other films, but to focus on the epic nature of time itself. The musical soundtrack of this film definitely adds to the epic feel of the movie. It is still a sci-fi comedy, however, and there are plenty of laughs to be had, and many technical wonders to behold. It's best not to label the movie and enjoy it for what it is. I think movies like this defy traditional labeling by genre."

","Hilarious, clever, and fun. Definitely a good classic. Doesn't take itself too seriously, but still provides some action and tension in the movie.<br/><br/>I thought acting was great and that though a little too eccentric, the doctor was probably the right acting for the role.<br/><br/>The plot was clever, not overly complicated, and didn't get bogged down in any stupid time paradox details.<br/><br/>It was nothing crazy, but I still thought it was entertaining. The cliffhanger at the ending was fun, as it implied a continuing adventure in time travel."
"ryansassy1","9","3","4","21 October 2012"," The movie that made time travel cool.
","Recipe for fun: take one teenaged boy from 1985, a ""mad"" scientist who's obsessed with finally getting his 30-year experiment to work, and a very special Delorean--mix in some family troubles and a complicated love triangle; cut in some quotable dialog; heat it up with plenty of action; remove from the '80s and let cool in the '50s; and top it all with Huey Lewis and the News.<br/><br/>There may be one or two people left on the planet who don't know the plot to Back to the Future. Okay: Young Marty is accidentally sent back in Doc Brown's Delorean from 1985 to 1955 and has to contact eccentric Doc's 30-years-younger version to help him get back to the future. (See what I did there? Clever, right?) Marty's biggest challenge is to not change anything in his past that could adversely affect the future -- say, preventing his mom and dad from falling in love, which would jeopardize his very existence. OOops! That's already messed up, so now he must correct the mishap or he'll disappear before he can get back to 1985.<br/><br/>Every element of Back to the Future works to create the coolest comedy of its decade. The comic situations that result from Marty trying to play matchmaker to his own parents are very well-played. Of course the best fun comes in when we get to experience (and in some cases, re-experience) the '50s from an '80s perspective. All these good times are helped along by having the easily likable Michael J Fox in the lead and the incomparable Christopher Lloyd as the hyperactive Doc -- a role he was born to play. Unflagging, quotable dialog powers the plot wonderfully.<br/><br/>Back to the Future is the kind of movie that can appeal to anybody from ages 10 to 100. When I saw this in the theater in '85 it was an instant hit across all cliques from the nerds to the jocks -- my generation's primer on time travel movies. I remember laughing right along with my mom and my little sisters. Not that many films manage to pull off that kind of magic, then or now."

","Back to the Future is a very good movie, better than I thought it would be. Everything is just about perfect with this film considering it came out in the mid-80's. The story is about a guy named Marty and his professor friend Dr. Brown. Brown invents a time machine in a car and Marty uses the car to travel to 1955 after a tragedy happens. While in 1955 and after messing up the way his parents met, he must fix this problem to avert another tragedy. The acting and directing in this film is great. The story is funny and some lines made me laugh like a hyena. The music makes the movie sound like a true 80's movie. ""Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis is an instant classic! Overall, this a movie classic for the ages. I rate this film a 10/10."
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","9","3","4","18 July 2008"," One of the best 80's movies
","The majority of 80's comedies have aged very poorly. They are not all necessarily bad, but they have a distinct 80's feel. This is not as much of a problem with Back to the Future, probably because a large part of it does not take place in the 80's! Although it does have more of an 80's feel than its sequels, I think Back to the Future will be enjoyed by audiences for many more years to come. The film has a wonderful blend of comedy, science fiction, and action so that it works on many different levels. Robert Zemeckis and the crew were able to create a perfect 1950's atmosphere, with great sets, 50's music, and 50's television shows.<br/><br/>Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox) friend Doctor Emmet Brown (Christopher Lloyd) invents a time machine out of a Delorean (a perfect choice for its futuristic look). Marty travels back to the year 1955 and accidentally prevents his father from meeting his mother, endangering his own existence. He must enlist the help of a younger Doc Brown to repair the time machine and get his parents together before he literally disappears! Things go awry when Biff (Thomas Wilson), the bully who controls George McFly's life, interferes with Marty's plans at every turn.<br/><br/>The relationships between these characters really elevate this film above its sequels. Lloyd and Fox have terrific chemistry and are always a riot in every scene together. Crispin Glover is hilarious as the nerdy George McFly, and Lea Thompson is a delight as Lorraine Banes, Marty's mother. Marty's scenes with his parents remind us that our parents were once teenagers too. Marty learns that he has more in common with his parents than he thought. He has the same fears as his father and his mother's rebellious spirit. Lorraine develops a crush on Marty that should be disgusting, but Thompson's charm and Fox's awkwardness make it hilarious.<br/><br/>I should devote some credit to the film's special effects and action scenes. In order to go forward in time, Marty and Doc have to harness the energy from a bolt of lightning and channel it into the flux capacitor (which makes time travel possible) while driving the Delorean at 88 miles per hour. This sequence remains one of the most exciting scenes I have ever watched, in large part due to Alan Silvestri's score, and I love how they were able to give the clock tower a significant role in every Back to the Future movie. The time machine going back in time is just as impressive today.<br/><br/>Back to the Future is my favorite film by Robert Zemeckis, and I doubt he will top it."
"slymusic","Null","3","4","5 February 2007"," From the present to the past and back!
","From writer/producer Bob Gale and writer/director Robert Zemeckis comes one of the greatest and most beloved films of the 1980s: ""Back to the Future""! This well-made science fiction comedy has become such a favorite among so many people, myself included, that it is on its way to becoming a true classic. The story is just as enchanting today as it was in 1985 when this film was released, and the casting could not have been better.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are absolutely superlative in their respective roles as Marty McFly and Dr. Emmett L. ""Doc"" Brown. Marty is a high school teen from 1985 who accidentally powers Doc's time machine, made into a DeLorean, to transport him back to 1955. While in the past, Marty meets Doc's younger self, and one of the most heartwarming aspects of this story is the great rapport between Marty and the 1955 Doc, even though Marty initially has great difficulty trying to convince Doc that he's from the eighties and needs his help to get back to his own time; once Doc is convinced of Marty's honesty and earnestness, he indeed does everything he can to help Marty, and he ultimately succeeds. Credit must also be given to the beautiful Lea Thompson as Marty's mother Lorraine, whose younger self has become dangerously infatuated with Marty; Crispin Glover as Marty's father George, the most pivotal character in the story as he develops courage, with help from Marty, to stand up to some nasty bullies and ultimately win Lorraine's heart; and the congenial Thomas F. Wilson as the mean Biff Tannen, George McFly's arch nemesis.<br/><br/>My favorite scenes from this charming movie include the following. At the opening, Marty strums one chord on his electric guitar and gets blown backward by the amplification in Doc's laboratory. Marty accidentally launches himself into 1955 by escaping a pair of Lybian terrorists (who hunt Doc down for stealing their plutonium) and crashing into a barn. Marty first encounters George's younger self at a small diner when Biff and his gang enter and antagonize George; this comically resembles an earlier scene in 1985 when Biff gives George a hard time after totalling George's car. Doc's horrified reaction to a videotape of his older self's mentioning 1.21 jigawatts of electricity is quite unforgettable! Biff and his thugs drive around town chasing Marty on a skateboard, but Marty outwits them and they end up crashing into a manure truck. In one of the greatest pivotal moments of the film, George doesn't realize his own strength when he knocks out Biff in one punch! And finally, at the dance, Marty sits in on guitar and plays a wonderful rendition of Chuck Berry's ""Johnny B. Goode,"" but he forgets that he is in the year 1955 and his heavy metal reflexes get the best of him.<br/><br/>I don't think there is any doubt that ""Back to the Future"" is a truly remarkable film. The direction, the screenplay, the casting, the settings, etc., are all top of the line. Writer/producer Bob Gale commented that there is something about this wonderful story to which everyone can relate; in my case, I can easily identify with George McFly's lack of assertiveness since I was frequently picked on in school. To top everything off, Marty had absolutely no idea what kind of can o' worms he was opening near the beginning of this film when he told his high school principal (James Tolkan) that history was going to change, but when Marty finally returns to 1985 near the end, he realizes how much he has inadvertently changed things for the better!"

","Why is ""Back to the Future"" my favorite movie from 1985? Because that was the year I was born! I'll be turning 22 this year, as will this film. Robert Zemeckis has had an astounding career over the last half-century, with other hits including ""Forrest Gump"" (1994) and ""Cast Away"" (2000). But his best will always be ""Back to the Future,"" at least to me. In 1985, wacky, frizzy-haired scientist Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) invents time travel, that is he builds a time machine out of a DeLorean. A series of harrowing events forces wise-cracking teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) to take the DeLorean for a test drive through time, 30 years back to 1955, before he was even born. Never mind the scientific improbabilities and paradoxes present in the script, but McFly must find a way back to '85, before his future is erased by events in the present. You see, he has inadvertently altered the course of events that will lead to his then-teenage parents (Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson) meeting and falling in love, and now he must try to get them together with a young Doc Brown's help while also facing off against Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), the local tough. ""Back to the Future"" remains a comedy classic, due largely to its mix of special effects fantasy and laugh-out loud moments. The performances are excellent, especially from Fox, who is one of my favorite actors and I do wish him well in the future with his fight against Parkinson's Disease.<br/><br/>10/10"

OK, maybe I am blind!). Michael J. Fox as the young ambitious Marty McFly and his 'Someday Jeniffer, Someday!' remain embedded in my mind. I think Fox plays the teenager to utmost perfection. I have never seen a teenager like that in my entire life!!! Doc Brown remains the most memorable scientists ever played in Hollywood! Christopher Loydd was impeccable, amazing!!! Kudos to Robert Zemickis for creating one of Hollywoods greatest characters in comedy! Amazing performances by Thomas Wilson (Biff Tannen) and Crispin Glover who plays the wimpy 'dad'.

They had to push the car with a train because they were out of gas. But there was another solution! There were 2 dolorean in 1885. The first one was the dolorean that Marty find in 1955 at the beginning of the movie and that he push with the train to go back in 1985 at the end of the movie. The second one was the dolorean that Doc have hided a few days ago near the cemetery (The car that Marty find at the beginning of the movie). Why they don't take the gas from this car?<br/><br/>There would be no problem to make a continuation to this trilogy.

Back to the future is about an regular, somewhat nerdy 80s teen named Marty McFly who is played by Michael J. Fox. He is accidentally sent back to the year 1955 in a nuclear-powered time machine that Dr. Emmett Brown (played by Christopher Lloyd) invented. He meets up with his parents and he accidentally alters time making it so his dad (played by Crispen Glover) and his mom (played by Lea Thompson) don't meet and fall in love. Therefore, Marty needs to try to get his parents to fall in love and he needs to return to the year 1985. With a great cast, much humor, and a lot of heart; Back to the future is highly recommended for anyone who enjoys excellent movies. It is one of my favorite movies of all time and anyone who passes out on this movie is missing out."

","I feel it is my personal responsibility to inform the world of this movie's brilliance. I have been in love with this movie ever since I was a kid and I still watch it regularly. It's such a fun story, and the plot is more in depth than most people realize. I swear I notice something interesting that I never noticed before every time I watch this movie. Anytime I talk to someone who hasn't seen it, I feel obligated to show it to them. The acting is superb; you'll fall in love with Doc Brown's eccentricity and wish you were as cool as Marty McFly. Overall this is a movie that will disappoint no one, regardless of your movie tastes; it has something for everyone."
"Agent10","8","4","6","29 April 2002"," A movie that should have stood alone
","This film will always be a classic. Some will call it corny, or even hokie, but it put a new spin on an old sci-fi storyline. And it was even funny! Granted, the whole concept was beaten into the ground with two sequels, the original film in the series demonstrates the timeless nature of this movie. History is always set in stone, but to provide the fantasy of minutely changing your current history is always fun to think about. This was also one of the first movies I actually watched in a theater, so I tend to have some sentimental value placed on this film. But then again, it's well deserved."
"bob the moo","Null","6","11","4 August 2006"," Very entertaining film  as slick as it is fun as it is engaging
","In 1985 teenager Marty McFly is a bit of an outcast and spends his evenings hanging out with eccentric professor Doc Brown and his various crazy and failed inventions. However when Doc asks Marty to meet him late one night in a mall parking lot, he learns that Doc has invented a working time travel system and inserted it into a DeLorean. Much to Doc's joy and Marty's surprise the machine works on its test run and Doc is all set to be the first man to travel in time when he is killed by the terrorist group who stole plutonium for him with the impression he was making them a bomb. Marty flees in the DeLorean but accidentally winds up back in 1955. Back there he convinces Doc to help him out and come up with a way of getting him back to the future. However the problem of no plutonium appears small when Marty changes the past and stops his parents meeting and falling in love.<br/><br/>In its own way this is a classic film that delivers the goods in the same way as Frank Capra's films does although I can understand why for some it doesn't hold quite the same appeal. The plot seems complex as it involves time travel and such but it is deceptively simple and is a clever mix of sci-fi and romantic comedy that is as light and enjoyable as you could hope for. It never makes fun of itself but it never takes itself too seriously and by doing this it pitches it just perfectly. The narrative may be light but it is consistently engaging whether it is the time travel aspect or the relationships. It isn't perfect and it isn't the deepest of films but it is effortlessly a lot of fun and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>The cast are roundly great and are a big part of the film being as light and fun as it is. For my money this is Fox's best all-round performance and he plays the clean-cut American teenager really well bringing energy to the character. Of course Lloyd's performance dominates the film by its sheer colour and energy, making him the most memorable character of the piece. Thompson and Glover (two people who still look young twenty years later damn them) are both good in their roles and work well together and individually to make their part of the narrative match up to the (superficially) more appealing sci-fi stuff. Zemeckis directs with an eye for a memorable shot and visually his film matches the style and vitality of the narrative.<br/><br/>Overall a very good film that is every bit as pleasing as the Frank Capra feel-good films that are held up as classics. Whether this film is a classic is as much up for debate as those films' classic status but it isn't really a debate that means a lot to me. What matters is that the film is engaging and entertaining, which it consistently is. It glides through a slick plot and I always enjoy it when I revisit it. Well worth taking a look if you are after a great piece of family fun."
"niamherz88","10","3","5","25 February 2007"," Best film ever
","In my opinion this film is the best ever. Why you may ponder as you search aimlessly through the database that is IMDb.com. Why purely for its comedic value of course. Who can honestly say they didn't laugh when Marty McFly landed Biff in a pile of Manure or When he encounters Doc in 1955. And it is not just comedy alone which makes this film so enjoyable. It is also the unique insight it offers into a situation which we could never hope to experience, that of seeing our parents as teenagers. And so If your wondering why this film has achieved cult status, stop, simply pick up a copy and watch Marty and doc rev up the delorean to 88mph and see for yourself. You wont regret the experience. 27 years later no one has."
"olsonfamk","8","3","5","6 January 2007"," The ultimate Time Travel movie
","I've seen this movie about 100 times, and I never get tired of it. It has great humor and a great plot line. Just the time traveling in the movie intrigues me. Michael J. Fox does an excellent job as Marty Mcfly and Christopher Lloyd does an excellent job as Doc Brown. There isn't a single bad actor in the film ( well, maybe one, though I haven't looked for him/her). The only bad thing about this film is the swearing. I love this film, but there is just a bit too much swearing for my taste. It wouldn't be as bad if there was only a little, but there is a TON! I mean, come on! They're not even necessary to the film and make me cringe every time I hear them. There are other things that they can say. All in all, if you like movies with good actors, good humor (mostly ) and good plot points and twists, then this is the movie for you. I recommend the whole Trilogy! 8/10 ( -2 for swearing )"
"jboothmillard","10","3","5","16 June 2005"," Back to the Future
","If you like science-fiction films, then you'll love this from director Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump) and executive producer Steven Spielberg. Basically Marty McFly (Golden Globe nominated Michael J. Fox) is the young aspiring teenage musician and friend of Dr. 'Doc' Emmet Brown (a fantastic Christopher Lloyd), and finds out that Doc has invented a time machine with a DeLorean car. It is run by tremendous power from plutonium, which he took from the Libyans, who find him and shoot him. When Marty escapes from them in the car and excels to 88mph (the speed needed to time travel) he is transported unintentionally to 1955 (which Doc set). Unfortunately, while looking for Doc to help him get home, he interferes with the history of his parents in this past, where they meet and fall in love, making his mother love him! Marty now not only has to get his parents, George (Crispin Glover, who did not return for the sequels) and Lorraine (Les Thompson) to fall in love again to restore history/the future, before he and his brother and sister are erased from existence, but the only power available instead of plutonium to get him back to the future (1985) is a bolt of lighting that will hit the clock tower (they know this from a paper he brought from 1985). A fantastic look at how time is so precious, and what can change from the tiniest history interference, aka time paradox. By the way, the plutonium was changed to trash in the end to help explain the sequels. Also starring Thomas F. Wilson as Biff Tannen, Claudia Wells as Jennifer Parker (who was changed in the sequels to Elisabeth Shue) and Titanic's Billy Zane as Match. The story is original and though provoking, the characters are lovable, and the special effects are great, just a great film. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Effects Editing, and it was nominated for Best Song for ""The Power of Love"", Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Screenplay, Best Special Visual Effects and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical, Best Original Song and Best Screenplay. It was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Outstanding!"

","Back to the Future is one of the most original and unique movie of the 1980s. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd have great chemistry together, which the film benefits from. Tom Wilson is also great as Biff. Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale came up with a great script. Also great special effects. Thumbs up."

","Well made film with Fox expertly giving his all as Marty McFly, who boards a DeLorean time machine and finds himself at his parents senior year in 1955, helping his wimpy father court his mother. Still fantastic special effects and still a very entertaining movie."
"james1080-272-547223","5","12","33","26 July 2015"," Seriously?
","Come on, Back to The Future isn't all that great. Yes it has its moments, courtesy of Christopher Lloyd's slightly crazy Doc, Michael J. Fox' wide eyed looks of confusion and some superb special effects but the pace falters, the humour runs dry one too many times and because of all the positive buzz, constant recommendations and reviews stating it to be one of the best films, and standing high in the IMDb top 250 I can't help but feel disappointed and underwhelmed. Robert Zemeckis is a good director, countless hit films especially Flight which is an incredible movie. But people hailing this as some of his finest work? No, seriously this is an average film at best."
"K3nzit","6","2","3","28 December 2019"," Hasn't aged well
","Even though it's a fun ride, I can't say I'm a huge fan of it. Had I seen it as a kid the nostalgia would probably carried into today and I would appreciate it more. But the fact is that it hasn't aged as well as some other 80's movies. It's manly the slapstick elements that don't hold up in my opinion. But I still liked Fox and Lloyd as Marty and Doc and the time travel concept is fun as always."
"Crystal_Hansen","7","2","3","31 January 2019"," Another great performance by Christopher Lloyd
","I know I've seen this movie before but I couldn't remember when or what happened. I kept getting it confused with Flight of the Navigator, a very similar movie in which a 12 year old boy disappears for eight years and suddenly comes back having not aged at all. Set in very similar time periods, it was easy to get them confused. Both are about time travel. One goes to the past and almost messes up history. One goes to the future after being gone for an extended period of time. Neither character look like they've aged. Marty is only in the past for a week, so you can't really age that much anyway.
When Marty McFly travels back in time to 1955 and spends that week with inventor Dr Emmett Brown who he knew in 1985. When Marty saves his father's life and gets hit by his grandfather's car, he has to figure out a way to get his parents together so that he'll still exist in the future. His father, once a poor businessman who gets bullied by his boss, becomes a wealthy author whose childhood bully becomes an employee and has to wax his cars.
After reading some of the Goofs on this site, I learned that there were quite a few historical errors, mostly relating to when a particular thing was first introduced to society. Silly things like a Pepsi thermometer in the soda shop that wasn't introduced to society until a couple years later. Or the type on a poster that wasn't around that year. Or the vibrato thing on Marty's guitar when he's playing at the dance. I've seen Flight of the Navigator a movie that takes place in 1986, a little more than a year after this movie.
Christopher Lloyd as an actor is awesome. He's played many roles in many different movies and TV shows. He voices the Hacker in the children's series Cyberchase. He's the criminal guy in Dennis the Menace. He plays as Doctor Emmett Brown in all the Back to the Future movies. He's the professor in the second season of the BYUtv series Granite Flats. He voices Rasputin in Disney's version of Anastasia. Those are just the movies and tv shows I can think of off the top of my head. How many movies has this guy played in? He plays all of his roles beautifully and I would definitely watch other movies that he's in. He's a great actor. He seems to get a lot of roles for villains and crazy old people, but he plays them well."

","Back to the futur is a film you simply never want to stop watching
I was greatly looking forward to this movie and it didn't disappoint me"
"CuriosityKilledShawn","9","2","3","29 January 2016"," Take me away, I don't mind
","Now more than 30 years after its release it's virtually impossible to review BTTF and say something that is new. Almost all observations of the film have already been made and the chance that my review will seem stale and familiar has put me off for years, but now is the time to finally get it done.<br/><br/>Since there are as-of-yet undiscovered tribes in the heart of the Amazon jungle who already know the plot of Back to the Future I will forgo typing out a synopsis. Time travel is a tricky device when plotting movies. It can work in your favor or it can destroy you. Both the Terminator and Star Trek have suffered under the paradoxical strain of time travel. I suppose the main lure of the concept is the chance to go back and live key moments in your life and do them differently, putting right what once went wrong - the lifetime pursuit of Doctor Samuel Beckett.<br/><br/>Back to the Future is a pop culture giant for many reasons. The iconic poster art, the fire trails, the instantly recognizable DeLorean, the title font, the costume design, the locations, Alan Silvestri's thrilling score, Huey Lewis' emblematic theme tune, but mainly for the dual time period. 1985 was present day when it was released but as I type this review it is 31 years in the past. In 1985 the western world still had a naive innocence, a hope that the future could be bright. Culture was hedonistic, optimistic, willing to experiment. In the three decades since then we have become bitter, pessimistic, and cynical. Dystopia, dysfunction, and distrust has permeated the majority of households. We are no longer a society that plans for the future, only to struggle through the day-by-day grind of increasingly hopeless existence. We long for the glory days of 1985 and Back to the Future allows us to access that dream.<br/><br/>But there was an even more naive and innocent time, a world that Marty McFly finds himself trapped in with only a chance lightning strike to send him back home. 1955 Hill Valley (or Kingston Falls if you look at it from a Gremlins perspective) is a post-WWII Utopian Americana where the streets are clean, the world is safe, and the lifestyles are wholesome. It's a rose-tinted insight into forever gone era. Society has grown darker and darker over the decades. We all wish we had a nuclear-powered time machine to stop this ever-declining spiral and skew the timeline into an alternate present.<br/><br/>Back to the Future is a good movie, a great movie, a perfectly cast and acted movie, an all time best and a classic for all the right reasons, but its main appeal is that it makes the viewer think ""what if I had that chance?"" I think most people would sacrifice their comfortable familiarity of their known present to go back in time and radically change the future for the better, and what better style to do that in than a DeLorean?<br/><br/>This movie will never age. It's an icon of its era and a movie that defines an entire decade. It will stand the test of time (pun intended) and will appeal to each new generation for all of the above reasons. <br/><br/>That's just the power of love, man."
"kironakumura","10","2","3","15 August 2015"," A nostalgic phenomenon
","This is my absolute favorite childhood movie. I grew up with it and i'm extremely excited for it's return to the cinema in October 2015. It tells the story of Marty McFly portrayed by M.J.Fox. A boy who catches his best friend Doc (Emmett Brown) building a time machine out of a Delorean. Unfortunately Doc presumably dies by getting repeatedly shot in the chest by a bunch of Libyans. So Marty escapes from them by using the time machine and goes back to 1955. I am not going to furthermore spoil the plot, but it definitely gets more and more intriguing. Considering this is only the first movie of a trilogy i can honestly say that it is my favorite of the bunch, because of it's originality."
"Eightiesjunkie","10","2","3","11 April 2014"," ""If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.""
","When you're reviewing a film that you love, it's hard sometimes to describe all the things that you love about it. Which is the greatest challenge I have in reviewing this. I'll try not to go into too much detail, but I will also try to go in as deep as possible as to why I love the film. When the film opens we're introduced to the Character of Marty McFly. He's a typical 80's teen, but also good natured at heart. Marty has dreams and aspirations of being a rock star, but is too unsure of himself to pursue them. He is best friends with the eccentric but lovable, Dr. Emmett Brown. We don't know how Marty and Doc became friends, but we can understand why they are. Doc is always guiding Marty to do what is right, and indirectly showing him to never give up. Their relationship in the film is one I really love, Because Doc is not just a mentor to Marty, he's also a somewhat surrogate parent. The plot is simply this: Doc calls Marty up, and asks him to come help him with his new invention: A Delorean time machine. Things go wrong, and Marty ends up sending himself back in time to 1955. Shortly afterward, Marty accidentally interferes with his parents meeting. So Marty must now try to repair the damage he caused, while Doc tries to find a way to send Marty back home. So, what do I love about the film? To begin with, everything! I love the film's concept: If I knew my parents in high school, would I be friends with them? When you're a kid, the only way to find out how your parents acted when they were your age was to ask a grandparent or relative, but think how different and exciting it would be to actually see it! I love the film's message: ""Never give up, and never stop trying."" I love the performances that all the actors give, and I love the re-creation of the '50's atmosphere. (I'm a big fan of '50's movies, music, and TV shows.) I just love the film all around. Would I recommend this to someone who hasn't seen it? YES, absolutely! Back to the future is one of those movies that you can watch multiple times, and with each time, it still holds as much magic as the first."
"ComedyFan2010","10","2","3","25 March 2014"," A time travel movie that never gets old.
","The movie takes us on a great time travel where a teenager McFly meets his parents when they were teenagers. He both needs to get back to 1985 but before that to get his parents to fall in love with each other so he doesn't get erased from the existence.<br/><br/>The movie is absolutely great. It has so much energy and there is always something happening. It is also great to look into the past. Nowadays 1985 is old times as well so the movie has twice the charm when we get to see both the 80's and the 50's. And the writers did a great job to make jokes to show us the differences between those times. Even as somebody who hasn't lived in the 50's I could get them, and the jokes about let's say Marty's 80's vest are even more hilarious to us now. So the movie aged very well, if it didn't even get better.<br/><br/>The casting is also perfect. Michael J. Fox is the right actor for Marty. He was not the one cast at first but I am so glad they got him. Even though Eric Stoltz is a great actor, but the footage with him from Back to the Future had a more serious feeling to it, it kind of was losing the charm I love so much. Maybe then there would be no other sequels.<br/><br/>Christopher Lloyd created a great persona as Doc. If I see a picture of him I would always recognize him. He always has this great crazy scientist in him. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover who played Marty's parents made a wonderful performance by being them at different ages. The make up artists also contributed to the success of it.<br/><br/>I loved this movie as a kid, I love it now. It has everything that I like for such a genre: great cast, a fun story, great lines, well connected plot and perfect time setting. One of the movies I can watch again and again."

","Lou: You going to order something, kid? Marty: Ah, yeah. Give me a Tab. Lou: I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Marty: Right. Give me a Pepsi Free. Lou: You want a Pepsi pal, you're gonna pay for it. <br/><br/>Within that one single exchange between Back to the Future's (1985) protagonist Marty (Michael J. Fox) and the neighborhood soda jerk there are so many things going on. Marty has traveled back thirty years into the past and is slowly coming to terms/panicking about where he is and how he got there. Studebakers and old Mustangs drive by the window, the future mayor of Hill Valley (played by Donald Fullilove) mops behind him and a younger version of his father (Crispin Glover) sits right next to him. Yet all the audience is supposed to pick up is that the lingo in Hill Valley circa 1955 is completely different than what he's used to which leads to this hilarious exchange.<br/><br/>While Pepsi Free no longer exists and Tab iswell Tab, the fact still remains that Back to the Future remains the epitome of a timeless classic. It's a classic based on its plot: a teenager who has befriended an oddball scientist (Christopher Lloyd) goes back into the past with his time machine and has to get back. It's a classic based on its sub-plot: said teenager messes up his mother and father's first meet and has to make the two fall in love before he's never born. It's a classic because of its state-of-the-art special effects which really haven't aged all that much and it's confident direction led by Robert Zemeckis. Finally it's a classic because of its humor and heart. How many times have you seen time travel in a movie and ask yourself honestly, whose done it any better?<br/><br/>Back to the Future made full fledged movie stars out of its likable leading man Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. Lloyd's Doc Brown is an unforgettable character that is permanently etched in this writers head. He's the gold standard of mad scientist that all future lab-coated eccentrics have to reach before I can deem them worthy. Fox's lovable Marty is smart, creative and surprisingly full of energy. Up until that point Fox had a regular gig on Family Ties (1982-1989) and had to work both projects averaging five hours of sleep for three months to finish the picture; it's a wonder he doesn't look like a wax statue.<br/><br/>It is said that Robert Zemeckis had tried for months to get a meeting with Steven Spielberg before finally bursting into his office unannounced and showing him his USC student film. Spielberg (German for childhood hero) would go on to executive produce his first few movies including the solidly acted box-office failure Used Cars (1980). Around that time, Spielberg also produced films by Joe Dante, Chris Columbus and Kevin Reynolds, but it was Robert Zemeckis who left the biggest mark on cinematic entertainment. It was his attention to detail and early adoption of computer generated special effects in Back to the Future that established Zemeckis as a technical wunderkind. Zemeckis would follow the success of Back to the Future with the equally inspired Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) and has since become a producer/director himself.<br/><br/>Yet Back to the Future remains a timeless package of an auteur at his zenith. A tight, clean story told with energy and panache. It has no equal and will likely never be pushed off its perch as the king of unfettered quality entertainment. In the realm of childlike wonder, Spielberg may be king but his best film is arguably not one he has directed himself but one he produced. And that production is 1.21 gigawatts of awesome.<br/><br/>http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"

","Back to the future can only be described as a 1980's culture epic. This seems to be the first of the director and writer Robert Zemeckis' bright idea's which seem to come along once a decade, other film's he's noted for include the 2007 3D-Beowulf and Forest Gump.<br/><br/>The whole film can be seen as nothing short of spectacular family fun. A great treat for any kid or adult looking to have a nice time. Beyond the wonderful mask the film wears though it has themes of bullying, class, incest, love, and justice. All the while containing a perfectly paced film that never lets you down. It may not be the worlds greatest film ever made, though that is up to opinion. But could be seen as a shining example of a good film. It's plot is relatively easy to understand, but it never treats the audience as stupid.<br/><br/>The acting isn't bad, (despite my hatred for Michael J fox: See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqUo8RaJ23Q . This is how much I dislike Michael J. Fox) and the film shows brilliant parallels between scenes, all the while being an adventure with lovable characters, and an insight to a world far from our own. With great music from the 80's, including The power of love, by (see: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-hUkO13Fy8)Huey Lewis and the news, memorable for other scenes in film history.<br/><br/>Recommendations: Back to the future II & III, Works of Stephen Spielberg and Forest Gump.

","Back to the Future is the perfect movie. After countless (upwards of two dozen) viewings, I am convinced that it is flawless and in my opinion, the most enjoyable movie ever made. The movie's premise is teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) goes back in time and screws up his parents' first meeting. What separates this from any other sci-fi movie is the constant humor and more than anything, the fun that everyone so clearly had in making it. The actors are all great and perfectly cast, and the movie is never boring; literally every moment is enjoyable. And it seems to get better with every viewing. From the opening song ""The Power of Love"" to the fantastic climactic ""Enchantment Under the Sea"" Dance, Back to the Future will captivate you.

DeLorean uses plutonium as fuel so Doc steals plutonium from Libyan fringe group then they shoot him to death. So Marty has to tell Doc about this accident too in 1955. Will he able to solve all...or...!? This movie is enjoyable for men and women of all ages I think. It is thrilling and dramatic with happy ending. I recommend you to watch it and sequels(2,3)."

","Run Marty Run is a euphemism for the loss of Marty's integrity. Marty was doing badly in school and doc did not know what to do about it. Especially in math class, Marty was doing very badly. And doc loved Marty and did not know what to do about it. So he created the time machine so that Marty would learn how to count better and he did not want to hurt Marty's feelings by telling him that he knew how badly he was doing in math class. Doc had covert intelligence reports on how Marty was doing in school. So the time machine was just a way to teach Marty how to count better without hurting Marty's feelings. ""Run Marty Run!!!"" is supposed to become colloquial English for when somebody has done something wrong."

","I recently have been collecting movies and one I constantly come back to is Back To The Future. The nostalgic feel of the movie with its contemporary portions set the stage for this film that you will enjoy watching over and over again. The casting was fantastic, the scripts well done, and the pacing excellent. Throughout our generation and those next we will all search for that flux capacitor that will show us what has made great movies in the past and find this title begging to be watched and replicated.Truly this movie deserves its ranking in the top 250 movies and possibly one higher than 125. So put on an old t-shirt, pop some corn, get back in that comfortable recliner and put on this classic that will surely shoot to the top of your favorites list."
"Bogmeister","8","2","3","12 March 2006"," When Time Traveling, Avoid Your Parents
","There aren't too many time travel movies around, mainly because ""The Time Machine,"" ""The Time Travelers"" and ""Time After Time"" films pretty much covered the subject. Then ""Star Trek"" used up the premise in its TV episodes and films, and there was even that ""Time Tunnel"" TV series in the mid-sixties. One option was to do such a movie with humor, pointing out the potentially absurd ramifications of traveling to your own past. So the main character of Marty McFly (Fox) ends up meeting his own parents when they were his age. Though this is a relatively tame comedy as far as teenage comedies of the eighties, there is the risky Oedipal element of Marty's own mother having the hots for him. This concept is then tossed aside near the end when, in a rather lame scene, his mom stops her advances because she suddenly feels like she's kissing her own brother. Disney should've went with this after all - it's possibly the least offensive picture of the decade and probably also explains its huge popularity - everyone could enjoy it.<br/><br/>What elevates this above the common film are a few things: Glover's performance as Marty's father, both in younger & older incarnations, is deliriously eccentric; where everyone else is kind of in TV-movie mode, he's off in his own zone and hard to forget. There's an energy to the entire story thrust (from director Zemeckis), helped by Fox, who always seems anxious about something. The concept of time travel itself gets a clever redux here; we find out you can actually change reality in the present by your actions in the past - there's no mention of creating a parallel universe, for example. The ending is pretty strong, throwing in an extra whammy when we think things are over and everything is back to exactly the way it was. And it's very entertaining to watch Marty explore the fifties - we see through his eyes - the culture shock and making various connections between the older and new decades is a nice routine. There were also a couple of wildly funny moments involving Marty dressed up as an alien from outer space."

","Quite simply the most entertaining time-travel movie ever. The story is magnificent all the way, expertly written with some of the most memorable dialog ever to grace the silver screen. It's lighthearted approach is spot on, the film has a suspenseful finale and last but not least the cast is the best.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox is just perfect in the lead and Christopher Lloyd is even more perfect as the crazy scientist who invents time-travel. Crispin Glover is hilarious as Fox's Dad, Leah Thompson has never been lovelier and Thomas F. Wilson is a riot as the ultimate bully (Wilson proved to be Part II's sole saving grace).<br/><br/>Terrific filmmaker Robert Zemeckis directs with a sure hand, the film is fast paced, has a great soundtrack (Johnny B. Goode has never sounded better), great special effects, in short; Back to the Future has everything that a great comedy is supposed to have, in spades.<br/><br/>Must have seen like 20 times and I never tire of it. This is timeless entertainment and in light of recent comedies one can better appreciate the level of fun this movie provides. They simply don't make 'em like this anymore."

","This movie came out just a year after I graduated high school, and by then I had seen many movies of many genres. Back to the Future was, in my opinion, not only well written, but also well acted. This is definitely a classic for anyone who is a collector.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly has befriended an eccentric scientist whom he calls, ""Doc."" The scientist is one zany actor, Christopher Lloyd. The two are a wonderful pair. If any of you remember, Michael was in Family Ties, and Christopher was in Taxi. Brilliant actors, and a brilliant unfolding script.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so wonderful is that it isn't exactly predictable. You will be on the edge of your seats if you tend to get wrapped up in a move. I know I thought I had it solved in the first fifteen minutes as I usually do, but no! There are many details that would tend to escape the untrained eye for the two sequels to follow.<br/><br/>If you are going to watch this movie, then be prepared for the next two. They are the filler for this. And like I said, pay attention to everything."

","This film has a pace & magnificence which transcends major holes in the plot/ script. Michael J Fox & Christopher Lloyd are at the top of their careers in this film. They have capable support although the sequels proved that even though Crispin Glover has a good sized supporting role in this film, he really does not add anything by his presence as he is not even missed in the sequels. He did sue producers for the using stock footage of him in the sequels & won the suit, but he'd have been better off to have appeared in the films because he is now much in danger of being referred to as Crispin who? <br/><br/>I love the Huey Lewis songs in this first installment. It is nearly impossible to write a time travel film & get it right but you love the main characters & the music so much that you don't care but some obvious ones include Marty McFly paying for coffee in a 1950's Cafe with 1980's money. The license plate coming off the car when they transport Einstein is a great effect but also makes no sense. <br/><br/>The changes in the photo of the McFly kids make no sense as why would only the oldest son be effected by problems in the space-time continuum? Humor is a main ingredient of this movie. From classics like how to open a Coke bottle in the 1950's to ""who the hell is John F Kenedy?"" to Pepsi Free, there is humor throughout the film. I like the Fox - Llloyd quotes:<br/><br/>""You built a time machine out of a Deloran?"" ""The way I see it, if your going to travel through time you gotta do it with some style!""<br/><br/>The people who carry this film are Michael J Fox & Christopher Lloyd who is really over the top. Put your brain away, & get on into the DMC time machine. Enjoy it!"

"rebeljenn","9","2","3","13 November 2005"," One of the best
","This is the film that started it all. Back to the Future is an original film in which time travel meets comedy. The film is told well with plenty of jokes. One of the best things about it is that it makes science fiction look 'cool' and introduces that genre to a wider audience who previously thought that science fiction was all about geeks dressed up looking like Star Trek characters. There is a good blend of comedy and action, and the general public was able to appreciate it for the comedy and popular culture -- and for the 1950s jokes and characters that we can identify with. If you haven't seen it, this is a film that should not be missed. I am glad to see that it is still popular."

","Back to the Future is a movie I can guarantee you will enjoy. It starts off when Marty McFly gets into a lot of trouble. Including with his girlfriend and school (are you surprised?!). But then Marty realizes, his best friend, a scientist who he calls 'doc', just invented a time machine... and guess what? It actually works! But then something happens. When he is about to go to the year 1955, doc is shot by Libyain terrorists from whom he stole plutonium, the liquid that makes the time machine work. Without any choices, Marty scrambles into the car and... finds himself in the year 1955. But the story doesn't end there. Marty accidentally stops his parents (who were teenagers then) from meeting and falling in love with each other, and puts his life at risk. Because if his parents never met, that means that they never had any children. And if Marty doesn't get to get his parents to meet each other.. it means that him and his brothers will simply disappear off the face of the earth. Also, Marty and the young doc encounter another problem. Marty needs to get back to the future, and he can't as plutonium was barely known in the 1950s. So how will he do it? See and find out! This movie is simply cool. Not only is it funny, it also has an excellent script and dialog. I like the cast and the characters and I also liked the set decoration. Nearly everything about this movie is good. However, you have to pay full attention at the start to understand what happens later. But that doesn't spoil it. Rating: 7.5/10"
"graemesmith50","10","2","3","8 August 2005"," I love Back to the Future
","This film is probably one of the best films of all time and a modern classic. I don't really like sci-fi films but this appeals to people on so many levels and genres that things like that don't really matter. Christopher Lloyd plays Doc Brown to absolute perfection when he swans around as if conducting an orchestra. Michael J Fox is the star of the movie but the supporting roles are cast so well that all of the characters are stars in their own right. I particularly like Thomas F Wilson as Biff and the way that he gets more manic and vicious as the trilogy unfolds. The combination of excellent special effects, brilliant directing and the true skill of the actors means that this is one of the few mainstream cult classics. It's a film for the whole family without being patronising or babyish. Ace!"

","This is one of those movies, you can watch anytime! It's funny the first time, it's even funnier the second time, and the third time it's still very funny, but you notice the small details in the movie. Examples: In the first movie, when Marty goes to see the Time machine for the first time, he drives (on a skateboard) by a sign that says ""Twin pine mall"". When he escapes from Old Man Peabody in the car, he hits on of Peabody's Pines, (there where 2 of them) - and when we see the mall later on in the film (when he has come back to the future), the sign says ""Single Pine Mall"" Another is in third movie. At first the ravine is called ""Shonash Ravine"", and in the future (before Doc and Marty arrived) it's called Clayton Ravine, because Clara Clayton should have fallen in it. But because they save Clayton and Marty, who's known as Clint Eastwood back then, falls in it instead. Well of course he does not fall in, it's just the train, but Doc must have said to the people in Hill Valley, as an excuse. So they name the Ravine after Clint Eastwood (Marty), so it's called Eastwood Ravine. And there's a lot of these funny small things in the movies, and that's just a fraction of the reason why this film is one of the best ever made!"

"cineasten89","10","2","3","25 May 2005"," A great movie... memorable.
","I grew up loving this movie. I have surely been watching this movie some hundred times. The first time I was watching this movie was surely when I was about six years old. I knew Michael J. Fox - I just didn't know his name. I recognized him overall - in Spin City, The Frighteners etc. I had no good understanding of this movie when I was six years old, but hey, I was fascinated. Some five years later, I watched this again. With full understanding of this movie, I was not only fascinated - I completely loved it. Buying the DVD back in 2002, I watched this movie very regular in a period, pausing a while, trying to memorize everything. And it only raised my fascination and love for Back to the future.<br/><br/>The plot? Marty McFly (J Fox) is an ordinary teenager in 1985 who usually meets his friend, the crazed doctor Brown (played by genial actor Christopher Lloyd), for some scientific researchs. But one night, he will find out what Dr Brown really is preparing - a time machine into a car. Surprised, but anyway fascinated, McFly loves the idea. But of an accident, McFly is going back to 30 years earlier his present date. And it is then he has to reunite his parents before everything goes weird - and if he doesn't replace everything as it was before, he risks to be unborn. <br/><br/>Sounds crazy? Right. It does. But it is the point. Mixed with smart humor, well-done dialogs and fine ending, it is probably one of the best genre movies I've been watching. It's not only a science fiction movie. It is also a coming-of-age movie, mixed with action, comedy and drama. And all simply, Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd, in particular his crazy Einstein-hair, make this movie great. <br/><br/>Highly recommended for you who want a mix of everything a Friday night."
"jkenny-2","10","2","3","3 May 2005"," Marty McFly learns that if the future is going to change, he'll have to change it
","I don't really see this movie as science fiction at all. Science fantasy, maybe. How does this time machine work? Marty asks. Well it's the good old flux capacitor, Dr. Brown ""explains."" In the original ""Time Machine"" movie, scientific explanations are even lamer. How does it work? Push the lever forward you go into the future; push it back and you go into the past! Why, thank you! It's perfectly clear now. No, no. There is no real science in ""Back to the Future."" The technological premise is a mere excuse to ruminate on the vicissitudes of fate and the possibility of doing something very difficult but crucial: changing your history. Marty learns that, maybe--just maybe--if you go beyond yourself and do something beyond what you think you can, beyond what you have seemingly been set up by fate to do, then you can change history--fate--not only for your self but for others as well, for your progeny, your family. Thus the real hero of this morality tale is not Marty but the old man. With Marty's help, he eventually stands up to Biff, something he never did the first time around and everything changes! The family is now hip and smart, classy, loving and cool! When I first saw that last scene (and when I still see it today), a tear of humanistic joy comes to my eye. The whole family is redeemed for at least a generation, because George learns a Hemingway lesson: a coward dies a thousand deaths, but a brave man only one. If Biff had killed him in the parking lot, then, at least, it would have been ""The Short, Happy Life of George McFly."" Sweet, sweet, sweet redemption. I love it!"
"thegreat1_921","10","2","3","18 April 2005"," simply one of the best movies ever

I won't give the movie away, but Marty must get back from 1955 to his era of 1985 AND make sure that his parents fall in love. Otherwise, he and his siblings will never be born!

"hseldon10","10","2","3","29 March 2005"," The Grandfather paradox goes boink!
","This movie is a marvelous exploitation of the grandfather paradox. This paradox is a supposed impediment for time travel: If a young man goes back in time and makes his grandmother fall in love, then, his grandfather cannot marry her, therefore, his father is never born and he is never born and can never go back in time to make his grandmother fall in love with him. (A paradox, in this sense, is, as said by Marty McFly in Back to the Future II, one of those things that can destroy the universe).<br/><br/>So, Zemeckis, with his amazing attention to detail, combines the talents of Christopher Lloyd and Micheal J. Fox to create one of the best science fiction movies of all time! It is a great comedy that attempts to laugh at how quickly does the past vanishes in front of the present, but also, how firmly does it remain (as firm as a Lone Pine Tree). Action packed, scientifically hilarious, Back to the Future is a movie that is icon of the 1980s."
"DavidSim240183","10","2","3","9 January 2005"," My all time favourite time travel movie.
","I first saw Back to the Future a year ago. I couldn't believe I'd avoided seeing it for so long. It has to be one of the most enjoyable time travel stories ever put on the big screen, because it uses science fiction, and grounds the story in human emotion.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis made a name for himself as a director with Back to the Future, because it was with this film he demonstrated how his storytelling can be likened to Frank Capra. In other words, he infused the intricacies of time travel with a benign, gentle touch, and with his own sensibilities too.<br/><br/>Beginning in 1985, our tale centres around Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox). A typical teen of the 80's into skateboarding, rock n roll and girls, he is a young man who just wants to prove himself. He believes he can break the family curse common with all McFly's. Marty could actually amount to something.<br/><br/>The rest of his family are really just a bunch of losers. Marty's father, George McFly, is the biggest loser going. He is an overgrown nerd who enjoys corny sitcoms and not much else. George has zero self-confidence, and allows himself to be antagonised, especially at the hands of his own personal tormentor Biff Tannen.<br/><br/>Then there is Marty's mother Lorraine, who is an alcoholic, smokes, and looks older than she should. Its also clear she is in an unhappy marriage. Just look at her face when thinking about life with George. You really feel sorry for her.<br/><br/>Marty's brother Dave is a pizza delivery boy, and his sister Linda must be the youngest old maid ever. Marty is really the only normal person in the family. The only bright spots in his life are his girlfriend Jennifer, and his friendship with the wacky inventor, Doc Brown (the brilliantly nutty Christopher Lloyd).<br/><br/>Doc Brown is one of those eccentric kooks with a twinkle in their eye right out of a Jules Verne novel. One night, he needs Marty's help with his latest experiment. He has converted a DeLorean into a working time machine.<br/><br/>Powered by plutonium, and at 88mph, it can literally travel through time in the blink of an eye. Unfortunately, Libyan terrorists Doc double-crossed have caught up with him, and kill him. Marty avoids the same fate by jumping into the DeLorean, and accidentally sends himself 30 years into the past.<br/><br/>1955 is completely alien to Marty, and an even bigger shock awaits him, when he meets his future parents who are still teenagers. Marty interferes with their first meeting, and puts his own existence in jeopardy. If George and Lorraine don't get together, Marty will never be born. And that's just one of the problems he has to contend with! <br/><br/>Since the DeLorean runs on plutonium, and used it up when Marty made the trip to 1955, he is now stranded. Fortunately, with the help of the Doc Brown living in 1955, they hatch a plan to get Marty home. In one week, a lightning bolt will strike the Hill Valley clock tower. By using its power, it will generate the electricity the DeLorean needs to make the return trip to 1985.<br/><br/>If all of this sounds complicated, it isn't. Back to the Future isn't nearly as complex as it sounds. It is wonderfully entertaining. Marty becomes George's best friend, and helps him find the confidence he needs to stand up to Biff. Marty playing matchmaker to his parents is not only fun to watch, but also amusing. Lorraine falls for Marty herself, which further complicates his agenda.<br/><br/>Although I am not a big fan of Michael J. Fox, he was spot on as Marty. He brings the right amount of teenage rebellion to the role, as well as amazement at his situation. He also has a terrific chemistry with Christopher Lloyd.<br/><br/>I can't imagine anyone else as Doc Brown. He is so zany, but so sincere. His hand gestures and body language are perfect, since he modelled his performance on the composer Leopold Stokowski. Every move he makes is always like addressing an audience.<br/><br/>The idea of a DeLorean as a time machine was brilliant. It is great to look at, and also provides one of the best visual gags in the film. After Marty first arrives, the family who see the car mistake it for a flying saucer with its gull-wing doors.<br/><br/>There are so many terrific scenes I could go on forever. Some of the most memorable are George standing up to Biff, George and Lorraine's first kiss, and Marty's attempt to return to 1985. You can't help rooting for George and Lorraine, because you really want them to get together. What is more satisfying, is because they meet under different circumstances, they become better people as a result.<br/><br/>Marty playing Johnny B. Goode is great too, especially when he confounds the audience with their first taste of rock n roll. It really gets intense and gripping towards the end, because you don't know how things will turn out for Marty. The musical score by Alan Silvestri helps no end, which is so uplifting and exciting.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis also showed his flair for special effects with Back to the Future. They hold up well after 20 years, and unlike most directors, Zemeckis incorporates them without overshadowing the characters.<br/><br/>Back to the Future is by far the best of the trilogy, because of its simplified theme. Part II broke that rule, and was too complicated for its own good. Part III made a welcome return to the simplification that made Part I such a big hit.<br/><br/>Back to the Future showed that science fiction can be used to promote humanistic values. Groundhog Day did the same thing for romantic comedies. There probably will never be a time travel story as compelling and heartwarming as Back to the Future."
"The_Void","9","2","3","23 December 2004"," The quintessential eighties time capsule
","Back to the Future is the quintessential eighties movie. It's over the top, kitschy, silly and lots of fun; pretty much what eighties movie making was all about. However, despite being an eighties time capsule; this movie is still well received to this day and will continue to be fun for cinema audiences for generations to come. The reason? Because in spite of being a predominantly fun flick; Back to the Future is a complete piece of cinema. It has it's heart in the right place, it's very funny, it draws themes and parallels from how times have changed, it has interesting characters that you can feel for and it's a lot of fun. Back to the Future is a masterpiece in it's field for all these reasons. We follow Marty McFly; a young slacker who is good friends with a genius inventor, Doc Brown. The fun starts when Dr Brown invents a time machine from a Delorian automobile and after certain events transpire, Marty finds himself in 1955...with his parents as teenagers and without any means to get back to 1985.<br/><br/>The idea of going back in time and meeting your parents when they were young is an intriguing one for sure, and this film makes best use of that fascinating (not to mention hilarious) idea, as Marty finds himself the object of his mother's affections. This sort of premise writes itself, and it's so delicious that there's no way it can fail, and fail is anything but what it does. This situation that the movie creates proves itself to be constantly entertaining and the film draws most of it's jokes and parodies from it. The film also details how the things we do can have massive repercussions on our future; but again, it does it with a huge smile on it's face. I'm a big believer that movies don't have to be entirely serious to have a point, and this movie proves that. Also of note is the way that Back to the Future draws parallels between how things were, and how they have changed. It's just little things, like the way Doc Brown confusingly asks if there's a gravity problem in the future after Marty's continual references to events being 'heavy'.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox stars as Marty McFly and does a great job with it. This actor was born to play this role; he completely looks and acts the part that you would expect this character to be, and for that reason; he is one of the finest casting choices of all time. Just like the Delorian motor company, Fox never got another good gig after this film, which is an ode to how well cast he was. Also like Fox, Christopher Lloyd's role in this film was the making - and the ending - of his career. He is so magnificent and so well fit to the role of the Doc that it's hard to imagine him doing any other type of role. It's a shame for him, but a treat for the audience. Further great castings include Crispin Glover as Marty's dad, George and Lea Thompson, who is all smiles and sweetness as his not bad looking at all, mother.<br/><br/>Back to the Future is, if you'll excuse the pun, a timeless classic. It is fit to be enjoyed by people of all ages and generations, and the fact that it's very much an eighties movie never gets in it's way."

Without doubt, a classic, that will always be remembered and looked back on, even in a hundred years time. This is Robert Zemeckis' best movie, with huge thanks to Spielberg as well.

I remember seeing it for the very first time over seven years ago and I couldn't care less about it, but when I saw it again last month, I've been watching it regularly around twice a week!!<br/><br/>BTTF is a fast-paced laugh-fest, unlike the many comedies out there, and it is a MUST MUST MUST-SEE! Fox is great and I doubt if the movie would have been even half as enjoyable if Eric Stoltz (who was replaced by Fox) played Marty McFly! Lloyd is absolutely amazing as the hyperactive Doc Brown, but the show stealer is Crispin Glover as the wimp father of Fox's McFly! His George McFly (from 1955) has just gotta be seen! Biff Tannen is played PERFECTLY by Thomas F. Wilson, and last but not the least, Marty's mom is just pure and simple WONDERFUL! Lea Thompson did an excellent job as both the Lorraines!

This has got to be one of the greatest films of all time, and it just happens to come from the land of good films :the 80's. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Loyd ignite this film on fire with superb acting and the rest of the cast is great also. This is one of those films that can be watched many times over, and even if you own it on video and it's on TV, you still keep it on the channel. Spawning 2 sequels part2 and part3, the ladder being the worst of all three but still good in it's own way, are a land mark in our history just like the Godfather films have their own mark on movie history.

Some of the metaphysical aspects of it may be a little off kilter to do with time casuality, past/present etc..  But that does not stop it from being immensely entertaining, and the basic idea and theories behind the concept of time travel are reasonably correct.  What is great about this film is how they use the science fiction concept as a base without straying away from contemporary mid 80s America. This film has a well deserved place in the top 250."

It is that simple.  The movie keeps you in suspense from the moment it begins to the very end.  The characters are creative and amazing.

","This movie deserves to be amongst the classics. Michael J. Fox did outstanding and who could ever forget Christopher Lloyd in his role as Doc. He made me think that there actually was a real Doc. Both actors are excellent along with Crispin Glover playing George McFly. Glover does very well in his roles. I would like to see him in better movies. I chose the sequel over the original though. The reason being that the sequel involved new stuff and a bit of the original stuff. This movie should not be forgotten. There wont be one like it.

"superboy478","10","2","3","1 April 2002"," A Blockbuster Masterpiece!
","From Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis, Back to the Future is one movie that is for sure a classic masterpiece.<br/><br/>Marty McFly (Micheal J. Fox) is your typical hip 1985 teenager. He plays in a band, he has a girlfriend, and he has a ton of friends and he lives in Hill Valley. But, his main friend is a scientist named Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). When Doc tells Marty about a new invention, it interests Marty immediatley. But what marty doesn't know is that the invention is a time machine made out of a hip Delorian car.<br/><br/>When Marty uses the time machine, he accidently goes back in time to 1955! He sees his parents again which leads to him changing events that makes his mother Lorainne (Lea Thompson) love him instead of his father George (Crispin Glover). Another problem is that the time machine is broken. And Marty and the yound Doc think of a plan to use lightning as their tool to getting Marty back to the future!<br/><br/>Micheal J. Fox (Spin City, Life With Mikey), Christopher Lloyd (Wit, Camp Nowhere), Lea Thompson (Dennis the Menace, The Berverly Hillbillies), Tom Wilson (Freaks & Geeks, Born to be Wild), Crispin Glover (What's Eating Gilbert Grape).<br/><br/>Produced by Steven Spielberg (A.I., Minority Report), and directed by Robert Zemeckis (What Lies Beneath, Forrest Gump).<br/><br/>Followed by 2 sequels very worth seeing.<br/><br/>A movie for all ages!"
"Khwaj","10","2","3","24 March 2002"," UNTOUCHABLE!
","Still an instant classic my books, Back to the Future for me was the ""ultimate"" in family entertainment.<br/><br/>It's even more of a blessing to learn that the DVD is coming soon, which should really please ""Die-Hard"" fans.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox was a real role model to look up to in this film. Everything his character was, was something I could relate to in terms of wishing for a better life than that of his previous time existence.<br/><br/>It's just a ""REAL"" shame that films like this don't get to be made with the same passion and enthusiasm as before. Try to do yourself the favor of avoiding watching too much commercial crap out there that tries to hard too hard to take after films like this and begin re-live classic films that still know how to please those since childhood.<br/><br/>My only dissapoinment about the film was Claudia Welles' character of Jennifer Parker, considering that she didn't bother reprising her role in the next two installments, paving the way for a rather wooden Elisabeth Shue to take over the role.<br/><br/>Since the Star Wars trilogy and E.T. can enjoy 20th anniversary re-releases, why not trying to add Back to the Future to the equation. It wouldn't be a bad idea at all the newer generation to really appreciate genuine Speilberg/Zemekis films of past and present.<br/><br/>Let the good times roll. 10/10"

","This is one of the few movies out there, that can be watched time and time again, and still thrill you like it did the first time you saw it.  Back to the Future is one of the best sci-fi/fantasy films ever made.  From the opening pan of the clocks, to the spectacular (even today) flying Delorean shot, this film is extremely involving and exciting. The script (even though dated by it's 80's dialog) is fantastic.  That, along with  Zemeckis' incredible, flawless direction (his best to date) keeps the film moving at a smooth and satisfying pace.  This ranks right up there with Star Wars as the best sci-fi experience ever."

"Howlin Wolf","10","2","3","15 March 2001"," Pure Movie Magic.
","One of the most genuinely enjoyable movies for enjoyment's sake.  I just cannot conceive how they could have made this a better movie.<br/><br/>   It seems like Fox was born to play McFly, and try as he might, he can never get away from the part now.  Although he's done good work elsewhere, this is the one he'll be remembered for.  His defining role.<br/><br/>   As someone else mentioned, Lloyd overacts, but somehow I never mind.  Lea Thompson has an indefinable quality, so I won't even try.  Crispin Glover is just wonderfully weird as George McFly.  No one could have played the role like him, and I think perhaps the reason the sequels suffer a bit in comparison to this one is his absence (tighter scripting would also have helped...)  Still, don't wanna give the guy a big head, 'cos when all's said and done he aint the star of the show...<br/><br/>   What's also impressive about this is the attention to detail.  It would have been so easy to turn out a pale imitation of what we actually got with this premise, but thankfully the film-makers didn't.  Every little in-joke and movie reference adds to the created universe and involves us more with the characters.  Thanks guys, you can tell you had a lot of fun with this movie.<br/><br/>   Also, there is no better director than Robert Zemeckis for creating escapist cinema.  This is a bona fide classic and will be no matter how far into the future you travel..."

How does an average high schooler know a random insane scientist? I think they should've started the film with a flashback explaining it, but it's not that big of an issue.

His father was weak and incompetent. He had no other hobbies than watching TV and eating. And often bullied by his boss. Martin was also looked down upon by the teacher at school, because this teacher was also the teacher of his father George thirty years ago.<br/><br/>The mother married her dad because of compassion.

","Many of the finest time travel films deal with - and overcome- the mistakes or mistakes of the past. Frequency, a more latest time-bending film, deals with an orphaned son who fears not to live up to the expectations of his father; Back to the Future plays with his parents ' filial disappointment or disillusionment.<br/><br/>On the surface, Marty McFly (in a physically and comedically deft performance, Michael J. Fox) has sufficient reason for disappointment: for his over-losing parents (and brothers) he seems far too cool, although he does not know how he really is the son of his father.But when a time travel experiment organized by Marty's friend Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd in an Einstein-esque fright wig) leaves Marty stranded in the 1950s, Marty finds a side he never knew of his parents.<br/><br/>The story is so tightly planned, with almost everything setting up something else and it pays off, that especially after numerous viewings, the first half can come off a bit gimmicky and artificial. But the last act is so overwhelmingly satisfying that it makes up more than any artificiality or artificiality.<br/><br/>Although the film takes for granted unchaste conduct as the norm among adolescents both in the 1950s and today, Marty's dismay at the unexpectedly risky conduct of his mother indicates, ironically, that despite everything else, kids still want their parents to have a greater standard.<br/><br/>The filmmakers followed up with a couple of back-to-back sequels initially designed as one film and that way should have been left.Part II is highly uneven, with a wonderful third act in which Marty returns to 1955 partially compensating for a wobbly opening, set in the future, and excessively nasty middle act set in a 1985 alternative. Part III is a bit loose in the old west and has some gaping holes in the plot. They might be worth watching once or twice, but it's worth going back to the original again and again."

The film follows Marty McFly as he has traveled to 1955 and must find a way to travel back to 1985. This is without a doubt the best time travel movie in the history of time travel movies. I love the imagination that it took Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis came up with in creating this masterpiece. I can watch this movie over and over again and not get bored with it. This is how you do a time travel movie. If you want to make a good time travel movie all you need is a good screenplay, music, special effects, acting, the whole nine yards. And this movie delivers and makes time travel sound easy as it breaks it down simple for the audience to understand. Back to the Future makes me want to go to back to a time where everything was simple that we didn't have smartphones or technology that we have now. This is how you do a science fiction movie without being confusing for the audience. I can watch this movie over and over again and not get bored out of my skull. It also makes me want to go to in time when I haven't even heard of this movie and tell my future self to explore this masterpiece. So in the end, if you haven't seen Back to the Future do yourself a favor and watch this film and prepare to be blown away."
"abalpn-99472","10","1","1","13 August 2019"," Great Scott! I love this classic science-fiction adventure film!
","I've watched this about a million times and also the other two films. I like the story in the trilogy and the music composed by Alan Silvestri. The emotion in the films are classic. Marty and Doc are the greatest duo and the best of friends. Michael J. Fox was excellent playing Marty and Christopher Lloyd as Emmett Brown. Lea Thompson was cute playing Lorraine. Tom Wilson was hilarious as Biff Tannen. I saw online about the cast being reunited for the 30th anniversary panel of Back to the Future.<br/><br/>I love some time traveling films but this one and the last two will be the greatest classic films to me."

","""Steven Spielberg remains the beating heart of modern science-fiction films, and if you want to find any reasons why then, I suggest you to watch this instant-classic movie at once, you will comprehend the legacy he has brought to us.""<br/><br/>The first time I have ever redacted a critic on this website was down in 2015, since then I learned impressively how productions could change lives and start movements throughout the world. Back to The Future represents one of those motion pictures: such a powerful, inspirational, comical, encouraging, and innovative one. Probably, McFly and Doc Brown proffer the best duo-interaction I have ever beheld in an 80s film, which, by the way, could end up being top-notch of all time. There are almost no blunders to be found because the flick essentially represents an instant classic of cinematic history as if to say, pure perfection. From this moment on, you might be wondering about the reason why I consider it as pure perfection. First and foremost, we discuss relating to breaking formulas and experiencing new paths, in other words, means opening new cinematic genres and improving them, that is to say, films which leave a significant legacy. Back to The Future follows the proper steps in order to provide that brand-new feature we were all hoping for. Secondly, we balance the film's highest moments and average moments with humour, some 50's nostalgia, some drama and (even) some action moments which results in a win-win, basically, the film provides a mixture of genres carefully well-managed and accurately-needed. Third, if the goal is the production of an instant classic, we will need to focus on the cast, because they are the ones who will perform during the whole film, they embody the heroes and villains, therefore, they become fundamental. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are the film's core, as excellent as a Vince Vaughn-Owen Wilson relationship in Wedding Crashers (2004), I daresay. Finally, but not least, the soundtrack and the environment, in spite of ending up being complementary, provides not only a trusting reality but an opportunity to show the audience the plot's main incidents. During the display, we will notice the most recurrent spots are the 80's and 50's at school, at traditional coffee shops and at the streets, not forgetting the genuine pop-culture references introduced.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Steven Spielberg's mind is proof that everyone is capable of creating instant classics, delivering the audience such an awesome time. (100/100)"

","I have watched this 1985 film classic Back to the Future several times now and I have never grown tired of it. Not only does it stand the test of time (no pun intended) but this family adventure just keeps getting better and better, My three sons grew up watching it with me and in the next few years into the future our first grandson will also be old enough to enjoy this treasure trove of a film.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd make every minute ""a must see"" with the worlds destiny imminently at stake. Added to the quality of the cast are Marty McFly's parents played by Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover, and I just loved the films' buffed bully Biff Tannen played to perfection by Thomas F. Wilson,<br/><br/>This is certainly one of the top 100 films of the second half of the twentieth century in film making and an all time film classic to ensure Michael J.

"TheMovieDiorama","8","1","1","15 June 2019"," Back to the Future accelerates its time traveling nostalgic adventure to a whopping 88mph.
","Great Scott! Finally managed to watch the quintessential 80s flick that combines a plethora of genres to generate an astounding 1.21 gigawatts. Enough to make me want to go back in time and watch it again. Damn. Damn damn! Now, it's no surprise that Zemeckis' most accessible film is the one that has stood the test of time. Spielberg matching him with this project was seemingly fate, and in the process they had created a pop culture phenomenon that contributed massively to many childhoods. A teenager, who documents a time travelling experiment with an eccentric scientist, accidentally travels back in time to which he must repair history and return to the correct year.<br/><br/>With Zemeckis' overwhelming contribution and Gale's stellar writing, they had amalgamated an absurd amount of genres into one adventure. Primarily a romantic comedy with the aesthetics of a science-fiction adventure packed with arresting action set pieces. A whimsical invention that perfectly balanced a variety of tones, resulting in an instant classic. Embedding various intricacies within its script, from the clock tower donation fund to the flux capacitor revelation, that you subconsciously start to cling onto every line of dialogue. Every word is so important in its foreshadowing, that it progressively enhances the enjoyment of its story.<br/><br/>It has to be said that the execution of some of these moments were heavy-handed (in case we missed anything...) and the paradoxical nature of its time travel premise was frequently brushed over. But the purposefully engaging characters and plot are able to distract us from these loopholes that sci-fi features commonly fall into. Although the final ten minutes wrapped up far too neatly for my taste, considering Doc went against his own words of advice.<br/><br/>Speaking of good ol' Doc Brown, Lloyd's performance was the highlight for me. Capturing the eccentric personality of his character perfectly, from the exaggerated facial expressions to the excitable scientific mumbo-jumbo that he blurts out. He is just as memorable as the pimped out DeLorean. Fox, again, was perfect casting for Marty McFly, the flyest kid in town with his hardcore skateboarding skills hanging onto the back of vehicles. Comedic timing was exquisite and the more dramatic moments involving his past younger mother and father were well handled by him. Glover deserves some praise also, no longer will I class him as the ""creepy thin man"" from 'Charlie's Angels'. He is George McFly, author extraordinaire and my new personal hero for decimating Biff with one punch. Now, Biff for me was too one-dimensional to have a lasting impression, and became a forced plot device just so that the film had an antagonist of some sort. Personally, it didn't need one. Exclude him, or grant him some development time, and the story would've benefited from those alterations.<br/><br/>It must be said that Silvestri's grand score accompanied the joyous onscreen shenanigans stupendously, and certainly had that Spielberg flair found in most Amblin productions despite the small scale drama. Oh, and ""The Power of Love"" is banging. All this time, and I didn't know it was associated with this film (I'm so uncultured...)!<br/><br/>Suffice to say, regardless of the shortcomings and an absence of personal childhood nostalgia for the film, it still delivers strong entertainment today. Perfect casting, punctual dialogue and memorable scenes. It may not be the best 80s film I've seen, but it certainly has the gigawatts the maintain its lasting power for many years to come."
"nilswessling","9","1","1","14 April 2019"," Great movie to go and see!!!
","Back to the future is a funny and action packet movie which is a perfect family sit down. A 17 year old teenager called Marty Mcfly goes back in time to 1955 and has to find away to get back to his year 1987. The movie is great for all ages since its a action comedy has no swearing,and no physical violence.I don't recommend it for kids that are under 6 years old cause they might get a bit confused, but what is great is that for some older people they might connect with a few things that happens to Marty in 1955 that will seem weird to the new generation which is all normal back then, but anyway the movie still is great it has great acting and voice play with the main characters being Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd who is also in Star Treck. The director Robert Zemeckis has done a great job in explaining the characters so you can build a bond between you and them. I really recommend this movie."

","What a great movie I have seen this movie countless times and its better every time. The plot of the movie shows a young Micheal j fox travel back in time and a lot of things go wrong and he has to fix them or else the future will be messed up. This part of history 1985 is very interesting to me it seems like it was really fun to be a teen or kid. Everything was so simple and it made sense. When they travels to th 1950 world the movie did a good job depicting that year and made it seem like that was the year the movie was actually made. I have seen the whole trilogy and i am glad I have because it is a very fun watch. I really like the scene where George Mcfly punches biff and saves the day and gets the girl who he deserves. One thing I didnt like but also like at the same time were the cheesy edits and special effects its kind of funny to see when we look at todays technology. I would deferentially recommend this movie to anybody looking for a good time."
"garynorm-79022","10","1","1","30 January 2019"," Go Johnny Go
","The best part of this movie is when Marty gets back and Doc is still alive. Even though it could change things Doc risks it and it saves his life. Doc builds a time machine and he is testing it. But Marty has to use it to get away from terrorists. He goes back in time, gets his parents to fall in love. Then he makes it back to his actual time. The historical accuracy is not really there. Time machines have not been built yet. But in the 1950's it seems like that is how it would be back then. Robert Zemeckis is the director of this movie. I haven't seen other movies that he has made. I have seen some of the other actors in other movies. I liked this movie, it was a very good movie for when it was made. I have seen this movie outside of my History Through Film Class. Very good movie."
"nirome","10","1","1","22 January 2019"," The perfect script
","One of the many reasons why this is my favourite movie of all times is because it's got one of the best scripts ever written for a movie. Everything that it's set up at the very beginning, pays off later.
For a movie that had such a rocky start from the production point of view and whose very creators didn't have much faith in, it sure made box office waves all around the world and made it one of the most fondly remembered and classical movies of the 80s. It catapulted Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd to stardom and turned one of the biggest automobile failures of the 80s into an iconic vehicle.
Everything seemed to fall into place for this one. Not only the screenplay, but the acting, directing, production design, visual effects, editing and cinematography. It's an extremely tightly edited movie, not a moment wasted, it moves along like lightning, and after all this years, its 80s look hasn't aged it one bit. This is one of the most entertaining cinematographic experiences ever and if you still haven't seen it; What are you waiting for?. Let's go back in time!!"""
"jmmustchin","10","1","1","22 December 2018"," Awesome classic
","I originally saw Back to the Future on TV when I was young. Several years later, my brother bought the 30th Anniversary Trilogy box set. What a trip down Memory Lane!<br/><br/>Back to the Future is a brilliant movie. Teenager Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) accidentally travels back in time in a car his friend Doc Brown had invented - shortly after Brown is murdered by Libyan terrorists. He meets the younger Doc and convinces him that he is a genuine time traveler. But while they figure out a way to send Marty back to the future, they realise that Marty accidentally interfered with his parents' first meeting - endangering his own existence. They must not only work on returning Marty back to 1985 (he went back to 1955), but they must get Marty's parents to fall in love.<br/><br/>The movie's brilliantly scripted. It's very funny. The acting is good. And the effects (when used) are quite good. To quote one critic's praise, ""It wastes very little in the way of dialogue"". EVERYTHING that's said is put in there on purpose. Pay close attention throughout the film. It's hugely fun to watch. A true masterpiece."

","I remember I first watched this film when I was 13 years old. This film was my first 80's movie obsession. This movie made me first fall in love with 80's films and made me the person that I am TODAY! I loved George McFly because I was a nerdy alienated adolescent myself. I also remember I got a little aroused when Lorraine McFly (Lea Thompson) was about to make out with Micheal J. Fox, who was suppose to be her son. I found that part a little messed up, but also arousing. Although Biff was a complete jerk towards George McFly and acted like a creep to Lea Thompson's character. I found the part amazing and scary when George McFly had the balls to fight off Biff from him almost raping Lea Thompson. I was scared on how George McFly (Crispin Glover) was trembling, and was about to make a fists, and had a horrified look on his face. I still want a guy like George McFly even though I felt sorry for him."

"hellraiser7","10","1","1","5 August 2018"," Race Against Time
","This is another of one of my favorite films of all time. This film is special to me in so many ways, from the fact that it's another film from my childhood I saw this when I was about seven years old. But most importantly this was the very first time travel sci-fi I've ever seen and it's still my favorite in the sci-fi subgenera. Back then I never even heard of the genre and the concept, this film is one hell of an introductory, it was a concept that blew me away the ability to travel anywhere throughout time; personally, for me I'd love to revisit the 80's decade which is funny to say since this film was made in the 80's. You could also say this was the film that steered me to my favorite TV show of all time ""Doctor Who"".<br/><br/>This film just has so much, I really like the story which is fun and clever at the same time. One thing this film does well is the fact things aren't overcomplicated, the fundamental problem with most time travel stories are sometimes they have this stupid need to complicate things or play around too much which really swiss cheeses the story in plot and consistence or that it's overly concerned on the concept and logic but little on story. This film keeps things simple because it keeps the car on the road, by keeping the focus on character and story. Sure, there is a slight complication and inconsistency in this story but it's not noticeable not even concerned about it, even I wasn't and let's face it all time travels stories have this. The film also kind of stays true to the pulp sci-fi as their concern was for story and adventure and logic was shelved.<br/><br/>The characters are great from Biff Tannen played well by underrated actor Thomas F Wilson whom is one of my favorite fictional villians as throughout the film series he's had several versions of himself about as many as any Time Lord from ""Doctor Who"". He's a villain you love to hate, yeah, he's basically a bully whom I normally despise but here it's handled right where he's a person you easily can despise but have fun with at the same time. He has some of the best lines, but I think what really makes him stand out is the fact that he's an idiot. Despite the guy being big and strong, having the best car, it's all really just a way to pass himself as cool, the guy literally thinks he's really cool even though in reality everyone around him knows he a dirtbag.<br/><br/>But of course, the two characters that really make the film are Marty and Doc Emit Brown played by two of my favorite actors Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd. These two are defiantly one of my favorite duos, both play off each other and balance each other out well.<br/><br/>Marty McFly is great he's one of my favorite fictional protagonists because he's someone I can easily emphasize with as I was a kid from the 80's and I can epaphisize with bits of his persona. As he's a teen from the 80's, as he's into skateboarding, music, camcorders, and a lot of things in the 80s, I'm a kid from the 80's I was into that stuff too. He's kind of on the rebellious side, but he's more of a silent rebel as he doesn't always feel a total need to follow every rule, as he sometimes undermines the school principal, even I'm like that sometimes. But what I like about him is he's a person that has big dreams and ambitions, he wants his band to play in big events and also make music in the music world, however he has faced his series of rejections yeah, I can emphasize with that with my acting auditions; however he doesn't give up despite how much it hurts. Though also has dreams of love with his significant other Jennifer played well by Claudia Wells whom I thought was kind of hot, you really get a good feel for her and both of them as they've been a couple for a long time.<br/><br/>I really like how Marty reacts to the 1950's decade, since he a kid from the 80's it's easy for me to emphasize with him since I was one to. To some people that either lived or close the decade of the 50's or historians that have some fascination with it, it would be a dream come true to be able to come back to it. But for a person like Marty and myself, we wouldn't really like it not to say it's a place I wouldn't mind visiting but not one I'd want to say in ; for one thing Marty traveled their unintentionally and with time travel machines you'd have the freedom to stroll out the door anytime you want but his freedom has been prohibited so that sucks. However, I really like in the first sequence of going to 1950's Hill Valley how disoriented and even scared he looks, I'm sure that would be how we would react to walking to a decade long gone it's like walking into another world. From seeing vintage cars, you would see in a car museum being driven conveniently, old songs you'd hear on an oldies but goodies on a sat radio station being played as if they've just made the billboard, certain things that aren't around yet like video games or further seasons of ""Doctor Who"", it wouldn't exactly be like going to a vacation spot.<br/><br/>It's also funny in the film how Marty in an inadvertent way affects things not just from how he brings his parents together but also how may 'be he was one factor that may have helped get certain things in our modern-day culture started. Like the music he plays in the school dance, the skateboard, you name it. To me that's part of the what makes the film it funny and fascinating, it really shows how one person can really have a big affect on time without know it but also how one person truly can make a difference. Though it also brings up the parallel dynamic between both Marty and the 50's decade as both were a time of great changes from youth to culture.<br/><br/>Doc Brown is just great as he's is a genius but is a bit childlike as he does have a bit of an eccentricity from his hairstyle which always seems to be stick up to even how rapidly inventive he is. However, he does have a good dose of common sense and wisdom which keeps him from not flying off the road but also able to interact properly and mentor Marty. But one thing about him I can easily emphasize with is on how fast he is, he the kind of person that loves to do lots of things and get things done but is aware he has limited time to do them. Like in one scene, he has built a rather elaborate scale model of the town but is apologetic that he didn't have enough time to paint and give it details, despite the fact it's looks great all the same. I just find that a little funny because I'm sort of like that myself where sometimes I get one thing done but there is one other thing I haven't got done yet or I wanted to do within the given time.<br/><br/>I really love the DeLorean, it's my second favorite time traveling machine next to the Tardis on ""Doctor Who"" which you know is my first. Making a time traveling machine out of a car was unheard of at the time, personal I thought it was a cool idea and really is a lot more convient because with it you will not just travel back or forwards in time, but you'd be able to drive within that time period where ever you need to go and hide it better by driving to a spot. The effects on that DeLorean are cool just every time it travels in time it just leaves a vapor trail of fire on the road. <br/><br/>Music is also great this film has probably one of the best soundtracks I know. From the theme song from Alvin Silvestri which perfectly reflects the movie as it has an adventurous tone. Another trademark are two other songs from the film ""The Power of Love"" and ""Back in Time"" by Huey Lewis and the News. As well as a few familiar oldies but goodies tracks, most notably the song ""Johnny Be Good"" at the dance.<br/><br/>There are lots of fun moments I won't say them all since there are so many which makes the better because there's not one dull moment, from the big highlight for me is the Skateboard sequence which is one of my favorite chase scenes, here it's a skateboard skating away from an automobile. When you think about it being on a skateboard does have its advantages as Marty is able to ride on sidewalks and certain roadways and areas that an automobile would have a hard time accessing, which means plenty of opportunities to outmaneuver his opponent. But also, the fact that Marty is using a skateboard in the 1950's decade alone is really cool, since they didn't have skateboards back then. To even the small moments my favorite which is to me one of the best reference jokes ever when Marty puts himself in the Rad suit and is tricking George to asking Lorene out by mixing up two popular sci-fi franchises, that segment always cracks me up being a sci-fi fan.<br/><br/>Well I've said enough, ""Back to the Future"" is a timeless classic that has the millage that goes beyond time.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"
"codfather-84460","10","1","1","2 June 2018"," Pure Genius
","Duun, dun, dun, dun,dun,dun,dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dundadun. My condolences.<br/><br/>Back to the Future released in 1985 is considered one of the best sci-fi movies of all time and I with out a doubt agree. The story follows a teenager who goes by the name of Marty McFly played by Michael J. Fox who has a strange friend named Emmet Brown played by Christopher Lloyd who invents a time machine using a Delorean which the instant that it appears on screen becomes one of the (if not) most famous vehicles in cinema which is the genius of Robert Zemeckis similar to the genius of Stanley Kubrick in The Shining with the ending of it which is ambiguous, yet awesome and Zemeckis seems to be the Kubrick of this film for sure.<br/><br/>First off, we have the incredible cast and acting which is certainly applicable to Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd who I still retain as two of the best lead actors in all of cinema from their charismatic performances and astounding chemistry which still puts a smile on my face and is one of the most quotable movies ever made. ""Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then who's vice president? Jerry Lewis?"" That quote makes me laugh out loud every time and I love it as well as nearly everyone's performance. Crispen Glover as George McFly is the performance that put him on the map after the fourth Friday the 13th movie went totally under the rug even though I think that his performance was decent in it. Lea Thompson is also amazing and I don't care but I still laugh when Marty McFly finds her for the first time and is tempted to say that she's hot but then realises that she's his mother which makes me laugh every time I see it. Thomas F. Wilson is so funny as he plays Biff, the bully of Marty's father who is so funny due to his stupidity which is written so well and appeals to all ages which is the same for all the humour.<br/><br/>Another thing that I appreciate is the clever cultural commentary as obviously not everything was the same in 1955 so there is going to be some references to how life was different then. First off, we have the continued comments on Marty's jacket with everyone saying that it is a life preserver which is really funny as nearly everyone acknowledges it. Another thing is the line said that says ""Who the hell is John F. Kennedy"" which is funny because obviously JFK wasn't even known at that time which is a nice little history lesson. One more thing is the racism as racism was still very prominent back then so the way that Marvin Berry's music group get racially attacked which is quite respectable on Zemeckis's half.<br/><br/>The story is really clever as it centres around Marty accidentally traveling thirty years back in time and during his little tour around his home Hill Valley, he finds his father being picked on which you see earlier and the scenes are practically the same but thirty years back which adds to the excellent writing from the mind of Zemeckis. The way that Marty changes history when he moves his father out of the way to make it so that he is the one that gets hit by Lorraine's dad's car and meets and becomes the one that Lorraine falls for which is so clever that it sometimes becomes mind boggling. My favourite moment by far is in my opinion the best scene in any movie ever which is the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance where we see George McFly finally stand up to Biff when he punches him in the face which I love every time I see it, the Earth Angel scene where George kisses Lorraine for the first time which (I don't even care to admit) makes me well up with tears of joy every time I see it because it is honestly that beautiful, and the scene where Marty McFly does a cover of Johnny B. Goode by Chuck Berry rest in peace and that it is so funny when he starts rocking out to the point of everyone thinking he's a complete weirdo which makes me laugh every time.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is definitely one of my all time favourites with it's charm, really funny humour and it's just a total joy to watch and one youngsters can enjoy and appreciate and I am so glad to give my favourite movie of all time a ten out of ten."

","It is about a teenager who is mistakenly travelling 30 years in the past, It brings him to discover the places and the people that he know but in the context of the 1950´s. And the ´time difference´ happens to bring some challenges as to ´how to go back to the future´ ?
The idea may seem simple but the problem with the time is that it is easy to create anachronisms or inconsistencies with the present. But this film is flawless on this aspect. It also introduces us to characters we are happy to follow through time.
My favorite film as a child that I have seen more times than I can count."

","This is my favorite movie of all time! It has a great plot, great comedy, and epic Sci_Fiction. 10/10 <br/><br/> The movie starts off with Marty McFly going to Doc's house and eventually gets to school late with this girlfriend Jennifer Parker. Next, we met Mr.Strickland(The Principal) who gives both Marty and Jennifer a late pass and then insults Marty that he will never make it in the Music Tryouts(Marty doesn't make it though) . Marty then say ""Well the futue is gonna change"". What I mean is that Marty loves to play the guitair. After the tryouts, Jennifer and Marty start walking through Hill Valley and notice a 4x4 Toyota car that Marty dreams of getting. Then, Marty tells Jennifer about what he plans to do with that car when he gets it from his parents. Right when Marty and Jennifer about to kiss, a woman interupts them saying that Mayor is saying up money to replace a clock that was struck by lighting(you'll see how when Doc trys to get Marty back to 1985). When Jennifer's dad comes to pick her up, she writes her phone number on the piece of paper that the woman gave Marty and then kisses him. When Marty gets back home riding his skateboard, we met Marty's Father (George McFly) and Biff Tannen(George's bully and supervisor). They both met because a car crashed and George has to pay to fix the car. The car Marty wanted can't be bought now because of the crashed car. Next, we met the rest of the Family Lorraine McFly (Marty's mother), Dave McFly(Marty's brother) and Linda McFly(Marty's sister). At 12:28 am, Doc calls Marty to met him at Twin Pines Mall to show him something. That something was his Delorian that is now a Time-Machine. At around 1:30am a van with 2 men come up at the Mall and shoot Doc. Marty jumps into the Time-Machine and traveled to the year 1955. When Marty arrives to Hill Valley, he realises that he traveled to 1955 and decided to find Doc and ask him to help him get back to the year 1985. Before all this, Marty comes upon a Cafe that has a Phone and a phonebook. In the cafe, we met Marty's father at a younger age and Biff at a younger age also. We learn that George is a wimp and Biff is a bully with another bunch of dudes. When George leaves the Cafe, Marty follows him and then he spots George on a tree branch looking through binoculars at Lorraine(the young one. About George's age). George then falls from the tree.(This is how George and Lorraine got married in the first place) then Marty pushes George out of the way of a moving car and the the ca hits Marty. Marty is then taken into Lorraine's house and mets her and her family. Marty then leaves the house to go find Doc. After Marty finds Doc, Marty shows Doc the car that he invented. Suddently, Marty shows a picture of him and his siblings. One of their heads are missing, this means that they are getting erased from existance because the young Lorraine is in love with Marty instead of George. The next day, Marty introduces George to Lorraine and she ignores him. At lunch, Marty asks George why he doesn't want to ask Lorraine out. George says that she already wants to go out with someone like Biff. At night, Marty wakes up George with Van Halen music saying that he is Darth Vadar saying that if he doesn't ask Lorraine out to the dance, he will remove his brain cells. The next day, George mets Marty at the Cafe asking for help to ask Lorraine out because he doesn't know how to. Right when George asks out Lorraine, Biff and his crew comes up and demands for his money for entering the Cafe. Marty then trips Biff and then punches him and runs away. As Marty runs, he comes upon two kids riding some scooter thing. Marty breaks one of their scooter things and then rides it as a skateboard. As Biff and his crew try to ram Marty into a truck full of Cow Poop with his car, Marty climbs right over his car and lands back on his skateboard. Biff's car then crashes to the truck and next thing you know, they are covered in cow poop. Later, Marty stops over at Doc's house and they plan how to send Marty back in time. Lorraine then comes and asks Marty to the dance. Marty says yes. Later, Marty teaches George how to get Lorraine and take her to the dance. On the night of the dance, while Doc sets up everything to get Marty back to 1985, Marty drives Lorraine to the dance. Before the dance, Marty writes Doc a letter saying when he goes back in time, he gets shot. A few minutes after Marty parked, Biff and his friends lock Marty in a car truck for $300 damage to Biff's car after he crashed the car into the truck of Cow Poop while Lorraine was stuck with Biff in the car. At exactly 9:00 pm, George comes to the car and took Marty's advice to getting Lorraine and punched Biff in the face whice eventually knocked him out. After Marty gets freed from the car trunk by the band that played music for the dance, he saw that George and Lorraine were together. But Marty and his family were still getting erased from existance. At the dance, George kisses Lorraine and marty's existance wasn't in danger anymore and George was becoming ppular at school. After Marty's guitair solo of ""Johhny Be Good"" by Chuck Berry, Lorraine and George met Marty at the exit door and says that he must be going. Next, Marty mets Doc at the front of the clock tower and Doc gives Marty instructions of what he has to do to get back in time. Doc realizes that Marty gave him a letter about the future and tears it apart. As Doc tears apart the letter, a power line for their plan falls off the clock tower. Doc tell Marty to go towards the end of the stree and wait for the clock that he gave Marty to ring. After the clock rings, the Delorian somehow goes dead. Marty hits his head against the steering wheel and it turns back on. As Marty starts his long drive back to the clock tower, Doc accidently detaches another power line of their plan as he attaches the other part that fell first. Next, Doc swings on the power line and as soon as the ligntning struck, Marty came and Doc connected the power line and Marty has made it to 1985. After Marty gets back to 1985, the Delorian goes dead again and wouldn't turn on again. After the Delorian goes dead, the van with the 2 men are driving to the mall to shoot Doc. Marty starts to run to the mall to keep Doc from getting killed. We see Doc get shot again and ther old Marty travel to 1955. After the van crashes into a mini building, Marty checks on Doc. Doc is alive because he was wearing a bullet-proof vest. Marty asks Doc how he knew he was gonna get shot and he shows Marty the torn up letter he gave him. Doc drives Marty back home and says that he going into the future 30 years. The next morning, we met Marty's family and Biff, and they all look different! Biff doesn't mess with George anymore and Dave wears a suit to the office now. Marty's mother said that he got the car he wanted. After Marty sees his car, Jennifer shows up and asks him ""How about a ride mister?"". After they were about to kiss again, Doc comes back to 1985 and tells Marty that something has got to be done about his kids. Marty tells Doc that he doesn't have enough road to get up to 88mph. Then, Doc says, ""Where we're goin' we don't need roads"". The car starts to fly in the air and flys into the screen. The end!<br/><br/>Oh boy! This took me a very long time to type, but it's worth hearing about the movie again! 10/10"

","'Back To The Future' can't be unloved by people. It was loved back when it came out in 1985 and its success has only grown. It has become a pop culture phenomenon worthy of all the success and praise it gets.<br/><br/>Christopher Lloyd just finished 'Taxi' and was doing a slew of successful films. Eric Stoltz was making a name for himself. But at the last minute, Stoltz was fired and 'Family Ties' own Michael J. Fox was replaced as protagonist alongside Christopher Lloyd. This co-stars some other up-and- comers that would go on to become household names.<br/><br/>Fox stars as Marty McFly. He's a high school senior who loves his girlfriend, tries to get gigs with his band, must deal with a mean principal and a weird family. He is also an errand boy for the wacky scientist Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), who Marty calls ""Doc."" Doc is constantly coming up with odd inventions and nobody can take him seriously, but he does sustain Marty's interest. His latest invention is a time machine made out of a DeLorean. Since that car has been discontinued, everybody's immediate association with it is a time machine. Doc calls Marty to test it at 1am so they can be in complete privacy. But they are soon found by terrorists who Doc fraudulently squeezed plutonium away from. Marty narrowly escapes...<br/><br/>The first act is getting to know Marty and his family and Doc. The subplot with the terrorists is also important. Marty escapes by accidentally entering 1955 on the date Doc got the envision for the time machine. Marty bumps into some people from his own present and tells them their fate. But it is his parents that he encounters that will mess up the timeline forever. His mom is a player who developed the hots for Marty instead of his dad. Marty completely screwed up the day they met. His dad is a total wimp too scared to ask his mother out or stand up to bully Biff Tannen. Marty is a hip daredevil who is the key in changing his father for the better and tricking him. This story with Marty trying to reconnect his parents is hilarious. Its my favourite aspect oft he film. Then there's Biff Tannen, who is the best bully in film history. I'm not condoning bullying, but Biff is hilarious. <br/><br/>How can Marty return to 1985? His escape was too abrupt to retrieve any plutonium for his way back, so he's stuck. Or is he? Doc says a bolt of lightning is the only thing of equivalent charge to plutonium. Hill Valley's (the film's setting) historic clock towers struck by lightning and it hasn't rung since. Next week will be the day it happens, so Doc and Marty construct a plan for the charge to hit the DeLorean and send Marty back to the future. Funny how these three very important events (Marty's parents meeting, Doc coming up with the idea for the time machine, and the clock tower destruction) take place over the course of the same week.<br/><br/>As a time travel film, there are lots of holes and plot errors that cannot be unseen. The wonderment is what makes films like this so groundbreaking. But at least there's enough smarts around this. <br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, Marty dealing with a week in the 50s with his parents is my favourite aspect. The whole ""fish out of water"" bit is done so well and so funny. It culminates with Marty doing an edgy rendition of Chuck Berry's ""Johnnie B. Goode"" which is my favourite scene in all of cinema. His imitations of various guitar legends such as Eddie Van Halen and Pete Townsend make it even more funny than it is. <br/><br/>This movie makes me feel so wonderful each and overtime I see it (which is a lot). it is spiritually uplifting with heart and comedy to make it fun, and complexity to take it seriously.<br/><br/>It should always remain the best movie ever made about time travel. 10/10"

"george-08410","Null","1","1","28 April 2017"," A small town teenager travels through time and back to when his parents were teenagers.
","Back to the Future is a film that is based on a teenage boy who is from a small town in California. The film was released in July of 1985. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is the teenager who is transported back in time to the 1950's because an experiment from his scientific, eccentric friend Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd), goes very wrong. Traveling through time in a DeLorean car, Marty lands in the time where his parents are teenagers. His parents are George (Crispin Glover) and Lorraine (Lea Thompson). Marty has the task of also making sure his parents fall in love or he will cease to exist. He also needs to get back to the future to save his friend Doc who was shot just before he traveled in time.<br/><br/>The them in Back to the Future would be courage versus fear. Both Marty and George are afraid in different parts of the film. Marty is afraid of the band that he is a part of, being rejected again. He doesn't think he can handle that kind of rejection. Ironically, when Marty is talking with his father George as a teenager, George also says something similar. But this time it is about Lorraine, Marty's mother. George is afraid if he tells her that he likes her that she will reject him and he does not think he can handle that kind of rejection. <br/><br/>One of the other themes in the movie would be that Marty is able to see that he has the same feelings about his girlfriend Jennifer that his dad had for his mother when they were teenagers. All Marty has known so far is the distance that his parents have and no the loving relationship that they used to have. Marty comes to understand they shared a similar love for the women in each of their lives.<br/><br/>Back to the Future has a theme that is similar to Peggy Sue got Married. Marty got to see before life changed a lot of things, that his dad George loved his mother Lorraine very much. This is similar to Peggy in the movie, going back in time to when she was in high school. This happened after she passes out at her reunion and travels back to a time where she realizes that she does love her husband who she was going to divorce before the reunion. <br/><br/>The theme is courage versus fear and several motifs come up throughout the film to support that theme. One part of the film is Marty having to make a split-second decision to drive the DeLorean to leave Doc dying on the ground after he had been shot. To travel back in the time to try and get away from the people who shot Doc. He then must have the courage to get back to the future so he can reverse what happened to Doc. Lighting also supports that same thing when the people start chasing Doc, it was darker but then the gun fire started lighting everything up and Marty was trying to get away from them. Doc was unable to do so, and therefore got shot. The lighting was prevalent to where you could see a lot of what was going on. You could see the courage on Marty's face when he got into the car in hopes to get away from the guys before they shot him also. The lighting and the motifs play an important role in the film, tying together the theme of courage versus fear by showing examples of why it is important to courageous even when you are afraid. It could change history."
"kyle-98356","8","1","1","25 April 2017"," Back to the Future...did it change?
","Back to the Future was released in July 1985 and is the story of Marty McFly played by Michael J. Fox. Marty ends up going back in time with his friend Doc Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd. Doc turned his DeLorean into a time machine powered by plutonium. They take the DeLorean back to 1955 and end up meeting Marty's parents, George (Crispin Glover) and Lorraine (Lea Thompson). While in 1955, Marty has to be sure that his teenage parents fall in love to make sure that he can make it back to 1985 alive. <br/><br/>The theme of Back to the Future is the conversation about fate and free will. Are we all on a predetermined path that cannot change or do we have the power to change our future? Marty is able to go back to when his parents first met. As the movie progressed and his time in the past grew, he had to make sure that his parents would stay together to ensure that he had a future to go back to. Was it always supposed to be like that? In the 1955 that his parents remember before he was born, did he actually come from the future to keep them together? Or did he alter history? This is the question that is addressed in almost every movie about time travel. Do the effects of what you do in the past ripple through time toward the future?<br/><br/>The effects of the movie were excellent for their time. The special effects used to transport the DeLorean back to 1955 made it look possible. Doc is the perfect mad scientist for the job. The DeLorean is just as crazy as him. With the switches and flashing lights, it is exactly what you would think a time machine to look like. The camera angles that are used in the movie give the viewer the experience of traveling through time. Cameras with the outside of the DeLorean in view during the time travel reveals the special effects used by the production to make it look like the car is actually traveling through the space-time continuum. <br/><br/>Director Robert Zemeckis does a great job with the film to make the viewer think about the effects of the past on our future. If the past would change because of someone using time travel. Would it effect the future immediately? Or did the future already know about that change so nothing would change that we know of?"
"zkonedog","10","1","1","12 March 2017"," The Film That Defies The Word ""Genre""
","When you head to your local video rental store, or browse the selection online with a site like Netflix, the titles are usually arranged according to genre, such as drama, action, comedy, romance, etc. However, when it comes to Back To The Future, truly one of the classic films of our generation, a copy would need to be put in almost every category, as it is the only film I have seen to date that defies the very notion of genre.<br/><br/>The basic story revolves around young 1980s kid Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) whose friendship with mad scientist ""Doc"" Brown (Christopher Lloyd) ends up with Marty in a time machine (made out of a Delorean, as if any more humor was needed!) whisked away to the year 1955, where he skewers the timeline and must make sure that his parents meet (and procreate sometime down the line, if you will) and fall in love once again.<br/><br/>Yet, that ""simple"" plot contains so, so much more in terms of just overall entertainment. It is hilarious (""Why don't you make like a tree...and get out of here""), romantic (the George-Lorraine plot thread), dramatic (will Marty make it back home?), and full of enough action and adventure to rival a Stallone or Schwarzenegger flick!<br/><br/>The acting is also some of the best that cinema has to offer. While Fox and Lloyd play the primary leads, the acting trio of Lea Thompson (playing Lorraine Baines), Crispin Glover (George McFly), and Thomas F. Wilson (Biff Tannen) almost steal the entire show on certain occasions with their various personalities. Even the ""bit players"" are superb in their short, yet very important/meaningful appearances.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most impressive thing about this entire film experience, though, is the detail put into each and every scene. One must pay close attention to every single detail (no matter how seemingly small) of every single scene in the 1980s-portion of the film in order to better understand the jokes and sight gags of the 1950s-era time frame. I have probably watched this entire film all the way through at least a dozen times, yet on each viewing I find something new that I seemed to have missed.<br/><br/>Thus, on my list of ""greatest movies of all-time"", this effort is without a doubt in the top five for its ability to suck a viewer in on all levels. Watch with confidence knowing there will never be a dull moment!"

This was a film I really wished i grew up with because this is the finest piece of work in film-making I have ever seen.I love everything about this movie from the amazing story, to the amazing characters, Jokes, Romance, set pieces you name it!.The acting is top notch and you really feel for the characters in the film. <br/><br/>The main character Marty Mcfly is a friendly,likable funny guy who's family isn't the greatest, His father is a loser who lack confidence and is always picked on by Biff who is a nasty person who only thinks for himself. His Mother is a drinker and is never really happy or upbeat. His brother also has a lame job in delivering pizzas.Marty is told by Doc brown (who is really funny and interesting) that he has made a time machine into a car. Marty then travels back in time from 1985 to 1955 because of being in a tight problem after the doc gets killed by a bunch of gang members. I won't tell you what happens in the rest of the story but it's something you have to see to believe. The writing in the film is tight and I can watch this film many times without getting bored and finding new things within the film that I have missed the first few times I watched it. <br/><br/>It's a film that anybody can enjoy.The first film in the series will always be the best and while the 2nd and 3rd movies were very good follow ups.

","Back to the future"" is a lesson in movie-making. The script is really good, the director (Zemeckis) does what is expected of him, and the cast is perfect for the characters.<br/><br/>The story itself is hardly original, but how it is told is outstanding. Not only that this film is funny, it succeeds in creating a certain atmosphere that is hard to describe. An atmosphere that you can feel and which distinguishes good movies from classics. You really connect with all the characters on screen. Zemeckis' first & only choice was Michael J. Fox for the role of Marty. Marty McFly is the part Fox was born to play, but there are other great performances here, as well. Christopher Lloyd is excellent as ""Doc"" Brown, and Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas Wilson also help to make this a very entertaining movie. There is an extra attraction here for those of us who can remember the 1950's, and some of the gags based on Fox's out-of-time character are classic. Also, this movie is recognizable by his amazing soundtrack composed by Alan Silvestri, including ""Power of Love,"" by Huey Lewis and the News. The track was a billboard charter at the time of the film, and it's rhythm and beat are still catchy. Overall, it's a good sci-fi film with the right amount of tension and laughs, and even some really touching moments.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 8 out of 10."

However, he is almost upstaged by a superb over-the-top performance by Christopher Lloyd.<br/><br/>Good support from Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson.<br/><br/>A pity that the producers felt the need to make a sequel, and then another.

If you're one of the few on the planet who hasn't seen it - buy it, rent it or find an old theatre that plays the classics.<br/><br/>I remember watching this for the first time and was amazed by how many details were in the story. My parents were young in the 1950s and have told me many times how accurate the period references were. <br/><br/>Back To The Future will always be my favorite Michael J. Fox film. He's done many good ones, but this has that ""it"" quality. Very special!"

","Back to the Future is the classic sci-fi, adventure and comedy film nearly everyone has watched and loved, it is directed and co-written by Robert Zemeckis, staring Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd as a troubled teen and a failed scientist who a thrust into a adventure through time in this praised trilogy.<br/><br/>I will try be as unbiased as possible but even if I were to forget the years of loving this film and forgetting about all the joy it brought me, it's still a fantastic film. Back to the Future achieves in every aspect which is more than can be said for a lot of films.<br/><br/>First off are the characters, perhaps the most important reason why this film is so great, each character is distinct and unique, likable and interact perfectly leading to hilarious and emotional scenes. They are all fantastically performed by a superb cast who bring these people to life more than any other actor could, you can't imagine another person playing them because they just fit so well in their roles. When you boil down this recipe and sprinkle some well written dialogue on the top you get some brilliant scenes, most of which made me (and the whole cinema) howl with laughter. Not only that but the romance intertwined with the plot is very well done, not feeling forced or poorly executed, this is coming from a guy who hates unnecessary love in films, I liked the romance! Which was very important since it makes up a huge chunk of the plot.<br/><br/>On top of a captivating story and a set of great characters are also great visuals from its cinematography to its slightly dated effects which just add to the charm. The use of visual comedy which is very scarce now days was a nice addition. All accompanied by a stunning score by the always brilliant Alan Silvestri which is one of my favourites to this day, from the roaring orchestra to Huey Lewis and the New this is a go to soundtrack for me and goes great with the film, adding to the humour and the tension which for what many would consider a laid back lazy Sunday film, there is a lot of.<br/><br/>Overall this is one of my favourite films of all time and has been since I first saw it many years ago and the fact that it's still up there really says something about how timeless it is. The characters, the humour, the music, everything is just spot on all combining into something that will be loved for generations to come."

","Time travel is a tricky subject in films. There's the old dilemma of all the paradoxes of timelines and butterfly effects and the awkward problem of trying to create conflict where the previous events have already established a status quo. Back to the Future neatly sidesteps this problem and presents an energetic mishmash of genres that became an instant hit and spawned an eager following. The script's building blocks pull together the plot intricately. Every little hint, every anecdote and appearance from the current timeline (Goldie Wilson's re-election van, the lighting struck clocktower) is re-enacted through the time machine back in 1955. You can only imagine the delight of audience at first seeing a young George McFly being subject to the same treatment, and recognising the fateful accident of the car hitting the young boy and gasp at how suddenly, the future is being morphed. And so we have a intriguing premise established so elegantly. <br/><br/>Even now the opening sequence is brilliant. We have this rather cryptic voice message from what seems like an eccentric madman scientist about the big experiment, the news report just as the camera reveals the case of stolen plutonium, and true to the key theme, an immense collection of clocks that tick so irregularly and mysteriously. Michael J Fox sees all this, doesn't make too much of it, and then we zoom out to the enormous amplifier that seems to be fit for only one thing in his mind: a guitar solo. He's a rockstar, and as he skateboards through the town to the very appropriate Power of Love, presents us with so many clues and landmarks that we will later look for in the same place, but decades earlier.<br/><br/>The opening sequence also does a lot of the lifting that creates the intrigue until we finally reveal Doc Brown and his crazy experiment. The iconic Delorean descending from the billowing smoke is epic, and so is the first attempt at hitting 88 miles an hour where the car flashes and disappears in a trail of fire. Zemeckis has become a household name for pioneering visual effects but it's the sort of low key work here that doesn't interfere with the excitement of the scientific breakthrough and lets our imaginations go wild (we see this again in the excellent world-building in the sequel). And in the ending, he hints just a little at the next adventure, and the sleek hover and fly off into the distance is short but sweet. There's also some inspired camera-work here and there. Cundey loves the dramatic crane up and reveals, and these work very effectively in the context of the narrative; the vast, undeveloped plains of Lyon Estate, and the triumphant sign of the fire trails after the lighting strike. <br/><br/>Michael J Fox as the lead character is just perfect. His height adds an extra dimension to the heroism; Biff towers over him and it becomes something other than a physical confrontation (it would have been easy to write in the son beating up the bully for his father). He oozes cool - there's the impromptu moment where he creates the first skateboard and weaves in and out before dispatching the car of bullies, and a moment of pure cheesiness and romance which he turns into a rock and roll romp - but of course they haven't got to that musical period yet. And he's also capable of being less than all style - see the hilarious way in which he stumbles out of the Delorean and is mistaken for an alien and his ufo. Thompson's young Lorraine is also excellent; each lovestruck sigh and desiring murmur of the dreamboat Calvin Klein is adorable and reminds us that this is exactly how it happened, only with a different boy. The Oedipus angle of it all is handled well, and with humour (My name is Darth Vader) - it could have been creepy or uncomfortable, but Lorraine is sweet and the resolution is satisfying. There are little kinks here and there, and the Libyan terrorist shoot-out perhaps a little too goofy, but Back to the Future is a delight."
"naturalswedenp","9","1","1","8 November 2015"," Little reflections
","It really struck me that how time passed fly when I saw the profile of Michael J.Fox(shot in recent years) as soon as I finished this movie,while he was so cute and young in Back to Future （1985）.I was touched when Dr.Brown exerted all his energy to help Marty back to future and firmly refused Marty's proposal to tell him his future,from which I see the responsibility that every scientist bear.Usually scientific experiments are successfully completed at the expense of each scientists themselves.And Dr.Brown was kind of person who dedicated all his life to science and totally enjoyed it-a super cute science manic.<br/><br/>After Marty backed to 1955,he encouraged his father to pursue Lorraine and that was when his father took action and punch Biff back,which the result became not the same anymore.It made me think that it was what we do right now,not what you do in the future that change our fate and make a total difference.Every choice we make,every action we take right now determine whether we will become a winner or a looser.So don't risk your life by fluke,the success of your life is earned by your efforts,little by little."
"luke-a-mcgowan","10","1","1","5 November 2015"," Brilliant, creative and delightfully fun
","Behold Robert Zemeckis' masterpiece, one of the best films ever to come out of the 1980s. One of the most brilliant and creative films I've ever seen, Back to the Future is an enduring classic.<br/><br/>The star of the show is Marty McFly, played with utter brilliance by Michael J. Fox. Marty is a bit of a cool kid, but as played by Fox he's also a bit of a goof and he's hilarious to watch. In my opinion, McFly is the greatest movie protagonist of all time. He rattles off the incredible dialogue from Zemeckis and Bob Gale but also injects it with such authentic emphasis and ""ums"" and ""ahs"" that its so easy to watch without thinking that you are watching a performance. He has incredible chemistry with Doc Brown (the unparalleled Christopher Lloyd). Also making up the superb cast are Lea Thompson as Marty's mother, Crispin Glover as his father and Thomas F. Wilson as Biff (one of the greatest film bullies of all time, thanks to Wilson's intimidating yet incredibly funny performance).<br/><br/>Alan Silvestri's iconic score is perfectly utilised to create a sense of triumph at key moments in the film. Zemeckis directs the hell out of the film with some superb long takes and superbly choreographed scenes. The film's climax is one of the most tense and brilliant scenes Zemeckis has ever made. But its the screenplay that makes the masterpiece - chock full of quotable dialogue, memorable characters and one of the most accessible time travel stories of all time. The story of Marty's parents is so much better now than I've ever realised; Lorraine's sheltered upbringing and George's timid persona set them up perfectly - their love story before Marty arrives is just as believable as their story as set by Marty, AND its just the right set of circumstances for his arrival to set it in jeopardy. It could have gone any way. Zemeckis and Gale place well written scenes in two different time periods to make a point more flawlessly than any amount of exposition ever could. <br/><br/>There are some problems with the film - after George's triumphant victory in the car park, the film needs to put in one more obstacle for him to overcome (a red haired brat who is never seen before or after) which just feels like borrowing time (which was needed but could have been done better). But all you need to do is watch Michael J. Fox shred the guitar to Johnny Be Good and you'll be giving out a perfect rating just like I did."

","I suppose like many people I got caught up in the whole ""it was 30 years ago today"" shtick surrounding this movie of late and with a free Saturday afternoon indoors, with my wife watched this movie neither of us had seen since 1985. Thankfully, we both found it was just as much fun and exciting to see as all those years ago. <br/><br/>I mean I'm an absolute sucker for any kind of time-travel stuff, especially the whole circular time, going-back-to-your-own-past-changing-your-own-future thing. I love how the film sometimes subtly, sometimes obviously sets up the prompts for future resolution, by so often doubling back on itself, but of course never lets all that timey-wimey stuff get in the way of what is at heart a rollicking, exciting, family entertainment.<br/><br/>It helps that the casting is so good, Michael J Fox as the spirited, energetic teenager Marty McFly and the great Christopher Lloyd as the madcap scientist Doc Brown in the two lead roles but also the characters of Marty's gormless mum and dad and numb-skull bully Biff. The period-settings are lovingly and nostalgically rendered and the humour is sharp and relevant, as Marty straightens out the future lives of his whole family, actually saves the lives of his brother, sister and Doc while inventing rock and roll in the process!<br/><br/>This really is a timeless entertainment and what better adjective could I use to describe it than that."

It would be so cool if all the original actors got together to do spoof or even better, be in the 4th movie! <br/><br/>I am not sure if an all new cast could do this story line justice or not but I'm willing to entertain the possibilities as long as it does not displace the time-space continuum!"
"hoxjennifer","8","1","1","23 October 2015"," Typical 80's, cult classic
","""Back to the Future"" is one of those films every 80's/90's kid just has to see! It's such a fun, light-hearted typical 80's flick. I wouldn't classify it as a comedy, because it won't have you on the floor rolling. It's more of a really light adventure film that has a simple, clean plot that doesn't claim to be anything more than what it is.<br/><br/>Marty McFly is your typical, trouble-making 80's teenager, who grows up in a troubled household. His father doesn't know how to stand up for himself and doesn't live up to his full potential due to an intense fear of rejection. His mother is obviously dissatisfied with her life and is an alcoholic. His older brother has a dead end job. And Marty has the same fear of rejection his father does. Except Marty is more adventurous, and his uncanny friendship with a mad scientist leads him to travel back in time 30 years, to the time when his parents met. Due to some unlucky mishaps, the younger version of his mother ends up falling in love with Marty instead of his father. Marty must race against the clock to correct history and get his parents to fall in love, and ultimately to return...back to the future.<br/><br/>This is such a cult classic. It is literally ""timeless"", and is a must-see for any generation. Michael J Fox is perfect in his innocent, boy-hood portrayal of Marty McFly. If they ever do a remake of this movie, I will be sorely disappointed because nothing can ever replace the original."

","Back to the Future is an all around excellent, family friendly movie. This is a classic sci-fi comedy that can relate to any genre and will be enjoyed for years to come. This is a movie about time travel, family and friendship.<br/><br/>Marty Mcfly (Michael J. Fox) travels back in time to 1955 and unintentionally changes the course of his future. Marty must succeed in getting his parents, Lorraine and George to meet and kiss or he and his two siblings will cease to exist. Once planted in 1955, Marty tracks down Doc (Christopher Lloyd) his bizarre and unconventional friend. Doc invented the time travel machine and is the person responsible for Marty being in this predicament. With Doc's help, Marty is able to get Lorraine (Lea Thompson) and George (Crispin Glover) to meet and fall in love. The movie is filled with many failed attempts to get this two together, along with attracting the attention of George's bully, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson). Once Marty is back in 1985, his world has changed for the better. George is now self confident, his mother happy and his siblings successful. Biff is now working for George and Marty and Doc reunite for another adventure. <br/><br/>The relationship between Marty and Doc is endearing and comical and is the core of the movie. George is a likable character who you can't help but root for and so frustratingly want him to take a stand to Biff. Lorraine is an amusing character who initially falls in love with Marty until George comes along and rescues her from Biff's advances. The relationships of these characters are endearing and the movie is filled with references to pop culture and much satire.<br/><br/>This film utilizes music and time to throughout the entire movie. The sound effects and music help to establish the era. This movie about time travel stands the test of time. Many other movies have been made about time travel but do not do it justice, such as Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Back to the Future is not a thought provoking movie nor are the effects like current big budget films; However, it has established itself as one of the best of movies of the 80's and certainly a film that can be re-watched again and again with enjoyment!"

","This is a fun movie with a bit of wacky science behind it. Time travel is not possible and so far may never be possible because if it was why hasn't anyone come back to fix this world? :) Nevertheless, this movie follows Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and D. Emmet Brown along with Biff Tannen and others as they go back and forth from 1955 to 1985. In an effort to change his family for the better Marty goes back to 1955 to get his DAD and MOM together. Now Biff is also in love with Lorane (Martys Mom) and does everything he can as a Neanderthal bully to win her heart. Forcing her to be his girlfriend but turns him down every time.<br/><br/>When Marty goes back to 1955 he alters the events in a way that would destroy his family completely mostly by accident. Pushes his dad out of the way of his grandpa's car. This makes it where Lorane falls in love with Marty who she think is named Calvin Klein (Brand of underwear he was wearing at the time) and this threatens his very existence. <br/><br/>At the dance at school he plays Johnny B. Goode that apparently inspires the original guitar player (whose hand got hurt using a screwdriver to open the trunk where Martys dad was thrown in by Biffs cohorts) to call his cousin to have him listen to Marty play that song. It was a bit much for the 1995 people as the looked at him funny at the end of his solo. Where Marty then says a statement that everyones kids will love it.<br/><br/>After everything in the dance is done and over with, Martys Mom and Dad kisses shortly after that which saves the family however if you look at the picture there are minor differences like his sister is not fat and his brother looks different.<br/><br/>He returns to 1985 where Biff runs an auto detailer company, and Marty's dad writes a book about his encounter with Marty in 1955 thinking he was an alien being that brought his mom and dad together His brother wears a suit and his sister is skinny, plus Martys mom went from not liking Martys girlfriend to liking her. And at the end Emmet comes back and says, ""Marty you need to come back with me."" And Marty asks where, where Emmet says, ""Back to the Future"" which is the lead in to BTTF II.<br/><br/>With all the zany antics done in the 50s and Dr. Brown coming back from 2015 *where are our hover boards and Mr Fusion?* this kicked of a wonderful Trilogy that is still liked today. There are rumors of a remake but how will that work now that it is 2015."

","Back To The Future (1985) The comedy, action and sci-fi classic that is, Back to the Future (1985, starring Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas F. Wilson. Is about a young high school student, named Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), living in Hill Valley, who is friends with the, genius with a little bit of crazy, scientist Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), who to travels back from the year 1985, to November 5th 1955, in a time travelling DeLorean. He gets stuck in 1955 and runs into his future parents when they were in high school, the only way for Marty to find a way back to 1985 is with the help of his friend Dr. Brown. First thing that came to my mind after I had watched the movie was the fact that the whole McFly family's lives got better after the crazy adventure Marty had been through in 1955. In the beginning you see how Biff (Wilson), basically bullies and dominates over, Marty's father, George (Glover). Then when Marty goes back to the future he tries to encourage his father to stand up for himself and ask Marty's mother, Lorraine (Thompson), out, even though she's in love with Marty. In the end Marty and George make a plan to make her fall in love with George instead of Marty. The plan is that Marty parks with Lorraine, he argues with her, then George comes and ""fights"" Marty to show that he can stand up for himself. Then it ends up by Biff being in the car grabbing Lorraine and trying to seduce her, while Marty is carried away, then George goes to the car opens up the door, and gets two options, either he really stands up for himself and saves Lorraine from Biff, or he just walks away like nothing happened. George chooses to stand up for Lorraine, and punches Biff in the face and he goes right down on the ground. This broke the whole pattern that had lead George to get held back by bad self-confidence and spent time doing Biff's homework for him and being bullied by him. So not only does personal life and his children's lives get improved, by them getting better jobs, but also his career takes off and he publishes a book on science fiction stories that he's been writing since high school.<br/><br/>Second thing that came to my mind is that the story of how Lorraine and George fell in love changes, after Marty's trip to the 50s. At first the story is that, Lorraine's father hits George with the car, then George gets brought into the house and Lorraine falls in love with him, then they go together to the ""Enchantment Under the Sea Dance"" where they first kiss. When Marty goes to 1955, he sees his father almost get hit by the car, but then he pushes his father out of the way and gets hit by the car himself and gets brought into Lorraine's house. Then Lorraine falls in love with Marty, which will change the whole story of how Lorraine and George will fall in love. As earlier mentioned, George won Lorraine over by standing up for her and himself, against Biff. Hence their love story goes from her just pitying him, to her actually feeling safe with him and loving him for a better reason. The story doesn't only sound better if they tell it to people, but it has also had a great effect on how their future together looks. In the beginning you see Lorraine, drinking, looking pretty unhealthy etc. you also get to see how George is not paying so much attention to her or showing any form of affection for her or even communicating well with her. Then after, you see how much healthier Lorraine is, and also how much George shows his affection for her, by i.e. walking with her and having his arm over her shoulder constantly, and teases her like they're still teenagers. Overall the transition of the McFly family's lives is what struck me the most in this adventurous and exciting movie. The transition of how the family went from unconsciously unhappy to a great successful family, not only career wise due to their father having an improvement in confidence, but also relationship wise, especially the parents."

","Sure one might argue that this movie does have some discrepancies in the time-line, still what makes most of us forget this, is the wonderful story being told on screen, which is why I believe many people, including myself, fell in love with this movie. Starring the newest star on the block back then, Back To The Future is a thrill ride that will surely entertain you, and for me part of the success of the film was due to wonderful dynamic acting by Michael J. Fox. When you add in Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and many others who put up great supporting roles, as well as a delightful (despite its plot holes) script, then this a must-see movie.<br/><br/>The movie's narrative focuses on a young boy named Marty McFly, who having traveled back in time to 1955, in his friend Doc Brown's time machine, has to fix his parents with each other in order to assure his existence. Factor in a comedic side to the story with his mom feeling attracted to him and a more dramatic side with Marty struggling to tell 1955 Doc that he dies in 1985, just before Marty traveled to 1955, and I would say the story is balanced. Just like Jurassic Park would put dinosaurs in the midst of popularity in 1993, I believe time traveling was a hot topic among those who watched and enjoyed the movie in 1985. It's that kind of reaction that I think creates a classic movie.<br/><br/>It might not be the most perfect film, however Back To The Future is blockbuster royalty and an audience favorite. It pleases with its light comedy and might even cause a few tears here and there. Bottom line: I don't think I'll ever stop loving this movie.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10"

","Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future is a very entertaining science fiction film of which is also pretty funny at times as well. The movie stars Michael J.

But when he travels back in time and visits his mother's house at the time he was young he has a huge problem which is that his teenage mother is in love with him instead of his future father. Zemeckis really knows good visual effects, a film i consider the best science fiction movie from the 1980's sine executive producer Steven Spielberg's 1982 classic E.T. The Extra Terrestrial. Not only that this works as a science fiction classic, it also works as a comedic family adventure. This movie is a huge sci-fi entertainment for the whole family to see."

And a mission you actually care about as the audience members. Michael J. Fox is just great a Marty McFly who may seem like a typical 80's main teenage character, but there is certain aspects about him that makes him a cool and stands out from the rest. Maybe it's his capability to stand up to bullies even if he is smaller in stature. While also having the courage to follow his dreams and how he conducts himself, despite his flaws of not being able to turn down a challenge. But Christopher Lloyd is the guy that just plain downright nailed it as the wacky scientist Dr. Emmett Brown. Even when it came down to the main villain Biff played by Biff Tannen, who is basically a generic bad guy of this trilogy, but certain elements makes him kind of a stand out villain for me. Maybe because you can see different versions of him, even if he is the bad guy all the way through. Watching this movie was like watching a Jerry Bruckheimer movie with a touch of Spielberg's elements, except this trilogy will go down as a classic trilogy. This may seem like a typical 80's movie from the surface, but it has a lot of elements that makes it brilliant. It's difficult to describe in words, but this movie, this trilogy just works and will stick with you. When it comes to the story it's actually very simple, but sometimes the simple aspect of a film makes it more worthwhile sometimes even if it deals with time travel. Watching this even now I can understand why a movie like this can be a timeless classic and give kids a colorful imaginative ideas. I for one tried to build a time machine with my brother when we were younger after watching this movie and had a blast! <br/><br/>9/10"

","When I look back at this movie and listen to the commentaries I realize just how lucky we are that the right people ended up on screen. No one else could play these characters. Love this movie! This does not apply to the second and third as important character was replaced. I believe it would have been an epic trilogy, as of now only the original is epic. I do own the 25th anniversary edition blue-ray and enjoy it. Some jokes some of the younger kids today wont get but was so funny back then and still crazy funny. The triple full service gas station, 80's diner is all funny if you knew the politics and pulse of the world back then."

","A normal teenager is accidentally sent back in time in a DeLorean built by his friend Doc Brown and must ensure that his parents unite in order to save his family and his own existence.<br/><br/>A classic film that is beloved by many film buffs and casual movie goers alike. A charming and unique story with a blend of comedy and action. The acting is top notch, the pacing and character development are wonderful, and a film with such a unique and fantastical story are expertly directed and handled by Zemeckis and is handled in such a manner that it is entirely believable. The film taking place in two different times is handled very well the world of the squeaky clean 1950's is made very believable and the nostalgia factor is very high. The score and soundtrack not only assist the film but strengthen it and make it that much more beloved. What can be said about this film as it not only resonates with the viewer and pop culture but has earned it place as one of the most cherished and beloved films of our time"

Lea Thompson,, and Crispin Glover are very good in supporting roles as well.. basically time travel is explored in this movie,, and if it is possible,, there are some pretty cool looking futuristic cars in this movie,, like the DeLorean for example..

"tristandetwiler","10","1","1","21 December 2013"," We're sending you Back to the Future! This is my second favorite film of all time.
","Plot:<br/><br/>Where the film shines. The opening scene is presented perfectly. It sets up flawlessly the central theme of time and space. There's even a small bit of foreshadowing with the image of a man hanging onto one of the clocks. A person hanging onto time, as most people describe it. The hint of the stolen plutonium is nicely presented with News Reel and then the reveal of the actual crate under the bed. It's great story-telling that doesn't use any dialogue, and there's a lot of it in this movie. There are SO many minor details that make perfect sense in the context of the story. Mart Mcfly, played by Michael J. Fox, goes back in time to the year 1955. He lands in a farmland that was owned by the man ""Peabody"". It was all replaced by the year 1985 and turned into the ""Twin Pines Mall"". Of course, Marty goes back to the past and knocks down one of the two Pine Tress Peabody had set up. Marty goes back to the present by the end of the film, and the mall's sign now says ""Lone Pine Mall"". None of this is explored through dialogue, but just through actions. It all makes sense. There's lots of people I know that never knew some of the information that Robert Zemeckis cleverly implements into this picture. The License plate on the back of the Delorean Time Machine reads ""OUTATIME"". Clever, right?<br/><br/>Characters:<br/><br/>""I can't believe you would loan me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot, OK? I coulda' been killed! I also want to know about this! I spilled beer all over my shirt, who's gonna' pay for my cleaning bill?"" This is main villain's first scene. The character is named Biff Tannen, played by Thomas Wilson, and it's possibly the best introduction to any character in any movie. Biff is talking to Marty's father, George Mcfly, about his car that Biff accidentally totaled. It's not spoon-feeding the audience that Biff is a villain, but just from what he says delivers the same message. It's so clever, that words can hardly describe it. Speaking of George Mcfly, whose played by Crispin Glover, his character is portrayed brilliantly. Crispin's charismatic enigma truly shows how much of a genius he is. I can't even imagine any other person who could take Crispin's place. The worried and timid attitude that the character has is shown powerfully from Crispin through frail and prissy acting. The best line in the whole film is from George Mcfly when he's acting up the nerve to talk to Lorraine. In the diner and walks to the counter, ""Give me a milk. Chocolate."" Grabs the sliding glass, drinks it, then slams it down. You just have to see it for yourself.<br/><br/>Visuals:<br/><br/>The composite shots are so obvious, but that's what characterizes 80's action and science fiction films. It works great! I'd rather have these effects over CGI just because they're natural visual effects. The added flames and sparks added to the DMC Delorean when it's time traveling has become a staple of pop culture. It's just a shame that the set the final scene was filmed on accidentally burned down years later... TWICE.<br/><br/>Enjoyment:<br/><br/>I could pop this in any moment of any hour of any day, and it would not lose a single ounce of its charm. It's truly a masterpiece; one of the best movies ever made. The dialogue and conversations alone make it worth it.<br/><br/>Rewatchability:<br/><br/>Let me tell you, it was a real treat getting to see this movie on the big screen TWICE. Once for the AMC Exclusive Release and the Cinemark Re-Release. If you haven't seen this film, then get your head checked. This movie is one of the best films ever created. Every single little aspect about it is awesome."

","this is the best movie series i have seen yet. awesome concept and direction. this movie (especially the second part) could have become very complex and confusing, but very well thought and written and so everything is explained with no loop holes. all the characters have became legends for me since i watched this movie. In the second part, when the Dr. was explaining the time traveling concept to McFly, we all (me and my friends) went totally mad, paused the movie and discussed it on paper first and then continued with the movie. I am ever ready to watch this movie again and again with people who haven't seen it yet and discuss with them about the movie."
"donuthaters12","9","1","1","8 December 2013"," Zemeckis' Film Is Ambitious And Multi-Generationally Approachable
","Back To The Future is one of those films that is universally loved and is one of the most referenced contemporary films of all time. Has there been any other time travel film that has created such an impact as this film? Not that I have seen, but it is arguable as I have not seen many time traveling films.<br/><br/>Back To The Future is written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale. I am just get this out of the way and say that both are not the greatest of writers but they did have created an a concept that is so ambitious and at the same time so accessible that it is hard to not appreciate their writing contributions. Back To The Future's premise is the reason we watch this film and it's the reason that we keep getting hooked to it. Back To The Future's plot is ambitious, at times too ambitious that certain plot holes may be present in relation to the impact of Marty's influence, and the film also has an abundance of humor scattered throughout the film. The humor is one of the main reason that the film is so accessible and beloved, the jokes can be related to both the younger generation and the previous generation even if either generation is from the 50-80s era. The story of just having Marty's mother be infatuated with him, and lightly touches on Freud's Oedipal Complex, is hilarious and ridiculous that it still has it's effect with every viewing. Back To The Future also manages to create the most unique of friendships, a high school student and a slightly off scientist, because these characters are so well written that I didn't really mind the unbelievability of their friendship. Both writers have created a protagonist that is very close to a real teenager during the 80's and made him so appealing that every adolescent males want to be him and all teenage girls want him.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis now is regarded as one of the greatest contemporary directors and Back To The Future is one of the reasons why that is so. Zemeckis was able to execute a film that has such an ambitious plot while maintaining a campy coming of age tone that can appeal to a multi-generational audience. Back To The Future and Romancing The Stone definitely made Zemeckis an important director and those become a stepping stone for him to create films with more artistic license. Back To The Future was able to create this sense of nostalgia and walk a tightrope between two generations of adolescence. Zemeckis was able to project that ability to recreate a time of adolescent youth that is relatable and fueled by references that defined that time period; Zemeckis has definitely created something that was similar to what George Lucas did for American Graffiti.<br/><br/>Dean Cundey started off as a cinematographer of the most popular Horror films of all time, including Halloween and The Thing. After working with Zemeckis on Romancing With The Stone, he did a complete turn around working in much more light-hearted and optimistic films. Cundey did a decent job here and was able to juxtapose two different looks for the film, the dark and dirty look for the 80s and the warm and colorful look of the 50's. Cundey's photography isn't as in your face with nostalgia, like The Godfather, as it consistently takes a more contemporary style throughout the film. Cundey shoots this film to serve the plot and maintaining that accessibility and light hearted tone that Zemeckis wanted instead of drawing attention to itself. The cinematography for this film may not be as loved as the film's writing or musical score but Cundey doesn't slouch with this film.<br/><br/>Alan Silvestri was brought in to compose the score for Back To The Future and what a wonderful job he has done here. Silvestri's score here is one of the most memorable film scores that competes with other films like Star Wars and Indiana Jones. It has the ability to stick under your skin and will have you bobbing your head when it comes on. Huey Lewis' ""Power of Love"" is so catchy that it just stands out and had me singing the lyrics every time it comes on. The song is able to blend in with Silvestri's score which prevents me from drawing too much attention to it and feeling like it's out of place.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox is the star of this film, embodying this character who is a product of a rebellious and erratic generation. Fox brings personality to McFly by acting like how cool teenage adolescents were like in his time period. When he is sent back in time, Fox was able to portray this fish out of water kind of personality and emotion that makes his entrapment believable. Christopher Lloyd plays the slightly intense scientist who has created time traveling. Lloyd definitely has given such a memorable performance and nobody else was able to capture his performance in any other film. Lloyd was able to balance humor and the seriousness with such flourish that he was to place weight in the story of the scene. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover play Marty's parents and both do a very good job and was able to embody both their young and older self, though at times Glover at the start of the film was quite over the top and had me cringing a couple of times. Thomas F. Wilson was good as a cliché looking bully ""Biff"". He was able to give off this toughness quality that is able to make the McFly's feel inferior.<br/><br/>Back To The Future by now is regarded as a classic and I can see why. This film will appeal to every generation and it's legacy will continue to grow as time passes. Back To The Future is still Zemeckis' best film and will forever remain as a timeless piece of cinema."
"AsifZamir","10","1","1","21 November 2013"," Would you trade everything to go back in time?
","Back to the Future is the first movie in a series of 3. The film was written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale. The film's origins stemmed from musings by Gale in that he wondered if he were to go to high school with his father, if they would have gotten along (Vs. what most Canadian boys think about ""gosh I wonder who my father is""). The movie went on to production only after Zemeckis' Romancing the Stone, as it was previously rejected before-hand. Back to the Future was produced through Universal Pictures by Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>Back to the Future is about a teen, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), who lives at home with his mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson), father George (Crispin Glover) and siblings Dave and Linda (Marc McClure and Wendie Jo Sperber). With the unintentional aid of eccentric friend, Doc (Christopher Lloyd), Marty is sent back to the time of his parent's teenage years in a time machine that is powered by Plutonium. Marty then has to bring his parents together again while diverting his mother's romantic interest in Marty, making it very awkward, so he and his siblings would still exist.<br/><br/>Back to the Future was the biggest movie for the year of 1985. Back to the Future was an all-time kids favourite and also enjoyed by adults, as I still watch the movie from time to time and thoroughly enjoy it. There have been other movies in production that copies the time travelling concept but hasn't come close to the greatness of Back to the Future."

","I love this film and it's 2 sequels, I watched one on TV some years ago and loved it and went straight out and bought the Trilogy. It's a must watch for anyone at any age, I'm 16 and I love it and this film definitely has a long shelf life. As for the storyline,it's fantastic and Michael J. fox and Chris Lloyd have such a great friendship and they really do make the film. The fact they chose the Delorean as the time machine is even better. This is my favourite Spielsberg film by far and truly is one of my favourite films of all time. Also this film really manages to overcome the big loopholes which are very common in time travel films, but this film addresses these issues and discusses the ways of a paradox and how it's dangerous to change the past as it may cause danger in the future. WATCH IT! NOW!"

This was before he had any real power in the business; they said 'you will start on this date or we won't make the picture'. Michael Fox was not technically available, and Universal refused to shoot around his sitcom, so Bob cast Stoltz.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg then told Bob that there was a way to get Fox after all, which was to do this; don't give Stoltz any direction, print the least funny takes, and assemble a rough cut to show Sid Sheinberg and the Universal execs. It was a gamble he was sure would work - the execs would not be pleased, but they would be too far in to back out, and would then acquiesce to shooting around Fox's TV schedule.<br/><br/>To Bob's credit, he was uneasy with this approach, but it was a tough time for him. He was struggling with Bob Gale (who also wanted to direct), and going through a rough patch in his marriage, among other things.<br/><br/>I've kept my mouth shut over the years because this is how the business works- it's not for the faint of heart.<br/><br/>However, I find it a bit reprehensible that they are now making even more profit off this ugly little event by releasing the footage that by design was never meant to be good in the first place.<br/><br/>Harvey Keitel shot a considerable amount of Apocalypse Now, but why don't we see Francis Coppola releasing that footage?<br/><br/>Because he's got class. The one thing that all the riches in the world cannot buy."" ------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Whether the story's true or not, I still think no one could've been better as Marty McFly than Michael J. Fox, he's just too fun to watch.<br/><br/>I'd recommend it to anybody, specially anyone who liked ""Star Wars"", ""Groundhog Day"", ""Looper"", ""Wall-e"", or ""Jurassic Park""."

","Marty McFly (Fox) is the average American kid who loves skate- boarding, chasing girls and getting late to school. His father keeps getting bullied by his supervisor, Biff (Wilson), his mother is an alcoholic and his elder siblings don't seem to have any aim in life. He has be-friended the local crazy scientist, Dr. Brown (Lloyd) whom the entire town considers to be mentally unstable. Dr. Brown has managed to create a time machine by modifying a DeLorean which needs a speed of 88 mph before it can travel through time and which also uses Plutonium. Dr. Brown had stolen the Plutonium from the Libyans and whilst showing Marty the functioning of the device, the Libyans attack Dr. Brown and Marty manages to escape back in time to the year 1955. Since he was out of Plutonium, Marty could not go back to the actual year and hence needed to find the younger Dr. Brown and take his help in going back to the future. 1955 was the year when Marty's father George (Glover) fell in love with his mother Lorraine (Thompson) but sadly, Lorraine takes a liking towards Marty himself. Marty realises that if he comes in the way of his parents, he might alter the future altogether to the point that he himself would seize to exist. The movie is a hardcore science-fiction movie that is a complete entertainment package. Although the story and developments might come across as being clichéd, the movie has some very good twists and a gripping climax to make this movie a wonderful watch. Many sci-fi movies end up looking too cheesy because of bad execution of the 'futuristic technology' but this movie seems to pull it off with ease which looks believable even 27 years later. A brilliant movie and a must-watch."

It's about a character who begins with one view of his life and reality, and is allowed, through magical intervention, to discover another side of it.<br/><br/>Because the movie has so much fun with the paradoxes and predicaments of a kid meeting his own parents, I won't discuss the plot in any detail. I won't even get into the horrifying moment when Marty discovers his mother ""has the hots"" for him.

","Back to the Future's script, almost as much as its look, mark it as a product of the 1980s. Consider the Doc Brown of 1955, who, upon learning that his future self wears a radiation suit, concludes that the reason is ""all the fallout from the atomic wars."" By 1985, nuclear war was considered unlikely enough to be funny, but the memory of the fear of it was still near enough for audiences to get the joke. The characterizations in Back to the Future are also shaped by '80s sensibilities, not only in Marty McFly's slang-slinging, rock-loving, denim-clad teen, but in the different ""present day"" versions of his parents, George and Lorraine. In one timeline, the distinctly old- fashioned McFlys are at the mercy of a stylish, macho go-getter, while in a ""better"" timeline they are sporty and flaunt their economic status. Their success may well have been presented differently had the film been made 10 years earlier or later when the middle class ideal was something other than a track suit and a ranch house. The time capsule that is ""Back to the Future"" remains engaging and entertaining today partly despite and partly because of its clear position on our reality's timeline."

The dialogue was very funny and the film didn't stop me from laughing. I especially loved Dr Brown's character<br/><br/>For me, I would highly recommend this film to anyone. Its a great family fun movie and I absolutely love it!"

","""Back to the Future"" good film or astonishing film?<br/><br/>""Back to the Future"" is a film loved by many. Specifically, ""Back to the Future"" is exciting and adventurous. Moreover, it has great acting. Subsequently, the series of events was so good they had to make 3 movies to fit the whole plot of the story. ""Back to the Future"" is a brilliant movie.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, ""Back to the Future"" is extremely thrilling and venturesome. Presumably, the main characters Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) go back to the future. Accordingly, the main character, Marty McFly, goes to the past in a time machine made out of a DeLorean. Ultimately, he causes a lot of issues and starts to fade away. <br/><br/>Significantly, the main attraction that people look for in a good film is the acting. Furthermore, when the director of ""Back to the Future"" ( Robert Zemeckis), hired actors such as Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, Thomas F. Wilson and Claudia Wells, you won't get anything less than superior. Additionally, the characters in the movie do not leave in the second and third; each piece to the puzzle overlaps and you'll find characters in the same place that they were left in the very first film. <br/><br/>On the other hand, time travel isn't real and is initially impossible. Some may find it childish and absurd. Conversely, isn't that why people watch movies? To get the feeling that they went somewhere else; to feel as if they really preformed the action the character just attempted. ""Back to the Future"" is an adventure like no other and is suspenseful throughout the entire production. <br/><br/>Comparatively, most films have an easy plot and the story line is plain yet dull. However, ""Back to the Future"" is not like that at all. To demonstrate, the first movie of the series was spectacular. Initially, it had a great special effects and left you on a cliff hanger in the end when Dr. Emmett Brown says ""roads, we don't need roads"" and the DeLorean takes off into the sky. Henceforth, the characters go through three main settings; The Past, The Future, and The Wild West. The very end of ""Back to the Future"" is astounding and inspirational. <br/><br/>Predictably, I would greatly suggest seeing this movie. Therefore, are you into suspenseful adventures? If they are you're thing, I would say that you need to look into seeing ""Back to the Future"". Ultimately, you will not regret it and you certainly will love what you have seen."

","""Back to the Future"" is one of my all-time favorite films. It is one that the whole family can sit down and watch, but isn't one of those stupid childish animations that comes under ""family"" but is actually just for kids 2-8. It is one of the few films I never get tired of watching, and by now I must have seen it at least 50 times (no joke!). I've never gotten tired of this film as it is so original in the way it is presented. I've never seen another film where a DeLorean is a time machine, or one where a son is hit on by his mother for that matter... Anyway, this film is timeless, as it is so funny, clever, and you never know what is coming round the corner. The film is based in 1955, although it does start off in 1985. Marty McFly, one of the main characters, travels back in time and runs into his parents (George and Loraine), which starts off the whole story, involving a time machine, some messing with history, and pretty awesome music. This film is brilliant and gets an easy 9/10 from me!"

","This movie was my very first movie I have ever bought. I remember seeing previews for this movie when it came out in theaters. The line that was shot from the trailer was when Lorraine said, ""Isn't he a dream boat"". Til this day, I can watch this movie over and over again and I can say the next line. That is how well I know this movie. I would love to write the novel for this movie. That would be very interesting. The other two were also gems. Have all of them. Michael J.

","one of my favorite movies. well thought out and planned. I love Steven Spielberg. Micheal j fox was great. in the beginning I did not know if it was good or not but by the end I could not take my eyes off the screen. Overall excellent. It starts out with a boy named Marty Mcfly. He is friends with a some what crazy scientist named emit brown, doc who invites Marty to go see his latest invention. It turned out to be a time machine in a Delorean. doc gets shot by some terrorists who doc tricked. Marty gets in the Delorean and drives for his life. when the car reaches 88 miles per hour he goes back to 1955. The people back then got freaked out when they saw him. he found his dad first, found out he was a peeping tom, then saves him from being hit by a car. That was a big mistake. he was awakened by his mom who was attracted to him. He finds doc from 1955. Thats when he realizes that his mom is in love with him instead of his dad. he must fix that while he finds out how to get back to 1985. he makes his dad develop courage and punch the bully who has bullied him for his entire life. then doc figures out that when lightning strikes the clock tower. Marty gets through just in time. that is a small summary you will have to watch the whole movie to really get it. overall excellent, 10 of 10"

","How many movies can you honestly say you would never get tired of seeing? Most movies, no matter how notably excellent they may be, lose at least a little bit of their charm, their ability to thrill, when you've seen them a number of times. Back to the Future is one of those precious few movies for which the thrill is never gone. There's so much here. Action, adventure, humor, drama, romance. The story is fabulous. The performances are fabulous. The music is fabulous. Great characters, great dialogue, great effects. Pretty much great everything. And even if you know the movie by heart, and at this point I pretty much do, it doesn't get old. Not a bit. I'll go back in time with Marty McFly over and over again. What a fabulous journey Marty goes on. Lucky are we who are along for the ride.<br/><br/>The story is wonderfully simple and yet incredibly intricate. Teenager Marty McFly is sent back in time, from 1985 to 1955. In 1955 the most beautiful girl you'll ever see falls for Marty. Lorraine Baines is the dream girl any guy would fall in love with...if she weren't his mother. Yes, Marty's mom now has the hots for him instead of his father. Marty has prevented his parents from falling in love. If he doesn't fix that he will be erased from existence. Of course there is also the small matter of getting back to 1985. Thankfully Marty has a friend in 1955 who can help, Doc Brown. Marty and Doc, one of the great pairings in movie history.<br/><br/>The movie starts a little slowly as it sets itself up. But then Marty and Doc come together in that shopping mall parking lot and the magic begins. From the moment Marty hops into that DeLorean and revs it up to 88 this movie is sheer perfection. Michael J. Fox, playing Marty, is obviously the glue holding the whole thing together and he is magnificent. But Christopher Lloyd, playing Doc, may be most indispensable of all. Could there be any other Doc Brown? With gestures and reactions and facial expressions Lloyd brought this character to life in a way nobody else could. He can say it all without saying a word. Of course when he does say something that's memorable too. 1.21 gigawatts! If having the kooky Lloyd playing the exceedingly kooky Doc Brown weren't enough we also get Crispin Glover playing Marty's father George. Or would-be father once Marty screws things up. Glover is a performer quite unlike any other and he makes George his own. What a fabulous job he did. Thomas F. Wilson makes for a great villain with Biff, hated in two generations. And Lea Thompson as Lorraine? Now that's a girl worth getting run over by a car for. Thompson certainly looks the part of the dream girl but she proves to be much more than just a pretty face. Her performance is perfect. The sweet, innocent 1950s girl. Or is she really that innocent?<br/><br/>This is a story which had to be worked out meticulously and it was. Any missteps unravel everything. But at heart it's still rather simple which makes the story, and the characters, so easy to embrace. Director Robert Zemeckis tied it all together brilliantly. The story, the characters, the actors...it was a perfect storm which came together to produce true movie magic. This is a movie which is not just enjoyed, it is beloved. And it should be. What's your favorite Back to the Future moment? Is it one that makes you laugh? One that makes you cheer? Or one that makes you want to get up and dance? Go, go! Go Johnny go! Yeah, even the music in this movie is perfect as Marty desperately tries to get back to 1985. Ah yes, 1985, that glorious moment in time where if you wanted to put a really cool rock star in your movie you went out and got Huey Lewis. Everybody, Huey included, plays their part in this glorious movie. By the time the end comes, with one of the greatest closing lines in movie history because this movie is perfect right to the end, you want to stand and cheer. No matter how many times you've seen it. No matter if you're all by yourself in your living room. Stand. Cheer. You know you want to. And this movie deserves it."

","This ranks right up there with my favorite movies of all time. What a great time to be alive! This movie was done with style, and will always be the best sci-fi movie around. The acting is remarkable; Marty (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) are the standouts in the film. Fox does a wonderful job portraying the average 80s teenager, while Lloyd made his voice heard in his career best performance. As for Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson, they add another ring to the story, and give it comedy, a rare occurrence in science fiction. There are several things that I could note telling how good this movie was. The concept of traveling through time has never exactly done well in the theaters before, but ""Back to the Future"" worked, as did its sequels. The small things also made this movie what it is today, like how realistic the 1950s were. During those scenes, you can imagine it being a 50s movie done in color. Also, the usage of the Delorean seemed like the perfect car for the time machine. To sum things up, I quote Doc, talking about the Delorean used for the time machine. ""If you're gonna make a time machine, why not do it with some style?"" And that's exactly how Zemeckis made this fantastic movie, with style."

Michael J Fox became one of my favorite actors after this film and i followed his career into other films. The cast must've worked hard with several actors playing 2 parts and it finish's well to be open for the sequel. A superb plot which has a fantastic storyline and superb actors and it uses a classic Irish car in a Delorean. Robert Zemekis as director was fantastic and choosing Michael J Fox as the main lead was the best thing they could have done A fantastic film for all ages and i will be showing my kids this film when i have some.

","""Back to the Future"" is my favorite movie of all time. Now, in 2012, I'm 25 years old and I remember the day I saw it for the first time. I was seven years old and it was a rainy Saturday afternoon. In those cases, my parents used to rent a movie for my younger brother and me. And this Saturday, my mom came home with ""Back to the Future"". Maybe it sounds crazy or unbelievable, but I can recall the emotion I felt when the movie ended. It was like, deep inside, I knew that I had just seen a movie which couldn't fit any better to me as a person. It was like I knew that this movie instantly became my favorite movie of my life and in the years to come, there wouldn't be any movie which can do the same thing to me. Strange perhaps, that someone can 'link' a movie to one's personality. But now I don't know any other way to put it. ""Back to the Future"" is a gem.

"Desertman84","10","1","1","2 March 2012"," A Time-travel Adventure Film With An Unforgettable Spirit
","Back to the Future is a science-fiction adventure film. It was directed by Robert Zemeckis, written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale, produced by Steven Spielberg, and starred Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover and Thomas F. Wilson. The film tells the story of Marty McFly, a teenager who is accidentally sent back in time from 1985 to 1955. He meets his future-parents in high school and accidentally attracts his future mother's romantic interest. Marty must repair the damage to history by causing his parents-to-be to fall in love, and with the help of scientist Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown, he must find a way to return to 1985.<br/><br/>Contemporary high schooler Marty McFly doesn't have the most pleasant of lives. Browbeaten by his principal at school, Marty must also endure the acrimonious relationship between his nerdy father and his lovely mother (Lea Thompson), who in turn suffer the bullying of middle-aged jerk Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), Marty's dad's supervisor. The one balm in Marty's life is his friendship with eccentric scientist Doc, who at present is working on a time machine. Accidentally zapped back into the 1950s, Marty inadvertently interferes with the budding romance of his now- teen-aged parents. Our hero must now reunite his parents-to-be, lest he cease to exist in the 1980s. It won't be easy, especially with the loutish Biff, now also a teenager, complicating matters. Beyond its dazzling special effects, the best element of Back to the Future is the performance of Michael J. Fox, who finds himself in the quagmire of surviving the white-bread 1950s with a hip 1980s mindset.<br/><br/>Back to the Future cemented the box-office bankability of both Fox and the film's director, Robert Zemeckis, who went on to helm two equally exhilarating sequels. Performances by the earnest Fox, the lunatic Lloyd, the deceptively passionate Lea Thompson, and, particularly, the bumbling-to-confident Glover, who runs away with the picture, merrily keep the ship sailing.While Zemeckis is able both to keep the story moving and to keep it from going too far. He handles Back to the Future with the kind of inventiveness that indicates he will be spinning funny, whimsical tall tales for a long time to come.Inventive, funny, and breathlessly constructed, it is rousing a time-travel adventure with an unforgettable spirit."
"toll-8","9","1","1","22 February 2012"," Where your going you don't need any other film.
","Back To The Future was a film I grew up on. It is one of those that I always remember watching as a child and one that never failed to entertain me. I was completely shocked however when I watched it recently and couldn't remember most of it. That being said I was right in remembering one thing, it is a damn great film.<br/><br/>This is one of the only roles I really remember Michael J. Fox doing. Here he play Marty McFly, an iconic name to many out there today. He is a typical teenager, running late for school, eyeing up the girls and hating his family life. His father is a wimp, who is bullied by his boss, Biff and his mother is an alcoholic. His siblings also hold down poor jobs and aren't particularly lookers. Due to this Marty chooses to spend his time with Doc (Lloyd), a mad scientist who is planning an experiment at a shopping mall car park in the middle of the night and needs Marty's help to film it. The experiment is to do with Doc's latest invention, a time travelling DeLorean, much to Marty's shock and amusement. However during the experiment a group of Libyan terrorists barge in and shoot Doc for stealing their plutonium. Marty jumps into the DeLorean and drives at speed to get away but ends up blasting thirty years into the past.<br/><br/>Once in the past Marty comes across his parents, and accidentally prevents them from meeting, meaning his own existence would eventually cease to exist. He enables the help of the younger Doc who sets out on finding a way to get Marty back to the future whilst he must find a way to make his parents meet and have that all important first kiss.<br/><br/>The premise is fairly simple but has a lot of depth, the writing is just brilliant. The film drops in hints all over of everything that is going to happen. The opening ten minutes alone references the past constantly and ultimately sets us up for what is about to happen. Everything is sewn together at the end also and nothing is left loose, except for of course the very end but you will see for yourselves. All tiny plot lines are relevant and everything that is said has huge relevance, even the repetition of dialogue which mimics the characters in different eras of their lives. The dialogue at times is great and there is a fantastic reference to Star Wars and Star Trek. The writing, and the direction are a large reason to the great success of the film.<br/><br/>The acting is also a big reason. Fox is great as the teenager we all will on to win. He is a character we can all relate to and all want to be. Right from the offset we want Marty McFly to succeed. Christopher Lloyd is also great, it is as if the role was specifically designed for him. He plays the crazy scientist with ease and he is a lovable character despite his tendencies to do the wrong thing. Marty's parents (Thompson and Glover) are excellent, Glover maybe more so. They both portray the elder parents and the teenage versions of themselves as if they are the age of the role they are playing. In fact they are the same age as Fox and were cast based around the story in the past and made up for the story in the future. Glover is just brilliant as the bumbling nerd and the hair style just works on Glover and Glover alone. We also get a bully in Biff, played by Thomas F. Wilson, who is also so pivotal. The acting for Biff is also top drawer and you really do hate him.<br/><br/>The film has everything; humour, action, family fun, love, you name it, it has got it: even the creepy thunder storm and lightning strike. It will please any sort of movie fan whether it be the typical movie buff or the guy who only tunes in every now and again. It is a film not to be missed.<br/><br/>My slight negative about it though is the relationship between Doc and Marty within the past. In the present we really believe they are friends but they don't spend too much screen time together in the past and I didn't quite believe that they were going to 'miss' each other like they said they would. I would possibly have liked to have seen a few more minutes of them two together. Maybe that is just me but it is my only negative with the film.<br/><br/>I understand that this will probably make little sense. The referencing to past, present and future within this review is confusing. One thing I have thought about though is this: surely if you are watching the film Marty is always in the present? If there is a continuing time line on a constant loop will you ever be in the past or future? Wouldn't you just always be in your present? Just one to think about but do it before or after the film as it is one you just need to kick back with and enjoy.<br/><br/>4.5 / 5 <br/><br/>For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com"

","Back to the Future is one of the time travel movies that does things right. The story of the film is basically Marty Mcfly(played by Michael J.Fox) is living in 1985 and his friend Doc Brown(played by Christopher Lloyd) ,who is a mad scientist shows off his new invention: the time machine. Something crazy happens that causes Marty to go back to 1955 in Doc's time machine and is stuck in 1955, and to make matters worse, the time machine is broken! On top of that, he stupidly alters his future and prevents HIS OWN BIRTH! Crazy huh? But, its up to Marty and Doc(played by Christopher Lloyd) to not only get Marty back to his present time, but to also fix the wrongs he has caused to his future! I will not spoil this movie because you must go see this magnificent piece of film-making! The performances in this movie were all fantastic! Especially the best villain in that movie: Biff. He is a mean bully that picks on everyone and has the most hilarious lines in this movie!""Well look at what we have here."" Robert Zemeckis did a superb job in establishing the characters and the plot-line.Not to mention, its a blend of other genres besides time-travel. There is romance, high school, sci-fi and action all in one movie!WOW! Hoow did they manage to do that you may ask? Well, it just works because the script cleverly sets the movie up. Plus, the story runs very smoothly during transitions of scenes. Usually, when time travel is involved as a premise to a story, it would fall completely apart. But, thankfully they didn't do that! The story is actually not as complicated as people think. But, it does make your head spin of all the things going on in the movie! Its very consistent on switching to those scenes. Plus, the special effects were jaw-dropping back in the 80's but today it kind of looks outdated. However, this film has a charm that makes this film a spectacle in the time-travel genre. Now, what I liked about this film was the way the story was presented and the hilarious interactions between the characters:""Oh what are you looking at butt head?"" Oh and the special effects! ""If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 mph, you're gonna see some serious s**t!"" See I'm already quoting the movie, thats how good it is! That line always makes me think of BTF so much! But anyway, there is really nothing wrong with this film. Now, its not my favorite of the series.(OMG HOW DARE HE! HOW DARE HE SAY BTF IS NOT HIS FAVORITE!!!! TROLOLOLOLOLOLOOLOLOLOLLOL) Yes, it is not my favorite IN MY OPINION! However, this is a fantastic piece of work from Robert Zemeckis! As Doc Brown says:""If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything."" I have lived with that quote in my head in my entire life to never give up on what you fight for! Overall, I think this is a fantastic film in the time-travel genre and deserves to be on the IMDb Top 250 List! ""So, why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here!"""
"thegoods7","9","1","1","24 January 2012"," Still awesome
","This movie is magnificent. The directing and actor are superb. originally director Robert Zemeckis had chosen Eric Stoltz to play the part of Marty McFly and I think we're all glad that he then chose Michael J. Fox to play Marty instead. This movie really makes you pay attention to detail and takes you into the realization that Marty is hanging out with his parents when they were kids, and they play off that whole not fitting in with the time with his clothes and making the film funny by talking about him, his family, and the future. This movie shows something that everyone wants to do in their lifetime, which is time travel and this is a great way to show it. Back to the Future is definitely a movie that will never get old and will always be enjoyable."

","I haven't seen this movie in 27 years. I decided to watch it again after playing Back to the Future: The Game, which made me nostalgic.<br/><br/>As I remembered, it's a funny, entertaining, ingenious movie that never flags. But what I could appreciate now, since even after 27 years I remembered the story remarkably well, was how nicely constructed the movie was. Nothing in it feels like a coincidence, or like a stretch. Everything is put in place. Everything Marty needs is there, but there's a good reason. Every crazy event follows a logical chain of circumstances. The movie is not simply wonderfully filmed but wonderfully designed, an example of a movie where everything has been thought out and nothing fudged. Sure, the story has the sort of time travel conundrums that make all time travel movies susceptible to criticism for being ultimately impossible, but if you accept the basic sci-fi premises, everything else makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>If you've never seen it, watch it just for the entertainment. If you've seen it before, watch it again just to notice how nicely put together it is."

","As this is my first written review, I figured it would be a good idea to review something that is close to my heart. Nothing is more important to me than films, and no film is more important to me than back to the future. So you could easily say its one of the most important things in my life. Its that awesome. I plan to make a video review of it sometime, but I am new at that and don't want to make it any less than perfect.<br/><br/>I will never forget the first time I saw BTTF. It all started when my parents had their fancy dinner parties with their friends. As a kid those things a freaking torturous, so I usually spun out of there unless I was forced to stay. However I always enjoyed hearing about the movies that they remembered from ""the good old days"". One film they often talked about is Back to the Future and how much they thought I would enjoy it. So that intrigued me a lot. One day my mom bought the complete trilogy on DVD. I couldn't believe it, my mother had never boughten a film because she thinks its a waste of space. So I was in awe and I couldn't wait to watch it that night.<br/><br/>I don't remember all of the details of me watching it, I do remember looking at the clock 15 minutes later and saying "" what the heck, its been 2 hours""! For me it totally surpassed the hype and gave me the most entertaining experience of my life. I have a vivid memory of my mom telling me to calm down because I was quoting the movie up the butt. So now that I've built it up so much, why exactly do I like this film so damn much?<br/><br/>Im a junior filmmaker and often hear people say that the story is the most important thing in a film. There is no need to describe this story because if you don't know it, your probably living under rock. Suffice to say this film has such a great idea that is so easy to work with the lines practically write themselves. The whole idea of seeing your parents at your age is so universally funny that everybody can get the jokes. I seriously think this is one of the tightest screenplays ever. Everything is so tightly connected that I notice something new every time.<br/><br/>The character world is full of clichés. However this whole cast brings something amazing to each of their performances. However I always have to go back to Doc and Marty as 2 of the best characters ever. Marty has like the perfect wisecracking attitude and an all around lovable personality, and the Doc just spits out comedy gold throughout the entire film. Also nobody could ever forget Biff Tannen. You just love to hate him, you also love to love him. I mean, my god, they made some of best characters is history.<br/><br/>I usually don't get in to comedy movies because I often don't get in the movie, which makes it not funny. This movie had me laughing my butt(head) off. ITs just plain and simply and awesome and funny as heck script. Also who could forget all the classic lines in here. I honestly could quote lines from this for hours. It just plain old cracks me up.<br/><br/>I need to wrap this up because there is nothing I can say that will show the greatness of this film. I can say with pride that its my all-time favorite film. It may be cheesy, but I will cherish it forever. This a comedy, a romance, an action movie, and a high school movie all in one, whats not to love. So how bought you make like a tree and get out of here, and check out Back to the Future!"

""Back to the Future"" tells the story of Marty McFly, who accidentally gets transported into a time machine, built by a wacko-genius scientist named Dr. Emmett Brown, and accidentally gets sent into 1955, and interacts with his parents as teenagers. Know he must get his teen parents together before the space-time continuum can mean the end of the world, and he must get back home to 1985 quickly. Now, I'm a big fan of science fiction, and this movie is a gigantic time-travel masterpiece. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd both lead an all-star cast with incredible and hilarious performances. The cast also includes the many great performances of Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson, and Crispin Glover. Robert Zemeckis does an amazing job of putting the movie together, and he joins Bob Gale in writing a well-written tribute to science fiction. The sound is super and superb, the visual effects are groundbreaking, the cast is incredible, the soundtrack is awesome, the score is amazing, the characters are well-memorable, and everything about this movie makes me wait for more, and I'm always entertained by this movie, even when watching over and over again. ""Back to the Future"" is science-fiction genius, and it's one of the many groundbreaking cinematic achievements in history. ""Back to the Future"", in my review, ""an incredible science-fiction tale, filled with entertainment to enjoy""."

","With a gentleness delicately lying beneath a smart and intelligent script, contributing to this extraordinary appeal that transcends every age barriers, ""Back to the Future"", in the same vein than its glorious predecessor ""It's a Wonderful Life"", is one of these heart-warming masterpieces that definitely stood the test  of time.<br/><br/>There is Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd's improbably pairing as Marty McFly and Doc Emmett Brown, the cool 80's teenager and the mad scientist, yet the chemistry is here, and we believe that these guys can be great friends. There is this unforgettable sight of the De Lorean at 88 mph disintegrating in a flash of light, leaving the two unforgettable fire trails. There is this heart-pounding climax on the clock tower driven by Alan Silvestri exhilarating 80's-defining score. There is this heart in the story. As the pillar of the movie's greatness there is Bob Gale and Zemeckis' winner script.<br/><br/>""Back to the Future"" deserves its reputation as one of the most quotable films ever and with the richest gallery of colorful characters each one impacting our memories with so many delirious catchphrases, from Biff Tannen's ""Butthead"" to Marty's ""This is heavy"" and of course, Doc's hysterical ""1,21 Gigawatts!"" or ""Great Scott"". Christopher Lloyd has this unique talent to revive the mad scientist figure with a likable dimension, creating one of the most eccentric and sympathetic characters from the flamboyant 80's. But the power of the script doesn't just rely on its 'destiny' in one-liners, but in the way it rigorously respects the codes of every genre with a new remarkable technical precision.<br/><br/>""Back to the Future"" is a masterstroke of originality in the way it adapted the 'adventure' genre, where the exoticness of the setting doesn't rely on its geographical but chronological aspect. Marty lives in a weird world where people don't know what a Pepsi Free or who John Kennedy are, and where Ronald Reagan is still ""the actor?!"". The adventure aspect provides some of the best gags of the film. Now to the Sci-Fi, from the simple premise of the film: time travels, Zemeckis refreshed an old scientific speculation by introducing the notion of ripple effect, that the smallest change in the past can have significant consequences for the future, for the better or for the worse. Finally, a movie had the right approach to time travels, probably earning it a deserving place in AFI's Top 10 Sci-Fi films.<br/><br/>This scientific approach conditioned Marty's mission in 1955, by preventing his parents from meeting and falling in love, Marty unknowingly jeopardized his own existence and of his siblings. The script outsmarts us through its ability to convert one thousands words into one simple image, Marty's picture with his brother and sister and the progressive fading of their bodies, cleverly illustrates Doc's notion of ripple effect. No need of words, the picture is the materialization of the success or the failure of the mission. And as long as Lorraine (Lea Thompson), is in love with her future son, the existence of her future children with George is severely compromised.<br/><br/>What a tricky dilemma! And when you discover Marty's family in 1985, you wonder how such a loser as George McFly (Crispin Glover) could have had a woman anyways. And Marty made the thing impossible again by replacing his own father on his to-be mother's heart. And Lorraine, by falling in love with her own son, creates a whole oedipal situation that, beyond the laughs, offers a very interesting perspective on the perception we might have toward our parent's youth, as we finally realize that they were young once. Of course, no one would dare to question how he would react if his own mother fell in love with him, but the way this is handled in the film is tactful and never fall into caricature.<br/><br/>This is the very aspect that makes ""Back to the Future"" a Family Comedy, with a heart beating for every generation, a film you can enjoy with your parents your buddies or your kids whether it's from the 50's or the 80's nostalgic value. Most of the film's humor relies on the 'generation gap' factor and the way things have changed a lot or not so much. Compare Lorraine's advice to her kids in 1985 and the way she behaved thirty year earlier. See poor Uncle Joey who might get used to his bars as a baby, Biff Tannen's same stupid jokes etc. The film cleverly underlines the effect time can have on our perceptions and relationships with people. But the beauty of ""Back to the Future"" is that the heart of the Family story and the entertainment from the laughs combined with the speculative imagination of Sci-Fi contribute to a new inspirational dimension.<br/><br/>Time travels represent the final opportunity to domesticate time, and to get a second chance. George gets a second chance and Marty learns one lesson or two during his journey while applying the fatherly advice he gave to his own father. And even more powerful is the way George would ultimately be the one to win Lorraine's heart and not through Marty's intervention, proving that sometimes, a simple act of bravura can change all your life for the best. Similarly to ""It's a Wonderful Life"", the film is about getting a second chance, about life, about time passing  And I can't go on without mentioning the most extraordinary moment of the film that would eternally ring bells of joy in my heart when George finally kisses Lorraine and in all of sudden, Marty who was progressively fading gets up and sees his brother and sister finally reappear in the photo. Mission accomplished! <br/><br/>And two young people dancing, ignoring, but we do, that they'll be forever together. An extraordinary moment that for me, summarizes the cherished place this film will occupy in my heart, for a long ... time."

","I have lost count of the number of times I have watched Back To The Future - I even bought the trilogy box set! For me this first in the series will always remain head and shoulders above the other two.<br/><br/>Time travel movies tend to be complicated and often dull. You need to keep up with the plot and when things go awry, you can find yourself lost or just bored.<br/><br/>Not so with BTTF. Even now, 26 years on, I was still sitting on the edge of my seat as Marty and the Doc attempted to get the lightning strike just right - and I KNOW that it all works out in the end.<br/><br/>But that's the draw of this fantastic movie - it continues to thrill after 26 years! Even TV editing for content and character comments does not detract from the spirit of the movie.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","Back to the future stars Michael J.Fox as Marty McFly, a typical American teenager of the Eighties who accidentally gets send back in time by Doc Brown Played by Christopher Lloyd! This movie features time travel, comedy and Science fiction all put in one mix. One of the reasons i like this movie is for the pacing and plot. Nothing is filler or unneeded everything that happens affects something.The actors are absolutely perfect Michael J.Fox does a great job as the skateboarding guitar playing teenager that is Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd also does a great job as the scientist Doc Brown. The special effect looks good the acting is good the plot is nice and the music is good i highly recommend it!"

","Back to the Future is the one the best movie I've seen in my entire life! The main reason I liked it was the plot, characters, well everything! I won't reveal it since it's not fair to some people that have never seen it. For first timers: I guarantee you will not regret watching it and will want to see it, over and over again! <br/><br/>Even though it's been 25 years since they released it, the classic never died. Every time I watch it, the movie still feels like new! I once heard a rumor they may do a remake and they might use Bieber as Marty McFly (I pray to god he won't be in it!!). I don't want to see a remake happening, not just Bieber, because it destroys the classic. But that's just my opinion."

"axlrhodes","10","1","1","5 February 2011"," A sci-fi blockbuster light on sfx and full of character and plot.
","Robert Zemeckis' Back To The Future is a highly entertaining, well imagined classic of a blockbuster. The 80's spawned a rich variety of franchise films and the Back To The Future series can be considered one of the better ones. Central to the success of the film are the performances, this is a science fiction blockbuster relatively light on special effects and more concerned with character and plot. All the actors are great, Lloyd and Fox of course,but praise must also go to Crispin Glover who plays his wet blanketed nerd with a heart role to perfection. The script is sharp and the production design is outstanding with a picture postcard image of the 1950's well realised and the Deloreon time machine a great touch. Zemeckis' last film Romance In The Stone proved how well he could handle entertaining popcorn movies and he succeeds beyond expectation here with a highly energised, fun packed time travelling adventure to remember."
"Vyom3","10","1","1","20 January 2011"," Review for those who ask, ""whats so special in BTTF that redefined a Generation?""
","(This is my First review on IMDb. I had to write it for the sake of humanity and space-time continuum ;)<br/><br/>Theme & Genre: The first thing which strikes me in BTTF is the theme, which is by far the most puzzled idea ever conceived by human mind - ""Time Travel"". Every true science fiction fan (or for anybody for that matter) have always wondered, if he could change the past. What if he could visit the past and see what was it like to meet your parents when they were your age? Its a truly wonderful idea, and with all its anomalies and paradoxes, still never fails to amaze the audience with the possibilities. In Particular, BTTF cant be put into just one Genre. Due to Time travel, its Sci-Fi, but its comedy, Romantic, as well as, a thriller, with many hair raising experience. The beauty of BTTF is the combination of all these genre with an awesome fusion, without overdoing anything.<br/><br/>Story: The most important thing for a movie after the theme is its story. And it hasn't been compromised. BTTF part 1 has an exceptional story line, which only becomes more interesting in subsequent parts. Because of the time travel theme, you get to again witness a plot in part 2, that already had been happened in part1, which is why time travel is interesting, in the first place. (Even writing about it now, is giving me goosebumps.)<br/><br/>Effects: Imagine at a time sans GUI OS (Like Windows), how can you imagine the creation of a 3D holographic shark coming out at you, or a flying hover board, or a flying De-Lorean in the midst of air traffic... I could go on, but you got the point..<br/><br/>Music: Don't even get me start on this. But I want to :) The music is nothing short of epic. The grand nature of music, just compliment the grand nature of the plots. Romantic song, ""Power of Love"", a more superb romantic song ""Earth Angel"", the groovy ""Back In Time"".. and then the BTTF score by, the Outatime Orchestra, makes me feel like I am a part of something big, a part of the movie itself.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Well, everyone have a different taste, but I am talking about the movie, who have a fan base of more than half a million on a Facebook page alone. (as of the time at writing this review). A movie which has been released on Blue Ray on its 25th Anniversary, along with re-release in select theaters, and a movie which has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry! A movie which is timeless, which never gets old, no matter how many times you see it, that is, you had to had a taste in Sci-Fi though.<br/><br/>And to say, its just a movie which is ""25"" yrs old! For some, its more than a movie, its a genre in itself."
"joshuavogel79","10","1","1","11 January 2011"," The best movie of all time, ever.
","This is movie magic at its finest.<br/><br/>This movie is is fun, funny, captivating, enthralling, suspenseful and all around amazing.<br/><br/>Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox are perfect in this movie, and the supporting cast are spectacular as well. Huge shout out to Tom Wilson who plays Biff as well, for being the best movie bully of all time.<br/><br/>Now, this film- while being the best thing ever made- ever- is not without its flaws... the opening amp sequence is a bit goofy and out of character with the rest of the film, and Crispen Glover's performance may be too outlandish for some people (personally, I love him in this movie).<br/><br/>I'm not sure that this movie is going to stand the test of time- You may have had to live through the 80s to fully appreciate the contrasting attitudes and behaviors of Marty and the people of 1955. I think the film holds up fine right now, but I wonder in 20 years if people will still appreciate its subtleties. <br/><br/>In brief, this movie is the most fun thing I've ever watched. Perfect, happy, blissful escapism. Movie magic. Pure movie magic."
"rsashwinkumar","10","1","1","9 December 2010"," A perfect comic-caper
","After watching a horrible movie (I don't like to mention the name of that movie!), i saw (or enjoyed to be exact) this flick, and it completely changed my mood. It made me laugh and sustained the laughter throughout the film. Further, it made me watch the other two sequels, consecutively, and i completely enjoyed all the three parts!<br/><br/>The storyline is bizarre and different, and it gives enough room for the humor quotient to fill in. Writers Bob Gale and Robert Zemicks, have made sure that the film goes on at a brisk pace. The entire film makes u laugh, and enjoy thoroughly. <br/><br/>Speaking about the performances, Michael J. Fox, fits into the character of Marty like a 't'. His perplexed expressions are quite funny to watch, and tickles u. His confused looks, especially in the scene where his mother (in 1955), is about to fall in love for him, and the way he tries to dodge and escape her, deserve special mention. Christopher Lloyd is the man to watch out for; it is his body-language and performance which contribute to the humor factor mostly. His dialog-delivery, body- language, looks and expressions are sure to make you laugh!<br/><br/>The Background score by Alen Silvestri, is pretty apt, and especially in the climax scene, his background score maintains the pace of the film and keeps you engaging. <br/><br/>In a nut-shell, if you seek for complete enjoyment, and want to ache your own stomach, laughing, then Back to the future, is the one to go for!!!"
"mancunianfatman","Null","1","1","25 November 2010"," 25 years and still magical !
","25 years on, and back to the future is still seen as one of the best films to ever exist. And i completely agree, because this film is a masterpiece - yes i said it a MASTERPIECE!!! so is it as good as everyone says, oh undeniably , but just what makes it so dam good? well they have that catchy and nostalgic theme tune that just brings a smile on my face every time i hear it. They have the wonderful duo of Christopher Lloyd and Micheal J. Fox who are just hilarious together on screen, and then of course is the story.<br/><br/>To keep this really short and not spoil anything for those who have not (and should) seen this, the story is about a Young teenager Marty Mcfly ( Micheal J. Fox), who accidentally gets sent back to the past in the year 1955. he travels back in time in a delorean invented by the brilliant Doc Brown ( Christopher Lloyd). Marty must somehow find a way to get back to the year 1985 and try not to change the past for the worst. that is all i am willing to say because this really is a film you must see without not knowing whats going to happen.<br/><br/>I think my 2 favourite characters have to be the villain of the movie Biff ( played to perfection by Thomas F. Wilson) and Lorraine Baines ( played by the beautiful Lea Thompson). I Love Biff just because of how big a prick he can be but still funny and charming at the same time. I can guarantee that once you have seen this movie Biff Tannen will be on your personal list of favourite bad guys , because he's high up on the list on mine . I also love the innocent and sweet Lorraine Baines because.......well, because shes so gorgeous , absolutely stunning. i really like the character but in all honesty, iv always had a thing for Lea Thompson so thats probably why i like that character so god dam much haha.<br/><br/>So if you are unfortunate enough to have not seen this epic masterpiece then i advise you do. Robert Zemicks and Steven Spielberg have created a franchise that leaves a warm and happy feeling in the hearts of the viewers, which never leaves. The sequels are both just as good , as back to the future isn't just the perfect movie, its the perfect first chapter, to a perfect trilogy.<br/><br/>By Scott Dewhurst"
"Jules45","10","1","1","1 November 2010"," 25 years on and it could still teach so many films so many lessons.
","Back in the decade of 'In space no-one can hear you scream', Lightsaber swashbuckling Jedi and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger cradling that not so delicate pump-action, bad-ass necessity; it seemed only appropriate to throw time travel in the mix of a genre that was starting to expand more and more with some good ol' computer technology, which back then, didn't have to become the primary tool in a directors box of apparatus.<br/><br/>So when Back to the Future spurted the fiery paths of tire grinding, followed by a once handsome DeLorean turned four wheeled ice block, the questioned was: what made it so much different, better, cooler? Simply, whereas other sci-fi's that demonstrated so effortlessly the compulsive need to slap audiences jaw drop levels further down to the ground, explosion by explosion, Back to the Future arguably took a more humour through simplicity approach.<br/><br/>Example, body language. Nothing that will be spoilt of course, but the deliberate motions of characters (especially in the diner) can tell an audience all they'd need to know about a character, before their identity was fully revealed through this interaction. Funny, yes. But not till it scratches the surface more deeply do things start to get more than standard slapstick, especially where family is concerned.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean the film lacked, an albeit Michael Bay need for some wanted explosions and top techno talk to remind us throughout it was a sci-fi (""1.21 gigawatts? 1.21 gigawatts? Great Scott!""), and hadn't took the 'Humour of his mum fancying him' path too far and sloppily. If anything, science is more of a focus than anything else.<br/><br/>Not for the obvious fact it's a science fiction (Bravo) but more that Marty is as confused with 'Docs' long winded trails of scientific calculations with himself as we are. And ironically, he understands the ins and outs so easily his madness seems ordinary. It's all Marty's dumbfound confusion and the audiences comfort of knowing 'We never need to know what on earth a Flux Capacitor is so let's go along with it'. This all makes the baffling intellect more of a reassurance everything will work, rather than a panicky and frantic turn of heads to understand every little detail as to not get lost in its 'family friendly' plot. And that's what it's all about. It never needs to go into drawn out explanations that only scientific universities would host, it's a thrill ride, Marty's ride, our ride; with two more stops yet to go."
"Fields201","10","1","1","26 October 2010"," 1985 was a very good year
","""Tell me, future boy! Who was President of the United States in 1985?"" And Marty quipped, ""Ronald Reagon."" ""Ronald Reagon? The actor? Who was vice president? Jerry Lewis?""<br/><br/>Honestly, who doesn't love Back to the Future? I mean, seriously, who doesn't love Back to the Future? It's one of those rare movies that after you watch it, it just isn't enough, you have to watch it again. It's been 25 years later, generations had come and go, and even the new generation has fond memories of this remarkable movie.<br/><br/>I think a lot of it is in its plot device and imagination. The imagination is so deep that it's almost plausible that you can travel through time with a little plutonium and a flux capacitor at a speed of 88 miles per hour. It could work! But part of the fun is its whimsical charm, and the humor laced into a sort of innocence and lightheartedness felt throughout the movie. The plot alone required some tongue and cheek humor as we find Marty mistakingly going back in time to 1955 - accidentally running into his parents in the process - and discovers that he made a crucial error of taking his dad's place and subjecting himself to his mom falling head over heels for him. Because of this, he created a time paradox that if he doesn't bring his parents together, he will cease to exist. Not only that, but he has only one chance to get back to the future, or be stuck in the past forever.<br/><br/>As great as the plot (and especially the script) is, there is one vital importance to carry this film, and that is the performances. The Bobs made a wise decision casting Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly in just the way his mannerisms are, and how animated he is in his expressions. Just watch the scene in the beginning when Marty and Jennifer are outside Hill Valley, and Marty gets a hard on for that new truck. It's a scene that could bore you to tears but it was the writing and the performances that really put those finishing touches. To further demonstrate, just check out the scenes between Marty and Doc Brown (played brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd). Their chemistry together is like pancakes and syrup. Neither one of them steals a scene from each other, because they play off each other so well that they almost need each other to sell the scene.<br/><br/>As a kid I was inspired to go skateboarding after that scene where Marty outsmarted Biff and his gang on the streets of Hill Valley. To this day, it is a classic scene. But as an adult, I appreciated the action in the ending because of the cinematography. It felt like a terrible night from hell, even if the sound effects are a little outdated. The way everything went wrong and Doc managing to fix the situation in the nick of time that zapped Marty back to 1985. It was all breathtaking stuff, and accompanied by a brilliant score by Alan Silvestri and the wonderful direction of Bob Zemeckis.<br/><br/>I really can't give a high enough praise for this timeless film. Since 1985, a lot of the dialogue became catch phrases. ""Hello, McFly!"" was a common use of explaining someone was an idiot in my family. I think the world used that too. That might have explained Crispin Glover's lack of involvement for the sequels. I guess he wasn't fond of George McFly. Now that's heavy!"

The showing was awesome, there were so many other fans, there was clapping during just about every scene.<br/><br/>Now for the film. The film follows a really simple plot (which is rare for most time travel adventures). The jokes seem new every time I watch the film. They're always hilarious. And I have to credit the Amazing Cast and Writers for that.<br/><br/>For a Comedy, the movie packs a lot of suspense, the climax is beautifully put together with its race against time situation.<br/><br/>And what else can I say that hasn't already been said? The movie is one that every person in the world should see. It's really one of the Best Movies of All-Time 10*** out of 10***"
"s_daad","8","1","1","21 October 2010"," The definitive time travel adventure
","The secret of Back To The Future is its madcap pace. Any film about time travel must be like that, because any pause will expose the implausibility of it all, and that’s disastrous. The first Terminator couldn’t afford to stop anywhere because if it did the plot becomes laughable. Non-stop action is easier to handle than comedy, because with comedy you are always mired in the time-travel ramifications, instead of side-stepping it as they do in an action flick. It’s even more difficult for Back To The Future because it takes those ramifications head on. The hero has to save himself from non-existence after he has accidentally stopped his parents from meeting each other. So it’s not just pace that makes this film work, but also ingenuity. The plot is devilishly ingenious, and ingenuity keeps popping up in other forms too throughout the film, in cross-cultural references, in incestuous asides, in time travel in-jokes etc. it’s all helped by perfect casting and great performances, particularly Christopher Lloyd as the mad scientist Doc Brown, also good were Michael J. Fox, Lea Thomson and Crispin Glover. The cinematography is excellent too. Walking back in time appears palpable. The ending is lame, however. There was no need to have a significantly altered present when Marty comes back home. The whole point was not to change the present, so the film loses a lot of credibility here. But it doesn’t take away from the joyous ride of the last 2 hours. This film became one of the most popular films of all time, and it’s on the strength of its quality alone.<br/><br/>The only thing I don’t understand is why they decided to make a sequel. When I sat down to watch BTTF 2 I knew I was heading for a disaster zone. I mean, if it took so much effort and ingenuity just to suspend disbelief in the first one, it’s an impossible task to keep it going for two more films. Sooner or later we are bound to be troubled by plausibility issues, and that spoils everything. I was absolutely right, and watching 2 was depressing and excruciating. Mind you, I can’t commend the makers highly enough for trying, but what’s impossible is impossible. 2 contains an even more ingenious plot, but it still ends up as utterly ridiculous, and indeed becomes an insult to the first. The first allowed us to indulge in the fantasy of “what if”. The second has us tangled in a mathematical web of “ifs” and “thens”, and this leaves no scope for fantasy. Gems like Back To The Future need to be preserved from the contamination of sequelitis. But Hollywood is a place where money rules, so I shouldn’t be fussy."
"neil-476","10","1","1","7 October 2010"," Don't take any notice of me - see it if you haven't already!
","I have seen BTTF loads of time on the small screen but never at the cinema so, lured by the promise of digital remastering, off I went. The ads before the film were pin-sharp and very impressive. BTTF certainly looked good, but I didn't go ""Wow!"" at the image quality.<br/><br/>This hardly mattered. Despite its familiarity, BTTF sucked me in at the first frame and didn't release me until the very last. This is one of those films with a delicious concept and fabulous execution. It is not perfect, but it comes close.<br/><br/>If I had to come up with criticisms, the minor - very minor! - points I would raise are: <br/><br/>1. ILM's effects, just before the digital age, are still good but could be done better now (the first set of fire strips below Doc and Marty at the Mall, for instance). Likewise the facial prosthetics; <br/><br/>2. Crispin Glover's George McFly is a touch overcooked throughout most of the film. Not until the punch and afterwards does George convince; <br/><br/>3. The episode with Biff berating George in the McFly house in 1985 serves two purposes: it loads up material to be revisited later (when the dialogue repeats in the diner in 1955), but it also illuminates George's and Biff's character, and the relationship between them. The first 20 minutes or so is packed with details like this, and necessarily so, but not all of it is delivered gracefully under the guise of character exposition (the Peabody reference comes to mind, clumsily lobbed into conversation for no particular purpose, just to reference the name on the mailbox later on); <br/><br/>4. Having been stunned into open-mouthed disbelief at encountering younger versions of his father, mother, Biff, and Goldie(!), Marty doesn't register his grandparents with any sense of wonder, and this doesn't ring true (he would have had some sort of reaction whether they were still alive in 1985 or not).<br/><br/>I'm nitpicking. This is a great, great film - sheer entertainment from start to finish."

","One evening, during my early teen years, I turned on the TV and watched the 1985 classic 'Back to the Future', and my only regret is that I hadn't seen it earlier...<br/><br/>The film tells the story of a skateboarding, guitar playing teenager named Marty McFly (played by Michael J Fox) whose life is far from perfect. That is until his eccentric, scientist friend Doc Brown (played by Christopher Lloyd) builds a time machine and sends him back to 1955. From there the movie really accelerates into exhilarating fun that get more complicated as it goes on but will keep you entertained until the very end.<br/><br/>Pretty much everything about 'Back to the Future' works from the interesting characters, to the clever humour, to the magical experience of going back in time. But without giving too much away, I'm going to let you go see it for yourself. A well worth purchase and a classic for generations to come."

","Back to the Future isn't just a fantastic sci-fi. It is also a funny comedy, a high school movie, and an action movie. This film takes all these genres, puts them together, and makes a classic. There is so many famous lines in the movie that everyone can have their own favorites. There isn't one joke that falls flat, and there is multiple side stories to it. There is the main story of Marty trying to get back to 1985, the story of him trying to get his parents together, the story of Biff Tannen the bully, and many more. All these side-stories are either predictions in 1955 of what 1985 will have, or they add tension. Marty has to take care of all these problems before he can go back to 1985. Due to the fact that he only has a certain amount of time to do these things tension builds in the climax. It is a great movie, and one of the best of the 1980's.<br/><br/>4 stars out of 4"

","Well, at this point in time, what more is there to say? When Back To The Future first came out in 1985 I saw it three times at the cinema. Back then it blew my mind and it still does. Great special effects, a brilliant score by Alan Silvestri and great costumes. You couldn't imagine any other actors in this. Michael J.Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson and Tom Wilson are all fantastic. Some people tell me it looks dated now because of the 1980's costumes. My reply is ""That means the 1950's costumes must as well"". If you excuse the pun, this movie is timeless. I've seen this dozens of times and will continue to in the future. Steve Rice."
"The_Depressed_Star_Wars_fan","10","1","1","13 June 2010"," One of the Best Science Fiction movies out there.
","This is a great movie, pure and simple. The story is brilliant. Marty McFly gets into a time machine, made out of a car, and created by a man named Doc Brown. As soon as he gets into the car Doc. Brown is shot by people with guns, in a hurry Marty gets into the car and drives away, but because of the fact that it is A TIME MACHINE! He is sent back to the 1950's. He ends up accidentally stopping his parents from falling in love, the Doc Brown of the 50's tells Marty that he must fix them up, of he will cease to exist. The lines and characters of Marty, Doc Brown, and Biff are very likable and-or memorable. Some of the lines that these 3 characters say are some of the most memorable lines. Since ""No Luke, I am your father."" The acting in this motion picture, although not Oscar worthy, is in fact fact great. Michale J. Fox and Christopher Loyd give good performances as Marty and Doc Brown. The best part about this movie are the effects. They are beautiful. Sure today they are not mind blowing, but still good. Now time to wrap this up. So in the end this is a very good Sci-Fi flick, and I recommend it heavily."

","Anyone who lives on the planet Earth has got to love this film. It's one of the the greatest sci-fi classics of all time. Director Robert Zemeckis, along with producer/director Steven Spielberg, and many other great movie makers, invent the greatest comedy of all time.<br/><br/>However you look at it, whether as an action film, a comedy, a sci-fi, or whatever, it will look excellent no matter what. The effects and sound effects are spectacular, but the hook into the film are the hilarious and lovable characters, the terrific performances, and the editing job put into the film. The story is one of the greatest screenplays ever.<br/><br/>Marty Mcfly is an average teen in 1985 whose friend, Doc Brown, invents a time machine out of a Dolorian. Marty accidentally activates it while running from terrorists, and travels to the year 1955, where he meets his parents-to-be as teens, screwing up their first meet. On top of getting them back together, he teams up with the past Doc Brown to fix the time machine to be able to send him back to his time period. The conflicts and plot of the story are all spectacular and work brilliantly to the core.<br/><br/>Has tons of laughs along the way. The doc, played by Christopher Lloyd, is without a doubt the best character. His crazy scientist ways will have your gut busted with laughter. The clever irony works terrificly as well, especially with scenes with Martie's teen parents. Conflicts arise, and the film gets more and more entertaining by the minute. Another great character is Biff, who was an old bully of Martie's dad, who becomes one of the main antagonists in the film, as he plans to take Martie's mom, and dispose of Martie's dad. Although he's evil, he still makes you laugh hard.<br/><br/>Ends happily, but without spoiling anything, its a simple masterpiece that must be seen."

","this movie is my all time favorite movie. 2 and 3 are great movies also. Michale J. Fox does a fantastic job as Marty Mc.Fly. and Christopher Lloyd does a fantastic job as Doc. Brown. SPOILER ALERT: the plot is that Doc.Brown invented a time machine out of a car. he then gets shot. Marty then mistakenly goes back in time to 1955. he meets his father and mother. his mom falls in love with him instead of his father. now he has to get them to fall in love or else he won't exist. and he still needs to get back to his time. the theme song is fantastic. everything about this movie is fantastic. none of my friends saw it. so if you've been looking for a good sc-fi action comedy look no further. that's about all i have to say."
"khanbaliq2","9","1","1","27 April 2010"," Back To The Future accelerates with wit, ideas, and infectious, wide-eyed wonder.
","I wasn't excited to review Back To The Future because it has become a very popular film, but, after watching it again, I took out my pen and some recycled paper to get it over with. Before writing my review, I read and watched a number of materials about the making of the film. In my opinion, Back To The Future is one of the best science fiction films, even if it is a product of a big Hollywood studio (in this case Universal Pictures). It's one of the founding films in the special effects action blockbuster genre, though few of its successors have half its wit, charm or grace. The entertainment industry now realizes how important it is, and, therefore, the film has been promoted in the media and at conventions. But that's fine. I like it too. So, why do many people like Back To The Future? Firstly, it's an entertaining science fiction comedy. Secondly, its message of changing one's life for the better with a courageous act appeals to the masses. Thirdly, it's a well-cast and well-made 1980s movie. Back To The Future is simply pleasant to watch. Americans can watch it and be reminded of better times - the 1980s and especially the 1950s. Robert Zemeckis directed two good films before Back To The Future - the comedies Used Cars (1980) and Romancing The Stone (1984). In Back To The Future, Zemeckis demonstrated his technological savvy and attention to detail. The DeLorean DMC-12 time machine looks fantastic. The car was chosen because its design made the gag about the family of farmers mistaking it for a flying saucer believable. When it comes to the excellent cast, the friendship of Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) works very well. It's entirely believable, and it works even better in the sequels - Back To The Future II (1989) and Back To The Future III (1990). The eager, likable Fox is actually good when it comes to the comedy. Also, his upbeat approach to his roles made him perfect for the part of Marty. Lloyd, as the irascible, sardonic Doc Brown, offers sterling support. Another excellent performance is by Crispin Glover as George McFly, the cowardly, nerdy father of Marty. In fact, Glover's performance may be the most effective in the film, and he's funny when it comes to George's nerdy mannerisms, such as his shaky hands. Lorraine Baines-McFly is actress Lea Thompson's most famous role. Zemeckis wanted her for the part after he saw her in The Wild Life (1984), opposite Eric Stoltz. Stoltz played the part of Marty before Zemeckis determined that he had been miscast. It turns out that Thompson is good at impressions. I found her body movements and facial expressions interesting as she played the somewhat shy 1950s teenager Lorraine. She's especially effective in the second half of the film. In addition to the lovely plot and perfect cast, Back To The Future features a wonderful music score by Alan Silvestri. The rock band Huey Lewis and the News provided two catchy songs - The Power of Love and Back in Time. So, there's a lot to like about the film. It's an appealing slice of bourgeois Americana. I have a few issues with its messages, but I definitely recommend it."

","'Back To the Future' is about young Marty McFly. He has a friend the Doc who has built a time machine out of a DeLorean.Marty's father George has been bullied from his schoolyears to his adulthood by Biff Tannen (Just occurred to me that the relationship between Marty and his father George is a little like James Dean and Jim Backus in 'Rebel Without a Cause' with a comic slant!)Doc's time machine takes Marty back to 1955 to resolve the situation with his father as well as other issues.When I first saw the movie I remember feeling alienated by the first couple of scenes with regards the problems in Marty's family life -- it is pretty grim .It is a brave move by Robert Zemeckis to start this blockbuster in a low key way.From then what we have is a very clever movie indeed with great action and comic moments .The great thing is that the story is foolproof and I especially liked the fact that if Marty doesn't do certain things he will erase his family's past.The performances are uniformly excellent --Michael J Fox is an expert comic actor brought in from Family Ties to replace another actor at a moments notice -- he is nothing short of superb - he effortlessly delivers his comic lines and is also good in moments where he portrays his frustration at his father and his strength in standing up to Biff.Lea Thompson is Marty's mother bringing a quite a nice dimension in the opening scene in her romantic memory of meeting George and then is beautiful as the younger version of herself.Christopher Lloyd has a difficult task as the Doc -- he in more ways than one drives the movie -- imagine Ben Kenobi as a mad professor!It has a great script and funny lines throughout and it is hateful to single someone out from this whole creative brilliance -- the cherry on the cake has to be Crispin Glover as George -- his performance is a thing of comic beauty --unforgettable! as is this brilliant --brilliant movie."

","Back to the Future could just be one of the most perfect movies ever made. I'm not one to bash other people's opinions, no matter how much I disagree with them, but I can't understand how you can't like this movie. Maybe think it's overrated, but if you live on this planet, you should like this movie. It isn't my favorite movie of all time, but I can find more flaws in movie's I like more than this.<br/><br/>Really, all I can do is nitpick the movie, like how Biff is more of a serial killer than a bully, but what would be the point, it would still just be nitpicking. So yes, it does have some small flaws, but that doesn't stop the movie from being a masterpiece.<br/><br/>OK, the good stuff now, first, there is something in this movie for everyone. It has comedy, it has romance, it has science fiction, it's a high school movie, there isn't much action, but that skateboard chase is pretty awesome. So basically if you want any of those types of movies, you will get it with this film.<br/><br/>The characters are so much fun, and very memorable. Marty is extremely likable, Doc is hilarious, Biff is such an asshole yet you still can't help but enjoy him, Lorraine is hot, and George has some great moments. And I love the story, time travel is one of those things that has been around for years and will never get old. Everything works, and I love the little background jokes it does, like how Marty meets Doc at the Twin Pines Mall, goes back, knocks down a tree, and comes back and it's the Lone Pine Mall.<br/><br/>The special effects are great, it's funny as hell, and it's just a lot of fun to watch. It really is one of the most perfect films ever made, the only way to criticise the film is to nitpick, and if you have to do that, then is there really any point in criticising at all?"

","1986 may be the month of July when i was at vacation form my school my bros brought this film home. For the first time i saw Michael.J.Fox , at that time i enjoyed the movie but not that much until when i turned 18 this very same movie was aired on a local channel here in my home town Lahore-Pakistan. At time i was able to understand the subject matter of the Hollywood movies better. That was so funny and also enjoyable watching but imagining your self traveling through time to same place and location where you belong 30 years backward the time in which you don't even exist. Then suddenly you happen to meet your own father who is same old you are now (shocking to unbelievable extant) than ending up inside a home being unconscious lights turns on , a young lady taking care of you sits in front of you ,you scream and become speechless because she will give you birth as your own mother. Meeting than your own grand parents and also meeting especially your youngest maternal uncle who is just a baby but in the future he will become a symbol of humiliation for whole family. Michael.J.Fox now tries to bring closer his parents together , but in a new manner as his future father is quite a weak personality and under confidant ,his mother was inside regretting her decision of marrying him ,another problem is their course met who is after her mother he is kind of jerk and also want to be dominating as his ancestors. But the most funny thing is that his mother falls for him (her own future son she does not know yet). On the other hand i found the most funny but cute character Christopher Lloyd the man who invented the time machine, he introduces Michael Fox to the machine(another funny thing , his dog name is Einstien). My whole family and circle of friends admired it very much and even it became popular in our country(it was also presented in theaters in 86-87), some people here were wondering is it possible. In the future it could be but it demands a lot of energy of solar stars ,BBC once predicted in sci-fi program hosted by X-files Gillian Anderson But it will take years maybe centuries till then keep on enjoying and imagining such cute fantasies."

","Marty McFly (Fox) is sent back in time to the year 1955 where he must make sure his parents meet and fall in love, otherwise his existence is in danger.<br/><br/>This renowned Oscar winning sci-fi has everything you need for a entertaining viewing, whether with family or a quiet solo night in. Action, comedy and adventure this ticks all the right boxes and is a film we can look at and say is a fine depiction of time travelling mischief and bravery.<br/><br/>There have been numerous films to attempt to unravel the complexity of time travel. From The Terminator to the Butterfly effect we have robots and unexplained seizures telling a theory on how travelling through the void can happen.<br/><br/>In this 1985 release the complexity of the lexis is weighed down to a comedy level to fit the mood of the moment, and through the wonderfully buoyant Emmet Brown we see his theory of the flux-capacitor and the use of plutonium to achieve the unachievable is brilliant appreciation of the target audience. There is no over the top scientific knowledge as we take Dr Brown as he is an overly knowledgeable protagonist, and doesn't Christopher Lloyd do well? The star shows a very eccentric style to portray a subtle madness and delicious exuberance to deliver one wonderful mad scientist that gives the film, and trilogy, its main source of comedy and resourcefulness.<br/><br/>Lets not forget Michael J Fox in arguably his most profound role from his illustrious career as the unbelievably cool teen who gets wrapped up in events. Fox's appreciation for cool is never over the top and fits even today's modern teenage stereotype. But to associate him with today would be unfair. He is way too cool for any kind of label. He skateboards, he has an attractive girlfriend, he plays the guitar and drinks Pepsi, what more can you say? He is the coolest kid in time.<br/><br/>Whilst the plot is easy to enjoy and relaxing unconditional fun there is a level of importance of attention to be maintained as the plot's intention of science bases itself on a few key rules. Such as what can alter the future, saying the wrong thing and the difference from the present and the future. All run however thoroughly and with plenty of zest and humour to satisfy any viewer's entertainment requirements.<br/><br/>The opening sequence with the clocks is fantastic panning and good timing (no pun intended) as Marty enters and blasts the stereo. This sets the tone for the coolness of the main character and builds everything around the complexity of time.<br/><br/>This really is fantastic fun with wonderful characters and a springy adventurous minded script that never hinders on the past, not literally obviously. Parts II and III are well balanced fun, but this was where it all started and what a fantastic beginning it was"

","Back to the Future is a film that for people of my generation would have growth up with, along with other important films like the original Indiana Jones films, Stars Wars trilogy, the first two Alien films, the Rocky Series and Mad Max 1 and 2 (just to name a few). Here is a fun family film that has stood the test of time.<br/><br/>Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), is a 17-year-old teenager living in Hill Valley, California. He has a loving family, a good girlfriend and helps a mad scientist, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). But he lives in a geeky family, his dad George (Crispin Glover) is bullied by his supervisor and avoids confrontation, his mum Lorraine (Lea Thompson) has conservative values and doesn't like Marty's relationship with Jennifer (Claudia Wells), and Marty's brother and sister are generally geeky. One Dr. Brown, aka 'Doc', asks for Marty's assistance and records the experiments with his next invention, a time machine (in the design of a DeLorean DMC-12). The test seems successful until Libyan terrorists kill 'Doc' and whilst on the run Marty ends up travelling back in to 1955. Whilst in 1955 Marty meets both his mum and dad as teenagers, and interferes with how they met. By doing this he messes up the time-space continuum and risks his own existences. The younger version of Lorraine falls for Marty, not know he is her future son; adding both to comedy and general creepiness. It's a race against time, both to get back to 1985 and to insure destiny is fulfilled by his setting up his parents.<br/><br/>Back to the Future is a family sci-fi comedy which is a symbol of its time. It works as a fish out of water comedy, teen comedy and a general look at time travel. They is a simple plot and theme about Marty finding out who his parents are and looks at the similarities and differences of live in the 50s and 80s. The aim of the filmmakers was to make a fun film, and Robert Zemeckis does this. He is a protégé of Steven Spielberg and he keeps the story simple and entertaining. He also shows his skills as a special effects director which in this film were very good. The special effects help the story, but don't overshadow it. They is a very good script to this film, mixing drama and comedy, and hasn't dated badly. The film is humorous and light-hearted. The humour is not crude, like it it in some family films. There is a strong story and with good messages for kids about standing up to bullies and respecting your parents. Michael J. Fox was perfectly casted for the lead role and there are many excellent supporting cast members. Lea Thompson was perfectly pretty as Lorraine and Crispin Glover was fine as a needy kid. Christopher Lloyd and Thomas F. Wilson were really excellent as the mentor and the villain.<br/><br/>Back to the Future is an influential family film. It is a mark of pop-culture with this movie being parodied in Family Guy and Futurama. It is Robert Zemeckis' best film (though Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a close second)."
"Sirus_the_Virus","10","1","1","3 August 2009"," Obviously one of the best films ever.
","The original Back to the future film was definitely the best in the series. It's even on my top five list. Back to the future is cute, funny, and an obvious classic. I know most of us have seen them, but i'll say what it's about. This is the first of three Back to the Future films. Marty Mcfly(the great Michael J. Fox) is a teen with boring parents, and a boring life and he has a girlfriend. His life is turned upside down when his friend Dr. Emmet Brown(the great Christopher Lloyd)shows him a delorean. Which is actually a time machine.That's where the entire trilogy began and the films continued after that. I love every Back to the Future film. I like the original the most, then I like parts II and III equally. The Back to the future films are nothing but fun and they're great movies. This is definitely Robert Zemekis's best film to date. He's done other great films like Romancing the stone, Beowulf, and Death Becomes her. Not one of the Back to the future films has any weakness. Back to the future is a film that should never be remade or anything. Knowing the world today, if they did remake it, then they would cast Shia Lebeouf as Marty. Michael j. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are irreplaceable. Don't remake it."

","One would have thought that a film made almost twenty five years ago about somebody travelling back in time thirty years would have dated terribly but it seems just as fresh now as when I first saw in on betamax all those years ago. I'm sure people will be enjoying it for decades to come.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox will almost certainly be best remembered for his role as Marty McFly, the eighties teenager who accidentally travels back to 1955 in a converted DeLorean. While much of the humour is derived from the differences between the two eras that isn't over done and it doesn't get in the way of the main plot. Not only must Marty enlist the help of his friend Dr. Brown to get him back to 1985 he must get his parents to fall in love all over again because he accidentally stopped their first meeting. This problem seems to be greater than time travel as his father is the school wimp who is constantly being harassed by the school bully Biff Tannen and his mother has fallen for him.<br/><br/>The supporting cast do a great job too, especially Christopher Lloyd is the archetypal mad scientist Dr Brown and Lea Thompson as Marty's mother who is rather prudish in the eighties but clearly knew how to have a good time when she was a teenager.. much to Marty's surprise. In a time before everything was done with CGI the effects are great and not overused. I'd recommend this film, along with its two sequels to anybody with a sense of humour."

","What teenage boy didn't want to be Marty McFly (Fox) if they grew up in the 80s? I certainly did. He had it all: someone he loved and loved him back, a best friend that could literally send him on adventures, played guitar in a band, a carefree spirit – using vehicles to accelerate his skateboarding, including a cop's and to be able to time-travel – catching his parents in future lies. I grew up on 'Back to the Future'; I must've watched it 50 times as a kid, never knowing I was taking for granted how much this comedic adventure masterpiece was completely unique and rarely a movie such as this comes around. Watching this now, having watched 1000s of movies since its release 24 years ago, I appreciate it all the more. The movie has great, pitch-perfect lines/comedy, extreme adventure, a heart, still well-made special effects and it certainly reminded me of how great movies used to be made: pre-CGI. Nothing against CGI, a lot of movies today benefit from the effect, but you have to appreciate the 50s town they recreated to scale, making me believe I was there. Marty accidentally gets sent back to 1955 by his best friend (played perfectly by Christopher Lloyd) Doc Brown and after a few scenes to convince him he's really back in time, he seeks the aid of Brown to get, well, ""back to the future."" At the same time, its damage-control with the paradox he creates that almost erases his own existence. Sure, it had minor flaws: Fox definitively didn't look like a teenager in the sequels –he barely pulls it off here and of course there's the typical 80s numerous product placements, down to the DeLorean itself – ironically, not enough to save the doomed car. Still, an absolute must-see."

He has to fix his mistake or else he may be wiped out from existence.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis was the perfect man to direct this film. In it, I couldn't help detecting some of the spirit of Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (one of my favourite movies). This movie can be thrilling or exciting, but the key element throughout is fun. This is simply a fun film to watch. Cultures from the 80s and 50s clash, Marty discovers his prudish mother was once a teenager like him too, and in general, the film proves to be enjoyable.<br/><br/>The film's music (a fantastic score composed by Alan Silvestri) really epitomizes the spirit of fun that permeates the film. Its triumphant tones at certain key moments are not obtrusive; instead of adding to the awareness that one is watching a movie, it seems to engross the viewer even more.<br/><br/>I will freely admit that the film's outcome is evident from the very beginning. However, the road that takes the audience there is full of fun, unexpected twists and turns.<br/><br/>The Verdict: Plain, old-fashioned fun, and it can be the topic of discussion for hours (although I've avoided it here for spoiler purposes).

Now, trapped in time, Marty has to find a way to get back into his own time. There's more elements to the plot, but I don't want to spoil the entire movie for you. Most people have probably seen this movie at some point in their life, but if you haven't, it's a must see. It has everything you could want from a movie: comedy, action, suspense, and great special effects for it's time. I love Back to the Future.

","I first caught Back To The Future when i was very young, one Christmas at home. I was only born in 81, so i was hooked from early childhood.<br/><br/>I have to say that i never have got bored of this film, no matter how many old VHS tapes i wore out through watching. With the sound off i could tell you every word, and hum along to every tune.<br/><br/>The combination of Lloyd and Michael J Fox is inspired, with the youthful cheek of Marty and the crazy flare of the Doc. Every scene is full of rich acting, maybe not the heavy Oscar winning performances, but i think better, in that it just feels real. I will never get tired of how Fox can act so naturally.<br/><br/>Another element for me is the iconic Delorean, being a car fan i think its a great choice, and at about 5 years old it just looks amazing! I have read one of the early release scripts from about 84, where the Delorean was going to be an RV, and the Doc was a womaniser. I'm very glad it did not come out that way.<br/><br/>It is also one of just a few films unspoiled by its sequels, even if II did loose a little in story depth, III helps to just bring them all together.<br/><br/>Just thinking about it now, I think i'll have to break out the DVD box set."

Great catchy, well varied songs that make you feel what the characters are: Earth Angel and Johnny B. Goode come to mind. 9/10 <br/><br/>It's rare to have memorable characters in film since little details get washed over, but BTTF's plot is highly character based, which works in being entertaining as well as informative. You'll remember all the names of these characters. 9/10 <br/><br/>The plot itself is quite simple, but well executed. It's fun with all the different genres. 7/10 <br/><br/>The acting is excellent. Chris Lloyd's performance is very over the top and eccentric, but memorable all the same. Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson's performances are very honest and moving. 9/10<br/><br/>In terms of entertainment I find all the foreshadowing (1985) a little dull, but it's impossible to delete it since it introduces all the characters. The script is very tight and well written, the tension builds as the film goes along.<br/><br/>I've watched this a few times so I'd say the re-watch value is very good."
"Science_Fantasy_Guy","10","1","1","21 April 2009"," Timelessly hilarious, charming and adrenaline-pumping: a blockbuster for the ages.
","As you probably could've guessed from my username, Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future is one of those very special and rare movies that I would defend vehemently. One of the most inventive, adrenaline-pumping, amusing and eye-popping movies of all time, and one that's completely devoid of pretension, pomposity and self-consciousness, Back to the Future is a film that never fails to leave me feeling like I'm on Cloud Nine. Here's why.<br/><br/>The year is 1985. Rebellious Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox, a last-minute replacement for Eric Stoltz, who failed to exude the laidback charm Zemeckis wanted the character to have) lives in the quaint (and fictional) Californian town of Hill Valley, where he has a beautiful and supportive girlfriend named Jennifer (played by Claudia Wells). Marty despairs of his alcoholic mother Lorraine and pushover father George (Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover) and thus spends most of his time hanging out with Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), a goofball scientist who, as it turns out, has just invented a DeLorean time machine (the time machine originally was intended to be a refrigerator, but Zemeckis changed it to a car because he worried that after seeing Marty walk through a refrigerator kids would follow suit). During a test run, however, Marty is accidentally sent back to 1955. Now, whilst trying to get back to the future, he encounters run-ins with his father's lifelong bully Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) and must somehow make sure his parents-to-be meet and fall in love – which is not as easy it sounds when Lorraine falls head over heels in love with him.<br/><br/>There is no department that makes a false move on this film. Firstly, the cast dynamic is flawless: Fox's Everyman affability has never been put to better use, Lloyd enjoys what is unquestionably the defining role of his career as the nutty scientist, Thompson and Glover revel in playing Marty's parents as teenagers and adults in middle-age, and Wilson brings menace and later even a little accurate lowliness to his role as the pathetic bully who finally gets his comeuppance. Technically, Back to the Future has aged like wine as well: the art direction is effective in its subtlety and accuracy to '50s culture, the editing is swift, but not to an extent that you can't make out everything that's happening on-screen, and although there aren't as many of them as you'd think given the type of film this is, the special effects are still superb by today's standards. Alan Silvestri's jazzy, electronic score is yet another element that raises the excitement enormously.<br/><br/>But at the end of the day, this really is Bob Zemeckis' show. Firstly he and Bob Gale co-wrote an ingenious screenplay so bursting with invention and peppered with sparkling humour (see the 1955 dinner scene, most notably) and heart that the years have done nothing to lessen the sense of wonder it brings. Secondly, his direction of Back to the Future is perfectly executed, especially for a blockbuster (and even I must admit to having a love/hate relationship with blockbusters sometimes): Zemeckis' directorial effort here is energetic, slick, cunning and fast-paced in the action scenes and cleverly subtle in the slower moments, his passion for the story apparent in every frame. Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich, leave the blockbusters to the true masters and stop embarrassing yourselves.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future, one of the highest-grossing films of the '80s and a film that continues to have a huge impact on popular culture and film-making to this day, is a spectacular blockbuster that flawlessly combines dazzling and incredibly exciting action sequences with a sweet thematic centre that never ventures into cheesy territory, all the while being laced with wickedly funny humour. It's a film that, like very few of its contemporaries, has managed to avoid developing a negative reputation due to its large-scale success and continues to enchant new legions of young movie fans as well as remaining an all-time favourite of many older movie fans, and it will continue to do that for many years to come."

","Back to the Future, starring Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, Tom Wilson, and Claudia Wells was great. The director (Robert Zemeckis) and actors were dynamic. The writers (Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale) cooperated really well. When this movie came out in 1985, it was a huge blockbuster. It was the initial movie in the series of three. It covers many genres. This film wasn't adapted from a book. It was actually written in the writers' own words. Here's how I found out about it: I was at Universal Studios and I went on a ride called ""Back to the Future."" Then, after the ride, my parents told me about this picture. So I found out about it through word of mouth. Out of all the Universal movies that I've seen, this is the best!"

","My Take: A modern classic sci-fi comedy.<br/><br/>Still stands out as one of the most creative and funny comedies of all time, as well as a creative piece of science fiction, BACK TO THE FUTURE is fun, funny as well as fast-paced and very entertaining. Greatly contributing from a clever screenplay and playful yet professional handling by director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg, BACK TO THE FUTURE is a classic of its kind, and I think it's also one of a kind.<br/><br/>The special effects have surely dated a bit, considering that the pattern for effects have advanced through the years. But they're still a lot of elaborate fun. Besides, perhaps the real ""special effect"" of the film is the clever screenplay. Written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, the script has dozens of very clever and ingenious ideas. The entire concept explanation of time travel remains original and brilliant until now, even providing some inspiration for other time-travel films 'ala BLAST FROM THE PAST.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox plays the teenage Marty McFly, who is accidentally whisked back in the year 1955 when he hops aboard a time-traveling Delorean created by the near-mad Dr. E. Brown, or simply Doc (played hilariously by Christopher Lloyd). Once there, he gets into trouble with his would-be parents, still teenagers, when her would-be mother (Lea Thompson) falls in love with him, instead of his would-be father (Crispin Glover), which sets the film's hilarious comedy with a difference.<br/><br/>Despite some occasionally bad language, BACK TO THE FUTURE is perfect family entertainment, and I think it still is. It's fun and original, something that most recent, more expensive blockbusters can't do at the same time. And unlike most films that it could have been, BACK TO THE FUTURE doesn't get bogged down to a pure special effects exhibition. The film has a lot of fun with its actors and script, and values them as much as any million dollar effects thrown in. For those, very few, who haven't seen it, don't afford to miss it! <br/><br/>Rating: ****1/2 out of 5."

"hnt_dnl","10","1","1","23 March 2008"," The best film of 1985
","BACK TO THE FUTURE is the rarest of movies. It has every element imaginable in it and going for it: science fiction, fantasy, humor, action, thrills, family ties (pun intended!), and an assortment of great, oddball characters. <br/><br/>Michael J. Fox (in his greatest accomplishment as an actor) is Marty McFly, a 1985 Hill Valley guitar-playing high-schooler who aspires to be a rock 'n roll star. He is the youngest child of working-class parents George and Lorraine McFly (Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson in their best roles). George is working a dead-end job for his mean boss and high-school rival Biff (perfectly cast Thomas F. Wilson). George never realized his dream of being a science-fiction author due to primarily a lack of confidence and Marty doesn't want to follow in his father's footsteps. Marty also has a super hot girlfriend Jennifer (sexy Claudia Wells; I liked her much better than Elisabeth Shue in the sequels in the same role). And finally, last but not least, Marty has a mentor Dr. Emmett 'Doc' Brown (embodied by the great Christopher Lloyd in a performance that should have won him an Academy Award).<br/><br/>Doc is a genius yet oddball scientist (what scientist isn't a little quirky?) builds a time machine composed of a DeLorean (remember that car? the Edsel of the 80s) and then the fun begins. At the town mall one night, Doc and Marty test out his time machine on Doc's dog Einstein and then Marty mistakenly (won't spoil it for those who haven't seen the movie) is transported back to 1955 in the machine and must figure a way to return home. <br/><br/>But Marty screws up along the way to finding the young 1955 version of Doc and sets the process in motion that keeps his parents from meeting and falling in love, thereby endangering his very existence. So he and Doc have dual missions: to make his parents meet and fall in love and to fix the machine (damaged during the time travel) and get Marty, as Doc would say 'back to the future!' <br/><br/>This is my favorite film of director Robert Zemeckis. WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT and FORREST GUMP were both overrated and don't have that 're-watchability factor' that BTTF has, even though both films garnered perhaps more critical praise and acclaim in their time. But BTTF is complete, utter, enjoyable fun from beginning to end. I still find myself today being impressed by the way Michael J. Fox convincingly carried this film, at Crispin Glover's manic, hilarious, comic acting style, at how sexy Lea Thompson was in this film, and finally, at Christopher Lloyd's brilliant characterization of Doc Brown. <br/><br/>But more impressive is the fact that even though I've seen the film a lot of times, I'm still excited by several of it's signature scenes: young Biff and his gang chasing down a skateboarding Marty, Marty's wonderful rendition of ""Johnny Be Good"" at the Enchantment-Under-The-Sea dance, and of course the pulse-pounding, thrilling climax of Marty and Doc trying to put history back in order and send Marty back to the future. <br/><br/>It's strange that there really has been no film like this since it came out in 1985. Maybe too difficult to re-create the magic of this one. There have been a lot of time travel films, but I believe this may be the best one in all of film history! Forget about the unequal sequels. This film is the standard by which all fantasy (and time travel) films of the modern era should be measured."
"cryofry","10","1","1","20 March 2008"," BTTF is excellent entertainment
","BTTF is a magical film that can be watched again and again and never tires. I first saw it when I was about 10 years old and it became an instant personal favourite, somewhat due to the fact that the ""future"" coincided with my own year of birth.<br/><br/>Conceived by the highly talented duo of Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis (the two Bob's), it tells the story of a 1980s teenager who is accidentally transported back in time to the 1950s in a plutonium-powered DeLorean created by an oddball scientist. His brief trip back in time turns into a nightmare after he inadvertently prevents his parents from meeting and subsequently jeopardises his own existence. Working with the 1950s counterpart of the scientist who created the time-machine, he must find a way to make his parents fall in love and get back to the future.<br/><br/>On the surface, the story seems rather simple and straightforward, but if you look deeper, you will find that this film has many complex layers, which make it an utterly brilliant piece of work.<br/><br/>It is also full of coincidences. For instance, our time-travelling hero, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) travels from 1985 to 1955, with the latter been exactly 30 years in the past. There are countless other coincidences that are scattered throughout the film, many of which can be picked up after repeat viewings. Picking up and identifying new things can be quite fun.<br/><br/>Get lost in time and enjoy the film!"

"TheUnknown837-1","10","1","1","19 July 2007"," There should be more comedies like this one
","What makes a good comedy movie? Just lots of dumb, pointless humor and no real plot. But what makes a good movie? A film with every feature containing quality, even the humor. So to have a really good comedy movie, at least in my opinion, it has to have EFFECTIVE humor WITH a point behind it, mixed with a good plot, good acting, storyline, and have a realistic feeling behind it. In other words, the humor must be something believable and of the possible. And it must all blend seamlessly with the rest of the quality parts of the film. And we get all of that in Robert Zemeckis's classic science fiction/comedy film ""Back to the Future"". This is the kind of comedy film that I wish we would see more often. It's like ""Forrest Gump"", it takes a realistic approach to life and then just blends it with the humor so that the audience doesn't concentrate so much on just laughing, but also understanding the plot and characters just as they would with a serious film. And as soon as they're done laughing at the lifelike jokes, then they focus back on the rest of the film.<br/><br/>One thing I notice about a lot of comedy films that teenagers in particular seem to cherish and love is that the humor is crude and oftentimes, disturbing. And I suppose that if ""Back to the Future"" was made for teenagers alone, then the humor would be exactly the same. In this film, there is a subplot which some might think would end up being just disturbing and agitating to the audience. But when you look at it, it's not at all uncomfortable to the viewers, but instead works out effectively by not concentrating so much on just getting an uproar out of people. Of course, there is lots of jokes in the movie, mostly because of comedian Christopher Lloyd, who is at his top notch in ""Back to the Future"" as well as ""Back to the Future 2"". Not as much in the third part of the series. But he is especially keen in the first entry of the famous trilogy. And once again, his character of Dr. Emmett Brown is goofy and funny, but also has the traits where if you bumped into a person like this on the street, you wouldn't just sit back and laugh like he was just a dumb comedy feature. The character seems like he could be a real person.<br/><br/>""Back to the Future"" is a very great film. Not just as a comedy, but also as a science-fiction film. The explanations of the time machine aren't just thrown together as they are with many films. The time machine isn't just 'created' by the scientist and not explained how it works our what it takes. There is a fairly logical explanation, and maybe a theory, as to how time travel could be possible but it doesn't so so into depth to the point where only professors would understand what's going on. That's the thing about this film. Nothing just happens. There's an explanation and a point for everything. And that's what I like to see in all films. Whether they're serious of just plain funny. Or both."

","Back to the Future (1985, Dir. Robert Zemeckis) <br/><br/>Story <br/><br/>The year is 1985 and Marty McFly is your everyday teenager, except for one problem. He is stuck in 1955. After his good friend Doc Emmett Brown is gunned down, Marty ends up sending the DeLorean back twenty years into the past. Now, he must find the Doc and convince him that he is from the future, in order for the Doc to send him back to the future, but this is the least of Marty's problem. After accidentally getting in the way of the important meeting between his future mother and father, Marty must get them back together before he changes time forever, and destroys his own existence. This is the start of the successful 'Back to the Future' trilogy.<br/><br/>Actors <br/><br/>Thing important thing about this type of film is that you really need the right stars in order for the story to successfully work. Michael J. Fox plays Marty McFly, the lead character in the movie. He sits the role well of a normal teenager. He can really see the expressions his face, especially when he forgets he's in the past where no one can remember him. Doc Emmett Brown is played by Christopher Lloyd who is probably the best character in the film. His mad movements and acting style, added to his crazy look really made him seem like an actual scientist, who is trying to actually create something beyond reality. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover portray the mother and father of Marty McFly. Something which isn't often in films today is the same actor playing both the teen and adult version of their character. They were very well cast for the role and the makeup in which they go through really makes them look older, without making it to obvious. All the characteristics remain intact when both young and old.<br/><br/>Music <br/><br/>The music in the film which is composed by Alan Silvestri includes a few memorable themes but not a huge amount. The theme for the film is quite impressive and is not over used. Its main use of the use is found the actions scenes. Apart from these select few examples, the score can be very quiet. It's really hard to think of a piece of the score which does not include the theme. There are also music from Huey Lewis and The News. These aren't used out of place and still fit in with what's happening on screen.<br/><br/>Special Effects <br/><br/>Many people see 'Back to the Future' as a special effects film, but this isn't really the case. There are very few special effects shots in the film, but what does appear is quite impressive. There are a mixture of shots which would fit in well with a film today. One shot for example, is when the car disappears and the fire appears along the road. This particular effect would look out of place today, but still is viewable and enjoyable. The final shot in the film, where the care rises in the air and flies towards the camera is a lot better, and it perfectly blends in with the sky and looks very realistic.<br/><br/>Conclusion <br/><br/>'Back to the Future' is a wonderful and classic family film which as survived through so many years and still has the enjoyable factor needed to watch it. It's not too long and not too short, and a perfect family film too watch together or even on your own.<br/><br/>""What happens to us in the future?

He accomplishes the tasks of being an innocent teen who is stuck in a situation that he is not able to get out yet he can totally play a bad ass when he sticks up for his friends.Christoper Lloyd is hilarious as the crazed yet totally sane scientist.a recommendation for all the ages. there are not really any objectionable parts but some may find some scenes quirky. i don't know if that is considered a spoiler. its a sci fie, a triller a family film and geneaally a great film."

","I love sci-fi that is based in reality. By that I mean that you can test the logic defined by the rules set in the film, and it stands up from all angles. Most time travel movies break their rules somewhere. Sometimes it's forgivable, sometimes it's not. But Back to the Future (and its sequels) is as close as I've seen to the perfect logic in a time travel movie. The writers clearly thought this through from all aspects. They defined the rules of time travel that they were going to use (of which there are several to choose from) and they wrote the story around those rules, rather than just making a time travel movie and not thinking through the ramifications of what the characters do.<br/><br/>This movie and its sequels remains to this day my absolutely favorite movie(s) of all time. All other time travel movies pale in comparison."
"Cocacolaguy912-2","10","1","1","5 March 2007"," The most entertaining movie ever made.
","In my opinion, Back to the Future, along with its sequels, are the single most entertaining movies ever made. There are tons of gripping movies out there, but Back to the Future is a quality fun and edge of your seat film...totally deserving of its place on the Top 250. The flow of the movie, the characters who make it - everything is just awesome. The lines...""1.21 gigawatts!"" or anything about the Flux Capacitor never fails to make me smile.<br/><br/>One of the best things about Back to the Future is that it doesn't try to be anything special. The movie was made by individuals who just wanted to give the public something to enjoy...and it was a hit and still remains one of my favorites today."
"andrejvasiljevic","5","19","62","23 May 2010"," Entertaining... but that's it.
","I saw this movie 10 or maybe 15 years a go. Naturally I liked ""Back To The Future"" as every kid did. So, after a decade and a half last week I've decided to see it again, and man was it a cold shower.<br/><br/>OK, let's be honest, Back To The Future films are meant to be a fictional comedy and you can't expect any complexity or dramatic twist. A cool kid with ambition and a classical nutty professor type join their forces in a time traveling adventure. Sounds like a cool plot for the 12-15 generation, but that's as far as it goes. I still find it entertaining yet the simpleness of the whole story does kill the excitement a bit. Also, the commercial aspect of the movies is insultingly obvious. Come on... Pepsi, Delorean, Nike, Toyota... it all shouts of sponsorship and it's placed without any effort of subtleness. It's like the whole budget was dependent on the good fortunes of the sponsors, thus making a movie into an expensive and long commercial. Overall, entertaining, relaxing but that's about it.<br/><br/>And another thing. This is not SF!<br/><br/>Science Fiction - Fiction based on scientific facts. Flux Capacitor and time traveling dogs are hardly supported by science. Very few films dubbed SF fulfill the standards overall. Adventure, fantasy, comedy, fiction... ""Back To The Future"" is all those things, but SF it ain't!"
"Low Man","1","50","200","28 July 2004"," A dissenting voice
","OK...it looks like I'm the only person in civilization that hates this movie. I was at a friend's house, and it was rented for part of the evening's entertainment. I saw it way back in 1985 when it came out, and I did not then have any particularly hostile feelings toward it, but after seeing it again recently and looking through the comments on IMDb, I must conclude that it is the most overrated film ever made.<br/><br/>A quick browse through the comments yields such superlatives as, ""Fantastically scripted sci-fi comedy!!"", ""The perfect movie package"", ""One of the most original idea ever to put on film""(sic), and ""One of the best movies ever made in the history of film making."" Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion, I guess.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, this movie is as sit-com formulaic as they come. I can see how the pitch went to get this film made. ""We'll make an episode of Three's Company meets Happy Days with some time travel in it!"" I must also point out that this film is not science fiction. It is fantasy.<br/><br/>Maybe this is my own personal problem, but science fiction should make some attempt at plausibility. This movie relies on a device called the 'flux capacitor' that requires gigawatt's of power and a DeLorean moving at 88 miles an hour to function, although why this is the case and what the device does is never even vaguely delineated. The film would have been just as plausible if it involved a wizard that zapped people back in time with a medieval talisman and an incantation that required precise rhythm and pronunciation. It might even have been more plausible that way.<br/><br/>I suppose it's the 'science fiction' of it that really honks me off. It seems that so many people regard this film as good sf, and it is not. If you want a good example of sf, look at Terry Gilliam's Brazil. Many people find that film confusing and impenetrable, but good sf usually takes some work to appreciate because it deals with concepts that most people haven't thought about. This film just takes a formulaic stroll through a combination of well-worn clichés to be found all over situation comedies and time travel stories. Come to think of it, Gilliam's Twelve Monkeys deals with the time travel concept far better than this film does.<br/><br/>OK, this isn't to say the film has no redeeming qualities. It does have some amusing moments. As a sit-com, it's OK. For comedy in science fiction, though, the Fox network show Futurama is vastly better."
"ccthemovieman-1","7","8","23","17 February 2008"," Mixed Emotions Looking Back On This Film Today
","When this came out over 20 years ago, I thought It was solid entertainment with a clever story. It was a big hit, and spawned two sequels. I saw it at the theater and several times on VHS. Then, after an absence of time, I saw it again in the late '90s and was shocked to hear 11 blasphemes - a ridiculous amount for a comedy (and ""PG-rated,"" to boot).<br/><br/>Also, the character ""Biff"" (Thomas Wilson) was so irritating to me (he must have done a good job acting) it also fun out of viewing. I could say the same about ""Marty's"" father (Crispin Glover), who was a disgusting wuss. <br/><br/>I did enjoy seeing Lea Thompson in her prime: a very pretty woman, and there were still a lot of laughs in here. She and Christopher Lloyd's ""Emmet Brown"" are definitely fun to watch. Michael J. Fox became an even-bigger star, thanks to this movie.<br/><br/>The mixture of humor, action, drama, special-effects, science-fiction, etc., all made this a film a lot of people enjoyed. Why they had to include all that ""language"" is a mystery to me, except that it's the twisted world of Hollywood."
"idanvinter123","7","3","6","20 October 2015"," It's 2015 and it's still awesome
","Let's start off with a statement: This film is a classic masterpiece.<br/><br/>The writing, the characters, the dialog, the technology- it's all epic. Steven Spielberg has always been an outstanding director.<br/><br/>This film, no matter what year is it right now, will still be a massive classic masterpiece. Everything is done correctly is this film, nothing went wrong, there wasn't a single moment when you actually feel bored, and when a film makes you feel the same as it did when it was first released in theaters- that's an marvelous achievement for a movie. I'm definitely planning on watching this trilogy a couple more times in the future (pun intended).<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of those movies that you just have to watch at least once before you die."
"lee_eisenberg","7","3","6","23 September 2005"," Many people may remember Michael J. Fox as Alex Keaton, but I'll always remember him as Marty McFly
","Okay, so maybe ""Back to the Future"" seems a little hokey, but it's so cool! You probably know the story: typical '80s teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) accidentally goes back to 1955. His existence is threatened when his mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson) falls for him instead of his father George (Crispin Glover). Only the zany Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) can help him. Along the way he has to cope with local bully Biff Tannen.<br/><br/>If the movie is excessively nostalgic, then they play it to good effect. I sometimes have to wonder what would happen if I accidentally went back in time and met my parents. Given what happens in this movie, it's probably best that I stay in my own time.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's an interesting contrast/comparison between the '50s and '80s. After all, who in the '50s would have imagined Reagan becoming president, or any town having an African-American mayor? So check this movie out; it won't disappoint you."
"PIST-OFF","7","3","6","2 July 2002"," classic 80's , it's even got Micheal J Fox
","If Sigmund Frued saw this movie he'd be foaming and frothing at the mouth about it's  latent theme of having your mom wanting you in a sexual way. Cokehead theories aside this is one of those movies that sums up the 80's quite nicely. Between Micheal J Fox and Huey Luis and the News on the soundtrack you can't get much more 80's. It's another movie like Ghostbusters that you watch as a kid, then see as an adult and notice alot of adult themed jokes you didn't even notice as jokes as a kid. ""I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts"" That line never did make sense when I was ten."
"The_Movie_Cat","7","9","29","27 August 2000"," ""Make like a tree... and get outta here!""
","I always regard the eighties as the weakest decade for movies. Short running times were filled out with one dimensional characters and thin plots, patronising audiences with their banality. Some thought John Hughes was a genius, and everyone liked Arnold Schwarzenegger. Thankfully, there were the occasional gems in the mire, and Back to the Future – a family film with daring themes of incest and attempted rape – is one of them.<br/><br/>Michael J.Fox is excellent as Marty, though you can't help thinking someone as boyish and short could never really be so cool. And I always thought it was irresponsible for a film to show such potentially fatal activities as skateboarding on the back of vehicles. Then again, how sensible can you be when your main songs are by Huey Lewis and the News?<br/><br/>Still, eighties haircuts and braces as fashion statements not withstanding, this film holds up remarkably well. The heavily signposted coincidences and plot developments are fun, while the support work well, particularly Crispin Glover as Marty's dad. A number of ""blink and you'll miss it"" pieces add to the enjoyment, especially an advert on the back of a newspaper Marty picks up – which can only be seen clearly via freeze-frame – proclaiming: ""You'll be noticed driving the car of the future"".<br/><br/>Direction could occasionally afford to be a little more cinematic in its approach (note how Marty films the Doc's experiment on a camcorder but we never see the camera's perspective; possibly because it's an obviously fake camera with no recording light) but generally it's sound. Christopher Lloyd's overacting could also grow irritating for some. Evidence of mild product placement does not really hinder the piece, and the evocation of 50's Middle America is quite charming.<br/><br/>Maybe there's the nagging feeling that – now fifteen years old – the film's cultural parodies seem hopelessly naive in their application. Constant references to Star Wars, Ronald Reagan and Jackie Gleason don't seem as fresh or relevant as they once did. <br/><br/>Back to the Future is an okay film, and an amusing diversion. But its lack of realistic characterisation and mainstream trappings make it an entertaining pile of fluff, nothing more."
"rmax304823","6","7","21","20 May 2008"," Amusing and commercial success.
","Good-natured and enjoyable fantasy about Michael J. Fox (as Marty McFly) who travels 30 years into the past with the help of Dr. Brown (Christopher Lloyd) and his magic, plutonium-powered DeLorean.<br/><br/>The present -- that is, 1985 -- is a bit of a mess in Fox's small town. What's left of the downtown area is surrounded by strip malls. The two movie theaters are defunct. One has been converted into an evangelical church and the other shows X-rated movies. Homeless bums sleep on the benches of the town square. Fox's mother (Lea Thompson) is an overweight, hopeless alcoholic; his father is a witless nobody constantly abused by a burly friend who exploits him and then insults him for his imperfect efforts.<br/><br/>Lloyd is a maniacal scientist who steals plutonium from Lebanese terrorists to fuel his traveling time machine. He's shot by them as Fox barely escapes, zooming into the past.<br/><br/>It's 1955 now and we note that the state of the town is rather better in most respects. No garbage on the streets. No suburbs, but farmland ""as far as the eye can see."" A couple of good gags follow, right out of ""The Twilight Zone."" Pull into a gas station and half a dozen employees rush out to service your car. A cup of coffee is five cents. When Fox orders a Tab in the diner, the counter man doesn't know what he's talking about. A ""Pepsi free"" doesn't help.<br/><br/>But there are of course the kind of complications that usually follow from time travel. Fox meets his own mother and father, as well as Dr. Brown. The problem is that Fox's mother gets the hots for him and Fox must arrange for his own father to take his place in her affection. In brief, he does so, successfully travels back to 1985, and finds Dr. Brown has paid attention to a warning and worn a bullet-proof vest so he survives the terrorist shooting.<br/><br/>I enjoy seeing it once in a while and I gather it was immensely popular. There's just enough profanity to pep things up and keep this from being a movie for children. The plot itself isn't challenging in any way, though some of the gags require a certain maturity to be understood. Someone asks who is president in 1985. ""Ronald Regan? The actor? Who's vice president -- Jerry Lewis?"" Fox is a convincing high-schooler and easy to identify with. Christopher Lloyd is overly manic and with his bulging eyes resembles a creature out of the very depths of the ocean. Lea Thompson doesn't add much, but Chrispin Glover as Fox's father seems all flapping arms and legs.<br/><br/>I think it might have been more enjoyable if the anachronisms had been spread throughout the movie instead of being all crowded into the first ten minutes or so of the 1955 period. Some of the comedy was thrown away in the interests of special-effects and pseudo-drama. (Think of ""Groundhog Day,"" in which all the elements are seamlessly blended.) And it also appears that McFly adapts too readily to 1955. After the first few minutes, nothing surprises him. He takes this extraordinary experience for granted and simply goes about the business of bringing his parents together and figuring out a way to get back to his real ""present"" before his picture disappears from the snapshot he's brought along with him. (?) I'd have been taking notes every minute. A few liberties are also taken with the norms of 1955. Good girls, like Lea Thompson, didn't reach under the table to squeeze a stranger's thigh. At least none of them did that with me. And if they<br/><br/>wouldn't have done it with me, they obviously wouldn't have done it to anyone. Except -- and this is probably the answer -- Lea Thompson was a slut to begin with. Yes, that must be it. How disgusting.<br/><br/>Anyway, you'll have fun watching the film. The kids will too. It generated three sequels, none of which I've watched."
"panchodh_12","7","2","4","20 July 2015"," Authentically entertaining
","You should not watch Back to the Future looking for serious, intriguing thought experiments regarding time travel. You should watch it for what it is: a Hollywood blockbuster that seeks to make money through people's entertainment. And the profit-seeking motive is quite clear from the beginning: you see brand placement EVERYWHERE. <br/><br/>Back to the Future, then, has all the ingredients for a Hollywood blockbuster: funny characters, unlikely plot denouements that you see coming way before it happens, very cliché characters such as the town bully, the timid nerd that becomes a hero, the damsel in distress. Also, as a 1985 blockbuster, it includes racism and sexism that would probably not be tolerated nowadays, such as the main actor shouting ""the Libyans!"" as a synonym of ""the bad guys!"", or the main character literally planning to abuse of a girl, which happens to be his mother.<br/><br/>That being said, the movie does achieve it main goal: it is truly entertaining. I'm not the kind of person who laughs out loud when watching comedies, but in this case I couldn't avoid it. There are truly remarkable situations, especially with Marty's mother. The doctor's character is also particularly well-made, and the actor's performance is notable. In general, the creators did a good job in showing all the different funny situations that would arise from bringing an 80s kid to 1955, such as him playing rock'n roll in front of an awed audience, or Marty saying that a TV program that is just being aired is a classic that he watched in a rerun.<br/><br/>So once you understand you shouldn't have high hopes for this movie, and that you should only look for having a good time, this movie will be very satisfactory. There are more artistic movies, better written plots, better directed ones, even funnier ones. But very often, these movies don't remain in the collective imaginary in the way this did it. The way this movie is part of today's pop culture should not be understated."

He hooks a guitar up to an app and blow's him away. Then he get's a call from the Doc telling him about his new invention. Even if you only know the plot and this is your first time watching the movie, you basically know what the invention is. You get some back story about Marty, his family and his town, Hill Valley. When you get to see Doc, you sorta know what's coming next. But then he get's killed by terrorists who chase Marty around the JC Penny's parking lot. After that where in 1955. You get to see George McFly in Lou's café and I will let you see the rest. Overall, this movie has a great mix of comedy, drama, suspense and action. It's also good to see cursing in kid's movie.

Actually Marty was going back in time, because Doc was shot and he was already there in 1955. Things have changed around Hill Valley in 1955. Well there's a young George McFly (Crispin Glover) and Lorraine Baines (Lea Thompson). Things go fine until Biff Tannen (Thomas Wilson) shows up.

Now they have to get George and Lorraine to the school dance. Now Marty is prepared to back to 1985. Then Emmett was suspecting that Marty was supposed to go back, but he came back from the future. It's a absolute classic, and I would recommend watching this, especially on TV, or on the trilogy set on DVD (Which I have, but unfortunately, I only have the full frame version, I don't have the widescreen version of this, sorry) But it doesn't matter, you get the movie anyway.

","Here I am...wow...like it amazes me every time. This is my 400th review on IMDb. Three years or more, 400 films, some good, some REEEALLY bad and I hope everyone enjoys my reviews because I enjoy writing them and I don't plan on stopping. So for each 100 films I have reviews a Superman film being such a huge fan but for 400 I decided on something special...this film easily hits my top ten of all time favorites list so without further adieu...Back To The Future.<br/><br/>Did they know they were making something this incredible when they were making it?? I think perhaps they did, that is part of the magic because Director and creator Robert Zemeckis holds nothing back from this flat out eighties classic fantasy adventure. The film is just so incredibly unique taking a cool, completely hip stereo typical eighties teenager and tossing him back into the mid fifties experience and forcing him to save his own existence by making sure his mother and father hook up. The special effects, the utter intense detail that goes into this amazing story line that makes sure everything flows properly, and captures not only 1985 vividly, but 1955 vividly. Zemeckie creates Hill Valley California from scratch and makes it feel like everyone's home town and he makes sure that we see every aspect of it so we can be as stunned and blown away by 1955 Hill Valley just like Marty McFly. This film is just brilliant.<br/><br/>Marty McFly, a classic character in the history of film is played by the irrepressible Michael J. Fox in his hey day. Fox (although 24 at the time) was perfect as the 17 year old kid that everybody wanted to be, and everybody wanted to be his friend and for the course of the film you felt like you were right there along with him. This is without a doubt Fox's best role and he has had some good ones but this one takes the cake. He is so smooth and a fast talking, material driven, eighties kid and he's perfect. How can we forget Dr. Emmett Brown?? We can't!! Christopher Lloyd plays the most eccentric and yet brilliant Scientist inventor of the eighties. Doc, as he is known to Marty, is brilliant but almost to the point of insanity. It shows in his personality, his actions and his creations. His I.Q. is obviously off the charts. Despite the age different Doc Brown and Marty have this incredible friendship and Fox and Lloyd's chemistry reflect this strong bond between them. No one could have expected these two would be such a great pairing but they are!! Lea Thompson plays Marty's mother Lorraine Baines McFly. She spends more time playing the bubbly, rebellious teenage Lorraine and she's terrificly believable as both that role and as Marty's mother. Crispin Glover plays whiny, rather weak George McFly, Marty's father. Now I'm not a big fan of Glover and his personal decisions (such as suing the producers of the sequels to this film) had not made me like him any more but he truly created a unique and terrific anti hero in George Mcfly. I will forever associate Back To The Future with the nerdy annoying laugh and his petrified nerdy walk. Thomas F. Wilson is the bully that everyone wanted to see get his in the end Biff Tannen. Wilson is just terrific as a guy that you absolutely despise and yet he still strikes that feeling of dread when he shows up...he's the perfect bully and adversary to Marty AND his father in 1955. They share the same enemy. The cast mesh so well together and the transformations of thirty years between everyone in the cast with the exception of Michael J. Fox is really astounding. I mean sometimes the make up looks a little cheesy but it's really quite amazing to see them. You really feel like you're traveling in time.<br/><br/>And isn't that what makes Back To The Future one of the most incredible adventures of all time. You're right there with Marty 100% of the time and you feel like you're going through everything that he is. The story is brilliant and in such a complex film about time travel there is BOUND to be plot holes but Zemeckis does an incredible job and barely making you notice them and wrapping things up so carefully and creating this incredible world around the characters. Back To The Future is not something someone might see, it's something every single person should see because it IS a classic film and always will be. To this day (20 years after the fact) Back To The Future holds up as well now as it did then against ANY big budget special effects film nowadays. It was years ahead of it's time making it the absolute must see. The movie has a kick ass soundtrack featuring a lot of Huey Lewis and The News tracks that became associated with this film (Power of Love--for instance), and it's the absolute quintessential eighties film...the power of wanting material things (Marty's truck, George McFly's book) social status based on appearance...that's the eighties way!! Throw in some what was then ""cool"" four letter words (not a lot but enough to make it feel naughty to the youngsters) and you got yourself everything that Back To The Future is. An incredible film that I have probably seen a hundred times and love it equally as much every single time. 10/10 THANKS FOR READING MY REVIEWS...100 MORE TO GO TILL 500!!"

I liked the parts where he meets his father in the diner, and watch his future wife undress. Marty knew his father was a ""peeping tom"" when he was younger. Then trying to make a difference in their lives was the big part from keeping him and his siblings from non-existence was a bigger challenge. When everything was restored, Marty's finally changed for the better, though he introduced the skateboarding craze which one of the kids were amazed completely. Sticking to the dreams is important, listening to Dr. Brown is a must. Robert Zemeckis is a genius, and he really put up a solid cast and characters for the movie. The music rocks!

","Back to the Future (1985) was the film that launched Michael J. Fox's career into the stratosphere. This film not only made him into an eighties superstar but it also made Back to the Future a part of Americana and a slight fixture upon Hollywood for a few years there after. This film was so successful that it was made into a trilogy.<br/><br/>The film follows a high school student Marty Mc Fly (Michael J. Fox) who's not pleased with the way his life has been going. He always feels that there's more to his life than what there appears to be. When he's not spending time with his girlfriend or his band, Marty is best friends with an eccentric inventor Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Doc Brown is on the verge of breaking through his latest discovery. Marty watches his family and notice's how broken down they are. But when he see's that the family car is wrecked he loses it. There goes his date! This dilemma isn't nothing compared to what Doc Brown has in store for him!<br/><br/>This film is the perfect example of an eighties film. The fashion and style is in your face. Crispin Glover (who plays the Marty father) steals the show with his neurotic style of acting. He portrays Marty with an underlining manic presence. Michael J. Fox makes a somewhat believable teenager and Christopher Lloyd is great as Doc Brown (another character who's a borderline basket case), Eighties stars Lea Thompson, Casey Simezsko, Courtney Gaines and future star Billy Zane appear in this one as well.<br/><br/>I happen to enjoy this film. The sequel was entertaining as well. But the final chapter was a weak effort by all. If you like Michael J. Fox or Cripsin Glover I advise you to check this flick out.<br/><br/>Recommended."

","This is one of the few cult classics which deserves its status. It is a fun popcorn movie which does not take itself too seriously. A teenager-oriented flick, as was the norm of the 1980's, which holds fond memories for many of that era.<br/><br/>It's become trendy to point out all the discrepancies in the science of this sci-fi/comedy, but they do not matter one bit to the casual movie goer, who will plug in this flick with a bowl of popcorn and lean back in that recliner for an hour and a half of good, wholesome family fun. And, frankly, they don't matter to me, either. This is not one of those sci-fi movies which demands that the science be put into the story in order for it to work. This works beautifully for the ~lack~ of the science. There is nothing to muddle the pace, mess with the timing of the comedic delivery, nor throw off the dramatic sequences.<br/><br/>It is a very satisfying ""coming of age"" movie.<br/><br/>All in all this is a very enjoyable and entertaining film which rates an 8.4/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

The puns (""Get used to the bars, Joey""), the storyline and the extremely thrilling finale make this movie very special.<br/><br/>And of course we have brilliant actors who play absolutely lovable characters. I am certain that I was not the only boy in puberty who would have given everything to be as cool as Marty McFly...<br/><br/>Though the sequels have not been bad as well, this movie is the ultimate Science Fiction comedy of the 80s.

Wilson, Claudia Wells, James Tolkan, Marc McClure, Wendie Jo Sperber, Casey Siemaszko, Billy Zane, J.J. Cohen, Harry Waters Jr. (PG)<br/><br/>Irresistible time travel adventure comedy finds teenager Marty McFly (Fox) witnessing wacky scientist pal Doc Brown (Lloyd) successfully test out his time-machine-on-wheels, and then gets stuck in the past after inadvertently going back in time thirty years. Energy, humor and action to spare, not to mention plenty of nifty hardware and blazing special effects, but this is far more than a sleek wind-up toy of thrills; it also poses a fascinating rhetorical concept well worth exploring: what if you could meet your parents when they were in high school? The script by Zemeckis and Bob Gale is an amazing construction (despite the oft-parroted paradoxical plot holes), full of clever dialogue, twists and payoffs--that the project was rejected by Hollywood dozens of times before finally getting greenlit proves just how shortsighted the major studios often are. Filled with wonderful, near-iconic performances and Alan Silvestri's rousing music (not to mention Huey Lewis' catchy contributions--he also cameos as a teacher); lots of laughs, lots of heart, lots of exhilaration, as good a family film as there ever has been.

","It is said that the director originally wanted to shoot a scene of a nuclear explosion, the company did not give Monty, so the story can only be placed in a small town. There is no nuclear explosion, no laser sword, the director and screenwriter must only attract the audience from the details. Wearing ck underwear, the protagonists of the Nike canvas shoes returned to1995, and he simple changed his name to Calvin Klein, pretending to be an alien and scaring his dad to a dad to dance with this mother. Holding a Gibson casino guitar at the graduation ball of his parents and playing a Johnny bgoode, and finally came a fan brother's hands to string, making the 55-year high school students stunned, the protagonist said: your kids gonna love it. And the guitarist with an injured hand called his cousin chuck berry to let him listen to the song, and rock music was born.
Skateboard chasing this classic bridge must have originated from this movie. The protagonist was in the west in 1885, the director paid tribute to Clint Eastwood. I don't know if Fukuoka Fukui has seen this movie. The hero in Doraemon has also set a talent for precise shooting. I remember in a long story, Nobita also became a cowboy and rescued the beauty. When the person selling the Clot pistol asked the protagonist: Where did you learn this hand. Seven eleven convenience store, the protagonist replied. And we already know the protagonist's skills on the game console in 2015.
The first dog of the doctor was Copernicus, and the dog in 1985 was already Einstein. You can imagine how many dogs the doctor has raised. After reading it, I knew how much the movie Westward Journey and the 90s used to return to the future. Even if the classic sentence in Journey to the West is in heaven, I think it is not as good as that of the doctor: she is one of a million, one of a billion, one of a googleplex.

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","10","0","0","5 April 2020"," A timeless classic.
","'Back To The Future (1985)' might just be my favourite film of all time. It's an absolute classic, endlessly rewatchable and utterly brilliant. Its story really is timeless, less focused upon its sci-fi concept than you might expect. Even though the past is recreated with a lavish contrast, the piece doesn't tend to revel in its part period setting. Instead, it keeps its focus firmly on its characters and the dilemma in which they find themselves. Marty and Doc are as iconic a pairing as there's ever been, each written to perfection and performed just as well. Fox is fittingly flustered, as relatable as you can get, and Lloyd is like a living cartoon, lighting up the screen whenever he appears. The rest of the cast are all great, too; almost everyone has a distinct and memorable personality. After a lengthy but necessary set up, the flick absolutely flies by. Its amazing finale is comprised of a series of satisfying climaxes; everything pays off in some major way. The affair is incredibly efficient in that regard, as it only shows things that are vital to the story. It squeezes as much tension from its set-pieces as possible - I mean, I still squirm with suspense during its clock-tower clambering sequence even after a dozen viewings. The movie is phenomenally well-made in general. Frankly, it's a masterpiece. It puts a big, beaming smile on my face and keeps it there right through to the end of its credits. If I had a time-machine, I'd go back to 1985 to watch this in the cinema. 10/10"

It was a lot of fun, it was an homage to the innocence of the 50's and had some really cool science fiction elements.<br/><br/>It propelled Micheal J.Fox from a TV star with Family Ties to a full on movie star. It was the big breakout movie that Robert Zemekis had been so desperately seeking ( I personally think Romancing the Stone was just as good) and it cemented writer Bob Gale as one of the screenwriting greats.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie yet, go stream it or better yet buy it.

","A properly weighed mix of blockbuster filmmaking & quality storytelling, Back to the Future is pure sci-fi delight that's as intelligent as it is entertaining and makes for one of the most fun, creative & adventurous examples of time travel subgenre. Featuring a lively concept, filled with interesting characters & packing no shortage of thrills, it remains one of the defining works of 1980s Hollywood cinema.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Robert Zemeckis, there is hardly any wasted scene in this picture as it quickly acquaints us with its story setup, and establishes its tone with an instantly captivating opening segment that bears similarity to Spielberg's style. Every moment is accounted for, no residue is left behind, and once the main story kicks in, Zemeckis makes sure the momentum is never lost and keeps the interest alive till the end.<br/><br/>The writing is no slouch, for it makes sure the plot is constructed in a way so that every action only develop the arcs of characters involved without deviating from course, compromising with its entertainment factor or slowing down its 88 miles pace. Further assistance comes from its era-appropriate sets, kinetic camerawork, consistent dose of action, excellent wit, breezy narrative flow, exciting score & fab inputs from Michael J. Fox & Christopher Lloyd.<br/><br/>Overall, Back to the Future simply takes its conventional setting & straightforward premise, refines each little detail as meticulously as it can, and never loses sight of its primary goal, which is to take its viewers on a highly enjoyable & incredibly fun roller-coaster ride. There are several shortcuts it could've taken but it doesn't, plus Zemeckis' commitment to improving every scene to the very best of his ability is a reason why it continues to impress even today. Strongly recommended."

","Back to the Future, directed & written by Robert Zemeckis, and produced by the great Steven Spielberg & Bob Gale, was inventive, and I quote, ""heavy"".<br/><br/>Back to the Future may not have been the first film to take a shot at time travel, but it's the movie that broke barriers, and holds up the most out of Time After Time & Terminator, along with other early titles. This movie is so heavily guarded; a lot of people say it's almost a flawless movie, with good reason. With a low budget, even for 1985, of 19 million dollars, this movie made a lot of noise at the box office, taking home 389 million dollars!<br/><br/>Before I dive into the characters, I just want to give Deborah Lynn Scott, Robert Iannaccone, Brian Callahan & Julie Starr Dresner, credit for the brilliant costume design. Michael J. Fox, as his first major role in a motion picture, puts on a phenomenal & energetic performance as Marty McFly, making his character very bold, and entertaining. His character development throughout the film brings a lot of an enjoyable wit and comedy. Christopher Llyod, who is most noticed for One Flew Over the Coo Coo's Nest, before Back to the Future, put on a trademark performance. Chris Llyod NAILED his performance as Doctor Emmett Brown. His character development during the second and third act was the best out of all the characters. He carried himself with this quirky & loud, yet brilliant and thoughtful attitude, that was admirable to all. Lea Thompson, as Lorraine McFly was one of the cringiest, yet best characters in the movie. Her character in the first act was whatever, and what she turns out to be in the second and third act, is hysterical. Thomas F. Wilson played a great, stereotypical bully, in Biff. He was a clichÃ© character, and meant to hate, but he is absolutely hilarious.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale was ahead of it's time, along with some of the scenes and risks they took. A very intelligent and creative script, that flowed just right for the 80's, then flowed even better with the 50's, adding consistent tongue and cheek humor.<br/><br/>The score by the up and coming, Alan Silvestri, had this magical, yet suspenseful, and even a few sad tones. This score was absolutely phenomenal, backed up with a great song by Huey Lewis & the News, That's the Power of Love.<br/><br/>Overall, I can completely understand why people would call this movie flawless. It is absolutely fantastic!! With only one notable award from the Academy Awards, being Best Sound Editing, this movie has a lot to be proud of, and A LOT of nomination worthy aspects. Robert Zemeckis set up the sequel perfectly, and if I was around in the late 80s, I would've went to go see it."

","People who always complain about a bad life, in fact, always stay in the shadow of sadness in the past, can't see the beauty of the present, can't enjoy the joy of the present; or can't hold the present in the dreams of the future. The most important thing in life is not memories and the future, but grasping the present and cherishing what you have so that you won't regret it when you lose it later. At least we have it, we cherish it.
Life is a one-way ticket. Life cannot be rehearsed. Grasp the attitude of being responsible for life now. Those who are still in the past and imagining the future, don't hesitate any more. Only grasping the present is the ideal and only option. The future is now, and having today means embracing countless tomorrows."

With all of it's perfect attempts at filmmaking, the pacing holds it all together, it can end up flowing very well or have the film feel unnatural. The most risky pick for a pacing is fast, you usually end up with a film feeling rushed or frustrating for glossing over important storytelling that needs more developing, Back To The Future is undoubtedly the best attempt at this pacing. The film is to the point, never feeling like it's pandering or rushing, and even juggles with two completely different genres perfectly, thriller and humor. The two genres are both at their peak in this film and deserve their praises.<br/><br/>It's hard to find good humor now days, but you know what's even harder to find than that? Good lasting humor that can work whether it's seen once or eight times, but do you wanna know what's even harder to find? Back To The Future's humor that can work thousands of times. The use of humor never has and never will be quite like Back To The Future's, the film is endlessly charming though Marty's interactions in the 1950s and no other film will ever do such time traveling humor as great. Marty not knowing how to open a glass soda bottle, the distinction of his clothes compared to the general clothing at the time, the teenagers being displeased with him playing rock and roll music at prom (just like the adults they grow up to be in 1985 which is a nice touch), and so much more is just comedy at it's finest. To add on top of that, it's refreshing that the time travel comedy never outstays it's welcome nor becomes reused, every joke is trying something new and the film feels more fresh for that. It's also not the only use comedy in the film, every other joke is just good use of humor. The dad laughing at the stupid sitcom, the bullies running into a pile of dung Doc admiting that his truth knowing machine didn't work, and so much more good use of comedy. This film will still be funny for decades to come.<br/><br/>On the flip side we have the films use of intensity, this is put to play in one of the most thrilling scenes I've ever seen; however, there is also some build up to it beforehand. The film up to the climax scene has been really fun and entertaining story telling. There is a great plot developing and building towards this one scene, this one unforgettable scene. It feels like there are no other second chances at this point, it's either successfully getting to the present or ending up being stuck in the past and Marty never has the things he loves in the present anymore. Our characters are desperate to succeed, it seems like it's game over but they keep fighting to win. Through the doubts and slip ups in this attempt, Marty makes it back home, the relief of our characters succeeding is immense. The accomplishment feels earned, most of the film is all about Marty trying to make the future right again so that he won't die. He escaped the terrorist, planned how he was going to get back to the future with Doc, and he encouraged his parents to get together. All of this is now put to the brilliant climax, if he fails then all of his previous works were all for nothing, this is truly one of the best climaxes of all time.<br/><br/>Never do these two strengths interfere but in way support each other. The humor and charm of the film builds the heart and likability of the characters (and also the film as a whole but still makes the characters better). After all of the build up and connection we have with the characters, it's now all put in jeopardy for the final scene.<br/><br/>One last thing to add is that the pacing is not just impressive for juggling two genres but also amazing for flowing so well. Never does the film talk down to its audience or is running ahead of them, every second is perfect and precise storytelling. Let's take a look at the opening, which is considered to be one of the greatest of all time, for an example.<br/><br/>The film opens with it's iconic logo and then fades into a shot coming out of a clock. This simplistic moment makes us expecting time traveling in the film to happen, we get pumped and ready for it to happen, creating more of an ambition to keep watching. Scene continues with the camera moving around the room which not only sets the tone of the film but also the story of the film. Seeing all of the somewhat goofy gizmos and gadgets convey to us that the film isn't taking it self that seriously. If this scene was more slick and cool then the rest of the movie will feel out of place and stupid. The story is set up in the quickest way possible but still sets the ground perfectly. Us seeing the huge amounts of technical gadgets conveys that some sort of scientist lives here. The news on the TV covering that plutonium has been stolen not only makes the audience knows it's been stolen but it also interests them. The shot of the overfilled dog boll doesn't just tell us that the scientist owns a dog but also that the scientist isn't home. Then Marty calling out for Doc in a friendly way tells us the scientists name and also that the stranger is a friend of his. Last thing conveyed is Marty's skateboard rolling and bumping into a box of plutonium, conveying that Doc was the one that stole the Plutonium. So much is conveyed in just one scene, and it's not just the first scene, it's pretty much every scene in the film. Most filmmakers would tell this information through exposition or narration, but a talented one would attempt something like this.<br/><br/>This is only three minutes of brilliance out of the one hundred and sixteen that never stops delivering. Just every bit of love and attention to this film just flows so well that it seems like there was no sweat in making it. Is it one of the best films from the eighties? Absolutely."

"dudemisra","10","0","0","23 November 2019"," A classic for all the ages
","Back to the Future, in its 80s cheese, stands out for its cultural influence and iconic storyline. It's a film no one can help but smile about, definitely due to the optimistic and adventurous aura this film radiates.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox plays cool kid Marty McFly who is living life like his last whilst living with a family that seems to barely survive or live anymore. His weak-willed father and depressed mother along with his no-good brother and sister find themselves between a rock and a hard place with Marty in very middle. Fortunately Marty's crazy yet brilliant scientist friend Doc. Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd has one solution to change the fate of Marty and his family's life: To go back to the future.<br/><br/>The film is definitely interesting in that its storyline is very cheesy and cliched which is all acceptable given the period this film was released. Yet, even viewing this film now in the 2010s, we aren't affected negatively by how cheesy or corny certain scenes or dialogue are because its what makes this film unique. The over-the-top hysterics of Doc Brown and his time traveling theories, Biff and his gang chasing Marty across Hill Valley square and certainly the sequence of Doc Brown trying to connect the big clock with a cable power point before Marty in the DeLorean strikes it. Its scenes like these that people remember 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 year or hell after 10 years simply because only Back to the Future can execute them with perfection.<br/><br/>I'm not bluffing when I'm saying anyone of any age MUST watch this film. Whether you're a middle aged adult, this film will bring back memories as you ponder on the freedom and energy of your youth with refreshing optimism. Even watching this film as a teen, you feel a sense of urgency to live life the way Marty does in this film; always on an adventure, being the coolest or popular anywhere you go or just learning how to be a great friend like Marty is to George, his father. This film is filled with hidden life lessons on how to treat yourself and those around you.<br/><br/>I believe that even as the 21st century comes to an end, people will still remember or talk about this film because there is nothing or there will be nothing like it ever."

"filipemanuelneto","8","0","0","18 November 2019"," One of the most remarkable movies of the eighties.
","This is one of the most remarkable trilogies of the 1980s. Even those who have never seen the movies know or have heard of them. In the first movie, teenager Marty McFly helps his friend, ""Doc"" Emmett Brown, a half-mad scientist, in his experiments with a time machine built from a DeLorean. But after a few adventures, Marty becomes the first time traveler by accident and gets involved in the midst of her own parents' romance in the 1950s. Now she'll need all the help she can to make sure. back in 1985, that his parents are married and that he himself will exist in the future.<br/><br/>The film cleverly blends sci fi and comedy. Robert Zemeckis can make things work perfectly by designing a lightweight movie that can entertain and make you laugh, but still smart enough to appeal to the most demanding audiences. The film never tries to be credible or scientifically accurate, nor is it required as it is clearly a comedy. The cast, in turn, is absolutely dominated by the excellent partnership of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, with a series of memorable dialogues in between. Both actors here have probably achieved the most notable roles of their careers. The other actors contribute perfectly.<br/><br/>Special effects, visuals and sound are inseparable and important part of any sci-fi movie and here they work quite well. The soundtrack has also become iconic. In fact, the entire film has gained classic status, to the point that the film has been preserved as part of American cultural memory. For me personally, it is one of the most remarkable films of the eighties, which has aged very well and still has class, charm and style today."
"kathrynpratt-28185","Null","0","0","10 September 2019"," Cheerful movie magic
","Back to the future was a massive hit and it is surely one of the most popular and famous sci-fi films ever made. The premise is simple but well executed, and with the character presence of Michael J Fox, director Robert Zemeckis made a crowd pleaser that is still recalled to this day. Back to the Future is played neither entirely seriously nor entirely for laughs, and therein lies the nature of its success. It's funny and breezy but doesn't descend to a level where the characters are little more than props for jokes. We believe in Marty, like him, and root for him to succeed. Part of the reason for that is Michael J. Fox. Back to the Future is unapologetically lighthearted and upbeat - a tonic for a weary movie-going society. Like Spielberg, Zemeckis has a keen understanding of how to blend diverse elements of comedy, action, adventure, and drama into concoctions that win over audiences. Marty's story could easily have been suspenseful, purely comedic, or a three-hankie melodrama, but Zemeckis found the balance and employed it."

And the writers knew that, so they put in some dillemmas and suspenseful moments which rids the movie from any dull moments and keeps the audience's attention throughout.<br/><br/>The two central roles of Marty McFly and Dr. Emmett Brown played by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd respectively are so good! Memorable in every way even if their characterizations sound generic at first, they just play them out so well you can't dislike them.

","Michael J.

Even though there are more modern ideas that have been created about the side effects, I still think you can still enjoy Doc Browns version every time you watch, because of the way the film was made.<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite films and I'll always be able to re-watch it ever once in awhile, because of the wonderful special effects that haven't lost there touch and still look fresh, time has been good to this film (no pun intended).

","The best film ever made.<br/><br/>I really cannot convey how much I love Back to the Future. I was born in 1976 so was the perfect age for when this was released at the Cinema. I spent my pocket money on ""Back to the Future everything"" sticker book, poster, pencil case for school, skateboard, you name it! I think I saw it about 5 times at my local Cinema, and then at least another 5 on VHS when it was released. I literally bugged the guy at the Video store not to sell it to anyone else when he was done with renting it out. I saved up and bought the ex-rental video from him when he got a new copy and watched it pretty much constantly!<br/><br/>Everything about BttF is perfect. The story, the cast, the score, the locations, the De Lorean! BttF is a pure time-capsule (no pun intended) that whisks me back to being 9 years old again.<br/><br/>Michael J Fox is wonderful as Marty in his break-out movie role, and I cannot imagine anyone else playing the role of Doc Brown with the perfection that Christopher Lloyd did. The rest of the cast are also extremely strong, everyone brings their game here to make the best film possible, and it shows.<br/><br/>Both Bob's (Zemeckis and Gale) created absolute magic and captured it on film, there will literally never be another one like this. I know Bob Zemeckis was awarded the best director Oscar for Forrest Gump, but for me, Back to the Future will always be his crowning achievement. Alan Silvestri and Huey Lewis and the News added the cherry to the top of this wonderful cake with their fantastic score and music contributions! We also cannot forget Steven Spielberg, without him, Back to the Future may never have been made.<br/><br/>If you are any kind of movie fan then BttF is a must. The fun and downright excellence of this film just shines through in every scene, it is infectious. You can tell that everyone had a great time making it!<br/><br/>BttF also has the best cliff-hanger third act of any film I have ever seen! I still sit on the edge of my seat even now, and I must have seen it 50 times (Will Marty and Doc's plan succeed?).<br/><br/>I showed it to my 7 year old son last weekend, and whilst he did not understand all of it, he loved watching it. There is a reason why Back to the Future became wildly popular, has stood the test of time, and is loved by different generations all around the world. The reason is because it takes the viewer through every emotion that a great film should, one moment you are basking in the cool of it all, the next you are laughing, the next you are on the edge of your seat. That, is visual storytelling at it's best!<br/><br/>Extra bonus points must be awarded for making the Time Machine a DeLorean, this was an inspired and genius idea. The design of the Time Machine is second to none, it looks exactly like you would think a Time Machine should, and is, by my reckoning, the coolest car in cinema history. Pulling a car with such a troubled history from relative obscurity, and turning it into one of the most recognizable in the world was a master-stroke.<br/><br/>I think being there in 1985 the first time around gives me a particularly special relationship with Back to the Future, but everyone should see it at least once, as I said, I think it is the best film ever made, and the collective work is the best trilogy ever made!<br/><br/>Thank you to everyone who came together to make the Back to the Future trilogy happen. You gave us something really incredible, unique, and timeless!"

"jacobhunt6","8","0","0","29 April 2019"," A great film for light viewing, a blockbuster classic
","Back to the Future is an example of some of the most thoroughly-planned filmmaking in history. It is an often-expressed sentiment that in film and theatre, everything that happens should have significance, and this trilogy, and particularly the first chapter, are an example of exactly how thoroughly a good director can achieve this.
Robert Zemeckis works extremely hard to craft a film with such symmetry, motif in both visuals and dialogue, and general tight-knit cleverness, that it rightfully goes down in history as a favourite of film fans the world over.
The zany characters, particularly the performances of Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Crispin Glover and Thomas F. Wilson, are superb. Along with the parallels of dialogue and props, the characterisations of each of the recurrent leads are vital to the time travel plot, and they are achieved to perfection.
As is always the case with such philosophically complex issues as time travel, there are some gaping plot issues, however anyone willing to enjoy a film for what it is can overlook these with ease and disregard them as simple oversights in an issue that even the brightest theoretical scientists struggle to grasp properly.
The soundtrack to this film is another stand-out, with catchy music both in the orchestral score and the contributions of Huey Lewis and the News and John Berry that really adds to the overall feel of the film. The entire trilogy, but particularly the first chapter is fun, bright, engaging and enjoyable for all ages, and generally a wonderfully-crafted action-adventure created with the enjoyment of the audience at heart.
Back to the Future goes down in history as one of the blockbuster greats, and for good reason. This is a fantastic film for light viewing that can be enjoyed at any time and in any place. It's a definite favourite to view on a rainy day when I'm not in the mood to do an awful lot of thinking in my film viewing."

","The 1985 movie ""Back to the Future"" is definitely a timeless - pardon the pun - classic. It truly is a movie that has withstood with the trials of time and proves to be a movie that you can watch again and again and it actually never loses its appeal or charm.<br/><br/>Writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale managed to put together a very original story here, one that captivates the audience from the very beginning and keeps a grip on the audience until the very end. The story told in ""Back to the Future"" is a story that has so many aspects and so many topics that there definitely is something that appeal to everyone in the audience; ranging from romance, action to science fiction.<br/><br/>There is a great pacing to the movie, and director Robert Zemeckis ensured that the movie never left momentum or dropped down in its pacing. This definitely made the movie all the more enjoyable and certainly ensured that the movie can be watched again and again.<br/><br/>The movie is packed with great actors and actresses. Of course the movie is so phenomenally well carried by Michael J. Fox in the lead role as Marty McFly, and he definitely made that character lovable and memorable. But right up alongside Fox was Christopher Lloyd in the memorable role as the eccentric Dr. Emmett Brown. Who can't claim to be familiar with the expression ""Great Scott!""? Furthermore, the movie also brought along Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover and Thomas F. Wilson, whom individually also brought a lot of contents to the movie with their appearances and performances.<br/><br/>I can't count the number of times that I have watched this movie, nor the other two in the franchise for that matter. But the original 1985 ""Back to the Future"" is a classic in every meaning of the word.<br/><br/>While the movie is from 1985, then the special effects still holds solid even in 2019. Sure they wear symptoms of aging, certainly, but still the special effects are quite good. And back in 1985, they were off the charts.<br/><br/>If you, for some unknown reason, never have gotten acquainted with ""Back to the Future"", then shame on you. This is a movie that you HAVE to watch. ""Back to the Future"" is one of those movies that you need to watch regardless of your age, creed and standing."

","Back to the future is a movie about a teenage boy, Marty McFly, who travels back in time to the 50's using scientist Doc Brown's experiment time machine. He travels through time in a modified DeLorean car. Things go wrong when he finds his parents back in the 50's. He had to make them fall in love with one another so the future goes as planned and he's born. If his parents don't fall in love, he won't exist.
A Lot of the movies made back then that were about teens, look like they've been set in between the 50's-70's. The clothing the people wore back in the movie portraying 50's clothing was, I think, fairly accurate. The clothing style was kind of like bowling meets disco (somewhere in between the two.) Robert Zemeckis was the director of back to the future. He's directed a ton of other movies. I've seen a few of the movies directed by him, but not a lot. I've seen A Christmas Carol, The Polar Express, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and lastly Forrest Gump. They were all super great movies and all so popular, as well as back to the future is. Forrest Gump is easily the best movie i've watched that was directed by Robert. It's more into the genre that I preferably watch whereas all the other ones are more kiddie movies (except for back to the future, that one's kinda for just about anybody, lol). What I liked about this movie was the clothing they wore in the time setting. I love movies with clothing from the 50's all the way to the 2000's really. I love to see the way clothing's changed throughout the years. I would recommend this movie to friends if they have yet to watch it. I loved the movie, always have, always will."

At no point in the movie do I feel bored, or check my watch, I'm engaged the whole way through and I'm always waiting for more.<br/><br/>The story, for those who don't know, focuses on a rebellious teenager named Marty McFly, who, after discovering that his friend, the slightly mad Dr. Emmeett Brown, has discovered time travel, turning his DeLorean into a time machine, is forced to escape after Brown is seemingly killed in a hit and run, sending him 30 years back in time to the 1950's. Once there, he seeks out the younger Doc Brown, needing to find a way Back to the Future. Along with that, he discovers the teenage versions of both his parents Lorraine and George, and after ruining his parents' first meeting, soon discovers he needs to get them together before he and his siblings all disappear forever.<br/><br/>Though there are a LOT of different character arcs, they all work themselves into the plot greatly and make it even more enjoyable and engaging to watch. Along with the characters, we get the main villain, Biff Tannen, the typical 80's jock bully who keeps getting in the way. It's funny seeing Marty accidentally getting his own mother infatuated with him as a teenager, and desperately trying to get her with his father George, who as a teenager is the typical nerdy, socially inept dweeb, and watching Marty help him find his confidence.<br/><br/>Not to mention that the score is phenomenal, on par with the Star Wars theme, the Indiana Jones theme or the Jurassic Park theme. When you hear it, you instantly remember stuff like the DeLorean, Doc Brown, the 80's.<br/><br/>This is one of my favourite movies, and I'm giving it a 10 out of 10. If you haven't seen it, I would highly recommend it."

","The adventures of the McFlies and the Tannens, as well as Professor Brown, between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, are part of the great classics of the 1980s. In this first episode, we discover Marty and his family, Jennifer Parker, Biff Tannen, Emmet Brown and Einstein. Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis put together a cast of anthology (the hallmark of American cinema in the 1980s) to bring to life an inventive story that travels between 1985 and 1955 with insight, humor and liveliness. Three decades later the magic still operates, both with the nostalgic of these times and new generations who discover this saga with delight."

","Back To The Future is my favorite movie. I saw it for the first time when I was 10 years old back in elementary school days.
It is a movie about time traveling. Time traveling has always been exciting and fun. It's 1985 and Marty McFly is a typical teenager who doesn't like his parents and who has some problems at school. His best friend is Doc Brown, a weird inventor of useless machines. Their acting is awesome. I think this is not only because they are talented, but also because the director wrote a great screenplay, which showed how the acting should be in the film.
Also this movie has great ups and downs, which keep the audience's attention. Overall, I strongly recommend that you see this movie."

","This is one of my favorite movies, as it is hits all of my interests. Like engineering, time travel/ conspiracies, action, and humor.
The plot of the story is great. I love how Marty goes back to his parents prime time in high school. The plot can also explain how one little effect can create a bigger problem.
History in the movie i feel like it is correct. The team to make this movie did a really good job of making one feel like they are in those two time periods that take place. The style of talk and dress looks to be accurate to that time period. Spielberg is a great director, other movies that I enjoyed watching from him include monster house, polar express, and my second favorite from him real steel. Micheal j Fox did a really good job playing the role of Marty Micfly. I don't beilive I have seen other movies from him.
My favorite part of the whole movie was the story. Time travel is so interesting to me. I also love the character of doc brown. As he is very optimistic and smart."
"torijohn33","8","0","0","8 February 2019"," A look in the past
","My favorite scene was when he gets stuck in the 1950's and his moms in love with him. I loved the pastel colors that they had. The filmmaker is telling you that they thought you could time travel and that there would be flying cars in the future. I also think the filmmaker is telling us that we dint want to be in high school with our parents. I already knew some of the music in this part of history and the cars they drove and the things they wore. Yes I have seen other movies in this part of history. Something that is similar is that we both have cars. Yes I have seen all of the back to the futures. I think that this is a good movie and I would watch movies with these actors before. I liked how it showed us the 1950's and the 1980's. I didn't like how the mom and the son had a weird relationship back in the 50's. Yes I would watch this movie outside of school because I have seen it before. I would recommend this to friends if they were into this type of film."
"fanny92","10","0","0","6 February 2019"," Childhood Movie
","This movie is a classic and one of my favorites. I used to watch it when I was little and it has always been a family favorite. It has a fun story line and a very interesting concept. It has many great scenes. One of the best scenes in the movie is when Marty, the main character, realizes that he is in 1955 instead of 1985 and he meets his dad and Biff.
This movie is about Marty, a high school student, and his friend, Dr. Brown, a scientist, who creates a time machine in the form of a car. Marty gets transported from 1985 to the past in 1955. He meets his parents who are then in high school and he has to get his mom to fall in love with his dad so that he will still exist in the future.
The history in this movie is interesting because it kind of compares the 50's era with the 80's era. I knew about both eras before; mostly what the styles in clothing were. I really like the way they compared the two eras using the contrast between Marty who was from the 80's and his parents who were from the 50's and how they interacted with each other. It made me wonder what it would be like if I went to the past and met my parents.
The director of this movie is Robert Zemeckis. I have seen a couple of the movies he has made and thought that they were well made. The main actors are Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, and Crispin Glover. I haven't seen any other movies that I know of with these actors in it, but I am familiar with the actors Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. I enjoyed all of these actors in this show and thought they did a great acting job. My favorite scene from this movie was when Marty gets hit by his grandpa's car and meets his mom for the first time as a teenager. It was a well done scene because it set up the problem that Marty had to fix.
I just overall love this movie. It brings back great memories from when I was young. It is fun to follow and it has a different plot that really makes you think about what it would be like if something similar happened to you. I would recommend this to people who like science fiction and who just want a good laugh and fun movie to watch."

"ammonrose","8","0","0","4 February 2019"," Coming Back to this Time-less Classic
","Once you've seen a show since childhood almost 10 times it's easy to say that it's flawless, however as I watched this movie for a History Through Film class, I wanted to watch it as objectively as I could without my biases.
This film contains very dynamic characters (Marty and Doc) along with a few static ones (Biff). Spielberg's writing hits its mark once again by making a story with wonder but one that we can all connect with on personal levels. This movie it very fitting of being label as a classic that everyone sees.
While this movie is great, there is a few flaws. There is that classic 1980s super close up face shots that I cannot stand. Another problem with the movie is again an issue I have with a lot of 80s era movies, which is bad sound design. The super loud sound effects with a lot of the movie consisting of yelling."

"Min111","Null","0","0","4 February 2019"," A timeless adventure
","This one was spectacular to say the least. Back to the Future couldn't do anything wrong. Everything about it was perfect from the moment it started. The great thing about this movie is that with every scene or sequence, it keeps on getting better and better, so better that it's almost hard to resist. The story is excellent - very simple to understand and follow.<br/><br/>In the movie, within the timeline, it's the year 1985, and Marty McFly travels ""Back to the Past"" to the year 1955 in spectacular fashion, and has a whole set of problems to deal and tackle with. The odds are heavily stacked against him, and at the same time, he's in a race against time to get back to his future otherwise there will be a paradox. Only one person can save him from the mess he finds himself in called Doc Brown, a ""mad"" or ""crazy"" scientist.<br/><br/>It's amazing how this movie actually unfolded. Everything fell in place ever so perfectly well - the film couldn't do much wrong. It's when they get back into the past where this movie truly excels. Everything was not just enjoyable to watch but perfect at the same time. I really liked how Marty McFly bumps into his parents, and takes on that menace called Biff. That menace, Biff, is someone nobody can forget about when they think of this movie. He was central to how everything unfolded within this movie. Let's not forget that cute dog called Einstein, who for some reason, happens to be my favourite character within the Back to the Future franchise. When people discuss about this movie, the majority will talk about Marty McFly and Doc Brown, but they seem to be forgetting that little dog, Einstein, that seem to have started this adventure in the very first place. The characters introduced in this movie, and possibly the entire series was excellent.<br/><br/>The important thing about this movie is that it can't stand alone on its own after you've seen what happens towards the end, so it's important to see the sequel called Back to the Future Part II. The fine thing about Back to the Future is that you could watch this repeatedly, and yet, never get tired of it one bit. It's a timeless adventure! Not only it's a great movie, but one of the greatest movie trilogies there is."

","I personally grew watching this movie, so I always get a bit nostalgic. One of my favorite scenes is when Marty-main character- plays the guitar. It starts out with the blues but morphs into rock. The main plot of the story is that a kid goes back in time and accidentally messes up a few things. Which he then later has to fix or his life will be all messed up. The movie was set in the 80's then changed to the 50's when Marty goes back in time. What was interesting to me about the history was one, their clothes, and two their day to day life. I have seen a lot of movies set in the 50's and few are my personal favorite. Obviously a lot has changed when it comes to our daily life, but a few things have stayed consistent. Like high school for example had almost stayed the same. The director of the film is Robert Zemeckis, I have not seen any other movies that have been directed by him. I know two actors that are in this film, Christopher Lloyd and Michael J Fox. Christopher Lloyd was Doc Brown and Michael J Fox was Marty, I have seen both of them in other movies. I love both of these actors and I think that they do an amazing job in this movie as well as others. Another favorite scene of mine is the Marty on skateboard vs Bif and truck scene. I think how they shot it as well as editing is hilarious."

","This is a really great movie and I enjoyed watching it. The ideas are inventive and original. There are great suspenseful scenes, and the overall quality of the acting and sound/special effects (considering the time of production) are really amazing. I don't see much history in it, as it is not the main focus of the movie in the first place. Marty starts out in the 1980's and ends up in the 1950's.<br/><br/>The only criticism I have is the fact that the ""scientific"" aspect of this movie is too ignored. It would have been nice to see a discussion about space-time continuum and the dangerous effects of altering the smallest things.<br/><br/>One of my favorite things about this movie is the fact that there are a lot of references to Marty's time when he goes to the 1950's. It's very entertaining. However, I do wish the social differences of the 1950's were a bigger point.<br/><br/>Overall, a really great movie and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone. It's iconic, and with good reasons."

It makes me wonder how it would be 30 years from now would be and even how it was before.

There of course minor flaws, mainly due to how the movie has aged such as the mother's makeup and the special fx/greenscreen work, but everything else is just phenomenal.

While, Robert Zemeckis definetly found a way!<br/><br/>This movie is what i can call a absolute PERFECT combination. A combination of storytelling, writing, suspense, action, effects, acting and music. All of these things are just PERFECT in this film! That's why this movie truly is one of a kind. Something that Robert Zemeckis also did brilliantly with other movies of his in the 80's and 90's, like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" or ""Forrest Gump"".<br/><br/>The movie just has this magic to it that ANYONE can enjoy, no matter who or how old you are. The main characters, Marthy and Doc Brown, are some of the most enjoyable and iconic characters in fiction to date, they are just a blast to watch! Including supporting characters, like Biff or Marthy's parents.<br/><br/>The action scenes are also enjoyable and even more with the excellent special effects and music attached to it. And the story of the film is brilliant as well.<br/><br/>Of course we've seen many time travel movies before, but the way how they did it in this one is incredible. This movie is truly a masterpiece and i can't have enough of it. I highly suggest to at least watch this movie ONCE in your lifetime, you won't regret it.

","An endearing mad scientist cracks the secret to time travel and snares his young assistant in a complicated familial paradox. Do I really need to summarize? The original Back to the Future is one of the decade's most ambitious, identifiable smash hits, a genre-straddling film that's still effective more than thirty years later.<br/><br/>With a warm, slightly off-kilter personality, fabulous characters, a craftily complex plot and a fantastic musical score, there's no shortage of reasons why it's aged so well. Perhaps most impressive is the cast; one perfect fit after another. Michael J. Fox, at the onset of his overnight fame, is equal parts driven and perplexed by the chaos surrounding his life. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover each nail double roles as deflated, defeated adults and their glowing, energetic teenage counterparts. Christopher Lloyd might be the best of them all as Doc Brown, the forever-old, slightly deranged mastermind who never completely believes he's accomplished his life's greatest goal.<br/><br/>The story has a few holes (what time-skipping adventure doesn't) and sometimes tries to be a little too cute, but such shortcomings are easily brushed aside as the large/small adventures unfold. Expertly written, directed, acted and produced, with memorable lines a'plenty and a charming, optimistic spirit, it's a well-worn favorite."

","Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale wrote a screenplay back in the 80s that was having troubles getting made. Due to earlier projects such as I WANNA HOLD YOUR HAND, 1941 and USED CARS all did not light up the box office. Once Zemeckis made ROMANCING THE STONE people in Hollywood were looking more at this writing duo and their projects. Thank God, because this was one of the best trilogies ever made!<br/><br/>Within the first 10 minutes or so of this film we see Marty McFly (excellently played by Michael J. Fox) back in 1985. He has a super-dorky dad (Cripsin Glover), drunk mom (Lea Thompson) and two older siblings (Marc McClure, Wendie Jo Sperber) who are no longer at high school, but still live at home. Not to mention his band The Pinheads were silenced at an audition for being just too darn loud. At my prom it would have been amazing to have them rock the night away. After we see the first 10-15 minutes of the film it really does start to pick up and we are introduced to his friend Doc Brown (wickedly played by Christopher Lloyd and could be his best part in his career). He has just invented a new time machine. To make a long story short McFly ends up in the time machine and travels back to 1955 when his parents were in high school. So, he has to meet the younger Doc Brown and have him send him back to the future. At the same time not trying to meet his parents or screw up their relationship in any way.<br/><br/>This really is a terrific sci-fi/comedy from 1985 that lets your imagination soar, laughter fly and emotions ride. Spawned two sequels that were also great. Also has quite an amazing score by Alan Silvestri that is in fact one of my favourites. Also has some great original tunes by Huey Lewis & the News.<br/><br/>Also starring Thomas F. Wilson who is amazing as the bully Biff and his three thug friends J.J. Cohen, Casey Siemaszko and Billy Zane. Totally a need-to-see for anyone who likes a little bit of sci-fi, because even though it is really based on time travel the sci-fi elements are not overwhelming. I have watched this and its sequels endless times over the years since I first seen it over 30 years ago. Highly recommended."

","As time goes! 
For good or bad, time puts things in their place. The current blockbuster happens to be an empty entertainment without much interest in delving into the issues that sometimes proposes. Back to the future is an example of this evolution to the current blockbuster. The themes of the film are developing roughly and put on the table interesting points but stays on the surface. The simplistic universe that proposes a priori annoying to take the movie as a serious thing but plays a lot in their favor to take it as a simple metacomedia of the time in retrospect.
BUT there are also good things, the script of the film is a masterpiece that nowadays is studied because it is so round. Its importance lies in giving coherence to science fiction that until then was left in second place.
The characters despite not being super complex are charismatic and work wonders even if they are medium interpretations.
The audiovisual narrative is quite functional and surprises me for good.
The fast paced also helps to never disconnect and invest in the plot of the film."

","When I was eight years old, my dad showed me Back to the Future for the first time, and it changed my life. Over the years, I've seen it hundreds of times, and Michael J. Fox quickly became my favorite actor ever. I love this movie so much that I've even gone to comic conventions to meet Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Tom Wilson, and Bob Gale, and I even met Crispin Glover at an Alamo Drafthouse once. This movie got me into skateboarding, and guitar playing, and it really began my fascination with the 1980s and the 1950s. Alan Silvestri's score is iconic, and so is the soundtrack featuring ""The Power of Love"" and ""Back in Time"" by Huey Lewis and the News, as well as the now iconic remakes of ""Earth Angel"" and ""Johnny B. Goode."" I have the soundtrack for this movie on vinyl as well, and it's one of the great movie soundtracks and scores. I've always been a small guy, about the size of Marty McFly/Michael J. Fox, so seeing someone like him that I could relate to made me feel cool to be short. It amazes me that Michael J. Fox did this movie with roughly four hours of sleep every night, while doing Family Ties during the day. Anyone who has been on a film set or tried memorizing lines knows that this couldn't have been easy, but hey, ""pain is temporary, film is forever."" The opening scene with the credits followed by the ""Power of Love"" scene are the perfect way to start a movie. I still re-watch this movie and catch new subtleties that I never picked up on before. When you look at the behind-the-scenes production of this movie, it's actually astounding that this turned out so perfect, especially since they ironically enough, didn't have much time. This movie is a masterpiece, especially in it's clever writing, with subtle foreshadowing in ways that remind me how they just don't make movies like this anymore. This movie has fun, and it has heart. The fact that the stakes are really so small is also a testament to the writing, because if you really think about it, the only people this whole movie would affect are Marty and his family. The stakes are so small, yet when Marty is racing to get back to the future in the finale, it is still as epic and riveting as the first time you saw it, and somehow still manages to keep me on the edge of my seat, as if I don't know what's going to happen. That's how well made this whole movie is. It's a fun, timeless movie that resonates because of the values it places on time and family."

","I've got an interesting relationship with this film, I was first introduced to it while channel flipping and stopped while the film was on. It made me laugh, cry, and jump with excitement. Ever since Zemekis has been one of my all time favorite filmmakers. Written by himself and Bob Gale, Back to the Future is a true testament to the passion project becoming a reality. Michael J. Fox delivers what is quite possibly one of his best performances ever, as well as Christopher Llyod. (who I believe deserved an Oscar nomination) The Script is highly original and inventive making the most of its time travel related story. The film also transcends the 80s teen comedy trope of bad films sitting up there with classics like Ferris Buellar and Breakfast Club unlike others. This is one of the best films ever made, and Inspires me to create art with just as much heart, humor, and passion."

"The-Sarkologist","9","0","0","24 June 2018"," A Childhood Classic
","Seriously, I haven't written a review on this film. Well I better watch it again and rectify that. I love this film, it is literally a classic from the Eighties. In fact not only is it a classic from the Eighties, and takes me back to my childhood, but it also takes our parents back to their childhood by going back in time to 1955. Okay, this film does have the potential to mess with your head, but it is still great.
 I'm not sure if I even need to run through the synopsis since I assume that everybody actually knows the plot, but then again I'm sure there are people that have basically been living in a rabbit hole who may not know anything about this film. Basically, it is about a teenage kid, Marty McFly (Micheal J Fox) who watches his friend the Mad Scientist Doc Brown get killed by Libyan terrorists (namely because they gave him some plutonium to build a bomb and instead he uses it to power the time machine) and to escape them Marty jumps into the DeLorean and inadvertently goes back in time to 1955.
 Well, you have to admit that that DeLorean is just so cool. In fact, this film is so much apart of our collective consciousness that I actually wonder whether anybody can look at a DeLorean and think of a time machine. Actually, I wonder if anybody actually went out and purchased a DeLorean with the hope that if they drove up to 88 mph they would end up going back in time? Then again, I suspect that there are some authorities that may have had a thing or two so say about that.
 Actually, there are a couple of things that baffle me, including the fact that when Marty got back to 1985 he pretty much leaves the DeLorean unlocked and parked in the middle of the road. I'm sure that there would have been people who may have wanted to take a free DeLorean with them. Then again, if it wasn't running at the time then it probably isn't much of an issue. However, at least he was smart enough to hide the DeLorean behind some bushes when he was in 1955, though there is always the suggestion that things were a lot safer, and crime a lot less back them.
 However, Hill Valley in 1985 really didn't seem to be one of those places that would be all that fun to live in. You know, the town square looks pretty shocking, and it is interesting that the old cinema has been turned into a church. Then again, a lot of churches meet in cinemas - it sort of works rather well, and the sound is also pretty good, or at least the wiring. However, I also noticed that the place next door was an adults only entertainment complex - right next to a church. Gee, I'm sure the church is happy about that.
 This is basically one of those lets go back in time and change everything, inadvertently of course, so that the rather dreary life back home actually becomes quite good, even if it really came down to a single punch. Then again, Biff Tanner really did have it coming to him, and it clearly goes to show that the guy is all talk and no action. Well not quite, but it is quite convenient that they moved all of his thugs away just as George McFly inadvertently came up to the car, expecting Marty to be in there. Of course, punching Biff really does a lot to George's self esteem.
 Oh, and then there is the principle, going around calling everybody slackers. I'm sure there is a law against that. Oh, that's right, it's 1985 and teachers could get away with demonising students. Then again, what did George do wrong? Why had he earnt the enmity of the headmaster? This guy certainly seems to have it in for him, or was it that he pretty much had it in for all of his students. Surely he knew what Biff was like anyway. Actually, the interesting thing is how the guy never actually seems to age. Okay, Marty does comment on the fact that he has never had any hair, but still, we can't quite fault the movie for having the principle look the same. However what was it, thirty years in the same job. That's literally his entire career.
 Oh, and there is another thing that I find somewhat curious. If Doc Brown is now aware that he sends Marty back in time, where does Marty go when he flees the Libyan terrorists. Honestly, I wonder if Doc Brown actually realises that the time line has already been changed with Marty going back the first time, so if Marty goes back a second time, it isn't as if he is going to keep the timeline consistent. In fact the second Marty who goes back is likely to make some more changes, and inevitably he is going to muck up the time line even more. As I come to think of it, it seems as if Doc Brown doesn't fully understand the fifth dimension, so most likely he will set the timer to the exact time that Marty comes back, which will mean that there will be two DeLoreans arriving at the same time, and Marty will meet, well, Marty.
 Anyway, this is a great movie, and it certainly brings back a lot of childhood memories. Actually, I have no idea how many times I have watched this, though I will have to say that the guy that walks around wearing 3D glasses looks pretty cool, even if he happens to be one of Biff's thugs. Then again, they do eventually get whats coming for them when they end up picking on the wrong people."

","Back to the Future is my all time favorite film and it's been so since I first saw it back in 1985. The way that director Robert Zemeckis brings all the elements of the film together seems magical today as it did back then. The film does indeed has everything: drama, romance, comedy, sci-fi and it's all brought together in such an awesome way that seems to live on way past it's time. Whether it be the fantastic Delorien, the iconic characters, the memorable score or the skillful direction, there is hardly anything about Back to the Future that does not stand out."
"bankofmarquis","10","0","0","30 March 2018"," Almost a perfect film
","I was flipping channels the other day and ran across BACK TO THE FUTURE, it was just about to start and since I hadn't seen it in quite awhile, I figured I'd catch the first part of it before venturing off to other surfing opportunities. As often happens in this sort of situation, I ended up transfixed by this film and watched the whole thing. After it was over, I asked myself why did I enjoy this film so much and my answer was fascinating (at least to me) -<br/><br/>BACK TO THE FUTURE is about as perfect of a film as there is.<br/><br/>Why? Let's start with the structure of this film. It follows the classic 3 Act structure. ACT 1: set up the premise, the gimmick (if any) and the stakes. ACT 2: escalate the stakes and throw in complications and obstacles. ACT 3: Resolve everything.<br/><br/>Seems like a pretty simple formula, right? So why do so many get it wrong? Quite simply, they don't keep it simple and then execute (almost to perfection) the simplicity of the structure. Let's break down the 3 Acts of BACK TO THE FUTURE.<br/><br/>ACT 1 - set up the premise, the gimmick and the stakes. The premise & gimmick is simple, time travel is possible and our hero travels back in time and is stranded there. The stakes are even simpler - our hero must find a way to get Back to the Future.<br/><br/>ACT 2 - escalate the stakes and throw in complicaitons and obstacles. The stakes are escalated by the fact that our hero interrupts the timeline of when his mother met his father, thus there is the very real possibility that he will cease to exist for his parents never met. Our hero must find a way to bring his mother and father together. The complications are that his parents are not the boring old fuddy-duddy's that our hero thought they were, his father is a peeping-Tom nerd and his mother is a randy high-schooler who falls in love (lust?) with our hero, her son. Further complicating things is that the time machine must find enough power to make the time travel device (the flux-capacitor!) work, power that is not readily available in this timeline. Adding one more complication to the mix is the school bully who is constantly after our hero.<br/><br/>ACT 3 - resolve everything. This is where this film excels. EVERY loose end is tied up. Our hero find a way to reunite his mother and father, the bully is put in his place, a source of energy is found and our hero's journey comes to a succesful conclusion.<br/><br/>There is much, much more to this film than those plot points, but I just wanted to show how deceptively simple and efficient this plot is. Kudo's must go out to screenwriter's Robert Zemeckis (more on him later) and Bob Gale for coming up with this idea and executing it so well. Gale (1941, KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER) said he came up with this idea when he saw his father's high school yearbook and dreamed about going back to meet him. He stated that he doubted that he and his father would have been friends.<br/><br/>An interesting side fact: The University of Southern California Film school's writing classes use the screenplay for Back to the Future as the model of ""The Perfect Screenplay"". So, I rest my case.<br/><br/>But a ""perfect"" screenplay would be worthless without near perfect execution of putting the words and actions up on the screen - and this film achieves that as well. Director (and co-screenwriter) Robert Zemeckis (WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT, FORREST GUMP) cleary had a vision of how to make this film and did not waiver from it. The action is strong, the fluidness of the film is solid and the performances are all top-notch. The only thing that might knock this film down a peg or two is some of the 32 ""special effects"" shots that - to look at it these days - seem somewhat archaic (see the flames between Doc Brown's and Marty's feet when the DeLorean first goes forward in time). But for the time, these special effects are state-of-the-art.<br/><br/>Speaking of performances, Michael J. Fox became a movie star with this film, and rightfully so. His Marty McFly is charming, quirky, intelligent, dorky - all at the same time. His uncomfortableness with his teen age mother is palatable. Credit must go with Director Zemeckis, who - after he couldn't get Fox released from his contract on the TV show FAMILY TIES - went (famously) with his 2nd choice, Eric Stoltz. When Stolt's seriousness and ""method"" acting was not meshing with the type of film he wanted to make, Zemeckis made the bold decision to fire Stoltz and worked out a deal where he can use Fox at night while Fox shot Family ties during the day. <br/><br/>Playing against Fox, brilliantly, is Christopher Lloyd as ""Doc"" Emmit Brown. A two-time Emmy winner (at the time) for playing crazy Jim Ignatowski on the TV show TAXI, Lloyd played Doc Brown as ""part Einstein, part composer Leopold Stokowski"", creating what would be the benchmark for ""brilliant, scatter-brained scientist"". Leah Thompson does the finest performance of her career as Marty's mother and Crispin Glover was beyond quirky as Marty's nerd/loser Dad. Finally Thomas F. Wilson is the embodiment of bully as ""Biff"" Tannen.<br/><br/>After the success of this film, two other BACK TO THE FUTURE films were made - films that I feel were good, but somewhat diluted the perfection of this film. No matter. Sit down, relax and enjoy one of the most ""perfect"" films ever made.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A+<br/><br/>A rare 10 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

"jarinsimon","10","0","0","9 March 2018"," Best Movie Ever
","The first Back to the Future movie is one of the greatest movies of all time. It is a classic movie, and is widely considered one of the best movies Universal Studios has ever produced, even over 30 years later. Back to the Future was the first major success of Robert Zemeckis' directing career, who would later go on to direct easily recognizable movies such as Forrest Gump, A Christmas Carol, and The Polar Express among others. Michael J. Fox plays the protagonist of the movie, Marty McFly, which is one of the coolest names I have ever heard. According to empireonline.com, Marty McFly is the 12th greatest movie character of all time, higher than Iron Man, Captain Jack Sparrow, and Gandalf. Doc Brown finds himself 20th on that same list. This movie is set in the year 1985, and takes place in the fictional town of Hill Valley, California. Marty is a 17 year old teenage boy who finds himself in a situation like any other.<br/><br/>Marty unknowingly changes the course of his life, and history, when he accidentally takes a modified Delorean car back in time using Plutonium stolen by Libyan Terrorists. These terrorists hoped to make a nuclear weapon using this plutonium, and seeked the help of Dr. Emmett Brown. Instead of making this weapon, Dr. Brown uses the plutonium to modify a Delorean spots car and turn in into a fully functional time machine.<br/><br/>There are many reasons why people should watch this movie, widely known as one of the best movies of the 1980s. The concept of time travel was a popular one, as Arnold Schwarzennegger's The Terminator having come out the year before. For Back to the Future to come out the next year, adding fuel to the time travel fire that The Terminator created. Some would argue that the Back to the Future trilogy is one of the greatest movie trilogies of all time, maybe even eclipsing those of The Godfather and Lord of the Rings. My personal favorite in the Back to the Future trilogy is the first one due to the plot twists it takes. The first time I had watched this movie, I really didn't know what to expect, but I was quickly fascinated by the intricacy of the plot. The plot is brilliantly interwoven in movie, with setups buried throughout the entire film. One of my favorite things about Back to the Future's plot is how the movie is centered on the idea of running out of time. A ticking clock is central symbol, counting down to the moment when Marty will be stranded forever in 1955, or even to the moment when Marty will actually cease to exist because he's interfered with his parents getting the chance to fall in love. I really enjoyed Back to the Future, and went on to enjoy the remaining two movies in the trilogy. Although millions have enjoyed this movie and place it high up on their ""All-Time"" lists, not everyone has a favorable opinion of this movie, as hard to believe as it may seem.<br/><br/>On the IMDB website regarding Back to the Future, it was hard to find negative reviews. Considering that Back to the Future is considered one of the greatest films ever made, that finding did not come as a surprise. One of the negative comments was that the movie did not portray the idea of time travel in a serious manner. How can one possibly expect talk about the idea of time travel to be serious in a film made with the sole purpose to entertain? Back to the Future was definitely not meant to revolutionize the science of traveling through time, and should not be criticized as such. I feel that Back to the Future is unfairly criticized for its lack of ""serious talk about time travel."" Say Stephen Hawking were involved in the production of this movie. Surely the newfound seriousness would overshadow the comedy that this movie intended to be. The humor of the movie would be lost, leaving viewers confused if they are watching a childish documentary about time travel, or if they are watching a comedy that was unsure of its own identity, jumping back and forth between humor and science."

"bowmanblue","10","0","0","26 December 2017"," As good as it ever was
","There are some films that are just timeless and everyone should watch (especially in today's climate of remakes, reboots and reimaginings). Basically, see it before it gets horribly remade with overblown computer effects and wafer-thin characters that you simply just don't care about. By now, you can probably already tell that I love this film and I'm effectively going to 'gush' about it, so if you just want to accept now that it's a definite 10/10 you might as well stop reading now. However, if you're vaguely interested as to why I think it's so - technically - perfect, then feel free to read on. In case you're one of the few people that have been living in 1955 all your life and have only just arrived in our year courtesy of a time machine, you may need to know that 'Back to the Future' is about time travelling. Marty McFly, played by the ever youthful Michael J Fox, gets caught up in eccentric inventor, Doc Brown's, latest scheme to build a time machine out of a DeLorean car. Naturally, things don't go smoothly as he inadvertently ends up in 1955 and accidentally interferes with the very moment his parents got together, therefore possibly preventing him from every being conceived. If this wasn't bad enough, he's only got a one-shot chance at returning to his own time thanks to a lightning bolt due to power his time machine for the return trip.<br/><br/>I think what makes this film stand the tests of time is the fact that it is a true 'family' film. Whereas most films which can be watched by children are largely aimed ONLY at them and force the adults to sit through it until it's over, I can't imagine anyone - male/female, young/old - not actually finding enjoyment out of this adventure. It's funny without ever being childish or vulgar, exciting without ever being over the top or unrealistic (if you're willing to suspend your disbelief enough to believe that time travel is actually possible) and, of course, it contains some of the most memorable characters ever committed to film. Naturally, our dashing young hero, Marty, is very easy to root for, however it's his cranky old sidekick 'Doc', played perfectly by Christopher Lloyd who steals every scene and is the true joy to watch all the way through. It's also worth mentioning that Marty's on-screen family also can hold their own, played different versions of themselves throughout the time periods, but special mention should go a character who should - by rights - be little more than a stereotypical bully, yet 'Biff' somehow becomes the clichéd bully that all other on-screen thugs aspire to be ever after. <br/><br/>If this film has a downside - and I'm only mentioning this because I can see that some people may have a problem with it these days (I didn't and still don't!) it's that there are a few topics of humour that some people may find a little 'edgy' in today's PC culture. For some reason I get the feeling that today any 'family' movie may shy away from a mother inadvertently falling in love with her son, but it was the eighties and things were different then!<br/><br/>There aren't many movies that still can bring a family together around the TV in the living room on Christmas Day, but this is still one of them. If you haven't already brought the entire trilogy on DVD, then watch it now and show your children. It deserves to entertain future generations. Yes, the following two 'Back to the Future' movies weren't quite so well-received by the critics, but I think they're great, too.<br/><br/>"

","Parents need to know that Back to the Future is a family time-travel favorite that includes sequences that place the hero and his friends in physical jeopardy: an attack in which a sympathetic character is thought to be killed, a van chasing a teen on a skateboard, several episodes of bullying, and more. The violence is exaggerated and closer in tone to cartoon jeopardy than real danger, but some kids will no doubt find it tense. Several scenes show the hero's discomfort when the girl who will eventually be his mother tries to entice him with kisses and embraces; there's also a scene in which the beginnings of an assault on a high school girl are shown; she struggles/expresses fear, but intervention prevents anything else from happening."

","I love Back to the Future. While having a typical 80s feel to it, which I like, I love how fun, irresistible and original the film is. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time traveling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film, or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis's direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting, Michael J Fox is really appealing in the role of Marty McFly, the role that propelled him to stardom, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are also great. Overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways."

","BACK TO THE FUTURE (1985) **** Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, Thomas F. Wilson, Marc McClure, Wendy Jo Sperber. This generation's ""It's a Wonderful Life""?

Very popular and very entertaining sci-fi comedy that made Fox a movie star after success with TV's ""Family Ties"", casting him, after Eric Stoltz was dropped, as Marty McFly who winds up in a nuclear-powered DeLorean time-machine and is sent back in time to 1955 by his quintessentially eccentric friend Dr. Emmet Brown (Lloyd doing a fine Art Carney). There he meets up with his parents to be and realizes his chance encounters have changed his future and he must see history repeat itself or perish. <br/><br/>High-concept hilarity and some truly ingenious schematics thanks to screenwriter Bob Gale and director Bob Zemeckis. Wondering what it would be like to never be born and/or what it would be like if things were different...see what I mean. Oscar- nominated song ""The Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis (who has a fun cameo) fuels this dynamo gem of a film. Classic.<br/><br/>Also Dean Cundey as DP was fantastic!

I found myself concerned about the well-being of Doc Brown when he was shot at early on in the movie. I highly recommend re-watching the movie to notice little things you might miss the first time. Pay attention to the opening scene inside Doc Brown's place. All in all I enjoy watching this movie on more than one occasion. Enjoyed the references they make to a certain musician as well.

","The film Back to The Future was released in the US in 1985, and starred Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly, a high school student who is unlikely friends with Doctor ""Doc"" Emmet Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd. Doc is an eccentric inventor, who has created what he hopes to be the first ever time machine out of a DeLorean. Marty is documenting the unveiling of the time machine with Doc in the Twin Pines mall parking lot, when Doc is hunted down by the terrorists he stole the plutonium from that he needed to fuel his machine with. After Doc is gunned down by the terrorists, Marty has to flee for his life, so he jumps in the DeLorean, and accidentally speeds back in time to 1955. He meets up with a 30-year younger Doc, who has not yet invented the time machine, and mistakenly bumps into his parents, George (Crispin Glover) and Lorraine (Lea Thompson), before they were supposed to have met. He disrupts the sequence of events that should have led to them getting married, and so has to try to match them up before his own existence is put in jeopardy. He also has to help Doc fix the DeLorean so he can get back to 1985, all before it's too late. <br/><br/>The theme of this film is courage vs. fear. Marty and his band, The Pinheads, try out for his school's Battle of the Bands, and they're turned away because they're ""too loud"". He tells girlfriend Jennifer (Claudia Wells) that he's never going to get to play in front of anyone. She tells him he needs to send his audition tape to the radio station, but he's afraid his band will be rejected, and doesn't think he could handle the rejection. He's afraid to even try because of the possibility of failing. <br/><br/>Later, when Marty goes back to 1955 and sees that Lorraine is interested in him instead of his father, the way it should be, he tries to get George to ask Lorraine out. George doesn't even want to ask her for fear of her possibly saying no. But when George overcomes his fear and stands up to Biff to save Lorraine, she falls in love with him for his courage. <br/><br/>This is a similar theme to the theme in the film It's a Wonderful Life, when George Bailey (James Stewart) is taken to a time when he was never born, and he sees the impact he has had on his town and the people around him. It gives him the courage to stand up to the evil businessman, Mr. Potter, and do the right thing. <br/><br/>The special effects and studio sets made the film not only more enjoyable to watch, but helped to make the story line more believable while you watch it. Filmed in the 1980s, the special effects aren't nearly as high-tech as what we have today, but were very good for the time, and still make the time machine scenes very exciting. <br/><br/>The film score, composed by Alan Silvestri, also helps to set the mood of the film, especially when the triumphant theme comes in during actions sequences, or when Marty or George are doing something particularly brave. The music makes you feel excited and victorious, and heightens the emotions in the film.<br/><br/>Back to The Future is a great movie about making good life choices, doing the right thing, and standing up for yourself. Marty is able to go back in time to help his father stand up for himself and be courageous, and they both end up being better people for it. This film always has something great to teach every time I watch it."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","0","0","22 March 2017"," The greatness of 'Back to the Future' is both obvious and defies explanation
","""Back to the Future"" is a quintessential '80s movie and '50s throwback that's fun for people of any and all ages, but it's also the first film to harness the concept of time travel in a universally human way.<br/><br/>Time travel is both a critical and unessential part of the movie. Nearly everything that makes the movie fun and interesting comes from the time travel conceit, but the reason Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) travels into the past is accidental. Instead of traveling into the past to improve his life or fix a mistake – a much more obvious kind of wish fulfillment – Marty is inadvertently forced to save someone else's life, and ultimately preserve his own existence.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale aren't necessarily searching for something profound with their screenplay, which is kind of what makes its deeply resonant and occasionally insightful moments so much more effective. The joy of watching the film is being entertained by the fun of it all and kind of incidentally uncovering the moments that move you or make you think with each viewing. Before you know it, you're biting your nails waiting for Marty to patch everything up in the space-time continuum and make it to the clock tower on time. Zemeckis' direction isn't particularly noteworthy, but he really works the emotional turning points of the script, maximizing the ""payoff moments"" for the audience.<br/><br/>The cultural phenomenon of it all starts with Marty McFly. It's crazy to think that filming had been going on for weeks with Eric Stoltz playing Marty and only when that didn't work out did Fox get the part. He just exudes cool and in a timeless manner that allows ""Back to the Future"" to hold up more than 30 years later. He's tremendously likable, he rides a skateboard in an awesome way that we still haven't seen in the movies since, and he's brazen and defiant of authority in the way that most teenagers only dream of. Outcasts in the '50s couldn't stand up to bullies like Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) yet Marty does and becomes an instant hero in the eyes of anyone who's ever been bullied.<br/><br/>The dynamic between Marty and the teenage version of his father, George (Crispin Glover) lies at the heart of the ""Back to the Future."" Although their relationship could definitely have been given more attention in the present day scenes, the fact that we know he's a man who gets completely walked over as an adult suffices. Really, it's George we identify with – the science-fiction nerd who struggles with rejection – and Marty represents the confident version of ourselves we so often strive to be. The wish fulfillment of the movie is about seeing the physical embodiment of that projection of ourselves (in Marty) making the weak George a stronger person.<br/><br/>Marty's reactions with his younger mother (Lea Thompson) go the more comical, Oedipal route, but also there is this idea that our parents were teenagers too once, and they had their own struggles with contemporary living and authority. The fact that Marty has to help her and his father fall in love requires the kind of empathy we so rarely have for our parents as teenagers, and so much of the emotion of the film comes from watching that play out (not to mention the wish fulfillment of the popular Lorraine falling for the meek George).<br/><br/>Then there's Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd), who is essentially the movie's mascot. He's thought of as a main character and everything builds toward saving him, but he's not all that integral to the human element of the story. He facilitates a lot of exposition, however, and it's his compassion toward Marty in the '50s timeline that endear us to him as much as it is his memorable lines, fabulous expressions and winks toward the camera. <br/><br/>The iconography of the film really defies explanation. The DeLorean, Marty's outfit/skateboarding, the Huey Lewis soundtrack and, most importantly, Marty rocking out to ""Johnny B. Goode"" at the Enchantment Under the Sea dance, are so effortlessly perfect yet inessential components to the film's success. What this suggests is that the right combination of story and talent can infuse even the smallest details of a film with a paradigmatic energy that makes that detail feel classic or quintessential. In spite of stalling the plot, the ""Johnny B. Goode"" scene works because of the schism in time rooted in the time travel story. Marty's line ""your kids are gonna love it"" perfectly encapsulates that sentiment.<br/><br/>In this way and others, ""Back to the Future"" defies most models of great filmmaking. It both captured the zeitgeist of its era (and of the '50s) while creating its own. Its footprint on culture is unmistakably large and its timelessness is both mystifying and yet ingeniously apropos.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"
"matthewceratops","10","0","0","20 March 2017"," A masterpiece at any time
","Quite possibly, and quite probably, my favourite film of all time is ""Back to the Future"", released on 3 July 1985, directed by Robert Zemeckis, and written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale. The film stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson, and Crispin Glover, and features a score composed by Alan Silvestri. ​<br/><br/>Writing is an essential part of filmmaking, and the script in ""Back to the Future"" is nearly a perfect one. Of course, in a time travel film, the appearance of inconsistencies, paradoxes, and other similar errors are almost inevitable. But, on first viewing ""Back to the Future"", and even for subsequent viewings, these plot holes aren't very noticeable due to the engaging story. The film explains the science of its time travel perfectly, with lengthy but fast- paced exposition. ​<br/><br/>Marty, played by Michael J. Fox, is a likable and relatable protagonist. At the time of filming, Fox was busy working on the NBC sitcom ""Family Ties"", and so director Robert Zemeckis and producer Bob Gale hired young actor Eric Stoltz to fill in the part. A few weeks into filming, Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg decided that Stoltz just wasn't the actor they needed. Pushing back the film's release date and adding $3 million to its budget, they recast Fox as Marty under the condition that Fox would work on ""Family Ties"" during the day and ""Back to the Future"" at night. Fox often slept on the way to the film's shooting locations.<br/><br/>Doc Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd, is both interesting and funny to watch. His long explanations of his work, along with his misunderstandings of what the future is like, make for plenty of amusing and intriguing dialogue. George McFly, played by Crispin Glover, is likable in his awkwardness and inflections. ​<br/><br/>The film's antagonist, Biff Tannen, played by Thomas F. Wilson is a fantastically well-acted character that a viewer loves to hate. His arrogant nature and loudmouth remarks easily allow the audience to want to see him defeated by the end of the movie. The beautiful Lorraine Baines-McFly, played by Lea Thompson, also offers a great performance, both as her teenage and middle-aged selves, adding more comedy to the table. ​<br/><br/>The music for the film is also spectacular. The score to ""Back to the Future"" was composed by Alan Silvestri. Silvestri's compositions for the film are orchestrated expertly, and the main theme carries a sense of adventure and awe. The songs ""The Power of Love"" and ""Back in Time"" by Huey Lewis and the News, created specifically for this film, fit well and are great to listen to on their own. The tracks covered by the fictional band Marvin Berry and the Starlighters are excellent renditions of the real-life oldies. ""Earth Angel (Will You Be Mine)"", originally by the Penguins, earned actor Harry Waters, Jr. a gold record certification, and rightly so. Chuck Berry's famous rock and roll tune ""Johnny B. Goode"" (performed in the film by Marty McFly, but dubbed over by Mark Campbell) adds a great musical scene and leads to a terrific comedic moment. ​<br/><br/>The visual effects work in the film is always a treat. Three DeLorean cars were purchased to be modified for the film. The DeLorean time machine was designed by Ron Cobb, Andrew Probert, and Michael Scheffe, while effects supervisor Kevin Pike helped build the time machines. The flying DeLorean at the end of the film was created by the wonderful people at Industrial Light & Magic.<br/><br/>The DeLorean is an aesthetically cool-looking car, and a far better choice than what was originally intended. When envisioning the film, Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale had a time machine made from a fridge in mind. They decided to pass on the idea, since it could lead to inspired children getting stuck in refrigerators. The film's title was even a stroke of genius that had some concept issues. Sid Sheinberg, head of Universal Pictures, made some helpful alterations to the script, but insisted that the film be called Spaceman from Pluto. Subsequently, Steven Spielberg sent him a memo that implied that the crew thought it was a joke, and Sheinberg decided sheepishly to drop the idea.<br/><br/>The set of Hill Valley was shot at the Courthouse Square backlot of Universal Studios. It was used in numerous films aside from ""Back to the Future"", including ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (1962) and ""Gremlins"" (1984). The scenes in the film that took place during 1955 were shot first in the beautified backlot. For the scenes in 1985, the crew simply trashed and uglified the square, like leaving garbage on the streets and replacing classic motion pictures on a movie theatre sign with sleazy titles. Industrial Light & Magic animation supervisor Wes Takahashi created the lightning effects for the climactic clock tower scene by hand, which is an impressive and awesome-looking achievement. ​<br/><br/>In finality, ""Back to the Future"" is a contemporary classic. Its acting, direction, music, visual effects, editing, sound mixing, and most importantly, screen writing, all lend to it being an engaging, story-and-character driven film. It has marvelous foreshadowing, superb character development, and a well-structured story without any unnecessary scene; whatever few problems it could have are insignificant, and there may be no film I enjoy more."

","""Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?"" Yes Marty McFly, in fact, that is your famous quote from one of the best movies, Back to the Future. Ever since I saw this movie, it has always been one of my favorites. Everything about this movie is great, from the cast, to the story, to the many marvelous one- liners. With all that being said, let us travel back to 1985 and Marty McFly's misadventures in Back to the Future!<br/><br/>Marty McFly is a 1985 teenager who is called on by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown to come to the mall at 1:30 am to see his latest invention. Apparently, using plutonium that he stole, Doc was able to harness the power of the material to power a DeLorean car. The catch, the DeLorean is a time machine. However, Doc is shot down by the terrorists whom he stole the plutonium from. Marty gets in the DeLorean and attempts to escape. However, he accidentally gets up to 88 mph, and is transported back to 1955. Marty thinks he is in a dream, until he comes across the future mayor as a sweeper in a diner. Marty then finds his dad, and interferes with his meeting with his mom. Suddenly, Marty finds his mom, who seems to have the hots for him. Marty is able to find Doc and gets Doc to believe that he is from the future. Doc tells Marty that his interference with his parents meeting might cause him to never exist. Marty plans to get his parents together while allowing Doc to get him back to 1985. They eventually come up with a plan: using the exact time that a bolt of lightning will strike the clock tower, Doc will set up a wire that will transport the lightning's power into the DeLorean as it reaches 88 mph, sending Marty back to the future. At the Enchantment Under the Sea dance, Marty is able to get his parents together, and his plan to warn Doc that he will be killed that night in 1985 fails as Doc tears up the letter saying it will be catastrophic in the space-time continuum. Their plan is a success, and Marty is transported back to 1985. To his surprise, Doc taped Marty's note back together and wore a bullet-proof vest to protect himself. When Marty asks for an explanation, Doc says ""I figured, what the hell.""<br/><br/>What makes this movie great? Let's start with the cast. Without a doubt, Marty McFly and Doc Brown are two of the best movie leads ever! They have great chemistry together, and both pull off some very memorable one-liners. My personal favorite is Doc's line: ""Great Scott!"" The supporting cast is also great. Marty's dad and mom are very quirky and very funny. Some of the scenes, like when Marty disguises himself as Darth Vader from Planet Vulcan, are some of my favorites ever in any movie.<br/><br/>The story of the film is also very inventive. This was the definitive time travel movie, and still is to this day. Loaded with some still impressive special effects, the story is very real and an absolute gem to watch.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Back to the Future is an instant classic film. With great characters, an extremely inventive story, and eye-popping effects, Back to the Future has truly supplanted itself among some of the best movies of all time. While it is only #12 on my personal favorite movies list, there is no doubt that this is a movie that anyone can pick up and watch. Back to the Future gets a 9/10!!! See this movie if you have not!!!"

Any age can enjoy it, as it isn't too dumb for adults and isn't too smart for children. Every character has a unique purpose, so the movie doesn't feel bare or overcrowded.

","Back to the Future is one of those classic films that you'll remember for years to come. Marty Mcfly (Michael J. Fox), an American teenager living in the 80's gets sent back thirty years to 1955 in a silver DeLorean that is actually a time machine. With the help of Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), the creator of the time machine, Marty must make sure his teenage parents fall in love so that he will return to the future and regular life.<br/><br/>One of the themes that came to mind quickly is that Marty sees his father (Crispin Glover) when he was a teenager completely different then he sees him now. So, the theme revolves around, would Marty have been friends with his father when he was the same age and gone to school together? Marty sees his dad as a scared person that told on people when they did something wrong. He was terrified of Lorraine, which is Marty's mom in the present. At the beginning of the movie, Marty had a firm mind-set of his father, but when he traveled back in time to see his father as a teenager, that all changed.<br/><br/>One of the techniques that was used in the film that really stood out to me was the sound effects. Especially in the scene where Marty is being chased on the hover boards, the sound effects that were put in place for when Marty was pushing himself with his foot and when the hover board was ""flying"" were appropriate for the action scene. Also, when the DeLorean was going back in time, the sound effects that were used to give you the elution that he was zooming through time was perfect for the overall affect."
"hoyt08","9","0","0","11 December 2016"," Back to the Future Review
","There are some movies that you can view again and again especially when you grew up in the 80's. The films that came to mind also helped me remember childhood memories from the first viewing of Top Gun, Beetle Juice, The Breakfast Club, and the movie I most recently viewed Back to the Future with Michael J. Fox. As I viewed Back to the Future again, I could view the components that kept my attention back from younger years and even to this day. The movie's central focus was on a teenager, Marty that had a crazy scientist friend Dr. Brown. Although he was told not to associate with the scientist by the principle, Marty being the typical teenager, that didn't stop him. The story goes on leading you through scenes of the upbeat life style of a teenager of the 80's ridding his skate board as the sound of rock-n-roll music drowned all noises except the his interactions with his parents and a bully named Biff. The excitement rises as Marty goes to visit Dr. Brown, clocks ticking, alarms sounding, music sets the emotion of excitement. Marty meets up with Dr. Brown and witnesses the Dr.'s latest experiment called time travel. The theme is pronounced throughout the movie. Director, Robert Zemeckis introduces the characters and their change with time only in reverse. The first introduction of the characters playing Marty's parents are in a present time, 1985. Stories are vocalized by the mother of how the she first met their father George, ugh. Marty and his sister, Linda are very tired of listening to this story. Editing brings this scene to the viewer's attention using outside/in, leading you into another scene further in the movie. Lighting of the film was appropriately placed as scenes changed, from time travel full of sound and colors to the settings of past, 1955 colors to the more flaming colors of the present, 1985. The excitement begins when Marty witnesses Dr. Brown being shot by foreign terrorists. The dramatic sound as shots being fired, music tone drops in the scene only to transition to a faster tempo matched the pace with the scene as the terrorists begin to chase after Marty. Marty jumps into the DeLorean/ time machine and the chase begins. Continued are angled views through Marty's eyes of the digital displayed date and year with another date and year set back to 1955. The sounds of screeching tires and gun shots along with a fast-paced music sets for excited emotions with Marty speeding from his predators. The focus changes quickly and the angle of the speedometer comes to focus as it reaches 88 mph and with the sounds of a screeching swoosh, as the burning flames ignite sending Marty back in time. Upon his arrival in 1955, unexpectedly Marty is lead to his parents in the time they were teenagers. As the story proceeds it gathers your thoughts from a previous transition of editing scenes from the introduction and conversations of how the parents met. Marty, accidentally runs into his father, George at the town's local dinner. Curiosity leads Marty to follow George as he leaves, setting the transition of editing back to the time when George was hit by a car and met his mother. Only leading into more action. Marty interacts with the past occurrence and pushes his father to safety and gets hit by the car himself. Scenes begin to twist with the time, as his mother, Lorraine is introduced as a teenager to Marty who is now in place of George, as his mother, Lorraine now develops a crush on Marty. Conflicting thoughts and transitional emotions of the Marty taking place of George with is Lorraine. Marty must re-start time or find a way of bring his parents back to the first time they met or the family will disappear in the present time, 1985. The director doesn't let go of the movie's theme from scene to scene with the continued views of clocks and sounds of ticking, transitioning from the development of change from time and place. The director uses adult and teenage ethics and thoughts that change the emotional views through the movie. The action and excitement kept my attention from the first time I saw the movie to the most recent time. Even with a new-found viewing I've learning from the class of Film Appreciation. As I analyzed my viewing, I found the movie was one that I enjoyed to watch and continue to find entertaining. Back to the Future (1985) continues to be a movie to be viewed."
"gamby-04545","8","0","0","9 December 2016"," Back to the Future
","Back to the Future, is a highly enjoyable movie. That can be enjoyed,and appreciated, by both adults and children. The two main characters,Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, and Emmett Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd, showed me they had great chemistry together. Swear words, where said in moderation. Compared to some movies, I have saw, the language in this movie, is like words, from a Church Hymnal. And as far as any violence in this movie, it was in the same category as a ""Road Runner,"" and ""Coyote,"" cartoon. To keep from sounding like a hypocrite, I would take my kids to this movie. (I am sure, they heard swear words before). So much for the language. I loved the sound effects, as well as the special effects, of this movie. It was sort of accelerating to hear, those lightning bolts crackle. And to see, that time vortex swirling around. It almost had me feel as though, I was being whisk into the future. The performances of Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, and Lea Thompson, who played Lorraine Mcfly. And Crispin Glover, who played George Mcfly were excellent. Especially, Crispin Glover, who kept this movie, on the right track. Even though, this move has a PG rating, parents should be for-warned, that there are some contents, of sexual nature in this movie. I personally think that Back to the Future, should have had a PG-13 rating. Oh, I know that it was not so sexually explicit, that it would be condemned by the Vatican. But, I am just putting myself, in the minds of some parents. And I also know, you can't please everybody all the time. Speaking for myself, I do not have a ""Hollier than thou""attitude, about this movie. Back to the Future, is a fun movie. To put this movie in perspective. I would recommend, taking the entire family to see Back to the Future. And I can almost guarantee, that your kids will not leave the theater corrupted."

","Back to the Future (1985) is one of my favorite sci-fi adventure comedies of all times. Directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale. I first seen this film when it came out in the 80's. I have watched it several times since then, as well as the 2 sequels. I watched this film again for my Art of Films class and was just as entertained this time as all the other times I had seen it; it never gets old.<br/><br/>Michael J Fox, one of my favorite actors, plays the role of Marty McFly. Marty is a 17-year-old teenage boy who travels back in time to 1955 by jumping into the DeLorean when trying to escape from the men that shot his friend Dr. Emmet Brown, who is played by Christopher Lloyd. <br/><br/>The action and suspense throughout this movie still excites me to this day. The film gives you the feeling of being part of the movie by relating you to the characters. Teenagers today can relate to Marty and his feelings of his parents. It is hard to imagine your parents being anything but your parents. This film is filled with moral implications such as the consequences that can happen when you bully others and the social problems that we all deal with in high school."
"jasonleestepp","8","0","0","4 December 2016"," The Growing Awareness of Marty McFly
","Few other movies, such as Goonies and Ghostbusters, may be as quintessentially representative of the 1980's as Back to the Future. The stories central focus is on everyday 1980's teen Marty McFly, played by the charismatic Michael J. Fox, who is sent back in time by Dr. Emmet Brown who is played in a career-defining performance by Christopher Lloyd. After Marty arrived in 1955, he accidentally interferes with the events that would bring his parents together and spends the rest of the movie trying to correct this mistake while also working with 1955's Dr. Brown to figure out a way to get home. While this film is mostly a plot driven good time, there is a theme of growing awareness that threads throughout the movie.<br/><br/>While many movies in the 80's focused on the coming of age of teenagers, such as The Goonies or Stand by Me, Back to the Future puts a slightly different twist on this theme. When we are introduced to Marty he is an ordinary teen who is reckless, likes to drink, play rock and roll, and give his parents attitude. We see this lack of respect or understanding of his parents in the dinner scene early in the movie. Then Marty is thrust back in time. While going through the process of trying to reconcile his interference with his parent's meeting, he gains an understanding of how his parents became the people they are in the future. Back to the Future puts a twist on the coming of age story here because they put Marty in the parental role who is increasing his awareness, but we also see his parents, played by Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover, come of age as well. We see Marty develop while he takes over the parental role in scenes where he is trying to instill confidence in his father or when he is getting on his mother for drinking and smoking. This latter instance results in his mother stating that Marty is acting like her mother.<br/><br/>The director, Robert Zemeckis, then uses the static versus dynamic character technique to demonstrate Marty's parent's growth. The bully Biff Tannen is a very static character. As the movie progresses, he doesn't demonstrate the capability for growth. In contrast, Marty's father George does grow as he eventually becomes more self-confident and stands up to Biff. Zemeckis also uses the motif of time to stress the theme of growing awareness. Throughout the movie, we see images of clocks, hear clocks ticking, and hear clock alarms going off. This motif causes the viewer to be very aware of the passage of time which is associated with growing wiser.<br/><br/>This theme is very effective throughout the film until the end. I think it would have been more impactful if Marty returned to the same home life he had at the beginning of the movie having gained an appreciation of who is parents are, but instead he is rewarded with the perfect life. Even though I believe the ending could have been changed to strengthen the theme of growing awareness, it is the movie's ability to resonate with viewers, who are all too aware of the passage of time and the lessons of life, that will allow Back to the Future to continue being a classic that will be revisited for generations."
"CinematicInceptions","7","0","0","28 October 2016"," Has some implausibilities, but is nonetheless amusing.
","This is total conjecture, but I don't think that the story of this movie would hold up with modern audiences. Nowadays, we all find plot holes and reasons why certain parts of a story aren't true to life or human nature. Put Back to the Future under that kind of scrutiny, and I don't think it passes the test. I guess people just didn't watch movies that way back in the '80's. They didn't care that all of Marty's dreams magically came true at the end in Disney fashion; they just wanted to have a good laugh and have another thing to quote. This may be a very shallow view of the '80's, but the fact remains that audience expectations have changed drastically in the past 30 years. Even if you look at how the time travel element is handled in this and in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, compared to how it's used in Interstellar and X-Men: Days of Future Past, there are major differences.<br/><br/>Regardless, it's easy to see why this became a classic and resonated with it's viewers. It has a fairly interesting plot, but is very easy to follow. It also has a lot of fun lines and exciting scenes. The use of setups and payoffs and callback devices is done very well. It may be a bit on the nose in displaying the similarities and differences from '85 to '55, but this fits with its identity as a comedy and saves the audience lots of confusion. The exposition in the beginning is also vital to nearly all of the ironic and humorous situations that payoff in the 1955 setting. However, all of the events discussed in 1985 all conveniently happened during the same week in 1955, which is hardly plausible. That aside, it is impressive that the writers were able to squeeze that much information into the first twenty minutes in such a way that it would be easy to recall.<br/><br/>But what we care about most when watching a movie like this is whether it makes us laugh. Any comedy can be mostly excused for its plot holes if it succeeds in amusing the audience, and I would say that Back to the Future succeeds for the most part. It may not be gut-wrenchingly funny, but it is nonetheless amusing throughout. If nothing else, it is interesting to see how Marty interferes with his past and how he discovers just how unbelievably sad his parents' relationship is.<br/><br/>This makes for a pretty good all-ages comedy. It's easy for even the youngest of viewers to understand. There's a bit of language and sexual tension, but all of the awkward scenes between Marty and his younger parents are done in such a way that the awkwardness is palpable without being raunchy or gross. There aren't any plot holes, per se, but there are a number of clichÃ©d moments at the end and a few implausibilities in how the time travel works. Obviously, Marty's world wouldn't necessarily be better after his trip, and it's still quite possible that he wouldn't have been born or turned out the same way. But it keeps things simple and adds a nice little cherry on top. If you haven't seen this, just be aware that it is loved as a classic comedy and did not achieve its status by great execution. Certainly it is superior in many ways to other '80's comedies, but it might seem overrated to a modern viewer. Overall Rating: 8.2/10."

","One of the most iconic movies of the 80s . I was born in 88 but i seen this movie a lot, and Michael J Fox just kills it when he plays Marty McFly. Its also hilarious how his mother in the 50's calls him Calvin Klien because of whats on his underpants. I also love it when doc brown says that he needs 1.21 gigglewats to make the car go .If you also a fan of Drake and josh they even made a reference to the car in the Christmas episode movie. My favorite scene is at the dance scene where George finally stands up to Biff and punches him, and kisses Lorane to finally make things right . I also love the song Earth Angel .Even if your not a 80s kid you should definitely check it out. Because its such a great film to make it a movie night."

"AlsExGal","9","0","0","5 August 2016"," Lots of fun, just don't think too hard
","Why will this film be remembered? Well, I'd say the strength and chemistry of the characters alone makes it an eight. This film was perfectly cast even down to the supporting characters. Then there is that marvelous score that reflects the atmosphere and energy of the entire film and is immediately recognizable. And although the overall ground of time travel has been trodden before, this one addresses time travel and its implications on so many levels. There is the main story arc, but then there are lots of little ripples going out to the universe as a result of the present interacting with the past that you may have to watch it several times to catch all of the changes and all of the jokes.<br/><br/>Besides time travel, this one merges in questions about self-esteem and how it is built or destroyed, and how it changes things to EARN the girl instead of having her handed to you through a trick of fate and actually your own moral failings, along with some great action scenes and edge of your chair suspense. Also, it demonstrates what you've always suspected - that your parents were probably quite different as teenagers than they have told you. Heck, they probably even THINK they are telling you the truth! <br/><br/>Still there is some stuff that just bugs me - just enough to knock one star off of the film from a perfect ten. Someone smart enough to build a time machine (Christopher Lloyd as the loopy Dr. Brown) does not know that Christ was not born on 12/25/0000? People being erased from existence in order of birth as a result of messing up the past? And why would George hang around in a town working at a job where Biff, the town bully, continues to dog him for thirty years past high school? Why not leave town, or at least spike Biff's drink with some untraceable poison at the company Christmas party that produces a death that looks like a heart attack while George laughs maniacally (in private of course)? But now we are talking a different genre of film aren't we? Plus, why are Marty's brother and sister exactly how you would expect them to turn out given Dad's lack of self esteem and mom's unhappiness with her situation, but Marty has turned out to be this normal kid, an apple falling far from the tree? And I really think that Chuck Berry wrote every song he wrote without any help from a time traveler. The only answer to all of these questions but the Christmas one is that these things have to happen or else the story cannot play out as cleverly as it does. I'll let you watch and see how it plays out.<br/><br/>But first I have to set up the story for you. Michael J. Fox plays Marty, a normal kid who hails from a dysfunctional family of underachievers, and whose parents sole reason for being married seems to be that mom's father ran over dad with his car. Marty befriends Doc Brown, a guy who over the years has sold the entire family fortune he inherited in building his time machine. He finally accomplishes this, but to do so he needs plutonium, which he steals from some Libyans. Unfortunately the Libyans show up at the Twin Pines Mall where doc and Marty are about to give the time machine a test drive - it is in automobile form, a DeLorean to be specific. To get away from the terrorists, Marty has to use the time machine as a getaway car. In the process he crosses the speed threshold that sends the time machine into the date it was last programmed for, which happens to be the date his parents met back in 1955. Marty's only hope is to go find his friend Doc Brown, as a young man, in hopes Doc can help him, even as Doc lies dead in 1985, shot by the Libyans. Well, it gets complicated, but you'll enjoy every minute of this film that manages to be so 80's even when it is in the 50s."

","I was definitely late to the party on this one. I missed out on watching this at anytime over the past 26 years of my life, and I also missed watching it during the anniversary event in October 2015. I believe the adage is ""better late than never"", I hope it is anyway. No matter how late I was to this film, I'm glad I watched it. Back to the Future was a wonderful tale of ingenuity, diligence, and retribution. Michael J. Fox teams up with Christopher Lloyd in a quest finish his greatest invention and freely travel the realms of time.<br/><br/>Our story begins in 1985, as we are introduced to Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), a quintessential American teenager, forever embarrassed of his parents and seeking independence. His friendship with the zany Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is well- established as he is in tuned to the many experiments he is in the process of developing. When Doc is ready to unveil his creation, he asks Marty to meet him at the mall in the middle of the night. Shocked at Doc's explanation that he has uncovered the secret ingredient needed to power his time machine, Marty is intrigued. When a terrible accident takes place, Marty is accidentally send to November 12th, 1955 where his entire existence hangs in the balance, as he must be sure that his parents to-be meet and fall in love, in spite of the fact that his entry into the past has disrupted this. The audience accompanies Marty through a nostalgic look at life in the 50's, and all that Marty introduces to the past. Marty's trip culminates with a big finale that must spark him back to his present.<br/><br/>No one talks about Back to the Future without mentioning the incredible on-screen chemistry between Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. Despite their vast differences in age, they pull off a believable well-established friendship beautifully on-screen. Several scenes throughout involve just the two of them, a type of movie in which chemistry is crucial. Another bright spot of the film is the shooting. With many special effects, especially in the climax, it needs to be believable or the story would fall apart. Robert Zemeckis obviously directs a beauty with Back to the Future and is a joy for audiences from beginning to end.<br/><br/>A powerful message emerges as one watches Back to the Future. Many of the film's leads at one point has their character questioned. At the beginning of the film we meet George McFly (Crispin Glover), who doesn't look like he's strayed far from the 1950's even in the 80's. He is getting pushed around in the film, like he has all of his life, and seems to be destined for a life filled with this type of abuse. He seems to have no respect from his family members, or anyone else that comes into contact with him. Marty shows us, through his journey that sometime all it takes to make someone realize they deserve better is a little confidence from a friend. We also learn early on in the film that Marty has a passion for music and a dream to pursue it. He gets a big chance to realize this musical dream at his parent's dance in the past. He convinces his dad to pursue his own writing dream when he visits him in 1955, and seeing his father's dream pan out, one can only assume Marty will take his own advice in the future. One can also take a lesson from Doc Brown's perseverance throughout the film. He is never appreciated for his ingenuity, and often thought of as crazy for pursuing his scientific endeavors. In spite of all this criticism, Doc presses on and remains steadfast in his scientific exploits. There is something in this film for everyone, and the audience is given enough tools to find whatever suits them.<br/><br/>Now that I have finally seen Back to the Future, I can understand why it has remained such a staple for decades after its release. This story provides a feel good story of normal, good people overcoming the evils of other normal people. Not an overwhelming moral story to the point where it is cheesy and unbelievable, but one that tugs at this reviewer's heartstrings nonetheless. Back to the Future is a four star prize for me, and I would recommend it to anyone that likes to follow an engaging story with fun characters. One does not even have to be a fan of time travel movies, as I am not, to enjoy this film. I'm glad I finally gave this movie a chance, and I will probably be along for the whole series."

","SPOILER ALERT: Plot Leak<br/><br/>The film, Back to the Future, directed by Robert Zemeckis, is a comical science fiction film on time travel. The film was released in 1985 starring Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly, a teenager who enjoys working with a scientist and inventor named Dr. Emmett Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd. The action starts when Marty is sent back in time to 1955 in a DeLorean time-machine. This rash action not only threatens his parent's relationship, but his very existence. This is a humorous family film great for all ages displaying a balance of humor, fantasy, family values, adventure, and clever entertainment. Not only is the film funny, but shows an in-depth plot with plausible plot-driving events and developed story lines. Although the special effects may lack the luster of modern day editing, it adds character to the film and creates a unique style since the special effects are used sparingly rather than constantly bombarding the audience with explosions. The characters are realistic, or in some ways stereotypical, but offer a kindness that is desirable in every-day personal interaction, encouraging the audience to bond with the time traveler and ""mad"" scientist on a journey shadowed by none. The film is different than most popular science fiction competitors of its time, showing that a well- developed narrative is just as desirable as thrilling special effects."

","Everyone needs to know that this program favorite includes sequences that place the hero and his friends in physical jeopardy: a gunfight in which a sympathetic character is thought to be killed, a van chasing a teen on a skateboard, several episodes of bullying, and more. The violence is exaggerated and closer in tone to cartoon jeopardy than real danger, but some kids will no doubt find it tense. Several scenes show the hero's discomfort when the girl who will eventually be his mother tries to entice him with kisses and embraces; there's also implied unwanted sex, but nothing serious happens. Strong language is included but nothing parents cant get teach their kids that its wrong. Amazing show and you would not regret watching it.

","Today was the day me and my best friend from high school-who now works at the movie theatre that is showing these Back to the Future trilogies-saw these again, a little more than 30 years after this first one initially came out. Because the second one took place partially on October 21, 2015 was the reason for this series playing for that one day. Anyway, this first one was the best of them mainly because of the contrast between teen Marty McFly's '80s lifestyle and that of his parents' when they were teens in the '50s. Also, his relationship with Doc Brown was also a big part of the movie's phenomenal success. That and plenty of jokes about culture shock and great chase scenes. My favorite scene involved Marty playing heavy metal licks at the '50s dance sequence. And what great players like Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd handling their roles the way they do! And, yes, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas F. Wilson are also fine as Marty's parents and his father's bully, respectively. Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale fashioned a fine screenplay with excellent direction from Zemeckis. This is still my favorite '80s movie, bar none! So on that note, I definitely highly recommend Back to the Future. P.S. One of the most interesting things I now know about this movie is that the younger brother of Lorraine in the '50s sequence was played by Jason Hervey who was also in the other summer blockbuster of the summer of '85-Pee Wee's Big Adventure-and would later play Kevin Arnold's older brother, Wayne, on ""The Wonder Years""."

","Back To The Future is one my favorite summer movies, it has everything a summer movie needs, comedy, suspense, a bit of action, and an eccentric old professor. And since today was the day that the future was predicted to be in (by the way I'm not reviewing Part 2, because I don't like it), I decided today would be the best day to review this movie.<br/><br/>One aspect that I like about this movie is the contrast between the two different decades. For instance, when the movie begins we see the 80s where people wear strange looking clothes and Huey Lewis songs always play, then it cuts to the past with incredibly basic looking houses and cars and even the songs are different. That's kinda the reason I give this movie a pass with some of the cheesy 80s aspects, since it help differentiate the two different decades.<br/><br/>Another thing I love about this movie is the way the story feels like it would be in a cheesy 50s or 60s comic, except it takes place in the 1980s. The tone of the film is almost always adventurous and fun, like what summer should be like: adventurous and fun.<br/><br/>Also the movie has many iconic aspects, the Delorean, Doc Brown, the weird Rube Goldberg machine at the beginning and so many other little things.<br/><br/>Anyways, Back To The Future is a movie I think everyone should see in their lifetime, not because it is emotionally powerful or philosophical, but because it a quintessential summer movie.<br/><br/>Final Score: 9/10"

","Back to the Future (1985), an eighties classic, is already celebrating its thirtieth birthday this year which makes it the perfect opportunity to review this 'popcornflick'. Back to the Future was written (together with Bob Gale) and directed by the now famous Robert Zemeckis. Together with Spielberg they proved that eighties films could have cheese all over it while still being a whole lotta fun. Assisted by a top-notch cast in the likes of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, Back to the Future became the quintessential 1980s flick that inventively combined a funny script, with action, science fiction and romance, that brings joy to both children and well... big children. <br/><br/>It's present time, or at least it was in 1985, and we are introduced to the teenager Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, who lives together with his rather nerdy parents. Though his household sometimes feels like a funhouse, Marty tries to escape from his boring life through his friendship with the eccentric Dr. Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd. Dr. Brown appears to be some sort of inventor and can only be described as the lovechild of Einstein and Stokowski. With the time-traveling DeLorean created by Dr. Brown, Marty is send back in time to make sure his parents will still fall in love... again and to stop his own existence from being endangered. Back to the Future plays with the fact that teenagers believe their parents were never teenagers. How could Marty's parents have ever been teenagers if they don't understand their own son? Luckily Dr. Brown has the perfect solution and Marty travels back in time to meet his 'teenage' parents. Without spoiling the plot in detail it's quite the encounter. <br/><br/>Let it be faith or luck, it seemed almost as if Michael J. Fox wouldn't become synonymous with his role of Marty McFly. Due scheduling clashes it was nearly a certainty that Eric Stoltz would play the now famous part. Although Stoltz is very capable in his own respect it's a blessing they found a solution to Fox's busy schedule. Michael j. Fox plays Marty with an unique and energetic charm for which he is known and it works brilliantly. In addition, the chemistry Fox and Lloyd share on screen is one of a kind, their friendship feels so natural that it is a true pleasure to withhold. <br/><br/>This friendship is indeed one of the reasons why Back to the Future works so well and still holds up to its time. But even more importantly for its success, is the way in which the film has fun with the paradoxes and difficulties of a kid meeting his own parents. And if this alone wasn't enough we are faced with many running gags of the changes that happened in 30 years.<br/><br/>In 1985 Spielberg gave us besides Back to the Future two other productions: ""The Goonies"" and ""Explorers"". It leaves us wonder if Spielberg, at the peak of his science fiction/adventure heyday, tried to imitate the great studio executives of Golden Hollywood, who were known for matching the right director to the right film. Robert Zemeckis and Back to the Future proved to be a match made in heaven. His big breakthrough is the perfect blend of everything cinema stands for. It's made with such an unforgettable spirit you only wish they made more like these today. Too much nostalgia? Oh well..."

","Even after decades, the 'Back to the Future' trilogy is an enjoyable and adventurous ride, and belongs to the few time-travel movies which have their time-travel logic intact.<br/><br/>This first part is innovative, intriguing, and a funny all the way. The writing is efficient and tries its best to not leave any space-time loopholes (neglecting small details and related consequences, and other goofs). Good acting from everyone involved, and effects (the minor instances it's used). The entire prom sequence is just brilliant. It was a wise decision to take the story to the past, which saves a lot in special effects expenditure. I don't think I need to say more; it's a sci-fi classic now.<br/><br/>Spoiler: It's sad but not paid attention to; no matter how his parents were, the parents he returns to aren't the same people who brought him up. Was he just happy to have this new enhanced version of them? Yes, getting rid of the bullying part was completely fine, and I agree that the new versions of them are much better. But the rest? The memories he had with them don't exist anymore. Anyway, that part isn't a big deal; maybe we aren't supposed to analyze that aspect so deeply. And why did it have to end in a cliffhanger? The next part didn't come out until 4 years later. It's still a hilarious cliffhanger, though."

","That's because they are mirror versions of the same movie, showing how ""the time-warp continuum"" effect changes everything, both in the past and the future. (An unproven time travel theory ""made fun of"" in several movies, including ""Milllenium"". Also de-bunked in the 2 new ""Star Trek"" movies as old Spock meets young Spock face-to-face.) A genius of an idea born out of necessity, as ""George McFly's"" actor failed to ""sign-up"" for Part II! The DeLorean auto was a great choice as a time machine. Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, and Lea Thompson carry the entire series. Mary Steenburgen in Part III is wonderful. ""Einstein-the Dog"" deserves a canine ""Oscar"" award! Basically a ""fish-out-of water"" classic, if follows the mis-adventures of two bumbling ""nerds"" as they stumble through time, in three different movies, from 1885 to 2015 with a constantly malfunctioning time machine, leaving behind messy continuity errors that need to be cleaned up to avoid disastrous events in time. Clever use of special effects (all optical) abound throughout. Much use of split screen as in ""Parent Trap"". Michael appears as his own ""daughter"" in drag (part II) and looks wonderful (though more than a bit creepy!) A few almost-innocent racist comments and situations, including two lines edited out (on the DVD version) involving the timeliness of the words ""colored and black"" in 1955.

","There are always decade-defining films. They may not be the best films of the decade, but they capture the feel of living in them. Back to the Future IS the 80's. It's funny, charming, sweet, and completely enjoyable. Dare, I say, it's one of the most enjoyable films ever made.<br/><br/>There had to be a point during the writing process when someone said, ""This is it."" The plot is movie magic. Teenager goes back in time to save his future by fixing the past of his parents? Brilliant! And it works so well because of the phenomenal, tightly written script. All the little things are important and all tie together. It's so cool to see the same scene happen in two time periods, but the action is exactly the same. Like the diner with Biff/ Marty's house with Biff. It's laugh out loud funny, with plenty of period gags (Reagan, who the hell is John F. Kennedy?), and sweet, with goodbyes and relationships that clearly inspired modern film and TV (Lost Season 5?). The pacing is perfect, with a constant sense of movement, and Zemeckis can weave suspense whenever he wants, be it the first 88 mph or the super- tense climax.<br/><br/>In this cartoon world are cartoon characters, and Back to the Future is filled with gems. Marty McFly, one of the most iconic teenagers,is pure charisma. ""That's heavy stuff!"" We wish we were Marty. He's too cool. Doc Brown, with his great phrases and even better facial expressions, is just so dang lovable. And the first time I saw this, I completely overlooked George McFly. He is hilarious. Brilliantly pathetic.<br/><br/>It's impossible to not like Back to the Future. Sometimes it crosses the line into cheesy (NOOOOO!), the CG looks fake in some places, and personally I don't like the role reversal of George and Biff at the end (he became what we hated in the beginning), but those are small things. Back to the Future is one of the best 80's movies, and has undeniable charm. You have to see this one. 9.3/10"

You know I'm a child of the 1980's and think that this was an awesome decade in which to grow up. While of course every time period has it's ways for being defined this way I hope that all you out there will take a chance to view the particular attributes the 1980's had for shaping society and try to notice the positive impact and images you can make out of them. I mean it took things like friendship, love, warm feeling, innocence, and even comic relief and mysticism very profoundly and emphasized that anything can have some form of bright side, and that every possibility is endless! These movies with a new generation in special effects (which was as I've heard launched by Star Wars in 1977) began about 1980, or to a more exact point 1982 with the theater release of E.T. (the first movie I saw on the big screen) and continued for the rest of the decade which went well given that it was just in time for the positive image as described above. One thing I know is that for the rest of my life I'll be in the process of keeping this era alive as much as I can, and showing the world what an extraordinary icon every member of society can make of themselves and the world around them.

Despite the inherent plot issues involved with any time travel film, this is still a great adventure with a diverse, likable cast and career-defining performances from Christopher Lloyd, Michael J Fox and Crispin Glover. Even though I could recite several lines verbatim from the dark recesses of my memory, I still caught myself laughing at the jokes like they were brand new, and grinning like a fool from start to finish. Like many high profile BR discs, the picture on this was almost *too* stunning - you can actually see some of the ""old person"" makeup flaking off around certain characters' necks in the '80s scenes.

"Gong5","Null","0","0","14 October 2010"," What a concept.
","MJ Fox is rather grating after your 100th of so film you 've seen in your life, and I don't like this over actor (god bless his soul with the fight he is on) nor the other overactor Llloyd. <br/><br/>But Lea Thompson is something else here, she's so charming, and natural, and expressive...she's something.<br/><br/>This film's success was that it fused too great forces together teen love and lust with the concept of that happening between a boy and a younger version of their mom in the past. Now what's forceful here is not how many guys have fancied their moms, we are talking here symbolically, and in that level there's a taboo (for good reasons) and taboos can be very titillating and exciting (even if you don't subscribe to the literal meaning of the taboo - in your fantasizing subconscious of symbols and apparitions the taboo is still there (not literally with ones mom of course) contrasting such complex internal phenomena as motherhood, care, love, lust). <br/><br/>So in essence this fantasy notion of time travel gives the writers here (in a very unlikely for a Hollywood teen flick profound way) a very inconspicuous way to explore, or to tease rather, the very real forces of taboo, oedipal complexes (though I dislike the term) , our feelings of attachment, lust, love and we also have no worse than too teenagers we can project them on. While that doesn't go anywhere really, nor should it (or could it) necessarily, it keeps a very sensual and exciting aura that spills over the dumb and formulaic scenes that make up the rest of the plot.<br/><br/>MJ Foxes to me is a loss to the film, his constant spastic antics might add something to the comedy, but they detract a lot from his scenes with the girl. Plus his face which is so man boyish (that of young looking older man more so than that of an older looking kid) detracts too. He also plays too much like a caricature, the girl playing his mom is so into her role, and he... well, he isn't convincing at all. Anyway I ll shut up about MJH now because a lot of people love him here. It's just doesn't do it for me, now, it did when I was a kid and watched it.<br/><br/>So, all in all some really good acting by Lea, a delicious conceit for a script (not so the time travel of course, but the ""incestuous"" bit, but too formulaic a script otherwise, and not funny where it should have been (well if you are over 20-25 or something and with some good sense of humor).<br/><br/>It's a classic so ratings don't really matter (and as an aside I think films are not like sacks of potatoes that you can compare by rating/weighing, even potatoes are not so unimportant that solely on weighing they can't tell us nothing about their colours, bitterness, sweetness, taste...), so I'll give it a 7."

","Back to the Future and its two following parts take the time travel genre from HG Wells social criticism to social satire and beyond. While chock-full of '80s cues (the dress, designer labels/celebrities and Pepsi Free-remember that?), the film still manages to be eerily prescient. In 2015 you may buy a ""Mr. Fusion"" portable reactor that produces at least 1.2 gigawatts, but your flying car still runs on gas pumped at the Texaco station. What does that say about EV cars in the next few years? OK, there are no hover boards...but flat-panel TVs have all but erased tubes from memory, there's Major League baseball in Miami (or will be shortly) and the social decline of ""traditional"" white, middle-class suburbia is already widespread. And unlike those ""other"" depictions of the '50s, it wasn't all bobby-socks and sax; there was sex (and rape) too.

To sum it up, a kid gets sent to the past on an unplanned trip via a time machine constructed by his eccentric inventor friend. I don't want to give away any more than that. This is truly one of the best films to come from the '80s. It's colorful, exciting, funny, and filled with a gold mine of amazing '80s lines. The music went with the film perfectly, of course, just fun music when it was a good time, and music to work up the audience when stress was needed. Director Zemeckis did a great job. I could watch this movie again and again. It had no low points, no slowing down. It was genuinely interesting the entire way through.<br/><br/>My only problem is one prevalent in many films: overactive coincidence. Sometimes the conflicts were resolved way too easily, and I felt really unsatisfied. Maybe I was taking it too seriously, maybe I was expecting too much, I don't know, but a few moments of the film I was disappointed. No worries though, because the greatness of the film made me forget the hiccups. I still thing it's a super fun ride.<br/><br/>This is a perfect movie for family movie night, or hanging out with friends, anything. I can't think of a scenario where viewers wouldn't have a good time watching this movie, except for stuffy, boring people who have no imagination who perhaps just came from a funeral, or something like thatbut you probably shouldn't be watching any movies with people just coming from such a sad event, and you probably shouldn't be hanging out with boring people anywayso yeah, I stand by what I said.

","I have fond memories of seeing ""Back to the Future"" for the first time when first released during the summer of 1985. The audience I saw it with actually applauded at the end of the film, which is rare for a movie. I remember coming back to see it five more times that summer. Yes, it was only ""just a movie"", but such an original, clever, imaginative, heartwarming, charming movie. One that is very enjoyable and relate-able to a wide audience. <br/><br/>""Back to the Future"" made a big, positive impression on me. I realized I had seen a special, unique film, that might stand the test of time, which it has. I've seen this film many times since 1985 and it has never failed to lift my spirits. It's simply one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>""Back to the Future"" was the product of the imagination of director Robert Zemeckis and producer Bob Gale. The story idea was in genesis for several years. This was the third film of Zemeckis, after ""Use Cars"", 1982 did poor box office and ""Romancing the Stone"", 1984 became a minor hit.<br/><br/>Marty McFly is an average 80's teenager who accidentally gets sent back in time and interferes with the meeting of his mother and father, jeopardizing his very existence. A simple premise, but one really well thought out and done with imagination and heart. It's part comedy, part action-adventure, part science fiction and part drama. All together, a very entertaining and enjoyable film with great appeal.<br/><br/>Here's where Zemecicks first showed what would become one of his trademarks: using the same characters in the same setting of different times. This playful manner with history that would fully develop in the visual effect techniques of ""Forrest Gump"", 1994.<br/><br/>""Back to the Future"" is really not much of a visual effects film. What sets ""Back to the Future"" apart is, that it focuses on story, characters and circumstances, in a playful, clever and imaginative manner.<br/><br/>For science minded viewers, it's the first a time travel film got most of the physics correct about time travel. It broke the old designs of past time travel movies. Here, energy is used to crack open the space time continuum and the trip through time occurs in a fraction of a second.<br/><br/>There's some surprisingly heartwarming and charming moments between the main and supporting characters, such as Marty and Doc saying goodbye and Marty talking to his mother and father at the dance after they've been reunited. All the characters and situations are very relate-able, which is part of the films' appeal.<br/><br/>Zemecicks knew he had a small film here, so he requested and received a big, rousing, traditional style film music score from Alan Sylvestri. The climax and epilogue/twist ending of the film were especially memorable and engaging. ""Back to the Future"" was a critical hit and an enormous box office success, that really launched Zemecicks as a prominent director. The film stayed at number one for 11 weeks, which is the third best ever performance for any movie. It received four Academy Award nominations, the most important and nomination being for Best Original Screenplay. <br/><br/>I'm happy this film has stood the test of time to be appreciated and enjoyed by a new generation. In 2007, ""Back to the Future"" was added to the National Film Registry as a film of historic or cultural significance. My personal favorite line: ""If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything""."

","I really don't believe it's possible to not enjoy this movie. It doesn't matter who you ask, I can nearly guarantee everyone has great memories of this film. It's a classic; most people would agree. The story is well-known but for the 1% of you who may not be familiar: Marty McFly is an average teenager living in 1985 until his friend Doc Emmett Brown invents a DeLorean time machine. When problems arise, Marty finds himself trapped in 1955 and he realizes that his actions may have prevented his own existence unless he can correct his mistakes. By now, everyone knows the deal: the car, the characters, and the countless memorable moments.<br/><br/>I can't get enough of that DeLorean. It will forever be my favorite film car. Despite having been released in 1985, the effects in this film hold up surprising well. Every time I watch the DeLorean sparking up as it leaving through time, it's like watching it for the very first time. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are two of the most fun characters in cinema history in the form of Marty and Doc. They're perfect; I honestly can't imagine anyone else having been cast in those roles. Honestly, that extends to the supporting cast as well...Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Tom Wilson. I'll always love Glover's performance as Marty's father George and its a shame he didn't return for the sequel.<br/><br/>Everyone's got a favorite moment from this film, as it's loaded with fantastic scenes. Mine would have to be Marty's initial reaction to finding himself in 1955 and his guitar performance of ""Johnny B. Goode"" at the dance. Seriously, there isn't much a person can say about this film as just about everyone's seen it and knows how fun it is. It was the start of one of the most entertaining film trilogies and it's a worldwide phenomenon."

","Back to the Future is a film that really rewards a repeat viewing. The plot is highly entertaining and has something for everyone. Michael J Fox stars as Marty McFly, a wannabe rock star and high school pupil who gets drawn into time travel by the Doc (Christopher Lloyd). The Doc's creation is a DeLorean which is hooked up to nuclear power and takes McFly back to 1955! The car itself looks incredibly cool and to the people of 1955 looks like some kind of space ship. The plot sees McFly encounter his parents when they were his age, with lots of butterfly effect moments threatening to unsettle the space time continuum! At one point, McFly accidentally prevents his parents from meeting and falling in love, thus risking his never being born. There are some really funny moments when his mother begins to fall for him, rather than his father, forcing him to take ever more desperate risks to make sure his dad ends up as her husband. The best scene for me is where McFly lays down a fantastic cover of Chuck Berry's Johnny B Goode to a bemused 50s audience, complete with wildly over-the-top 80s style electric guitar solos. The film gets more outlandish, before McFly and the 1955 version of the Doc manage to send the DeLorean back to 1985. This is a very impressive family movie, with plenty of action, comedy and an interesting storyline. The sequels were also top-notch, although the third film didn't quite match the standard of films one and two for me. Overall, though, one of the best trilogies ever made."

","Rewatched Back to the Future recently for the first time in 5 or 6 years and decided to rate it for fun here. In all honesty this movie is probably not a ""9"", but growing up with with it, I attach huge sentimental value to it. The script is a work of art as is the energy, pacing, and acting. The cast and director really hit the right blend of humor and adventure rarely seen in movies even now. I particularly loved Christopher Lloyd as the manic absent-minded professor. His comic facial expressions and clumsiness come off great. No part of this movie is poorly done, and the accompanying music is superb.

"blanbrn","8","0","0","9 May 2009"," One of the best sci-fi, adventure, fantasy, films of all-time. Very memorable and unforgettable film that makes you wish time travel were real!
","Since first seeing this classic in 1985 and thru the years from premium cable, TV network, video, DVD, and cable showings ""Back to the Future"" has always been an enjoyable film. I've saw it enough many times and whether it be with family or by myself I still enjoy. Clearly the film is well liked for it's theme even though time travel is fantasy, still when blended with adventure and great sci-fi special effects ""Back to the Future"" is without a doubt a memorable classic.<br/><br/>Directed by film master and genius Steven Spielberg along with special effects wizard Robert Zemeckis they helped make this film one of the most groundbreaking works of all-time. And the story is a catch even though mostly wrapped up in fantasy still the time travel plot sells to all of our hearts making us fall in love with the time travel fantasy. 1980's TV star Michael J. Fox(""Family Ties"")stars as teen Marty McFly a down on his luck and out of touch high school slacking teenager who's only hope of escape in his present day 1985 is his love of rock music and being buddies with his sidekick wild scientist Dr. Brown(Christopher Lloyd). Yet both feel history is about to change as Doc Brown has created a time machine inside his DeLorean car. Oddly this is groundbreaking yet both become mixed up in a time shattering chain reaction that could keep them stuck in the past with a vaporized future.<br/><br/>Strangely they travel back to 1955 at a critical time when Marty's parents had yet to meet. During this time conflict and danger is abound as Marty has to be careful not to expose to much of his identity to his important past, because that is his critical future that he must protect from obstacles. In the past it was fun to see Marty having to force his parents to get together, and plus putting up with old high school bully Biff was entertaining and comical.<br/><br/>Lessons learned from this movie is time travel though fun and interesting like seeing the past of your hometown and the fact that you would get to meet your parents before they conceived you would be great, still when facing the conflicts of identity exposure and dealing with past pest(Biff) and unexpected events would be very dangerous and risky. Still ""Back to the Future"" is now an immortalized pop culture film classic coming along in a time the mid 80's that showcased and interesting fantasy plot of time travel that filled our entertainment thirst. As it was such a memorable and well liked film for showing that it would be nice and such a dream for anyone to go back and see important things in their past while in the meantime it's such a good feel to be able to shape things in your past that lead to a happy future just like Marty's character did in the film. The adventure and action special effects blend in well with the fantasy theme to make ""Back to the Future"" a film that's unforgettable, memorable and one that will certainly stand the test of time!"

","The opening shots of Back to the Future set up the film's ideas and general tone. We are treated to several inventions and gadgets and gizmos, within someone's kitchen and living area, designed to seamlessly ease into one another as the beginnings to a day are kick started. Maybe a television will come on; a robotic arm will pour dog foot into an already over stuffed bowl and toast will pop up when ready, but very burnt. The idea here is that this stuff can work, but to what negative effect? It's quite clear this area hasn't been occupied for a while and the dog food will surely leave a foul smell for when the owner returns but what's that compared to the fire hazards in both the TV and the toast? This is what the film will eventually branch out into; a piece about technology and inventions working but with what, potentially quite terrible, results.<br/><br/>Back to the Future is one of those rare and special films that feel tilted more toward a younger audience and yet bear no harm in being revisited by others later on in years. The film can amuse and is able to sustain humour and interest, no matter how wacky the characters are or the predicament is. The film can frighten and additionally pay sly homage to history whilst it includes a fair few gags to how the protagonist's actions perhaps changed the course of history as we know, those being more directed toward the adult watching audience with Marty McFly's rendition of 'Johnny B. Goode' a great example. The film is a near masterpiece, bordering on greatness as it seamlessly entertains, humours, delivers a brilliant and inventive narrative whilst even feeling brave enough to touch on elements of a Freudian nature.<br/><br/>Of Marty McFly, he is played by Michael J. Fox in what is a big-screen career defining role. The piece of brilliant technology that is used to a certain degree of negative effect is the time machine a certain Doctor Emmett Brown (Lloyd) built out of a DeLorean automobile. The film revolves around Marty using this invention to travel back to 1955, following an escape from some hostiles out for Emmett, and a consequential accidental changing of history equating in the danger of Marty himself quite possibly being scrubbed out of history.<br/><br/>As a stand alone film, Back to the Future offers pretty perfect family entertainment. Its balance of fun and games mixed with a foreboding scenario, a scenario that lies at its very heart, is perfectly captured when McFly wanders down the Hill Valley street in 1955 following going back and witnessing how different his town was thirty years ago before the reality of the situation hits him in ominous fashion. Buried deep within Back to the Future might well be a statement on the condition of then contemporary America. Its two worlds of 1955 and 1985 exhibit the same facilities and general look, but offer very different outlooks on ways of living in the respective years. While porno theatres exist in the 80s, cinemas were playing the cream of Classical Hollywood back in the day; while shops and business' look shoddy, run down and some are even out of business in the modern age but they were clean and bristling with activity in the past.<br/><br/>The film even pokes fun at mayoral promises, promising a bright outlook in the 1950s but we, as does the film's lead, know the truth of what becomes of the town. Without obviously pointing fingers, the film shares a joke with us to do with how remarkable it is that Ronald Reagan is the 1985 president. It enjoys telling us that Marty's home estate-to-be will be one of the 'best places to live' come development, but the harsh reality of it is that it's anything but. This is something the second film touches on more when the quality of living deteriorates even more when a powerful political figure (that would be this film's antagonist Biff) has a say in how the town is run, echoing Marty and Emmett's brief but poignant conversation to do with how unbelievable Emmett finds it that Ronald Reagen is the president in 1985.<br/><br/>But while the film's political slant isn't its primary focus, you can't help but feel the film is a reference to how the author is very fond of the 1950s or the past in particular, something he sees to have been so much better than the present day. Marty's accidentally and ill advised attempts at changing history result in his teenage mother potentially falling in love with him, subject matter deemed too taboo for Disney and they rejected the film, but the ideas aren't played for sick laughs and the film doesn't linger on the actual notion as much as it does focus on Marty's reactions to all these realisations his would-be mother is having towards him. The 'park' scene in particular acts as an example as to how Marty feels about the situation with the overly dramatic facial expressions acting as an offbeat and drastic reaction to the predicament. It's additionally easy to forget that, by the end, his mother's attention turns more towards George, like history should be, highlighting what a vulnerable girl she is and how easily it is for this girl to fall for someone else at such a delicate time in her life.<br/><br/>This factor deflects the idea of the mother falling too deeply in love with her own would-be son somewhat, as we realise how naive she really is to fall again so quickly. But the film is full of ideas and energy, arguably being the best of its 'type' at the time of release. Producers didn't think people would take to it due to its lack of 'risqué' but years later, it stands head and shoulders above all the other 'more risqué' teen films that were released at that time."

","What can I say; it's the usual Spielberg/Zemeckis sensibility; a little dumbed-down and ""B-movie""-ish, while delivering genuine humor and pathos.<br/><br/>They're movies ""for the masses;"" the writing, scenario work, pacing, directing is carefully designed to fill in the blanks for our slower brethren, but it works on many levels and has something for everyone.<br/><br/>After all these years, it's still a great trilogy.<br/><br/>Which reminds me of perhaps the most amazing thing of all. In stark contradiction to the immutable law of sequels, the trilogy gets better with each installment; the third is a marvel, feeling like the storyline has reached maturity. Perhaps, by the time they were shooting the third, the money folks backed off a tad and let the creative people breathe: You can feel it. The hyperbolically directed leads are actually given some slack to ply well-honed stage-style theatrical skills, and it looks and feels well-rounded and true.<br/><br/>Also, the film is simultaneously dated--'80s American youth values, without serious circumspection--and yet somehow timeless. Perhaps the feeling is that there *is* a kind of circumspection; that Marty, by story's end, has actually grown a little. Always nice to see some of that leak out of a ""pop"" movie."

","The second movie is my favorite, where the gang goes into the future and experiences a world quite different from the mid 80's. I was a child from the 80's, and remember these movies well, and I also remember back in the day everyone thinking that the future would be exactly like this movie portrayed it to be like. It wasn't, at least not *yet* in the year 2007 (in the movie, they go to the year 2015, so unless some major changes happen in the next eight years, all those flying vehicles and life-like television screens will probably not be happening in our reality any time soon). It was just a lot of fun to sit there and think that back in the 80's, people really thought our world was going to change THAT drastically. Lots of fun scenes. Anyway, I haven't seen the second movie in quite a long time, and was surprised that the quality of the storytelling has held up extremely well through the years, and the movie doesn't look like your typical 80's film either (you know, with lots of dated-sounding loud saxophone playing, yuck!) I was also surprised that the characters actually went back to the year 1955 for quite a long time. Talk about telling a story with lots of twists and turns. Awesome! These are seriously some of the most exciting movies that have ever existed. The first movie is a classic, and the third one is really good as well, even though many people point to the third movie as being the obvious weakpoint in the series. Maybe, maybe not. I don't really know. I just know I love these films and wanted to comment on how well they've held up after all this time. A series of movies that are worth watching over and over again, and I normally only watch movies once or twice. Not in this case."

","Back To The Future is a great movie that has everything.<br/><br/>A terrific story, memorable characters, great acting, dead-on satire, beautiful FX and great music. Every scene in this movie is a winner. Probably this movie works because it never takes itself seriously. From start to finish the movie contains an amazing wealth of visual gags (the giant guitar speaker, the DeLorean time machine), classic lines (""You can't have a Pepsi Free. You gotta pay for it."") and in-jokes (rocker Huey Lewis complaining that the music is too loud). The time travel logic, so hard to pull off, is done with great flair, suitable for any science fiction movie. Except this isn't a sci-fi film. It's a comedy with a heavy dose of social satire mixed in and it works on both levels.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox plays Marty McFly a teenager who would rather play guitar than do anything else. He's friendly with the town's off-the-wall inventor Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd.) Doc creates a time machine and Marty is accidentally transported back to the year 1955. There he meets a younger version of his parents (Crispin Glover and Leah Thompson) and has to arrange for them to meet so they will get married and have him.<br/><br/>The role of Marty McFly was ideal for Michael J. Fox. His ability to play a teenager transferred perfectly from TV (Family Ties) to the big screen. Crispin Glover is terrific as Marty's father, George McFly. He has a dual role, as a teenager and an adult. Christopher Lloyd is almost over-the-top as the nutty inventor. Thomas Wilson is Biff, the bully who constantly torments George McFly.<br/><br/>Other than Forrest Gump this is Robert Zemeckis's best movie. Kids and adults will appreciate it."

","Strangely, the part about Back to the Future that is the farthest from reality isn't the time traveling Delorean. It's the fact that at the end of the movie when it's shown that Biff, now humbled, is working for the McFly family, waxing their cars on this particular day. It seems far fetched to believe that the McFly brood would still choose to have any contact with a man who in high school not only nearly broke George's arm, but clearly got drunk and attempted to rape Lorraine. I'm 31, and don't have contact with many bullies from High School for doing far less than that. I can't imagine any scenario wherein Biff went from attempted rapist and bully, to fun loving goofball who is handy around the house."

It is not the case, and it remains a solid family value entertainment... the sort of films you can expect your kids to watch over and over again. I suppose the whole skateboard and matchmaking your mum and dad must be part of the timeless magic of the script.<br/><br/>So only one thing to do: buy a collector's three film box set and you'll know what sound investment means when they have been watched 20 times plus and your kids ask if they can watch it AGAIN."

","I first saw ""Back to the Future"" years ago, but it really didn't do much for me. I saw it again several years later, and don't recall thinking much of it during that viewing, either. However, after watching the highly acclaimed Robert Zemeckis movie again recently (this time a good few years after my last viewing, I believe), although I still can't exactly call it one of my favourite features, I now understand why it has such wide appeal! <br/><br/>In 1985, Marty McFly is a teenager who is not exactly popular with his peers, but does have a girlfriend named Jennifer Parker. His best friend is Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown, an oddball local scientist. One night, Marty meets Doc out in a parking lot, where he is to assist the scientist with his new invention, a time machine made by a car! To make the machine powerful enough, Doc has used plutonium, which he got from a terrorist group who were expecting him to make a bomb with it! Unfortunately, just as Doc is about to travel through time, the terrorists track him down and shoot him! They then go after Marty, who manages get away in Doc's machine, but ends up being transported to the year 1955, back when his parents were around his age! Eventually, he meets the Doc of that time and manages to figure out a way to get back to 1985 with his assistance. However, Marty also learns that he has altered history, and must somehow get his parents together in order to save his very existence! <br/><br/>This movie may start out a tad sluggish, but for the vast majority of the approximate two hours that it runs for, it is consistently entertaining! Most of ""Back to the Future"" is very exciting, with a lot of action, and it also works reasonably well as a comedy, with quite a few laughs here and there. Basically, the main cast members all nothing less than reasonable in their performances (I haven't noticed any really bad ones during any of my several viewings). The most notable performance (one that's definitely MORE than reasonable) is that of Christopher Lloyd, who fits the role of Doc Brown very well. The movie wouldn't quite be the same without this character and his antics! For all those reasons, this first installment in the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy is one fine accomplishment! <br/><br/>Over two decades after the release of this sci-fi comedy, it remains extremely popular. It's current position in the IMDb Top 250 is obviously proof of that. No movie can please 100% of its viewers, but clearly, the majority of people who have seen ""Back to the Future"" at any point in the past 22 years have enjoyed it, and that's a lot of people, so the film deserves a lot of credit! If you usually like to see the sci-fi and comedy genres combined, and you haven't seen this particular combination of the two for any reason, I strongly suggest you watch it as soon as possible!"

","Back to the Future is the kind of film for all ages. I have not come across many people who find this film to be stupid. A variety of ages, when asked, have told me they love the concept of the film, the story, the characters, etc etc. I agree with them whole heartedly. Back to the Future is one of those films I can go back to (no pun intended) again and again. It is a film that doesn't need brains to figure out, just watch and you'll enjoy it.<br/><br/>Back to the Future follows the life of Marty McFly and his relationship with a crazy old scientist, Dr. Brown, who says he has discovered the secret to time travel. Due to odd circumstances Marty is sent back in time and the time machine (which is actually a buffed up DeLorean) breaks down, stranding him in the time when his parents were in high school. With the help of the younger Dr. Brown he must figure out a way to save his own existence when he messes up things between his parents and find a way to get 'back to the future'. <br/><br/>Michael J. Fox is a great actor. He captures the spirit of a teenager though he was 24 when he did the film. He is the initiator of most of the jokes, though they don't come from his mouth. His inability to realize that he is in the past makes several awkward moments in the past, especially with the local bully and at a school dance. His performance is legendary in my book and one of the reasons I watch Back to the Future so often.<br/><br/>Christopher Lloyd, I feel, is what made this film work. His eccentricity and his random proclamation of ""Great Scott!"" makes his character work so well with what he is use to portraying. A veteran actor of Lloyd's background was needed to make the film work. If a serious actor had been put in the role, the film would not have worked. His odd approach to the character made his character and acting the funniest bit of all in the film.<br/><br/>The portrayal of 50's life is right on par. Marty's interaction with it is some of the funniest things I saw in the film. Crispen Glover gives a solid performance as Marty's father back in the 50's. What I find great about the film though is how you feel for every character. You really do feel for George McFly (Glover) as he struggles to woe the love of his life Lorraine. A rarity in comedy indeed. You want Marty to get back to the 80's and you want Biff to get decked the whole film. The script is solid, the acting is superb, and the laughs are numerous.<br/><br/>4/5 Stars"

Was that on earth either before or after a couple of months in 1985?<br/><br/>That said, Crispin Glover should have gotten an Oscar for his performance as Marty's dad George. He takes the generic nerd written in the script, chops it into kindling, and uses it to set the screen on fire.

","Back to the Future is one of the best movies ever made. It has a great stroy, has funny lines, and has great characters as well.<br/><br/>Marty travels back in time accidentally by using Doctor Emmett Brown's time machine. There he must figure out a way to get back to the future and also get his parents to fall in love since he accidentally interferes with their first meeting.<br/><br/>The story is great in this film. Time travel is a tricky thing but I think that this film does a simple job of explaining it so that general audiences can understand it more. However it still has a lot that confuses me but I guess with time travel in a movie the more that you think about it the more that you will have your mind boggled. So it is best just to accept what happens and not over think it.<br/><br/>Marty is a great leading character who people can probably relate to. Michael J. Fox is awesome as him. Also Christopher Lloyd is amazing as Doctor Emmett Brown, this is probably his best acting performance in a film. Overall the relationship between Marty and Doc is believable and well done and it is one of the major things these films have going for them.<br/><br/>The main antagonist Biff is also great. He really is just the type of jerk that seems to exist in a lot of 80s movies.<br/><br/>The conflict of the story is great and it really keeps you at the edge of your seat. No matter how many times I see it, this film still keeps my attention even though I know what will happen.<br/><br/>The score and song selections in this film are also well done.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film. If you have not seen it, do so right away and you will not be disappointed."
"jaygarcia367","1","3","10","24 April 2020"," Not so good
","I can see why certain ppl would like this movie. But I've been watching it myself for several years now & it's just not for me. I think it's cheesy & just not funny. Apart from the creepy scenes with the young mom hitting on her future son, there's a huge plot hole I've noticed for many years. Why wouldn't his adult parents remember that their son looks identical to the kid from both their pasts? It's a dumb movie, made for a ""certain"" group of ppl."
"TStormMarc","4","5","22","2 March 2019"," Liked as a kid, but lack of TacStorm now VERY noticeable
","I was on a cross-country plane ride recently, and I noticed that Back to the Future was one of the movies available as one of the in-flight entertainment options. I'd seen it as a child in theaters and maybe one other time since, so I thought I'd see if it held up. Granted, I'm not a kid anymore, but I wondered if there might at least be some nostalgia value. Sadly, no. The problem is that since the last time I saw Back to the Future, I'd gotten myself a TacStorm. I couldn't help but fixate on the places where a continuously firing gun would've changed everything.<br/><br/>For example, when the Libyans track down Doc Brown in the parking lot, all he has is a revolver that doesn't even work. Imagine if he had an automatic handgun that was already firing on its own before the Libyans even arrived, and all he had to do was aim. I realize he has to get killed for there to be a movie, but I still couldn't get over the absence of the TacStorm. Unfortunately, the movie was pretty much tainted 20 minutes in and only got worse.<br/><br/>In the climatic scene where George McFly knocks out Biff with one punch, all I could think was how he could've easily missed or not hit him hard enough to knock him out-just imagine what would have happened to him then. But if he'd had a gun that was always firing, there'd be no doubt, just guaranteed security when he needed it most. I realize the movie was made before the TacStorm was created, but that doesn't make it any more watchable in the year 2019!<br/><br/>As it turns out, that's not the only movie that doesn't age well because it doesn't have a TacStorm. For example, my girlfriend and I watched The Goonies recently (she had actually never seen it). She thought it was pretty good, but I said, ""You didn't notice something missing? I mean, a really HUGE omission?"" She didn't at first, but once I explained that Data wouldn't have even needed a spring-loaded boxing glove in his jacket or oil jets in his sneakers to fend off the Fratelli family if he had a gun that was always pumping out bullets, it was so obvious to her.<br/><br/>And, sadly, even some of my all-time favorite movies have lost their luster because the TacStorm is so glaringly absent. In The Godfather, for instance, when Michael has to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey in that restaurant, Clemenza tells him not to take any chances. Well, sorry, but if he doesn't have a TacStorm, if his firearm isn't discharging continuously straight from the factory, he's taking some MAJOR chances. Plus, if he had a TacStorm, it'd still be firing when he dropped it, which would take out anyone that tried to follow him.<br/><br/>So now I don't know if I even want to see any newer movies at all. I guess the good news is that maybe they're new enough to have the TacStorm in them, but do I want to waste money to find out? You'd think with four guys in the band, at least one of the members of Queen would have one, but I didn't see one in the Bohemian Rhapsody trailer, not to mention the trailers for Aquaman or Roma. Well, if I'm not 100% sure, I'm just going to watch some TacStorm demo videos online. At least I know they won't let me down."

","It's fine. It's mass appeal done right, if not exemplary. And that's the slant - it feels like it was formulaicly designed to have as much mass-audience appeal as possible. Much like Indiana Jones or the MCU, this tries to take you back to those Saturday Morning Cartoons - hip young teen and his mad scientist friend and their time-travelling rock'n'roll misadventures. Oh, watch out, they have to jump-start Doc's time-machine Delorean (in earlier drafts it was a refrigerator) just in the knick of time as lightning strikes the clock tower in the town square. This movie basically demands that you watch it in your pajamas while eating cereal. The production, direction, and pace are all fine. Michael J. Fox is hilariously bad and Christopher Lloyd is clearly having fun in his over-the-top madcap role. It's a serviceable diversion, but the problem with pop-culture is that it's elevated this movie way too far above its lot."

","There is no such thing as a perfect movie. Many people will try to argue that some movies are perfect in every way with absolutely no flaws. But in reality, some of the greatest movies of all time are filled with flaws. Like in the original Star Wars how Luke was kind of annoying at times and how it didn't make sense for a large space station to be destroyed by a torpedo going through a tiny vent. So even some of the greatest movies ever have flaws. However, there are some movies that come close to being perfect. Back to the Future is one of them. The pacing, characters, music, effects, and tone are all spot on. I won't give much away to those who haven't seen it. But if you haven't, get at it."

","'Back to the future' is about time travel. This movie was released in 1985. The story of this movie is that one weird scientist invented a time machine. Marty, a friend of him, accidentally used the machine and went back to the past. He went to 1950s when Ronald Reagan was still a second-rate actor. He met his parents who were very young and changed their life. Then he came back to the future. The plot is simple but gripping at the same time. The scene which Marty's mother fall in love with her son, not knowing who he is, was hilarious. Marty tried hard to unite his high-school-age parents to save his own existence. Also, it was so interesting to see what the life in America was like in 1980s. For instance, people usually wore checked shirt, jeans and Nike sneakers. I was surprised that They are not that different from today. Even though this movie is a little bit old and predictable, the movie was so much fun that I lost count of the time. Good casts, nice plot, humor, love and music well mixed in this movie. I really recommend that you should watch this classic movie."

","Back to the Future. Remarkably clever, witty and hilarious sic-fi ever made. When Marty played by adorable Michael J. Fox is accidentally sent 30 years back in time, he needs to make sure his teenage parents fall in love in order to save his own existence. When you go back in time where you were not supposed to be at all, you actions can change the course of your own future. This concept creates lot of hilarious situations and full credit goes to writer-director Robert Zemeckis and his team for consistently imaginative screenplay, excellent music and back ground score, witty dialogs and emotional connect between characters. All supporting actors have done a pretty decent job especially Christopher Lloyd playing the crazy scientist and Crispin Glover playing Marty's timid father. Don't miss this cult sci-fi classic. It is one of those rare clever and really funny comedies."

","I like this movie okay. It was not something that I would really want to have in my DVD collection as I am more into horror than comedy, but this movie was entertaining. This is mainly due to Christopher Lloyd than anything else, the man brings real energy to his role. Michael J. Fox was good to in the lead role, one has to wonder if ""Family Ties"" held him back a little as he had some rather successful movies during the 80's and could have done more without the television commitment. This one is about time travel, time travel to the past. The next film would feature time travel to the future and the past. That one is a film I can not watch, it is just to hard to for me. It also has not aged well as the future they paint is a future of the 80's, as fashion is never going to be like that I am afraid. This one though has a guy use the professor's time machine and ending back in the past where he kind of interrupts the first meeting of his mother and father. This in turn makes it so he may no longer exist shortly. Thankfully, the professor is around and so he has to work on getting the time machine, which is a car, in working order and Fox has to work on getting his parents back on the right track. Like I said, this one works, as you can recreate a time that is past, the second one doesn't because you can not see what the future is going to be like. The third one though was okay."

","Back to the Future (1985) <br/><br/>Review: Ah yes. This is such a classic. This is easily the best time travel movie ever. Good times.<br/><br/>Back to the Future is loads of fun. We start with Marty McFly who's goal is to be a rock star one day. He is friends with a kooky, but brilliant scientist, Doc Brown played well by Christopher Lloyd.<br/><br/>Doc makes a DeLorean into a time machine. That's the start. Before we know it, Marty is back in time....30 years to be exact! He now has to live in 1955. This starts off some great fun and a intelligent story.<br/><br/>This movie not only is smart, but has a lot of heart. When Marty winds up meeting his soon to be father, he jumps and is shocked too. He also meets his mother as well. This movie is telling something else too is that our parents were young too. Marty now sees that they were young and foolish in there teenage years as well. This gives the movie some depth. All parents are mature, but back then were just like him.<br/><br/>The theory of time travel is well explained. Who knows if mankind will ever create the ability to time travel? This was explained well enough. Who knows what the possibilities are? Can you change history? Who knows? <br/><br/>And kudos to Christopher Lloyd. He was just a hoot as Doc Brown.<br/><br/>The Last Word: One of my favorites. Back to The Future rules. This movie has a great soundtrack and a great look recreating the 1950's too. It's like you the viewer went back in time! Highly recommended!"
"sunny_jim9","10","1","2","25 January 2007"," Never a thing of the past.
","I don't usually comment on movies but on this movie I'll make an exception. The story starts with teenager Marty Mcfly (Michael J. Fox), a dedicated guitar player with a wonderful girlfriend (Claudia Wells). He however has a rather unusual family with his father (Crispin Glover) being a wimp, mother (Lea Thompson) an alcoholic, and brother and sister perhaps the most weird of the lot. We also find out that Marty has a rather unusual friend, Docter Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) who has been working on a time travel mechanism for the past 30 years. We are not shown Doc Brown until about 15 minutes into the film, however he is referred to as a 'real nut case who is very dangerous' by his Principle Mr Strickland who simply hates Marty's guts. We are soon shown how the device works by the Doc and Marty accidentally transports himself back to 1955 when a group of terrorists arrive to ruin both their days. Marty finds his parents are of the same age and destroys the way they are supposed to meet and suddenly it is an uphill battle from there, but with the help of the Doc who is 30 years younger, they come up with a plan that could help get Marty home (probably should've mentioned the time machine runs off plutonium).<br/><br/>This film is a lot of fun having both humour and lots of twists and turns throughout the entire film. Superb acting by Fox who was actually 22 years old playing a 17 yrs old teenager, however most of us wouldn't notice. Terrific acting by Lloyd, Glover and Thompson who had very unusual roles. Zemeckis's directing is top quality, especially the beginning with the many clocks which *hints* this is a movie on time travel. A very family movie for people of all tastes that will always be a classic in my books. <br/><br/>4.5/5"

","SPOILERS <br/><br/>I am going to honest here, the eighties may have been the best decade for film. I mean, you have The Shining, Empire Strikes Back, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, and this. Now, I recently found out that I had Back To The Future for a long time, just never realized it. Actually, it is my Dad's, but still. Not only that, I found out that it came with Back to The Future Two and Three also. I of course watched this one first, and all of a sudden, I realized that I have seen it parodied thousands of times. I never knew how many different scenes that I have seen before were in this here film.<br/><br/>Here is the plot. A teenager named Marty finds out that his friend named Emmet, or Doc, made a time machine. Then, Doc is gunned down by terrorists. Marty then goes into the time machine car and goes back to 1955, the year in which his mother and father get together. Then the car runs out of fuel. But do you what is even worse? Marty screws up time by accidentally making his mother like him, not his father. Marty then finds Doc, who is in 1955. Doc figures out how to get Marty back in time. He can use the lightning from the clock tower. Marty tries to get his mother to like his father.Then, Marty's mother asks him out for the dance. Marty and his father make a plan for his mother to like his father. The day of the dance the plan backfires horribly. The school bully Biff locks Marty in a car and attacks his mother. His father, named George, tries to rescue his mother, named Lorraine, but he was expecting Marty, not Biff. Then George knocks out Biff and Lorraine and George go to the dance together. Then Marty gets back to the future and realizes that the future is now better than is was. Turns out that Doc was not killed, but then Marty and his girlfriend need to got to 2015 with him.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a terrific film. It is impossible not to love this film. There are very few films that could be as fun as Back to the Future. The climax involving Marty trying to get the car through a wire thus conducting electricity from the lightning getting him back to the future is very suspenseful. Anyway, this is a very fantastic film that anyone of Sc-Fi, or films for that matter, will definitely enjoy.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>Recommended Films: Back to the Future Two, and Three."

His friend, Doc (Doctor Emmett Brown), has told Marty that he has succeeded in his latest experiment. Marty meets him late at night and finds out that the Doc has made an actual time machine! Marty goes back to the past, 30 years before, and accidentally meets his mom and dad, 30 years younger.

","I watched this movie for the first time when I was like 7 or 8 years old, and it captured med instantly. The home-made ""garage-build"" high tech time-machine, that is in fact build into a DeLorean - a cool legendary sports-car of the 1980's, are simply stunningly awesome for young people, and if you are not young any more, well then you will be during the movie. The great story, the action-packed adventure, and most important; the extreme caution of following rules of time-travel and the creativity of the countless details in the three movies - along with the great cast of sympathetic and funny actors - simply makes this trilogy a must see adventure for people of all ages. I am now 27 years old, and I still watch the movies at least once or twice a year, and I still find myself observing new details that I haven't noticed before. This really need a re-release on the big screen in my opinion! (maybe with some remastering)"

","I have watched this film a hundred times and still do not tire of it. i think the characters are awesome and the journey Marty goes on is fabulous. Excellent idea and i don't think this was wasted by the follow up films either. just a shame that Crsipin glover thought too much of himself to not come back and do the other films. in my opinion one of the best trilogies there is purely on entertainment value. I love the relationship between the doc and Marty, and hysterically how the doc changes from 1985 to 1955. i think the individual performances were excellent and i love the fact that biff just keeps getting covered in horse sh*t!! ace.

","Saw this movie last time at the age of 8....<br/><br/>now i'm 27 years old!<br/><br/>I had so much fun watching the whole trilogy again..even more like with the whole bunch of American movies i've been watching this year, just bought the DVD-Box with all three parts & it's AWESOME to watch these ones again!! Even more awesome like the first time i went to the movies. And I've been watching all 3 of 'em in a row.. HILARIOUS!! THIS IS Hollywood at its best! And in one thing i'm sure: a 4th part could never be done without Michael J. Fox..and never with. When you see this movie you think he never seems to get old. he could even play a teenager 10 years after finishing the 1st part! But for some reason some of the most gorgeous human beings have to get an illness that can't be cured... this fact is disgusting but you can't even do anything against it - what a pity...this movie is a part of Hollywood-History!!!"

","This is truly a classic, back when special effects looked realistic rather than impressive. I have always been fascinated by time travel and this movie demonstrates it to the full. If you're interested in time travel you will not get bored of this film! Oh and it's sequels are also excellent (although I like to think of it as one huge movie). Best trilogy ever in my opinion.<br/><br/>Not only is this a fantasy sci-fi, but also an adventure with comedic value. Tom Wilson known for his comedic roles (eg. wing commander series) does an excellent job of portraying Biff. In fact all the actors do an amazing job especially considering they all play multiple roles in different time-lines and realities. If you haven't already seen it, give it a try. 10/10 from me."
"ezdan1023","10","1","2","16 August 2006"," Timeless Classics
","BTTF trilogy is a timeless movie series. This is nothing new everyone knows this. It is 1 of 2 movie series I can watch and rewatch and find it a complete almost flawless piece of storytelling - the other being Lord Of The Rings.<br/><br/>That being said I would like to see the effects digitized in BTTF. Digital effects are infinitely better than analog ones - and the addition of such in BTTF would only further render timeless these films. I am a bit discouraged that Zemeckis hasn't done such already. I would want my pieces of art to be state-of-the-art and maintained forever onwards. George Lucas knows this and I respect him proportionately for such (though I think Episodes 4-6 of Star Wars need a lot of work).<br/><br/>Anyway, back to BTTF. Watch it and enjoy it. Hopefully we'll get another trilogy soon of BTTF. Maybe yes, maybe no. They'll still be great classics regardless. The only regret is that Crispin Glover out of his arrogance and naivete didn't stick around for all 3."
"ctrout","10","1","2","16 August 2006"," ""Oh Hi, Marty!""
","Back to the Future is probably the best and quintessential time traveling movie ever made. You can't go far without someone spouting out its memorable dialogue and imitating its wonderful characters. Now that it's over twenty years old, Back to the Future is entertaining a whole new generation.<br/><br/>It has a simple enough story that involves a teenager who longs for a better life and the crazy scientist friend who builds a time machine. When the scientist's unveiling of a time machine made out of a DeLorean goes awry, the teenager ends up accidentally going back in time thirty years. While he's there he sees all of the people he knows from 1985, except they're now thirty years younger.<br/><br/>A genius story like that creates an excellent movie and a star making performance by Michael J. Fox as the teenager. The highlight of this movie comes from the scientist played by Christopher Lloyd. His whacky antics were perfect for the role and made the character of Doc Brown immediately come to life.<br/><br/>Some viewers today may think that an '80s movie that ends up becoming a '50s movie won't be for them. Those people are sorely mistaken, because if you're looking for a wild ride that will keep you entertained and in stitches, look no further. Back to the Future has everything you crave."

","Well i first laid eyes upon Back to the Future when i was only a small boy. Straight away i was mesmirised. It was the first film that i watched over and over again and then the second one came out and then a third. Robert Zemeckis has done a great job on this picture, the script is solid and the acting is incredible from both ""Marty"" and ""Doc."" The way that all the films tie into each other is perfect scripting. A Great film for the family, the kid, the teenager or the geeky adult, it is a good example of a Perfect film.

","This movie is simply amazing to me. It has something to offer for everyone. It's funny, it's a good plot, and there's a time machine! And i believe the way the trilogy is structured is amazing. Robert Zemeckis closes out the first movie with a completed story and just begins the next one in a way. I think this is much better than what Pirates of the Caribbean:Dead Man's Chest, where too many stories are unfinished. The story line in Back to the Future is very thrilling. I don't think anything compares to this movie in its time era of 1985 where many special effects are used, and it is much different then a lot of the movies out.

If your child says ""It's too boyish."", ""It sounds boring."", or some other kind of whine or nasty comment, MAKE them see it. I even said I wouldn't like it! I said it with ""Star Wars"" too! Then my Dad FORCED me to see it, and now it's his fault I enjoyed these movies from start to finish. I'm sure you're child will be overjoyed with these movies too. If your a kid or teenager, take it from a 9-year-old, you'll adore it. If you came here looking for a plot line, sorry! In my opinion, one little hint at the movie could destroy one of the surprises, making the goodness of the plot crumble before your very eyes!!! That was a little too dramatic, but who cares! It's still a good movie, and you understood that. All in all, this is a terrific trilogy, which the world will cherish forevermore. 'Nuff Said!"

","I have no problem giving this movie a 10 out of 10. Exuberant, bursting with inventiveness, this movie is a joy. Marty MckFly is a great character, and the whole movie is done so well. Where are these movies nowadays? This may be my favourite Robert Zemeckis movie. And what a great career move for Michael J. Fox. He almost didn't get the gig; Eric Stoltz was almost cast instead. Flying Delorians and Flux Capacitors, Lightning Rods and Chuck Barry, an incestuous kiss and a disorderly scientist, elaborate inventions/models and pretty girls--1980's fun, indeed idiosyncratically 80's while also transcending cultural specificity...those lacking a sensibility for material from that decade will still find nothing to complain about in this happy exuberant adventure story."

I suppose I could comment on how amazingly well-written the plot is, how everything fits together perfectly and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Or, I could mention how hilarious it is; the subtle jokes like Lone Pine Mall, the absurdity of some of the characters, the expression on Crispin Glover's face. Perhaps I could say how incredible the effects are, and say how great it is that they still hold up today. After that, I could say something about how these are the characters that Micheal J.

Then I could end the review by saying how much I love the ending, how it almost makes you want to grab the sequel of the shelf right away.

"gabzz103","10","1","2","6 April 2006"," What more could you ask for?
","Wow, this movie had it all! It has an excellent comedic script, an extremely original science fiction and adventure plot, great suspense near the finale of the movie, very cool action sequences, a musical number and a romance subplot.<br/><br/>In this classic comedy, Michael J. Fox stars as Marty McFly, a 17-year-old from Hill Valley, California. He is a friend with Dr. Emmet Brown or ""Doc"" (Christopher Lloyd), a mad scientist who invented a time-machine out of a DeLorean. When they are testing it out for the first time, Marty accidentally gets sent back to 1955. He bumps into his teenage parents, before they are married, and by chance, his mother starts to like Marty and wants to go out with him. He then meets up with a younger Doc who helps him to try and make his parents fall in love with each other or else Marty won't be born and have him go back to 1985, the year he was originally from.<br/><br/>The characters are excellent. I loved the character development and how Marty made everyone change for the better. It put a smile to my face seeing the impact that he had on everyone else. Marty and Doc have excellent chemistry and everyone in it had an excellent performance. I preferred Crispin Glover's performance as Marty's father, George McFly. His total nerdiness just made me crack up when he spoke.<br/><br/>The script is also one of my all-time favourite screenplays. The humor is very clever and I loved the many one-liners. The plot is absolutely brilliant. It was truly one-of-a-kind and it made me think deeply of the concept of time travel and it kept me at the edge of my seat throughout the movie. <br/><br/>I cannot find a single flaw in this great feel-good movie. They couldn't have made it better. Out of the hundreds of movies I've seen, this is the most fun I had watching a film.<br/><br/>I rarely give out perfect scores but for Back to the Future, my rating is a 10/10, I could not recommend it more. This a great movie to watch if you want to have fun!"
"ray-280","10","1","2","4 April 2006"," One of the ten best films of the 20th century
","You could rank Back To The Future on an all-time list of best movies for its special effects, and its in-depth exploration of time-travel in what almost seems plausible. I'm sure the physics professors could find fault with a few things, but the ""pop physics"" lesson we get to justify the plot is sufficient. This, however, would only make Back To The Future a great film. What makes it a REALLY GREAT film, however, is the ""buddy film"" aspect, or the amazingly close friendship that Marty and Doc have. Their level of trust and reliance upon each other is phenomenal. We are lucky if we ever have a friend like that, and this is what makes the movie memorable.<br/><br/>For those who just got here in a time machine, the plot has typical high-schooler Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), whose father George (Crispin Glover) is bullied by Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), rejected high-school suitor of Marty's mother, Lorraine (Lea Thompson). George is a Walter Mitty type who never stands up for himself, and this sickens Marty, who seeks refuge with his girlfriend, Jennifer (Claudia Wells and later Elizabeth Shue), and the crazy, independently wealthy scientist Doc (Christopher Lloyd). School is no refuge for Marty, however, as the ""evil"" principal Mr. Strickland thinks he is a ""no good slacker."" Marty tries out for the battle of the bands, and Huey Lewis passes amusing judgment on him.<br/><br/>Doc invites Marty to film his time-travel experiment, by sending his dog, Einstein, a minute into the future. The time machine itself could have gotten a Best Supporting Actor Oscar itself, as it was a souped-up DeLorean (the brainchild of John DeLorean, who had recently been acquitted of cocaine trafficking that was ruled government entrapment of a vulnerable man about to lose his business). Doc had figured out that if he got the DeLorean to 88 mph while creating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity, the car would travel through time. He never made clear how he pinpointed the destinations, but there was a console in the car that needed only to be set.<br/><br/>The time-travel experiment is a success, but Marty soon learns (as gunmen approach) that Doc had gotten the plutonium necessary to generate the time travel had been stolen from Libyan terrorists who were out for revenge. They ""kill"" the Doc (who returns for II and III of this series, so draw your own conclusions), and Marty must escape their wrath in the DeLorean. To elude the Libyans, he floors the car, it hits 88 mph, and the next thing you know, Marty is back in 1955 and the movie ""begins."" Marty gets to see the ""romance"" between his parents develop, and he gets to compare their actual behavior with how they say things were, with predictable consequences. Marty looks up the Doc, who quickly realizes he is genuine, and blends into Hill Valley society. Marty then alters the future inadvertently, and he must repair his wrinkle before the key moment in his parents' hooking up, and then he has to find his way ""back to the future,"" something which will not be easy and which he will only have one chance to do.<br/><br/>Marty needs Doc to accomplish his mission, but Doc also needs Marty, because otherwise he would be the proverbial ""tree falling in the forest"" with no one there to hear him. The film develops the buddy plot to perfection, and handles the time travel humorously and in the true tradition of fantasy films, doing the best they can to be technically accurate, but staying focused on the human side of the story in a way that will leave audiences of all ages satisfied.<br/><br/>No DVD collection is complete without this film."

It's about a crazy scientist inventing a car that car travel both backward and forward in time. there is only one problem, something goes wrong. The time machines'power source consists of stolen uranium. The professor gets killed and a good friend of his, Marty MC fly (michael j. fox) has to travel back in time to prevent his death. Then another thing goes wrong, Marty gets send back to the fifties, where he learns the dangers of messing with the time line. Which is actually a sort of basic element in all three movies; 'facts and theories meet science fiction'.

It's an adventure that seems so plausible simply by the way the entire idea is executed.<br/><br/>Michael J Fox secured his position as one of the great comedic actors -- flawless and understated as the typical teen Marty McFly. In fact, the entire cast from Christopher Lloyd to Mark McClure to Wendie Jo Sperber, Leah Thompson, Crispin Glover and Thomas F Wilson (as Biff, the dim witted bully), the performances are engaging and memorable. <br/><br/>The story itself may seem simple, but the layers involved, tying present and past in a way that it both further and enriches the story, but never to be cute or clever.

I like other films from the 80s, like Lethal Weapon, The Goonies, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Return of the Jedi, but by far, Back to the Future is superior. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good comedy or adventure. Marty is probably my favourite character, followed by Doc.

","This has got to be one of the coolest movies ever made and the pinnacle of 80's popcorn cinema! High school teenager Marty McFly is sent back to 1955 through a DeLorean time machine invented by his friend, nutty scientist Doc Emmett Brown. Once there, he inadvertently changes the course of time. He must now do everything he can in order to bring his parents back together or he and his siblings will be erased from existence. He must also fight off school bully Biff Tannen and ultimately get back to the future. Director and co-writer Robert Zemeckis gives us pure solid entertainment with excellent pacing, likable characters, and a cleverly-written screenplay. The special effects are also exceptional. Twenty years later, they still look fresh and new. Zemeckis also succeeds in bringing to life an idealized and nostalgic 1950's look. Furthermore, the movie is filled with great performances. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are superb and have great chemistry together. Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson, and Thomas F. Wilson are also splendid in their underrated performances. Alan Silvetri's musical score and a couple of songs from Huey Lewis and the News are also enjoyable and serve their purpose to heighten the excitement.

","Back To The Future is a great movie that has everything.<br/><br/>A terrific story, memorable characters, great acting, dead-on satire, beautiful FX and great music. Every scene in this movie is a winner. Probably this movie works because it never takes itself seriously. From start to finish the movie contains an amazing wealth of visual gags (the giant guitar speaker, the DeLorean time machine), classic lines (""You can't have a Pepsi Free. You gotta pay for it."") and in-jokes (rocker Huey Lewis complaining that the music is too loud). The time travel logic, so hard to pull off, is done with great flair, suitable for any science fiction movie. Except this isn't a sci-fi film. It's a comedy with a heavy dose of social satire mixed in and it works on both levels. <br/><br/>Michael J. Fox plays Marty McFly a teenager who would rather play guitar than do anything else. He's friendly with the town's off-the-wall inventor Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd.) Doc creates a time machine and Marty is accidentally transported back to the year 1955. There he meets a younger version of his parents (Crispin Glover and Leah Thompson) and has to arrange for them to meet so they will get married and have him.<br/><br/>The role of Marty McFly was ideal for Michael J. Fox. His ability to play a teenager transferred perfectly from TV (Family Ties) to the big screen. Crispin Glover is terrific as Marty's father, George McFly. He has a dual role, as a teenager and an adult. Christopher Lloyd is almost over-the-top as the nutty inventor. Thomas Wilson is Biff, the bully who constantly torments George McFly. <br/><br/>Other than Forrest Gump this is Robert Zemeckis's best movie. Kids and adults will appreciate it."

"Nozze-Musica","Null","1","2","20 July 2005"," Corny no doubt but still awesome.
","This is as typical of a teen eighties movie as you can get, in fact the eighties might have been the decade that those teen movies were invented, if not then this is when they definitely got popular. The formula is generally the same, there is a self assured kinda rebellious young man who sometimes gets in trouble, has a nice girlfriend, and gets into all kinds of trouble. He listens to cool music, says ""ayyyyyyy"" a lot, and most of the time has some sort of mullet. Some of the teen movies are good, some of them awful, but this one is a cut above the rest, Back to the Future is one of the best movies of the 1980's, and 80's superstud Michael J. Fox leads off this excellent movie. He plays Marty McFly, a high school kid who hangs out with the crazy scientist Dr. Brown, a wacky spaced out inventor played to perfection by Christopher Lloyd. The performances of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd and their chemistry really are what make this movie they are perfect for their parts and really make this the movie that it is.<br/><br/>The plot is very nice too. We see Marty McFly's neighborhood before anything was there, and it was just open land. We see the small town he lives in when it was much smaller in size, and there wasn't so much expansion. We see a lot of cool stuff in this movie. This is a movie that holds your interest through the entire thing. I have to admit I am a science fiction fan, and I have always been fascinated wit the concept of time travel, and while this movie is a complete fantasy (they travel back in time in a Delorean) It is also interesting to see the makeup jobs in this movie, we see characters 30 years in the past, and we see 40 year old people playing people who are twenty years old and vice versa. The highlight of the movie remains Christopher Lloyd, who plays what might be his best part ever, he is just too funny for words, and is so over-the-top he gives this movie the perfect tone, and compliments everyone around him with his great performance.<br/><br/>The story progresses nicely, the last half hour is priceless, as we see Michael J. Fox play Johnny Be Good to a crowd who has never heard rock and roll as we know it. Then he goes back to the future and he almost misses it. The movie has the Quantum Leap aspect of it as we see what opens when you alter the past which affects the present in ways we never would have thought of. This movie is both a nice timepiece for the fifties and the eighties, showing at least the way that people in both time would like to have thought they were, in an idealistic world, so the movie is interesting like that, and has a nice touch of comedy, and science fiction here. The two genre's mesh well here, and sometimes Science Fiction and comedy don't always go well together. (see Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy) It is also kind of funny to see the time period conflict with each other, we see things that are done in the eighties, and not in the fifties and vice versa. While there are no belly laughs in the movie there are enough jokes and enough interesting moments that will definitely make you think, this is not a socially conscious movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it is something that is very interesting. This movie is probably the centerpiece of Michael J. Fox's film career, he rarely had a films this successful other than the two sequels, and this was a monster hit for the day. While it is one of the best eighties movies it is also one of the best about time travel, corny it might be but Back to the Future remains one of the best of it's kind, it's kinda hard to classify, but of whatever genre it is, it is one of the best."
"twisterchaser3","10","1","2","3 June 2005"," fabulous, thrilling, suspense, and much more!
","I love Back to the Future! Not only does it beat Star Wars, it also beats many more movies of its kind. Its so suspenseful, and yet, so touching and sweet. Its also hilarious to think that if you went back in time ur mother would fall in love with you! It presents a possible way of time travel. I love the Delorean, I want to get one. I love the scene at the clocktower in which Marty goes back to 1985. And I love the scene at the end where marty and the doc go back to the future, and doc says one his famous lines, ""where we're going we don't need roads!"" If you want something that the entire family would enjoy, get Back to the Future. I will say that you will need a curse-free DVD or vcr, for the movie has foul language in it, but other than that, ur good to go!"

","I grew up with this movie, it has to be my favourite film of all time. I have seen it hundreds of times and it just doesn't get boring. Michael J Fox became one of my favourite actors after this film and i followed his career into other films. The cast must've worked hard with several actors playing 2 parts and it finish's well to be open for the sequel. A superb plot which has a fantastic storyline and superb actors and it uses a classic Irish car in a Delorean. Robert Zemekis as director was fantastic and choosing Michael J Fox as the main lead was the best thing they could have done A fantastic film for all ages and i will be showing my kids this film when i have some. Even though it is 20 years old it still is one of the best films made in my opinion anyway"
"eddymula","10","1","2","23 April 2005"," My opinion on this movie
","I think this movie is the best movie ever made, so far. It is an exciting movie about a young man named Marty McFly Who travels back in time and can't get back. I think the score is the best score invented to a movie since James Bond Dr. No. It is an original score that really sticks in your head. Don't worry you won't hate that. I would like to thank Alan Silvestry for creating the biggest orchestra to make a movie score because I think he did a wonderful job and really made the music go with the movie. Me and my family I think have the biggest knowledge of Back to the Future probably in the entire United Kingdom. So take my word for it when I say this movie is the most exciting, suspenseful, and lovable thing you will ever see."

This specific trilogy is proof that most sequels are always worse than the original (although the sequels of it are quite enjoyable but perform far from the ""classic status"" of the original).<br/><br/>Its a classic and probably the best movie of the 80s. It is very enjoyable and engaging because you get drawn to it as you (in later viewings) try to find the small hidden changes that come by alternating the time-line.<br/><br/>The cast is also brilliant - it was like they were born for these roles: Christopher Lloyd is the perfect mad scientist, Michael J.Fox is very believable playing a teen (although in his twenties) and Lea Thompson is great (and obviously very talented) playing the different Lorraines in different time zones.

","I was watching the series again last week, and I struck for the first time by how brilliant Thomas F. Wilson's performance was throughout it.

"FrankBooth_DeLarge","10","1","2","1 February 2005"," Great '80's film, way better than its sequels
","Back to the Future was made in 1985. Let's say that the '80's was a very mixed time for films. There were some cheesy sci-fi moves, a lot of teen movies(the most popular ones were made by John Hughes), there were movies made specifically for the special effects, and there were plenty of raunchy comedies like the classic Risky Business and Revenge of the Nerds. During the time of its release, many movie companies weren't predicting Back To The Future to do as well since it didn't have anything raunchy in it, and it was different from a lot of other movies. However, all of those reasons are the real reason behind why this movie did so well.<br/><br/>(possible Spoilers) The movie is a creative look at the awe and danger of time travel. A teen named Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox) never gets to school on time and he doesn't get as much as he deserves. His family is kind of off beat, but all of this changes one day. A man he knows named Dr. Emitt Browm(played enthusiastically by Christopher Lloyd) has invented a car that has the ability to travel through time. Due to a certain event, Marty ends up thirty years into the past with no way to get back. Now he needs to find a way to get back to the future before he vanishes into time. This movie is actually way better than what it sounds through my summary.<br/><br/>The special effects were groundbreaking for back in their time, the acting is good, and this movie takes a realistic approach at the dangers of time travel. I'd recommend this movie to anybody, even younger kids will probably enjoy this. The sequels aren't bad, but they aren't as good as the original."
"malkane316","10","1","2","29 January 2005"," Quick Reviews!!
","Probably the best time-travel movie ever made, successful because it appeals to all ages- it has so much action and humour that all kids will be entertained, and the concept of time travelling is not dumbed down for the adults. The incredibly complex plot, made all the more incredible when considering that it spreads over the course of three films, but that each film has individuality.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox cemented his name in history by his performance here as school kid Marty McFly, a wannabe musician who befriends local wacky scientist Doc McCloud, played exceptionally be Christopher Lloyd. The Doc has created a time machine in the form of a De Lorean car. However, when the Doc is murdered, it is up to Marty to ravel back in time to prevent the murder. Marty goes back to the fifties- to the time when his mum and dad were in school together, but in a great twist Marty's mum falls for him, so he has to figure out how to get his mum and dad together or he will never be born. Many more twists ensue with frantic pace until Marty eventually attempts to get back to the future.<br/><br/>The action is fast, the sets and costumes are excellent, the famous theme tune is rousing, and there are many memorable moments. It is definitely a film for fans of 80's nostalgia, but it is one of those rare films which can be clearly recognised as being made in the 80's without looking remotely cheesy. On the contrary, everything about the film remains cool to this day. Every performance is worthy of mentioning, from McFly's eternal bully Biff, to Marty's young, geeky father. A film which should delight everyone, and another which i find difficult to fault. 10 out of 10"
"ben-plant","10","1","2","18 January 2005"," Why this film is so BRILLIANT!
","The film is fantastically clever and the plots are very good. Also, the car looks so damn good with it's bits on, and it definitely sparked my interest in cars, particularly the rare ones. I don't care how many people say it's fake and it's poorly rendered and whatever, but i think it looks amazing and it deserves a heck of a lot of praise! The second film is not as good as the first, and the third was not as good as either of the other two. But it is still an amazing piece of film and a truly incredible plot line and story. The characters are very believable and this is always good. The actors used just slot right in, and things are so smooth with the actors that it looks almost as though it's a documentary."

","The first time I saw this movie, i was mezmarized, I was 4 years old. Now every time I see it, I am mezmarized, even at 18.

Who wouldn't want to do that? I know thats what I would wanna do.

Fox because the first guy just didn't fit Marty like he does. The ""Delorean®"" fit the time look perfect to.

","I think this movie is one of the most intelligent movies ever made! Charmingly witty and extremely well done. I think it is downright hilarious how Michael J. Fox's characters own mother was trying to get in his pants and how he learned so many ""interesting"" things about his mothers past! Another great part was when he met his jailbird uncle when his uncle was just a baby and he told him to get used to the bars of his crib! There were so many things that happened in one part of the movie that became important later on in the movie that, if you weren't paying attention, was probably lost on some people, I felt it was brilliant! The soundtrack was also fantastic and helped set the mood for the whole movie. The whole ""butterfly effect"" of dealing with Biff was brilliant as well. BRAVO!"
"spymedia","9","1","2","8 August 2004"," The movie was superb!
","The minute I saw Michael J. Fox in Doc's house putting in wires here and there connecting to the large speaker and then it blasts-I was laughing away! I have hardly seen any movie that starts of funny! The making of the car is brilliant and I thinks that with so little special effects it is really the best! Many movies have this thing about wishes, they wish for it and ta da it happens-but hello how did it happen?! This car thing is really good for imagination and really persuades people to enjoy and let their fantasies fly with the characters in the movie. The best part I liked-I was snickering, when Michael-'Marty' is hit and found by Lorraine who is actually his mother brings him into her house and she has some feelings for him and 'wants him'-he freaks out! That was really funny, like I never thought of such a case when he is to see his parents in high school. It was really cool! The imagination is so rich that you feel like you are in the movie and enjoying the humor and the tensions that Marty has! There was one thing that bothered me-by the end of the movie when Marty wakes up and he walks by the dining room he stops and sees something really weird, there are different furniture and he spots his brother in his business suit and is unaware what it is, then he sees his parents and then collapses how did he end up here when his parents look older and there is new furniture which he wasn't familiar with and he ended up having a jeep? Plus when Doc turns up he has a new way of making gas It's confusing! But it didn't really matter because the movie was the greatest! I wouldn't mind if they make a newer version of these series of Back to the Future, with more visual effects and more action!"

"DarthBill","Null","1","2","20 April 2004"," It's all about being a man
","SPOILERS!! ""Back to the Future"" underwent a lot of changes. In earlier drafts of the script, the time machine was not a car but more of a chamber or fridge, Marty's mom Lorraine was called Eileen, Doc's pet was a monkey named Shep isntead of a dog named Einstein, George became a boxer instead of a writer and Marty himself had to confront a few federal figures in order to get back to 1985 (originally 1982). But one idea always stayed the same - a son teaching his father how to be a man and get him to hook up with his mother even though the mother is infatuated with her own son or else he and his family won't exist! The film also presents the idea that happiness and manhood are linked.<br/><br/>Because George McFly (Crispin Glover) is unable to stand up for himself, his life is an unhappy one: his house is full of bad furniture, his wife Lorraine (Leah Thompson) is a depressed beer guzzling chain smoker, his son Dave (Marc McClure, Jimmy Olsen of the Superman films) works at a McDonalds, his<br/><br/>daughter Linda has problems with her love life and his younger son Marty (Michael J. Fox), a typical teenager who wants to be a rock star but has doubts about himself, is probably the best of the lot. Meanwhile, George's life long tormentor Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson: ""Say hi to your mom for me kid."") is his boss and still pawns off all his work on George, just like when they were in high school. George himself is a middle aged mess of a nerd, and because of this his family, particularly Marty and Lorraine, are unhappy with him.<br/><br/>
The only good things Marty has going for him is his girlfriend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells) and his eccentric mad scientist pal ""Doc"" Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). While video taping Doc's plutonium powered time machine car, things go horribly awry and Marty is transported back to 1955, where he must get help from the 1955 Doc in order to get back to 1985. Unfortunately, Marty screws up his mother and father's first meeting as teenagers, which puts his own existence in danger because if they don't fall in love at the high school dance that was supposed to be their first big date, then he and his siblings won't exist!<br/><br/>This gives Marty the unique chance to be his own dad's mentor and engages in a series of embarrassing attempts to get the beautiful Lorraine and hapless George together. Problem is George is too shy and clumsy to properly talk to people, least of a a beautiful girl like Lorraine, Biff Tannen is also after Lorraine and Lorraine herself is infatuated with her future son Marty! George manages to win Lorraine's sympathy but not her interest, and it doesn't help that Marty has a knack for upstaging his own father, if only to protect both of his parents from Biff. This makes Marty the film's definition of a man: a guy who can stand up for himself.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Lorraine's infatuation with Marty eventually fizzles and George<br/><br/>comes through. When Biff tries to rape Lorraine in a car at the dance, George (as part of a failed plan concocted by Marty) comes to the rescue. The sight of Biff roughing up Lorraine finally angers George enough to fight back and he strikes Biff down with a mighty left hook, which also scores him big points with Lorraine. Striking down Biff is the first step George takes in achieving his manhood and he later cements it when a guy tries to steal Lorraine from him at the dance but he pushes the guy away.<br/><br/>Because of this, George's life in the future is much happier: his house has better furniture, his wife Lorraine is healthier and happier, his son Dave has a better job, daughter Linda has control of her love life and Marty is basically the same except he now has a big truck and Biff no longer has any control over George. This is because George became a writer like he wanted to and is able to provide better for his family. This would imply that manhood and happiness are linked.<br/><br/>Thomas Wilson is an imposing Biff, Fox is an endearing teen hero, and Leah Thompson is both repugnant and adorable as his mom Lorraine. The real standouts though are Christopher Lloyd as Doc and Crispin Glover as George.<br/><br/>Though his intense gaze may be out of place at times, Glover brought something unique to George McFly that made him more than just another underdog. Who would have guessed he'd go on to play so many weird characters? Lloyd is just plain funny.<br/><br/>The ending of the film, where Marty and Jennifer are whisked away to the future by Doc, was NOT a set up for a sequel, it was just another gag."
"clydestuff","10","1","2","18 March 2004"," Tell me, doctor, where are we going this time?
","Good time travel films have always held a certain amount of fascination for me despite the improbability and implausible concept involved. Traveling through time is one of those ""what if"" fantasies one can continually dwell. I never grow tired of considering the endless possibilities involved if such thing were possible. I especially enjoy when a film gives us a new and entertaining twist on the subject. With Back To The Future, director and writer Robert Zemeckis along with writer Bob Gale has given us not only one of the best of the genre, but began one of the truly great film trilogies.<br/><br/>If you don't know the story by now, Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox) is a teenager with more than his share of problems. His father, George(Crispin Glover) gives new definition to the meaning of the word dork, his mother Lorraine(Lea Thompson) is a worn out closet alcoholic, his brother Dave (Marc McClure) works at a fast food joint, and his sister Linda(Wendie Jo Sperber) is on the verge of becoming an old maid. Outside of the home, a teacher named Strickland(James Tolkan) has it in for Marty constantly referring to him a slacker and his father's co-worker, Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) is constantly intimidating George even to the point of having George doing his work assignments for him. Marty's best friend is an old scientist named Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd), and his girlfriend is Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). It is his relationships with Jennifer and Doc Brown that enable Marty to think he might somehow escape the trials and tribulations of his Daily life. Well, Marty does escape, but not a manner that he could not have imagined in his worst nightmare. It seems that Doc Brown has invented a time machine out of a Delorean and through a series of misadventures Marty gets transported back to his home town in the year 1955. Not only does Marty meet his parents and his Dad's arch enemy Biff as teenagers, he somehow manages to interfere with Lorraine and George's romance, thus jeopardizing his own existence. It is left up to the Doc Brown of the past to help Marty set things right, and somehow find a way to return Marty ""Back To The Future.""<br/><br/>This scenario sets up endless possibilities and Zemeckis and Gale make full use of the concept. Not only do they have Marty interfering with his parents relationship, but his mother develops a crush on him in one of the most hilarious romantic encounters one could imagine. The more Marty tries to set things right, the more Lorraine becomes infatuated with him. Don't worry, Zemeckis and Gale never let the idea sink into sleaziness, but instead develop it into one hilarious moment after another. What is amazing also is watching how the life of the teenage Lorraine is as different from the adult Mrs. Mcfly as night and day. It's a revelation to Marty and to us. As for George, it seems he has always been somewhat of a cowardly type, but as Marty discovers, he had hopes and dreams as a teenager much as many of us did.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox was the perfect choice to play Marty McFly. Initially, because of his TV series commitment, he had to take a pass. When Eric Stoltz was not working out as Marty, Fox was thankfully able to work things out to be able to do the film. For that we shall forever be grateful. It's not that I think Eric Stoltz is not a good actor, but his laid back and darker personality would never have fit into what Marty was. Christopher Lloyd brings a characterization to Doc Brown that makes him the glue that holds the idea of time travel together. He's crazy enough to come up with the idea of a DeLorean Time Machine and has us believe he could make good on the concept. His friendship with Marty is believable enough that their on screen moments together seem genuine and sincere. There is no other way to put it except to say that if there is one character in this movie stranger than Doc, it's Crispin Glover's George. His portrayal gives new meaning to the words wimpy coward. Lea Thompson as Lorraine sets the pace for everyone. Her future Lorraine is different in so many aspects from the teenage Lorraine, yet Ms. Thompson is able to pull it off without a hitch and still have us believe they are one and the same person. There is nothing lovable about Thomas Wilson's biff. He is the consummate high school bully that many of us dealt with on more than one occasion. We have to admit a great satisfaction in how his character is dealt with.<br/><br/>Of course, as I have mentioned in other films about time travel, all this good stuff could have been wasted if the film makers had copped out at the end. It's the kind of thing that has ruined many other films of the genre. Zemeckis and Gale not only do not hesitate in their assumptions of the possibilities of what happens when you interfere with the past, they take the ball and run with it making the film just that much more satisfying.<br/><br/>If you were to look at a list of my favorite films, you would see Back To The Future on there, occupying a place of prominence. It is in the top 250 films on the IMDB, and one of the films that earned its place justifiably so. And if you are on my personal list, and that list also, you get my grade and in this case it equals an A+."

","PLOT SPOILERS:<br/><br/>Marty McFly is your average teenager, living in Hill Valley, CA, in October 1985. He likes rock music, has nerdy parents, has a beautiful girlfriend Jennifer - oh, and his best friend is eccentric scientist Dr Emmett L Brown. One night, Doc Brown calls Marty to the mall to record his latest experiment - a time machine built into a DeLorean sports car! Unfortunately, an encounter with some Lybian terrorists means Marty is accidentally sent back to November 5th 1955, where he interferes with his parents' first meeting. Marty finds the 1955 version of Doc Brown and they discover Marty's future mother Lorraine has a crush on him rather than on his future father, the wimpy George McFly! Local bully Biff Tannen is also causing trouble for Marty. Marty has just one week to get George and Lorraine together, defeat Biff and get himself back to the future using the bolt of lightning that will strike the clocktower at 10.04pm on November 12th 1955.<br/><br/>OK, now the plot is out of the way, I shall review the film. This is one of the best films I have ever seen, if not the best. The actors play their characters well, the storyline is gripping and engaging, and the filmmakers have managed to create the 1950's successfully.<br/><br/>The cast are perfect for their parts. Apart from Michael J Fox, the other main cast members all play their characters at 2 different ages, 30 years apart, and they all convincingly play the older versions of their characters. Special mention must go to Tom Wilson who is excellent as bully Biff Tannen, and of course Christopher Lloyd - no-one could play Doc Brown as well as Lloyd, with the waving of arms and the scientific speech - it is the part Lloyd was born to play. Although not technically a ""character"", the DeLorean time machine looks very scientific, yet also looks like it could fall apart any minute since it was built in Doc Brown's garage! I personally think it looks futuristic (and so do the Peabody family in 1955, when they see it they think it is a UFO!) and yet very stylish.<br/><br/>The story is engaging and the filmmakers have a lot of ""set it up, play it off"" moments, which make you remember to earlier in the film. Example: Marty fails a guitar audition with his band in 1985, but manages to wow the crowds whilst playing ""Johnny B Goode"" in 1955. Although the idea of time paradox is not really examined at until the sequels, there are hints of it here for all the scientific people out there. :-) Various one-liners, in-jokes and jokes about the differences between 1955 and 1985 are scattered throughout the film.<br/><br/>Alan Silvestri's score is one of the best he's done, and he manages to capture what the audience should be feeling at that time. The race to the clocktower near the end of the film has suspenseful, action music; whilst the scene where George and Lorraine get together has romantic, feel good music. The main theme is very catchy and you'll be humming it for quite a while! Various songs from the 1950's and 1980's are used, including ""The Power Of Love"" by Huey Lewis and the News.<br/><br/>Overall, a very good film that launched the movie career of Michael J Fox, and was one of the smash hits of 1985.

","Back to the Future concerns itself with an accidental trip into the past facilitated by a converted Delorean Sports Car. What isn't fully explored is the role that poor production values, industrial incompetence and the subsidies of the British Taxpayer, propping up a failing and corrupt American adventure capitalist, played in Marty Mcfly's near-on temporal suicide and submission to incest.<br/><br/>The time machine was the product of substandard labour from a ill-trained Ulster work force. In an area where zealots and murderers had ruined the local economy in the pursuit of an imagined community but with an all-consuming disdain for democracy and the value of human life, Delorean had stepped in, not for altruistic purposes but because of tax breaks afforded to him by the then Labour Government who were desperate to do something about the stifling level of provincial unemployment. If these men couldn't get jobs then they might be tempted to take up arms and join the mob, knee capping young men under the pretext of collusion of the Unionists and the British Army or, if there was no such man, kidnap mothers in front of their children and shoot them in the head. Thus mainland British taxpayers, who worked hard and had no part in the religious hatred that had ruined this community, began to have their cash syphoned off for the sake of a PR initiative. At stake - the vanity and greed of John Delorean, a man who saw the local fat, semi-literate workforce with their half-baked, bigoted ideals as the perfect contingent to fashion his overpriced, poorly designed sports car. The stainless steel construction would later be cited as conducive to allowing the mechanism of time travel to take place but in practice it was the cars poor acceleration and botched circuitry that would prove more decisive when Marty was forced to flee for his life from Libyan terrorists. Marty's odyssey into the past nearly wiped out his existence and could have lead to sexual intercourse with his mother. At the root of it all we may look to the folly of cheap Labour, poor management and a cheated British electorate.<br/><br/>Some good laughs."

","The film has every gene in it, comedy, sci fi, action, romance ect. The acting is brilliant and i recommend it to everyone! i don't know a single person who has watched it and not liked it! it has fantastic effects and also the story is fantastic and is completely original"
"Brad2002","10","1","2","14 February 2004"," One of the best (includes spoilers!)
","This is one of those movies that shouldn't get a high rating, but is one of my favorites anyway. Generally, highly popular, sci-fi/adventure, movies are not thought of as great, but this is definitely an exception. Why is that? It's the script, IMO. I have yet to see such a brilliant and clever script since. Examples are: Marty's mom berating the behavior she herself was guilty of as a teenager; Marty creating a makeshift skateboard, which he is shown to be very adept at riding in the present, out of an old time scooter in 1955; George Mcfly punching out Biff turns George into a confident, successful writer and Biff into a stumbling oaf; and, of course, Marty inventing rock n roll. Every story writer/screenwriter should really study this script to see how the great ones are constructed.<br/><br/>    Another reason this movie is so good is that the casting is as good as it can be. I really can't imagine any other actors in those roles.<br/><br/>    Beyond that, the movie is just so much fun to watch - it's one of those movies I've seen a hundred times and still watch if it comes on TV."

It REALLY suits it. Both with feeling and cinematically. I would really like to take my hat off for Alan Silvestri.<br/><br/>  I also want to mention the camera work on this film. The camera work on this film is so awesome! In just about every scene I find the camera work is well done.<br/><br/>  Another thing that I really enjoy in this film, is that it is one of the few movies where the movie is always flowing. No matter what is going on, it always seems that the film is always flowing well and with a large amount of interest. So I suppose that this flows much into story.

","Back to the Future is one of my all time favourite movies. A perfect blend of adventure, time travel and comedy that has the added bonus of a sparkling cast and a great 1950's backdrop. Christopher Lloyd is excellent as the wide eyed, white haired Doc Brown and Crispin Glover delivers a memorable performance as Marty McFly's nerdish father. This film made Michael J Fox a movie star and watching his energetic and adorable performance its easy to see why. Fox gives Marty charm and he has the rare and under appreciated gift of making characters seem likeable, this role fits him like a glove. Pratically rushed out to buy the trilogy on DVD when it was released and i know its a film that i will never tire of watching.

Unlike the sequels, which were watered down a bit. This film brings the new wave ""MTV"" quality of the mid-80's back to a realistic 1955. The issue of time and time paradox which is explained and demonstrated in the sequels....well it's to much information to get into. <br/><br/>Originally this film wasn't intended for sequels, then ending was a joke."
"LuboLarsson","9","1","2","10 August 2003"," Timeless
","Back to the Future was without a shadow of a doubt one of the best films of the 1980's, everything about it is just so great, the story, the acting, the music and the special effects. It was a huge hit in 1985 and I caught it on video soon after, it was the most entertaining and feel good movie I had seen up to that point. Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd got the roles of their life in this film and Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson are great too. The whole time travel concept is brilliantly realised, the great thing about time travel is that it gives the film-makers many oppurtunities to insert some clever in jokes into the movie and they do that a lot in BTTF. They promised follow up at the end of the movie arrived four years later, which interestingly was filmed at the same time as Part III. Although they were enjoyable enough I couldn't help but be disappointed by them, neither had the magic of this one unfortunately. ***9/10***"
"DragonMasterHiro","10","1","2","3 July 2003"," ""Make like a tree, and get outta here.""
","Timeless. One of the most amazing adventures brought to the big screen. Anytime this movie comes on TV or someone else is watching it, I find myself watching too even though I've seen it practically 20 times already. There are just so many great characters and the plot takes hold of you because it's exciting and humorous. <br/><br/>*SPOILERS* Everything fits together so nicely in this movie: the fantasy of time travel, a cool car, dire circumstances, a good villain, a variety of roles, great music (by Huey Lewis & the News) and so many great scenes! You've got Doc and Marty testing out the DeLorean and being attacked, people mistaking Marty for an alien, when Marty first arrives in town in the past and finds Doc, getting hit by the car and waking up next to his mom, the clock tower scene...they're all great! I think Marty McFly is one of the best movie heroes of all time. There's no super powers, easy way to escape or higher beings at work.  It's just him trapped in the 50's with nothing but his wits.  He's just an ordinary kid with big aspirations but plenty of quirks. Doc Brown is just plain crazy but goodhearted. Biff Tannen is the best example of the thick headed bully. The whole movie is intense since if Marty takes too much time to get his parents together, then he will fade away forever. Of course, in trying to make things right, Marty messes up here and there and constantly has to fix it!<br/><br/>What we have today simply does not compare to movies like this one. Sure, maybe they do big numbers at the box office for one weekend, but none of them will stand the test of time. They even managed to make the sequel, Back to the Future II (another great one) which wasn't a bomb like most sequels. They also made Back to the Future III which wasn't as good, but in my opinion this one was the best in the trilogy.<br/><br/>""When this baby hits 88 miles an hour, you're gonna see some serious sh*t!"" - Doc"

"forecastmazy","10","1","2","20 May 2003"," WHY this is the GREATEST triology ever.
","Okay so claiming something the greatest trilogy ever is a huge claim. I'll admit that, but I'd never have become a film student if it wasn't for Back To The Future....and that's right, not just Pt1, ALL THREE. Now let me explain....<br/><br/>As a child Back To The Future held my attention like nothing else. Every second was like a magical moment. I remember very distinctly when I saw BTTF2 and BTTF3 in the movie theaters; they were two of my greatest childhood memories. I feel honored that I could even see such great movies in the theaters. Makes me feel bad about the kids who are gonna have memories of Jennifer Lopez movies...<br/><br/>Marty Mcfly is a kid. He has a crappy family and doesn't know why. He doesn't have a car and doesn't know why. But he faces everyday troubles and hes really not that bad of a guy at the beginning of the movie. Despite his parents troubles Marty has grown up fine.<br/><br/>Marty however has a friend who's strange but a genius named Doc who accidentally sends him back to 1955 where he sees his parents grow up? The small things that the parents do in the long run catch up to them. The small decisions in childhood affect their entire futures.<br/><br/>As a kid, Marty grew up in the same time as myself and then travels to the two places you know you always wanted to go as a kid.... the mid 1950s, The Future and The Wild West. I mean I know I wanted to, that's why I played all three video games. Back To The Future has a nostalgic sense even if you weren't born in the 80s because it's done so well. The emotions are pretty much universal, especially for those who grow up in small towns/suburbia --- to see what your town was like in the future and the past....wouldn't that be amazing? ESPECIALLY amazing to see while you're growing up and still connected to the town (via school, etc...) Each movie in this trilogy has its own charm. It's hard to pick a favorite (but the first one IS really the best. I mean come on; you can't appreciate the changes in time if you don't see the first movie.)<br/><br/>Now talking about this film on the level of a film student, this film is amazing. The motifs are done very well, The Mayor, The Clocktower, Doc's House, Marty's family growing and changing, The Cafe where Marty always goes to eat no matter what time it is. There's so many motifs that you only notice subconsciously unless your looking for them, but THEY are definitely there.<br/><br/>Any lesser director would have just made up fancy looking things for the future. Made an old looking set for the past. BUT NO! This combination does it right. Returning the same place in different time, you ultimately see how time changes things and therefore you see the true cause and effect of life through time travel.<br/><br/>The underlying concept of the movie - The small things change everything. Marty's scolds his mother for smoking and drinking so much as a teenager...and she doesn't grow up to be an ugly alcoholic. Marty makes his dad more confident...and he overcomes other challenges in life and isn't a greasy dork at 40. I mean it's a lot like the cause and effect idea that the TV show Quantum Leap uses (and LET ME TELL YOU that show does time travel sooooo right.)<br/><br/>Anyone who says the sequels to Back To The Future sucked, or don't live up to the first one are just wrong. Their not looking and their judging it the wrong way. You can't watch Back To The Future with the judging eye filled with contempt the jaded pop culture of the now would give you. You must watch BTTF with the open eye of an awed film go-er. And then you will love the trilogy.<br/><br/>This movie made Robert Zemeckis one of my personal heroes. Bob Gale as well. Bob Gale went on the write for Daredevil amongst a few other comics and is well respected in the comic world and you can clearly see why in this movie. IF YOU READ COMIC BOOKS you can see Zemeckis creates shots like in panels. Gale and Zemeckis seem to click in a unique and perfect way. There's not one thing you could change about this series. It's perfect the way it is. I'm just glad IMDB exists so I could express how much I love this series for how great of a movie is. The movie keeps your interest because the subject matter is great. The movie keeps long lasting appeal because it is well done and the motifs are great. IMDB only gives me 1,000 words to express how great this film is. And that's far too few.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen these movies your already in the past.<br/><br/>
(HA! But I had to throw a cheap pun in there. I mean it is the 80s we're reflecting on....although this movie doesn't even have any of those. So maybe I'm behind....)<br/><br/>=)"
"Sneaky_Pete_XXVII","10","1","2","15 May 2003"," The first classy time travel film
","Back to the future is probably the only time travel film that is interesting on a scientific angle, and fun on an adventurous level. The film (like most of the films that I like), has everything going for it. Cast, music, script, etc. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are perfect for the roles of Marty and Doc. I enjoy the fact that it explains the story in a way that for those of us who don't read up on time travel can understand.<br/><br/>  Another thing that I liked about the film was that it took place in the 50's. If it had of been me writing it, I probably wouldn't of picked this era. But after seeing the film I probably would of reconsidered. I really don't like the 50's; but this film made me enjoy the story regardless, which is a powerful thing to do.   Back to the Future has everything for it, it attracts, and it flows with a positive plot and feeling. Making this film near the top of my choices of Sci-fi, and maybe perhaps over all genres."
"Mike_Scurfield","10","1","2","7 May 2003"," A classic - the best adventure movie of all time.
","This movie will always be special for me as it's the first movie I ever saw, and it's still one of my favourites.<br/><br/>For those who haven't seen it, Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) is a regular kid living in Hill Valley, he skateboards, he's late to school, and he's embarrassed by his parents.  He is friends with 'crazy' scientist Dr. Emmett Brown (wonderfully played by Christopher Lloyd), whose new invention turns Martys' life upside down.<br/><br/>Marty accidentally sends himself back to 1955, where he manages to stop his own parents from meeting each other.  With no power for the DeLorean time machine, and no where else to go, he hooks up with (a slightly younger) Doc to get his parents back together before the inevitable happens... he isn't born!<br/><br/>This movie is great in that it links a good story with even better characters. Full of funny moments, and quotable lines, this movie also sets up some great running gags which continue in the sequels (Marty waking up in bed thinking it was all a dream, the 'borrowing' of a skateboard, Biff & manure). Plus I think that this film has the best 'race against time' ending I've ever seen. (Doubled by not only getting his parents back together before he disappears, but also not missing his one single chance to get back to 1985).<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet then you really should, I can't recommend it enough.  It's a great family film which can be enjoyed by anyone.  If it's been a while since you saw it, go back and watch it again, you'll be amazed at how many great bits you'll have forgotten about. A very exciting movie, a true adventure in every sense of the word, which is held together by a sound moral core: 'If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything'. Like Jennifer says: `That's good advise Marty'."
"kouroszare","10","1","2","21 April 2003"," One of the greatest adventures of all times!!
","As I saw this great movie for the first time , I was astonished about the story and relation between time and characters. I think only Robert Zemeckis and Micheal J Fox and Christofer Lloyd can do this. Only great directors can make a film in 3 part, and each part has been better."
"SPaS","10","1","2","13 April 2003"," Great 80s' montage! (spoilers)
","Back to the future is perhaps the best fantasy/comedy/adventure flick to date! And a great 80s' montage, as well (God, is this really almost 20 years old??). Along, with, of course  ""Gremlins"", ""Ghostbusters"", John Hughes' movies and ""Miami Vice""... But what makes this movie special is, that it seems to have aged a lot less than the other movies of its time - which is a tremendous achievement keeping in mind that this movie somewhat ""boasted"" with its time-travel special effects. The trick is, effects shouldn't manipulate the movie. Zemeckis was a genius ahead of his time, too many directors haven't learnt this lesson even yet. Why don't they make movies LIKE THIS anymore? Just set a likeable character (college kids seem to work well) in a predicemen, and let him work and stumble - the balance is essential; needs to be comedic, but not a farce - his way out of it through a 1000 minor and major situations and setbacks. All right, this guy ""grows up to be"" an unlikely hero, but do NOT reward him too much in the end (yeah, yeah, ""rolemodels for the kids"", blah blah. There is a surplus of ""educational"" movies, no need to to be ramming it down everybodys' throats every possible chance!). And do NOT forget the darker issues, even a little grown-up material. Only the really-really-unimportant side characters are to be card-board stereotypes. Special effects come LAST. Keep up the pace, etc etc.<br/><br/>BTTF can also boast with its pace: comedic stuff from the starts and about a dozen ""endings"": great sentimental peak when George FINALLY punches Biff->We move to Marty having to play the guitar->the kissing scene (with a delay and a twist)->Johnny B. Goode-> and only THEN we move to ""going home"" with its problems- more than just a few plus running against the clock... and yet, after the ""happy end"" we're left with a great closing scene! Talk about a roller-coaster-ride! Your hands squeezing the nearest pillow. ANY more suspense or action and you'd and up a nerve-rack. Action, adventure and comedy, fitting for all ages. If you don't like this movie, there there just has to be something really wrong with you."

","""Back to the Future"" is clearly one of the greatest films of all time. One of those where not only can't you imagine changing a single significant actor, but you can't imagine changing a single scene or (almost) a line of dialogue. It also provides a good lesson about what science fiction should and shouldn't do, a lesson that its painful sequels fail. The original is about the characters and the times. The (absurdist) time-travel mechanism is a memorable device, and its inventiveness certainly contributes to the film's greatness. But the sci-fi takes a back seat to the things we really care about: Marty adjusting to 1955, George's self esteem, Marty's relationship with Doc. In the sequels, we get a whole lot of junk about the metaphysics of time (which as a philosopher I instinctively pick apart), but all of the new characters feel like props, and I don't really care what happens to anyone.

","Back to the Future is a great 80's movie.  It basically involves a teenager from 1985 going back in time to 1955  he hooks up with his parents and has to make them fall in love so the future is relatively unchanged.<br/><br/>It's a film for all ages (puke!)  but it is!  Middle aged people can get their kicks out of it  as a nostalgic trip back in time whereas younger people can relate to Marty as being a fish out of water  in a time where he is unfamiliar with customs / culture.  Plus on revisiting the film recently  I picked up on the rather `incestuous' interplay with Marty (the teenager) and his mother  it puts a funny adult spin on things!<br/><br/>Plus this movie has things in it for most people  it has rather exciting action sequences, it has bad 80's music (Hewy Lewis and the News alert!), it has romance, it has comedy, it has drama, it even has Michael J Fox!<br/><br/>Go see it  9 out of 10."

"jetrock","10","1","2","15 January 2003"," The Regular Guy Says: ""This Movie Has Everything""
","This movie is incredible. I don't really know anyone who hasn't seen it, but I'm sure those people exist. Really, this has Sci-Fi, Comedy, Action, Drama, everything. This is Michael J Fox at his best! All I can say is 10 out of 10 and Buy the DVD too. Back to the Future brings all the 80's kitsch and combines it with all the fantasy that you want out of a movie that makes you a happier person after watching it. The casting in this movie is iconic. I couldn't imagine Eric Stoltz as Marty McFly, because of Fox's performance, but now I would like to see it just to know. I truly think that BTTF can change people's lives and impact their outlooks. Oh yeah, did I say this was good?"
"Silverzero","10","1","2","12 January 2003"," A definitive classic
","17 years on since when it was released, Back To The Future still captures the brilliance it did back in 1985.Though, to be honest, I am disappointed that it is not in the top 100. Giving that films such as the highly overrated and outdated Citizen Kane is no.6.<br/><br/>It has a very simple plot (if you take out. the time travelling) and brings about an excellent sense of nostalgia. The cast works perfectly together. The soundtrack is very effective, from Mr. Sandman to The Power of Love. Even the special effects are good for its day.<br/><br/>Back to the Future still remains one of the best films ever made. 8.5 out of 10. (Marking films the way IMDb would)."

","When I was a kid i used to watch Back to the Future about everyday. I really enjoyed all these movies. The first one was good because it showed the setting in a time not too far away (1955)which i think helped viewers focus more on how time travel worked then getting fixed on settings in the past or future. A really good movie. A movie that can live up to rivals in a time decades ahead of itself truly shows that it is a winner. 9/10"
"haardwire","10","1","2","20 December 2002"," A feel good movie that has it all!!
","The first of the Back To The Future trilogy, and this one delivers. As a family movie it offers satisfaction on every front. Michael J Fox is perfectly cast as Marty McFly, the typical American teenager, falling in love and falling into the adventure of his life. His wild and whacky friend Doc Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd, builds a time machine, out of a Delorean, and soon Marty is back in 1955, where he disrupts his parents first meeting and falling in love. The ensuing romp is amusing and engaging on all levels. You hate the bad guy for all the right reasons and cheer Marty on as he struggles to set things right so his parents will fall in love and he can get back to the future. You would have to be a cold hearted cynic not to enjoy this one. If you haven't seen it yet, DO!! 10/10"

","I first saw this movie when I was just a little kid and I absolutely loved it.  In the time that's passed since that day, I've seen it again and again (probably about fifty times), and I love it more and more with each viewing. I think that alone is a testament to its power; I've never been bored by it once and I don't think I ever will be.<br/><br/>Top to bottom, everything in this movie works.  From the acting to the directing to the story to the music to the visual effects, it's quite simply the most enjoyable movie experience I can imagine.  Really, I think this is what movies should be all about--watching some moving pictures and having fun.  That's the best word to describe ""Back to the Future."" Fun.<br/><br/>So if you've never seen this movie before, don't take my word for it (I'm not qualified enough for you to do that).  Just go out and rent it and watch it and enjoy it and watch it again.  You owe it to yourself.<br/><br/>I know I'll see it again in the future.  You mean the past? Whatever."

"lonsdalegeezer","10","1","2","1 September 2002"," A Zemeckis Sci-Fi Masterpiece
","Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) is a teenager in Hill Valley, California in 1985 - and then in 1955. Dr Emmett Brown's time machine has flung Marty 30 years back in time and he's stranded there unless the 1955 Doc Brown can help him. Worse: Marty's own mother, here a high school teenager, is falling for him instead of his father.<br/><br/>It sounds like a clichÃ©d science fiction movie that could only appeal to fans of the genre - but that couldn't be more wrong. A huge hit, it appealed across the board for its invention, its exuberant energy, and the famous finale - so tense, so very exciting and yet able to make you gasp and laugh at the same time.<br/><br/>Looking back at it now, it seems less subtle than it did on release and you can't help but recognise how carefully the story sets out to manipulate you. Every scene, every line works but then later you see how you were set up: nobody says anything that doesn't become important to the plot later. That should be terrible, but it's done so very well that it's a treat. It's undeniably formulaic but so outstandingly executed that it vindicates the formula.<br/><br/>No surprise then that there were two sequels (and subsequent video releases of the film had the line ""To Be Continued"" added to the closing moments). They are good but not quite to the standard of this gem."

Humour for all ages and a kick-ass DeLorean car to boot, what more could a young kid want?

This film shows best friends, love interests, rock-n-roll, and a time travelling Delorean. It also touches on the ethics of scientific progress, If we could travel through time, what would be the consequences of our actions? I recommend this film to anyone that would just like to have a fun time watching a movie, just don't try to ruin the fun by overanalyzing the facts.

","It's not the best movie ever made, and E.T. is a better-made sci-fi, but no other film has combined laughs and thrills the way ""Back to the Future"" has. I don't want to tell too much of the storyline, (because if you haven't seen it yet, you really should) but it starts off with Marty McFly, a standard '80's teenager (the setting is 1985) with a goofy, nerdy dad, an alcoholic mom, a fast-food working older brother, and older sister who doesn't really do much at all. Marty's best friend is a scientist, Dr. Emmett Brown (""Doc""), who calls him and invites him to the mall parking lot at 1:15 in the morning the next day. So he goes, and Doc reveals what he has in fact spent the last 30 years inventing: a time machine. Unlike the past versions of what time machines would look like (generally a little room), Doc's time machine is in the form of a DeLorean (""the way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine out of a car, why not do it with some style!""). It has to go 88 MPH to work (along with a few other details I won't reveal now). After a series of surprises, Marty finds himself transported back in time to the year 1955. Right after he gets there, he accidentally runs into his parents (30 years younger; Marty's age now), and VERY accidentally, interferes with the event of his parents falling in love for the first time. Not thinking much of it at the time, he goes around town, looking for the one man who can help him: Doc Brown, 30 years younger. After he finds him, Doc realizes that Marty's interfering with his parents' first meeting could have VERY bad consequences. As I said, ""Back to the Future"" is not the best movie ever made. However, it provides outstanding entertainment; the likes of which we haven't seen since!"

Boy was I right Back To The Future continues to get numerous broadcast on cable networks especially TBS, I have probably watched Back To The Future 100 times and I own a VHS copy. The reasons I find the film so entertaining are first the wonderful acting of Michael J. Fox and Lea Thompson, Michael J. Fox is always entertaining to watch due to his wit and comedic ability. Lea Thompson is eye catching she has underrated beauty. Second I first saw Back To The Future only by chance, I was going to see a minor league baseball game, but due to a rain storm that caused the game to be canceled me my father and uncle made a trip to the theater, despite being a couple of minutes late, we still watched a delightful movie. Hey just as in time travel things don't always go as planned. Hint: Back To The Future. Finally Back To The Future is a tribute to any history buff, if your like myself and enjoy the past it would be a dream come true to travel back in time, especially to see your parents fall in love, see the shape of a community and how it changed to the present, but to already know the outcomes. Finally you must have drama and conflict in the past so you can really enjoy your present state example: Marty's struggle to get his parents to meet and fall in love and to get back to the future, and remember you can't take the place of your father in the past it could be disastrous Quote: of Dr. Brown. At last a movie for all ages to watch again and again."

Ha Ha Ha"" I also love it when Marty is trying to get the magazine, and Biff sees him and tries to run him against the side of the tunnel, and says, "" That'll teach him"" But the most memorable quote in the movie is, "" What are you looking at butthead?""  Biff is the man of the movie, and should be given more credit. In my opinion, Marty ( Michael J Fox), played his part well, but he was still a dork."

Dr. Brown accidentally sends Marty back to the 1950's where he runs into his parents and havoc ensues, because his presence prevents them from having their first meeting and threatens his very existence!  Crispin Glover was absolutely fantastic as the goofy father you wish you never had. (And Marty's reactions under his breath, ""my god, it's a wonder I was ever born""--equally hysterical.) I am unfamiliar with the actor who played Biff, the high school bully, but his echoing ""butthead"" throughout the movie had my entire family laughing.

","Imagine if you could go back in time and meet your parents when they were the same age as you? What would you think of them? Would you hang out with them? What if the parent of the opposite sex developed a crush on you? This is the inspired premise behind a movie that will live on forever in my heart, the best film I have ever seen out of thousands of films. Back to the Future received an Academy Award Nomination for Best Screenplay and numerous technical awards. It was the biggest box office hit of 1985. None of that explains what makes the film so perfect. What makes it perfect is the way it hooks you with it's premise and then carries it out in a manner that will entertain and enlighten you. It's a film that expertly blends so many genres. It's a comedy, a drama, a rip roaring thrill ride, sci fi action adventure, and love story. No movie I've seen pulls off all these genres at the same time. The movie transports you back in time and teaches us how our lives are connected and the significance of your family roots. If you're an adult, you marvel at the recreation of the 50s and the knowing jokes, such as the disbelief of realizing that the actor Ronald Reagan was going to become president. As a child, you realize that yes, your parents were young once and they were even like you in many ways. These are just some of the issues the film deals with. You care about the characters and live through their strengths and flaws. It's hard to imagine anyone other than Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly but as fate would have it, he was the replacement for Eric Stoltz (a terrific actor who apparently was considered too intense for the role.)  This bold decision by the producers to scrap several weeks of filming and replace the lead actor was a risk that paid off beyond their wildest dreams. Fox dissolves into the role so easily that his acting talent sometimes gets overlooked because he makes it look so effortless. As for Christopher Lloyd, no need to replace him. This is the role he will always be remembered for. Who else could handle the rapid fire delivery and sheer energy that his Doc Brown called for? He has a lot of the best lines. Hats off to Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover and Thomas F. Wilson, who each endured makeup allowing them to play 17 and 47. Their joy in playing these characters comes through. All the roles down to the smallest were wonderfully cast. The marvelous sets, costumes, editing, music, sound effects, etc. And of course, hats off to Director Robert Zemeckis, who went on to make Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Forrest Gump. This remains his masterpiece. He also did both of the good but inferior sequels. This is the movie to put into the time capsule (Delorean). Can't wait for the re-release."

","This movie is really stuffed with all kinds of adventure themes and the usual social ""issues"" (i.e. confrontation of fear)... It still makes a decent sci-fi adventure. The story is big and interesting, the movie is fast-paced (it speeds even through its more meaningful dialogues).There are some nice special effects, most of the action is original (in a movie, I suppose), and it has one of the most interesting adaptations of the idea of time travel. All the characters are depicted colorfully, without any useless or ""empty"" ones (for example - the Planet of the Apes' second astronaut, the one whose brain is modified, is only there to give the main hero [the first astronaut] another reason to dislike the Apes). Christopher Lloyd gives his best and characteristic performance here (although I haven't seen many movies where he stars or co-stars). Michael J.

Just the right mix of science fiction and comedy.  Also, a great representation of the 50's from an 80's point of view.

","The Back to the Future trilogy is utterly brilliant.  The two most important aspects for a film, in my opinion, are plot and character- and the Back to the Future films deliver on both!<br/><br/>The plot contains fun, excitement and humor in abundance.  Time travel is not new when it comes to story telling, but writers Gale and Zemeckis have handled it brilliantly in these films.<br/><br/>There characters in this series are fantastic!  The two leads, Doc Brown and Marty McFly, have a wonderful relationship throughout the trilogy, and there are also fun supporting characters, such as George McFly and Biff Tannen. Christopher Lloyd is perfect as the crazy, eccentric Doc, and Michael J. Fox equally great as Marty McFly. I love this trilogy dearly, and it is only surpassed by the mighty Star Wars saga."

High school kid Marty McFly (Michael J Fox), who is somehow the Docs best friend, gets involved in his schemes and accidentally finds himself test driving the time machine and ending up in 1955  and bumping into his parents - as teenagers!!

The teen style McFly mixed with a doc inventing everything from anything.  Going into the past was so cool.  Everyone wishes they could visit their heritage, so this movie did it for us.  Robert Zemeckis did a wonderful job on this flick.  My only con, is that they didn't explore more avenues.  For example, jumping into the Roman times, or even the Egyptian times.  Although, to be fair, they didn't actually get the chance according to the storyline, so it's really nobody's fault.  I gave this movie a rating of 9/10."

"Bats_Breath","10","1","2","11 February 2002"," The film that Proves that Teens never Change
","One thing about teenagers----they can't EVER imagine their own parents were teenagers.  Children maybey, but not teenagers.  Hell they usually forget their older brothers and cousins were teenagers too.  One of the universal truths about being a teenager is that you always think you and people close to your age where the first teens to EVER exist on planet Earth.  Teens always believe that what they are going through is so different from anything anyone else ever went through.  The reality is that 98% of what teens go through, EVERYONE before them went through as well.  Remember the 16, 17 year olds complaining and moaning about how they are different and misunderstood during the Columbine shootings in 1999?  Well they're 20 years old now in 2002, or will be 20 later this year.  So they can't complain about anything anymore.  So why did they complain about being misunderstood? Perhaps now they're adults that are misunderstood? j/king ;) <br/><br/>
In ""Back to the Future"", a typical 17 year old from 1985 is just, well a teenager.  Marty McFly is always late for class, he likes to hang out with his girlfriend at the mall, he's absorbed into his heavy metal music and he doesn't really know too much about what happened in the world more then 4 or 5 years ago.  Marty is self absorbed, but very hip and resourceful.  He's also confident and street smart.  On the other hand, his father George McFly is a complete loser.  George is 47 years old and constantly being bullied by his mean boss Biff Tannen.  Marty's mother Lorraine is an overweight alcoholic, and his two older siblings are 20 something losers like their parents.<br/><br/>In BTTF, through a series of strange events, Marty accidently travels back to 1955 and meets his own parents as----gasp---teenagers!!!  And while they may not have the technology, fashion and music that Marty has in 1985, they are teenagers just like him.  They are going through the same trials and tribulations of being a teen that Marty is in 1985.  And like typical teens, they think they are the coolest teens to ever exist on planet Earth.  At the end of the film, Marty says it's been ""educational"" and has been for the audience as well. <br/><br/>By the way I'm not that ""old"" myself, I'm only 26, but I get sick of teenagers always acting like they are so different and cooler because of the superior technology they have grown up with.  But that's part of being a teen. I have to remind myself that back in the early and mid '90s we teenagers acted and complained about nearly all the same stupid stuff the teens today complain about.  I thought and acted exactly like they did until about 1995 or 1996.....something strange happened to me then, I entered my 20s and became an adult, and I had no more excuses to complain about being ""misunderstood"". :)"

It is everyones fanatasy to go back and see when their Mother and Father met, knowing that from that moment they were ment for each other. The element of romance, close calls, the ugly duckling nursery rhyme theme, comedy, suspense and that touch of drama were the ingredients that made Back To The Future a non-stop adrenaline ride. Though it takes it a while to get the started, its pace keeps hounding until the fimal scene. Excellent cast, stand out performance by Crispin Glover, and Lea Thompson, Michael J.

No other film to my knowledge has proven to be so popular with fans and the society. Released in 1985 the film proved to be the sleeper hit of 1985 and redefined the time travel genre in terms of story and characterizations. The film's soundtrack is awesome with modern hits from Huey Lewis and the News, Lindsey Buckingham, Eric Clapton, composer Alan Silvestri and classic hits from Etta James and Marvin Berry(Harry Waters Jr.) and the Starlighters with special guest Marty McFly(Fox).

When I'm talking about this movie I'm thinking of all 3 parts of the series 'cause they are a whole to me. We really have to give credits Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for their writings. Everything is related from the first event in the first movie to the last one in the 3rd part, and there are some new connections that I detect each time I see the movie.<br/><br/>The credits should also go to Michael J.

Instead of standing in a machine and getting dissolved, electrified, etc., the only way to travel through time, is to speed! Couple that with an original storyline, a weird and wacky duo (Michael J. Fox & Christopher Lloyd), and a (warning: spoiler ahead) suspenseful ending (don't worry, I won't ruin it for first-time viewers), you have a science-fiction-comedy that never seems to decline in quality.

","I think some movies are perfect. By that I simply mean that given the chance, I wouldn't change a frame. This is one of those movies. The structure of the film is convoluted and full of surprises, but always easy to follow. The first quarter or so of the film is all setup for gags to come later. The viewer must be alert, because there's a payoff for virtually everything that's said or done. This film demonstrates better than any history book that as the decades pass, our understanding of the world changes in ways we don't immediately comprehend. Watch as a 1955 character demands a time traveler tell him who is President of the United States in 1985. His reaction, upon hearing it's Ronald Reagan, is priceless."

Fox is one of the best things in the movie because he portrays with a hunger for curosity.  Back to the Future(1985) is the best and most famous film in the career of Michael J. Fox.  Christopher Lloyd is wacky as the eccentric scientist, Dr. Brown. There is a scene in this movie that is inspired by Terry Gilliam's Brazil(1985).  Lea Thompson is just sweet natured and shy as Marty McFly's future mother, Lorraine Baines.  Back to the Future(1985) which besides Who Framed Roger Rabbit(1988) is a terrific film from director, Robert Zemeckis."
"aesgaard41","9","1","2","27 January 2001"," Great movie, Lousy Reasoning
","Next to ghosts, time travel movies are widely entertaining when they throw fourth-dimensional reasoning out the window. Marty McFly goes back in time and prevents his parents from meeting so he vanishes, right. Wrong! He has already been born in a timeline that still exists in another Quantum reality. He's just a visitor from another future timeline apart from the one he altered.  The only reason to restore his parents' relationship would be to create a future along that timeline to go to in the first place. ""Don't forget to think fourth dimensionally."" says Dr. Emmett Brown, wonderfully played by Christopher Lloyd, but now the bane of his existence thanks to numerous would-be impressionists. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover fit right into the 1950 sequences, as does Thomas F. Wilson as the idiot/bully Biff. The script as are the culture shocks between the Fifties and the Eighties are wonderful and the cast does a wonderful job.

I think what makes this movie so great is the people involved.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis is one of the best sci-fi directors of our time. It's funny how it takes a big budget movie like Cast Away (2000) to make people take notice.<br/><br/>FOX & LLoyd should win the nobel prize for chemistry. Brown is overexcited in his speeches, and his exaggerated facial expressions put Vince McMahon's (WWF) to shame.<br/><br/>And Thomas Willson (BIFF) & Crispin Glover (George McFly) gave it their all, including possibly the best performances of their life.<br/><br/>Back to the future is one of those movies where you believe in the characters, as much comic book as they are, and as hard as you try, you just can't pick a favorite. It's a popcorn movie that can be watched over and over again.

"jhaggardjr","10","1","2","29 December 2000"," One of my all-time favorites
","""Back to the Future"" was one of my all-time favorite movies when I was a teenager. It's a funny, exciting sci-fi/fantasy/comedy that today is still perfect for all ages. Michael J. Fox stars in his best film role as a teenager in 1985 who goes back in time 30 years earlier to 1955 in a DeLorean time machine and in the process meets his parents (Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover) while they're teenagers. He also catches up with his mad scientist friend (Christopher Lloyd) who built the time machine and tries to help Fox find a way to get him back to the present day. Director Robert Zemeckis made ""Back to the Future"" a winning film all the way around. Fox is terrific here. So are Lloyd, Thompson, and Glover. The writing (by Zemeckis and Bob Gale) is fresh and original, the directing outstanding, and the technical elements (ranging from the terrific production design to the rousing music score to the superb special effects) are dazzling. ""Back to the Future"" was a great '80s movie, and one of the decades biggest smash hits. Also a big asset, an awesome soundtrack featuring two great songs sung by Huey Lewis just for this movie (""Back in Time"" and the Oscar-nominated ""Power of Love""). The two sequels that followed simultaneously in 1989 and 1990 failed to live up to this one. In this trilogy, the original ""Back to the Future"" is the only one worth seeing.<br/><br/>**** (out of four)"

Anyway story goes like this, You've got your typical 80's teenager(Marty) and typical semi-mad scientist(The Doc), who just happen to be friends. and the Doc invites Marty to help with one of his experiments, and it ""all goes horribly wrong"" and Marty ends up being send back in time 30 years and as he approaches the town he's lived in all his life(presumably), he just happens to run into his parents and prevents them from meeting, then he finds the Doc, who at first doesn't believe him but after some convincing, helps him to get his parents together and send him ""Back To The Future"" hence the title. You have to see this movie because it's so great."

","Aged 7, this film blew me away.  Aged 21, I'm still enthralled by its charms.  Basically, BTTF is everything you could want from a movie.  It has action, adventure, romance, good vs. evil, laughs and, above all, a heart. It's a film that you care about.<br/><br/>Michael J. Fox gave a career-defining performance as Marty McFly. Christopher Lloyd excelled as his mentor Doc Brown. The supporting cast were simply terrific.<br/><br/>Everyone has wondered what it would be like if we could go back in time and meet your parents.  This film takes this already-enticing proposition and turns it into a story of ingenious excellence.  BTTF is hard to criticise, bar all the unanswerable technicalities about time travel.  The special effects look as good today as they did in 1985 but the film is more than that.<br/><br/>Back to the Future represents the way blockbusters used to be made.  The plot, characterisation and a developed sense of empathy with the characters are every bit as important as ""getting to the action.""<br/><br/>BTTF's sequels were good but came nowhere near to the sheer brilliance of this one.  It's well-structured and well-paced, clever, humourous and has a fittingly superb soundtrack.  Alan Silvestri's score encapsulated the action perfectly and 'The Power of Love,' employed to great effect, remains one of the songs of the '80s.<br/><br/>The DeLorean was the perfect time machine, everyone's choice of time-travel transport.  The unravelling of the story, with the revelation that only a bolt of lightning could supply the car with sufficient power to send Marty home, provided the film with one of the all-time great finales.<br/><br/>As a film of its type, it will never be bettered.  Robert Zemeckis' filmmaking future remains in the past.  He might as well retire.  He peaked in 1985."

","Back to the Future is a great ride. It's funny, it's touching and it's thrilling. I have watched this film over and over again and it never failed to impress me with it's charms. It started a trilogy that became one of the best loved and most succesful series' of all time. I really love this movie.<br/><br/>Marty McFly (Micheal J. Fox) is a typical teenager living in 1985 California. But he has got a couple of problems. He has a great band, but nobody gives him a chance. His parents are losers and his dad gets pushed around by hig-school bully Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), who is now his boss. Marty has ambition, but he doesn't want to turn out like his parents. But one night, he agrees to meet his friend Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) in a mall parking lot at 2 am. What could be so important? Well, Doc has just invented a time machine! But they are attacked by terrorists that have been ripped off by Doc and Marty inavertenly travels 30 years back in time! Now, in 1955, he meets his parents and disaster strikes! Marty's mom is in love with him and his dad is still a loser. With the help of the Doc from 1955, he must repair the time machine, get his parents to fall in love, and get back to the future, or he's history!<br/><br/>This movie sparkles with charm from the performances of all the cast. Micheal J. Fox is absolutley perfect as Marty and Christopher Lloyd displays amazing comedic talent in his role and it amazes me how criminally unappreciated he is. I also have to mention that Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson and Wilson are terrific.<br/><br/>Back to the Future is very, very funny. It has lots of in-jokes to other movies and Fox and Lloyd are given some great dialogue by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, who wrote the script. I am astonished how much a laugh every time I see this movie, even for the ump-teenth time. <br/><br/>With credit to the visual effects and a great score, I think everyone will find Back to the Future a pinnacle in the careers of Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg and love it for the unmistakeable movie magic that it holds. I know I do."

I loved the scene where the De Lorean backs out of the lorry in the JC Penney parking lot from the Dry Ice.  The soundtrack is excellent and really fits in with the action. The skateboarding is well done too as Marty tries to escape from Biff and the gang in the 1955.  Rent this out now, you will really enjoy it.  If you enjoy this go and rent the sequel.

Fox as a bona fide movie star, and featured a deliriously wacky Christopher Lloyd playing a scientist who invents a time travel machine. Robert Zemeckis keeps things light and playful -- he's one of many directors (like Ron Howard, Steven Spielberg, etc.) who started out making enjoyable romps until he felt the need to become ""serious"" and started making movie crap like ""Forrest Gump."" <br/><br/>I didn't fall in love with the ""Back to the Future"" series, but I see its appeal.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

","This movie is simply disgusting. I must have seen it about 50 times and each time I see it I get more and more disgusted. What is this thing? Each actor is playing perfectly, while you just have to look for one second at DcBrown's face to start laughing. The plot is so impressive that I can't get bored in a single scene, and the worst thing of all is suspense: It's chemically made(prepared with peaceful scenes to begin in action scenes) to make you feel real suspense, being unable to predict what is going to follow, and with a music casing that makes things about 6 times worse.<br/><br/>In addition, it contains contradictory material: It's both classic AND innovation. How can you make an impressive, suspenseful action scene with a skateboard run without making something completely stupid? Ask those who wrote ""Back to the Future"". Besides that, the whole movie is completely according to reality, with just a small add-in: The time machine. And, finally, it's rated PG. A theme that would be expected to be rated-R for other scriptwriters, in this film it's made in a moral, family, let's say, way. Not a single bloody drop of bloody blood. All wickedness and sexual abnormality belongs to the bad guy. This must be the most disgustingly good film I have ever seen."

","1st watched 5/5/2002 - 6 out of 10(Dir-Robert Zemeckis): Silly and corny, but likeable and sometimes funny time travel comedy.  A major hit when it first came out which I think had more to do with how well it was marketed then how good of a movie it was.  Michael J. Fox carries the film with his charm and his ability to do physical comedy.  The story jumps back and forth from serious to silly which keeps us giggling and the good guys win in the end which usually makes for a winner at the box office. The focus of most of the comedy has to do with Michael trying to get his parents together despite his unexpected intervention into their lives and being his mom's flame for awhile putting a damper on his real mom and dad getting together.  It all works out in the end of course and we're ready for part ii in the series which is predicted by the ""To be continued..."" as the credits roll."

The filmmaker is telling you that you should be glad you didn't go to school with your parents. They are also telling you that when your mom is hitting on you things can get a little weird. I knew in this part if history that women wore dresses. I also new they didn't have super nice cars. Something that is similar to this time in history is that people are still super clingy in relationships. I have not seen movies by this director. I think this was a good movie. I wouldn't mind seeing other movies by these people. I think the actors did a really good job. I liked the camera angles they were different from what you normally see.

","Before yesterday, 03 July 2008, I haven't seen this Robert Zemeckis picture since long time ago, I think actually since I was a kid, when this was one of the regular pictures showed on National TV together with the part II and the part III. I think saw the Back to the Future trilogy at least two or three times yet right now I don't remember a lot of things from part II and III just like before yesterday of part I. So right now I'm glad I saw this one after so many years; Back to the Future is the quintessential movie entertainment with two memorable characters, one memorable car and, of course, a magnificent time travel story full of fun and romance but not in a near or far future but in 1955. Well in the film is 1985 and Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is in high school, loves to play guitar with his band, is ready to spend more time with his girlfriend Jennifer (Claudia Wells) and the scientist and inventor Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is his friend. Here we also meet Marty's parents, George (Crispin Glover) and Lorraine (Lea Thompson), and also the abusive boss of George, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson). But is the Doc the one who is going to change everything for Marty with his latest invention that could be his own masterpiece: a De Lorean that works as a time machine.<br/><br/>I really like how in this picture the time travel stuff was used in a simple but great way. You can travel to any time but not to any place and of course, once in the past, anything you do will have consequences. The picture plays again in a simple way to focus just in the story of Marty's parents in 1955, in high school. Since everybody that Marty knows seems to be just as they are in 1985 (except his mother) his problem with the time machine is in good hands with a young Doc that looks exactly as in 1985 (funny). So the issue is just to get together George and Lorraine but that is going to be a -funny- problem since Marty has already replace his father and now he is the object of love of his own mother!<br/><br/>Many funny details with Marty Calvin Klein Darth Vader McFly and even what could be just a pretext to use one of the greatest songs in rock and roll history (if that was the case is still good since the song is Johnny B. Goode) turns to be just a great, memorable and hilarious scene with the cousin of Chuck. And in the end everything was just right on time for Marty and Doc, even way better, and leaves everything for more pictures.<br/><br/>Cast: Both Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are terrific; in the case of J. Fox this is the role for what I know him and eventually the one for what I always recognize him. Almost the same for Lloyd but he was also in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (Robert Zemeckis, 1988) and in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (Milos Forman, 1975). Crispin Glover is also terrific as a really weird but eventually lucky character.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Back to the Future is just a classic family entertainment with a magnificent story. That said, what else I could add to my -obvious- conclusion? I think just this: 9.5 out of 10"
"ryan_kuhn","8","1","3","13 February 2005"," ""1.12 Gigawatts? Great Scott!""
","Time travel movies make people have headaches, so Robert Zemeckis wisely added another layer to his movie, Back To the Future. The central question of Back To the Future is not what would it be like to go back in time, but rather, a bigger question: ""What were my parents like as teenagers?"" As teenagers, we always heard our parents give us rules about what we could and could not do, and we never thought maybe our parents were telling us what not to do because they did that stupid stuff themselves, we just assumed they always knew best. But what would it really be like to see what kind of awful things our parents did while young. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), for better or for worse, finds out in Back To the Future. While trying to outrun Libyan terrorists in a modified DeLorian, McFly is transported back to October 27, 1955, 30 years in the past for this 1985 film. Doc Brown (a manic Christopher Lloyd) invents the process to time travel and put it all together in the DeLorian, and is a young scientist when McFly looks him up in 1955. Not believing the story of ""Future Boy,"" especially after he says Ronald Reagan was president in 1985, but is eventually convinced and tries to help the young man out. While trying to get back to 1985, McFly accidentally ruins the moment that his father (Crispin Glover) meets his mother (Lea Thompson), possibly ending his own life. Parents don't meet, they don't have babies, and don't have Marty. Worse, Marty's mother starts to fall for him, so he needs to get his father and mother back together. Seeing his parents back in their teenage days is enlightening and will serve as a surprise at the end of the movie. There are several jokes about time and space, how Twin Pines Mall becomes Single Pine Mall is amusing and other changes to the town from the beginning of the movie to the end is interesting. But most of all, what would your parents to be like if you visited them 30 years ago? A great question, though do you really want it answered?"

","Let me first start by saying I have seen a lot of movies and am a self proclaimed ""Movie Geek"" and of all the movies I've seen, I'd say beyond a shadow of a doubt this is my favorite. Truth be told I consider the whole trilogy to be one movie and consider this to be a classic that will be cherished for many many years to come. There is a certain light-hearted, feel good quality in this movie that you just don't see anymore. It's of good moral fiber and the Directing has a crisp, sleek quality to it. The acting is perfectly attuned to the genre and the story is larger than life and the most original to come along in years.<br/><br/>The dictionary defines the word ""Classic"" as ""something that outlives it's anticipated duration"". Back to the Future has certainly done that and will continue to appeal to audiences of all ages through out the course of the future. Just like the Proverbial ""Bolt of Lightning"" that struck the clock tower, BTTF hit audiences across the nation and has forever changed the course of movie making history."

","It is extremely weird that i am disappointed by a movie that i enjoyed thoroughly. Back To The Future is a master piece concept which is also ful of fun but yet there was grossness and absence of ""extraordinary"" in the script.<br/><br/>I am sure the director never thought that this movie can be such a success and that is why he never paid much attention to make it overwhelmingly smart, appropriate and courageous. No doubt one can enjoy the trilogy and feel satisfied but i see a lot of doors left open untouched which if were cared, would have given the shape of metropolis to the grandeur. The movie is awesome but not beneficial or thought provocative. I rated it less for miss or less-using and then stabilizing the special concept which leaves no ground open in the viewers to allow something scientific and technically correct. Being a great person it becomes responsibility to take care of many aspects for others which i didn't find in this movie.<br/><br/>The amazing points of the movie includes two characters, the guy and the scientist, the most fitting comic faces to let you understand that whatever you are going to watch is going to be enjoyable. Next is the memorable vehicle that can travel in time. Third is the amazing area and landscape used to avoid the time travel giving clumpsy look. That is something intelligent film making."
"digitalbeachbum","1","3","39","13 February 2019"," It was uber cool in 1985 but not so much in 2019
","A kid/family movie which was good in 1985 but in 2019 it fails on many levels. The number of flaws and inconsistencies in the movie show how they rushed the production and didn't pay any attention to the details.<br/><br/>Fox and Lloyd are a perfect match and the rest of the supporting staff are very good. I believe Fox is a better choice than Stoltz, but not that I think Stoltz is not a good actor. I believe Fox is just a better choice in relation to Lloyd. Stoltz is taller and thinner, more like Lloyd. Fox is short and stocky, providing a good contrast.<br/><br/>I don't like time travel because writers use it as a deus ex machina to make stuff happen. It is abused by writers, as did the writers of Back to the Future, to make everything work. However their process of writing of the script this way creates too many new problems.<br/><br/>For example, when Marty goes back in time, he meets Doc as the earlier version for the first time. He then goes back to the future. Then doc goes to the future and comes back to Marty in the present. They then go back to the past again, then back to the present, then back to the far past, then to the middle past.<br/><br/>Eventually paths are crossing each other and characters seem to forget stuff that they should have already seen or know. The characters in the overlapping scenes do not react to seeing or knowing the same experience - EXCEPT - in Back to the Future Part 2 when Biff recalls seeing the ""flying Delorean"" Most of all, there are conflicts with Doc's memory and even Marty's parents.<br/><br/>So if you can set aside all the science and logic, then this will be a good movie for you and the family. There is very minimal language, violence and sexual scenes. So it will be acceptable for the teens and depending on who you are, the younger children.<br/><br/>Do I like it? Meh, it's OK. Not great and could have been better."

Back To The Future represents one of those films, such a powerful, inspirational, comical, heartwarming, and innovative one. Probably, McFly and Doc Brown proffer the best duo-interaction I have ever beheld in an 80s film (which, happily, could end up being top-notch of all time). There are almost no blunders to be found because the flick essentially represents an instant classic of cinema history as if to say, pure perfection. From this moment on, you might be thinking about the reason of having assessed the film an absolute perfection score:<br/><br/>First and foremost, we discuss relating to breaking formulas and experiencing new paths, in other words, means opening new cinematic genres and improving them, that is to say, films which leave a significant legacy. Back To The Future follows the proper steps to provide that brand-new feature we were all hoping. Secondly, we balance the film's highest moments and ordinary moments with humour, some 50's nostalgia, some drama and (even) some action moments which results in a win-win the film provides a mixture of genres carefully well-managed and accurately-needed. Third, if the goal is the production of an instant classic, we will need to focus on the cast, because they are the ones who will perform during the whole film, they embody the heroes and villains; therefore, they become fundamental. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are the film's core, as excellent as Vince Vaughn-Owen Wilson's 2005 Wedding Crashers, I daresay.<br/><br/>Finally, but not least, the soundtrack and the environment, in spite of ending up being complementary, provides not only a trusting reality but an opportunity to show the audience the plot's main incidents. During the display, we will notice the most recurrent spots are the 80's and 50's at school, at traditional coffee shops and the streets, not forgetting the excellent pop-culture references introduced.<br/><br/>The audience ought to congratulate Robert Zemeckis' mind and, also, the crucial support of his staff (one of whom was Steve Spielberg) owing to this masterpiece. The montage is proof that everyone who has an incredible imagination is capable of creating chef-d'oeuvres, delivering the audience such an extraordinary time. What is more exhilarating is the fact that then-president Ronald Reagan loved the film to the point that he used famous BTTF quotes, for example, during his 1986 State of Union Adress. What an achievement ladies and gentlemen!<br/><br/>(90/100)"

This movie takes place in the past, present, and future. A 17 year old boy gets sent 30 years to the past.
I think that it was really interesting the differences that there were in the different time periods. In the 50's segregation was still going on. African Americans were the waiters and didn't have any rights. In the 80's segregation was over and there was more acceptance. There was even a African American elected as mayor.
The director is Robert Zemeckis and some main characters are Lea Thompson, Micheal J Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Crispín Glover. I haven't seen them in any other movies but I've heard about them.
I really liked the movies lines and plot. They had really funny sayings and the actors weren't that bad. I would watch this movie in my own home and recommend it to some friends even. Overall it was a good movie with very funny dialogue. And a interesting plot."

","Back To The Future is a 1985 film directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Crispin Glover, and Thomas Wilson. The film was distributed by Universal, being labeled as a Sci-Fi Comedy Adventure. I have seen the film many times before on different formats.<br/><br/>The film takes place in 1985, Marty (Fox) is accidentally sent to 1955 by means of a time-traveling DeLorean. Due to the very limited plutonium supply the DeLorean had, he needs to find Doc (Lloyd) to get the DeLorean up and running again. Along the way he meets his own father (Glover) during his high school years. Marty realizes that it is his destiny to unite his Mom & Dad at the ""Enchantment Under The Sea"" dance. <br/><br/>I love almost every single actor's performance in this. Every single character, no matter how small, gets an arc. For example, Goldie Wilson (Donald Fullilove) is running for his 2nd term as Mayor in 1985. In 1955, Wilson gets the confidence to run as mayor from Marty. Fox's charisma as Marty is unprecedented and is one of the best audience surrogates in all of film history. Lloyd has the performance of a lifetime, stealing every scene he is in. <br/><br/>I love BttF, it will always remain as a classic as time goes on. It's representation of time-travel is almost flawless. The characters are amazing as goes with the story and with the writing and direction. The only nitpick I have is that some of the green-screen effects look dated but that's it. <br/><br/>Themes of BttF include love, destiny, and coincidence. The main theme song is ""The Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis & The News if that doesn't tell you anything. Destiny and Coincidence play a huge part in here seeing as George McFly doesn't get the courage to ask Lorraine out to the dance until Marty enters their lives.<br/><br/>This film has reached a lot of people then and certainly has now and will only be more widely known as time goes on. General Audiences love it, Kids love it, and Adults cherish it. The only people who would hate it are hipsters who think there are no great films, only overrated ones. <br/><br/>Overall, I give Back to The Future a 10/10"

","Back To The Future is a perfect example of a film that gets better the more I watch it. With time travel, great characters and fantastic comedy it is no wonder it is considered a classic. Michael J. Fox plays fish out of water Marty Mc Fly perfectly when he is taken back to the year 1955 through Doc Brown's unorthodox time machine. Despite some unusual situations the film is able to keep a whimsical charm that many Spielberg produced films from the era possessed. Not to mention great direction from Robert Zemeckis who simultaneously captures the spirit of the 1980's through the character of Marty McFly as well as perfectly replicating the feel of the 1950s in the setting. While it can not be ignored the plot holes that would be apparent in any film involving travel to the past the film is such an enjoyable experience that I did not question it. With universal appeal to both children and adults through its clever humor and originality this will definitely be a classic for a long time to come. I would urge anyone that loves film that has not seen Back To The Future to seek it out immediately."
"davonator97","10","0","1","11 July 2017"," Great Sci-Fi Classic that is impossible not to love!
","Robert Zemeckis created this masterpiece back in 1985, which is the same year the plot takes place. Marty McFly gets sent back in time 30 years where his mother falls in love with him instead of his father and endangers his entire existence. So his mission becomes to get his parents to fall in love all over again while he also has to get back to 1985 in time. The story is so entertaining that you'll never get bored and will want to re-watch it several times. I love how the movie has small details in almost every scene that add to the story and will sometimes only be found upon re-watching the movie. Overall it's a perfect mixture of Adventure and Comedy. The characters are all very likable especially Marty and the bit eccentric Doc Brown.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of the film are very well executed especially the visual effects (for the time). Considering the producers had to re-shoot entire scenes all over again due to the recasting of Michael J. Fox the movie doesn't suffer from this at all. I would also like to mention the brilliant score composed by Alan Silvestri which adds a great sense of adventure to the plot and is recognized by most people instantly upon hearing it.<br/><br/>Overall Back to the Future is a timeless classic that stays entertaining upon countless viewings and is impossible to hate, even though it has it's flaws (which movie doesn't?) but compensates these with a great story, great dialog, great execution and a brilliant score. For me definitely a 10/10 score and a ""must see"" movie."

"JasmondGipson","7","0","1","19 October 2012"," Mankind Vs Time
","Since the beginning of time we have wondered, what it would be like to rewind time, and undo those things we either did not intend to do, or to do something we should have done in the past. This could alter our lives, in the present or future as we know it. The movie Back to the Future (1985), allowed me to live this fantasy. Although, the plot was based on a realistic scientific possibility, I know it to be just a fantasy in realization.<br/><br/>The plot was Doc Brown, (Christopher Lloyds) creation that a DeLorean could indeed travel through time. However, during a bad transaction that had taken place with the Doc, and some extremists, the Doc was shot and killed, while Marty (Michael J. Fox), the lead character escapes the shootout in the famed Delorean automobile. The car would travel back in time, to 1955, as he was driving away at a heightened rate of speed in the automobile. <br/><br/>The thrill of this movie for me begins when Marty travels back in time, and he accidentally gets hit by his grandfather in his own car. He was then taken to his home for care, where his young mother, falls in love with him. This would create a chain reaction, which would prevent his mother and father from ever meeting and would put his own, existence at stake.Throughout this movie his whole mission was to find the old Doc, so he could help him get back to 1985. <br/><br/>This strategic maneuvering would ensure that his mother and father met, and inform the Doc about what happens to him in the future, so he could hopefully prevent it. After all this was accomplished the goal was to dodge the character of the story, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), the young man who was head over heels for Marty's mother. Biff wasted no time clobbering Marty every chance he got, in order to make Marty's mother not like Marty, by proving that Marty was a non-worthy wimp. Overall the idea of going back in time was awesome! However, the whole idea of my mother being attracted to me was very creepy. I believe that many of the movie goers would agree with me. Yes, the technological twist, drama and theatrics were great for its time (1985); but the close relationship, between mother and son, was a little over the top for me."

The supporting cast is perfectly raptured in their stereotypical high school roles and the revisiting the of 1950's is just precious. Oh, there's also Christopher Lloyd interrupting the terminal cuteness of Michael J. Fox. It's that combination that revolves around a tightly written screenplay which carries endless plot reference not to be missed. Full of ""what could go wrong"" only trumped only by ""what else can go wrong?"" Great Scott!"

Marty should have been sent back to biblical times so that he can be lynched and put to death on the cross. It is an utter waste of talent that director Robert zemeckis should have involved himself with this crud not once but three times. Thank god he redeemed himself later with 'death becomes her'."
"dimplet","8","0","1","27 July 2011"," Succeeds despite the over-acting
","I see Back to the Future has grossed $350 million. I wonder how much it would have made if I had directed it?<br/><br/>While Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd deliver impeccable performances, and it is impossible to imagine the movie without them, most of the rest of the acting is pretty bad, sometimes way, way over the top, such as the 1985 revised apologetic Biff. Anywhere else, audiences would have cringed. I cringe every time I see it.<br/><br/>But you can't argue with success. Did the movie succeed because of the over-acting, or despite it? Perhaps teenagers were amused by the silliness. But for adults, the movie is strong enough that they seemingly overlook it.<br/><br/>Back to the Future has many strengths, such as drawing you into the fantasy of what it would be like to travel back to the 1950s. There is enough detail and authenticity to the recreation that you are able to imagine you have gone back in time with the movie. I like movies that get young people interested in understanding what it was like before they were born. Yet, if you are going to go through all the trouble of recreating the 1950s, the time-travel fantasy effect would work better if the acting were more believable. <br/><br/>On the other hand, they overdo the sin-city decay of the 1985 present, for a small American town/city. There are some echoes of Bedford Falls without George Bailey, from It's a Wonderful Life (which would make a nice companion viewing). And speaking of connections, I believe this is the same town set used in Harvey with James Stewart, and for Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt (?).<br/><br/>The bottom line is Back to the Future starts with a cute concept and gives it several layers of action and irony that keep you amused. It succeeds in the rare accomplishment for a comedy of working just about as effectively upon subsequent viewings. This is because the humor is not based on crude jokes or bad language, but on the manipulation of the tension in the awkward, off-balance relationships between the characters. Part of the genius of this film is the way these awkward relationships are resolved to the audience's immense satisfaction.<br/><br/>These strengths are why I still enjoy this film, despite the over- acting. But producer Steven Spielberg is certainly no fool, especially when it comes to hitting the bulls-eye with younger viewers. So I must assume this is what he was aiming for. What do you think?"

"HelloTexas11","7","0","1","16 April 2008"," fast blast back to the '50s
","'Back to the Future' was hugely successful, mainly with teens and mainly because it ties in to their hang-ups, angst, and fantasies. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) deals with them all as teens only wish they could, jumping on a skateboard when things get too sticky, outsmarting the bully, and zipping through time in a REALLY souped-up Delorean. Fox doesn't so much act as hyperventilate his way through the film; he is constantly on the move, frenetic and frantic, forever running to or from one thing or the other, and shouting ""Doc!"" a lot. His energy level is admirable, even though I got tired just watching him. This is precisely what teenagers, particularly teen boys, empathize with so deeply in this movie. The best solution to any problem is to not stand still. Run like hell and maybe something will come to you. The film's script is clever and in keeping with Fox's performance, really over-the-top and unashamedly silly at times. With the help of Christopher Lloyd's goofily eccentric Doc Brown, he travels back in time to 1955 and meets his own parents, before they were married. There are a number of nifty twists and turns in the time-travel plot, and the other characters are very well-cast. Crispin Glover does a great job as Marty's dim-bulb father George as does Lea Thompson, portraying Lorraine, his mother. Lorraine develops a crush on Marty back in the '50s (obviously not knowing who he is, or will be) and one of several problems Marty faces is making sure that she and George end up together. Glover and Thompson, along with Thomas F. Wilson as Biff, the bully, actually outshine Fox's breathless portrayal and Lloyd's incessant mugging. The gags and situations are sometimes obvious but have a good batting average; upon learning from Marty that the president in 1985 is Ronald Reagan, the 1955 Doc Brown says, quite understandably, ""Ronald Reagan? The actor? Who's the vice-president... Jerry Lewis?"" There is also an entertaining sequence at a high school dance where Marty and a back-up band perform a freaked-out, almost 'metal' version of 'Johnny B. Goode.' The film even takes it a step further, having Marvin Berry (Chuck's cousin) call him in the middle of the performance to let him listen, making the almost blasphemous suggestion that this is what gave Chuck Berry the impetus to create rock and roll! 'Back to the Future' is so good-natured, though, that it gets away with this as well as Lorraine's flirtation with Marty. Fox and the film are sufficiently likable that it all seems harmless, which it is. Two popular sequels followed, but they lack the charm and upbeat feeling of the first movie, a frenzied fun-ride through time."

Christopher Lloyd was perfectly cast as Doc and Lea Thompson was great as Marty's mother. But I think my favorite performance from this film was Crispin Glover, who played Michael J. Fox's father. I found it interesting that when the movie was made, Michael J. Fox was actually three years older than Crispin Glover. And they're playing father and son! Michael J. Fox was 24 and Crispin Glover was 21. Interesting fact! Anyway, Crispin Glover was the perfect nerd. You just had to love George McFly! And you just had to feel sorry for him for getting picked on by Biff all the time. I loved all of Marty's attempts to get his parents together before he was erased from existence while he was back in 1955. I loved how you got to see a perfect depiction of the era of the 1950s, from the cars to the high school to the ice cream shop and then you saw how it looked in the present day 1985. There's even a DeLorean in the film! The cinematography was excellent and the direction was on key and you just loved all the characters. The storyline was interesting too. You just can't help but love this film. Yes, it's so 80s but it's so much fun to watch and Michael J. Fox was so cute in this film! ""Back to the Future"" is truly a classic! Thanks for reading my review!"

A really well written script.<br/><br/>-A GREAT and under-rated score. Just try to get the ""Back to the Future"" theme out of your head after a viewing.

When a movie does this, I think it shows that it accomplished what it set out to do and that was produce a great film.<br/><br/>In addition, ""Back To The Future"" brought back a lot of good memories and reminded me why I chose to see the first many years ago.

","Time travel is a difficult subject, but it's still used often in movies. Usually there's major plot holes, and there's some in this film too. But this is such a well-made movie that it's easy to forget the oddities in plot and just have a fun time. The character's in this movie are maybe it's major weakness, they are very one dimensional. But some characters, like Doc and Michael J. Fox's character Marty, are so good that it overcomes the weaknesses.<br/><br/>The film was continued with two sequels, neither of which are as good as the first, but they're not bad either. As a kid, I was much more interested in the future than the past that this first film deals with, and thought the second film was better. But now looking at them objectively, it's clear that this first film is the best. Overall it's a very enjoyable trilogy."
"graham_525","9","0","2","18 August 2006"," a serious plot hole
","I do really like this film and it is from an era when I was a teenager. It definitely captures the mood of the eighties and also the nostalgia for the fifties which was prevalent in the seventies and eighties. I'm not really one for picking holes in movies as the whole point of going to the cinema is that you are entering a fantasy realm. However when watching BTTF recently I noticed a serious plot hole. There has to be a suspension of logic when time travel is involved but usually time travel films make their own internal cock eyed sense if you accept that time travel is possible. In BTTF though there is a lack of internal consistency which I will explain. When Marty travels back in time he alters history and returns to his own time to discover things have changed. This means though that there are in effect two Marty's. The one who we follow through out the film and the one who grew up in the history in which his father punched biff and lives a much better life. When Marty returns at the end he see's ""himself"", a different Marty, being chased by the terrorists and going back in time. The problem is, what happens to this Marty? Where does he go? The Marty at the end is the same one who grew up in the original history where his Father was run over by the car. If the second Marty went back to 1955 he would find the other Marty there with him. Also when the musician calls Chuck Berry to let him hear Marty playing Chuck Berry on the guitar we are supposed to accept that this is a case of effect before cause. But even in this context it doesn't make sense because Marty grew up in a different history in which Chuck Berry hadn't heard him play guitar and so wouldn't have developed that sound. Anyway, it's a fantastic film despite this or perhaps even because of this crazy paradoxical plot."

","If any film endeared MICHAEL J. FOX to movie audiences, it was BACK TO THE FUTURE ('85). He was an inspired choice to play Marty McFly, who meets up with crazy wizard scientist Doc Brown (CHRISTOPHER LLOYD) and finds himself living in small-town USA circa 1955 where he discovers that he must arrange a match between his parents who haven't yet connected.<br/><br/>Lloyd plays Doc with wild-eyed enthusiasm, a stroke of genius for such an over-the-top kind of role. Completely in harmony with him is CRISPIN GLOVER as Marty's nerdy father, a joy to watch as he completely becomes this character. Then too, an added source of enjoyment is LEAH THOMPSON as Marty's mother/girlfriend who takes part in some of the most innocently funny ""incest"" routines ever--and somehow, none of it manages to offend. It's all played for laughs and all of it works.<br/><br/>Discovering that another actor originally started the Marty role and was then tossed aside (he was too intense and felt uncomfortable in the role), it's a wise decision that found MICHAEL J. FOX landing the role and keeping the whole story fresh, funny and innocent. He's an actor who tells you with his whole body what he is thinking--and his expressive face gets quite a workout when the plot thickens.<br/><br/>My favorite time travel movie has the wildest climax imaginable, all very clever and full of inventive surprises. Don't miss this one.<br/><br/>And last but not least: Thomas F. Wilson makes a great ""Biff"", the town bully whose mere physical presence threatens to dominate many a scene.<br/><br/>All of the action is directed at a frantic pace by Robert Zemeckis."
"tiwang80","9","0","1","1 July 2006"," masterful plot
","Suspend your disbelief in the mind-bending time-traveling premise; set aside the ultra-modern DeLorean (which still looks way ahead of our time 20 years later); peel back the 80s versus 50s clashing culture references; look past the extremely well-played cast of stock characters (the dashing, adventurous Marty, freaky fitful Doc, bullying Biff, timid pining George); mute the magnificent musical score; and strip away the splendid special effects (esp. the enduring parallel flame trails) and you have, in my opinion, the centerpiece and finest component of the movie--its superbly arranged plot. Movies tell stories. Stories have conflicts and problems that characters have to overcome. Back to the Future's plot is fantastic mix of interwoven conflicts. There are the character problems--Doc's dilemma about the morality of his scientific endeavors; McFly's family discord; Marty's growing pains. There are major plot problems--Doc's quest to test his machine; Marty getting stuck in time and trying to reconstitute his family. And then the film weaves in a myriad of subplots and little problems. The last half-hour of the movie throws one obstacle after another as Marty out of the locked school, fights off Biff, takes center stage, overcomes the downed cable, and still manages to get back in time to save Doc. Take the intricate plot and throw in all the other fine elements, and we've got a movie that keeps the viewer at the edge of the seat all the way up to 88mph. Then, with the denouement of the story, every the conflicts is resolved. There are no loose ends. There are no extraneous characters; everyone with a problem has it fixed by the end. The complete closure leaves a hook for the next episode. The special effects fit nicely within the story and do not overwhelm it (unlike so many films nowadays). Same for the music. At the end of the day, Back to the Future is a great story that leaves the viewer with plenty of plot to digest. Best appreciated over several viewings."

","This is a great fun movie, the best of the time travel genre, other than the more serious Star Trek themes.<br/><br/>It's the wild and zany tale of 17 year old Marty McFly (that can't be a real last name, surely?) who teams up with your typical mad scientist and inventor of time travel, Doc Brown, resulting in Marty going back in time to 1955 and maybe even preventing his parents from meeting. Obviously something to be avoided at all costs if you'd like to be born.<br/><br/>The plot twists, quirks, and spins are too numerous to delve into here, but they'll keep you riveted to your seat and laughing your head off. The lead actors are both wonderful in their roles... the always incredible Michael J. Fox as Marty, and Christopher Lloyd suitably crazy as the crackpot time travel scientist.

","The creative and entertaining science fiction content in this film certainly is a draw. Aside from that, this film satisfies an urge most of us have to know and experience what our parents were like when they were young and falling in love, and to understand what it was life to live in those times. The film's depiction of the contrasts between the world of the 1950s and the 1980s gives viewers food for thought about how our culture evolved, and what we've gained and lost in the process. Performances are universally credible, sometimes brilliant, and advance the plot nicely.

Repetition was rife and one of the characters (Jennifer) was put to sleep early on, which was surely a sign of a plot lacking direction. Don't think I'll bother watching Part III...<br/><br/>I read a review a while ago suggesting that the Back to the Future trilogy was better than the Star Wars trilogy.

","Doc Brown, local character & mad-scientist, gets mixed up with Lybian terrorists who vow to murder him. All the old guy wants to do is to perfect time-travel for his own enjoyment...he wants to witness the birth of Christ and the signing of the Declaration of Independence, etc. Brown's only friend is a typical teenager, Marty McFly, who ain't yet sophisticated enough to know trouble when he encounters it. With Doc Brown seriously-wounded, but the Doc's plutonium-driven time-machine-cum-Delorean-sportscar very functional, 17-year-old Marty scrambles to escape murder himself...in fleeing, he goes back to the teen world of the 1950's and finds himself an unadmirable pal, who's actually his dad at age 18. Young ""dad"" is a pushover for bullyboys, he's a clumsy peeping-tom and a depressed, whining escapist who'll probably never amount to anything but a small-town failure. Marty tries to help his future-dad and ends up making matters worse for awhile. Our hero's in an almost-impossible situation and makes us laugh at his misfortune. I'll always stop and watch this almost-great movie whenever it rears it's head on the boob-tube. It's wonderful fun, from the faulty Rube Goldberg mechanics in the first scene, right through development of Doc Brown's hilarious self, then into Marty's frantic sexual unease when his own mother throws herself at him (quite innocently!). I'd thought all time-travel plot possibilities had been exhausted before this movie hit the big screen, but it proved me wrong with all kinds of clever elements, such as no one in the 1950's knowing what TV reruns were, how odd the clothing of 1983 would look to people 30 years back ""What's with the life-preserver, kid? Ya just jump ship?"", or the unfabulous treatment of blacks back in the fabulous 50's. We see an element or two of the future smartly interplayed with the time-travel plot, such as when Marty finds his 19-year-old brother's head missing from an 1980's wallet-photo he carries of his family, foretelling doom to the unborn if Marty doesn't fix what he just screwed up in the past. In 1953, Marty pleads with a much-younger Doc Brown to save his own life, but the ethical scientist refuses. So, we're now mighty sure that Marty is stuck in '53 and that he'll meet himself as a boy when he reaches middle age, or end up in some wild Oedipel-time-warp sexual life of sin. Even that comes off as funny. Naturally, in an adventure-comedy, everything turns out right (almost) in the end. The movie has a message for us, in the last scene. And, unblessedly, the message is a shallow, modern piece of Me-Generation horsedump. It tells us that parents can be ""with it"" if they encourage sexual-immorality in their teenagers, that the accumulation of material wealth and popularity are what matters and that worship of self is the ultimate guarantor of ""success"". But, the blessings of the DVD player are upon me, and I can ffwd the action from when Marty wakes up, fully-dressed, safely back in his 1983 bedroom, through to the closing credits!!"

What makes this film different from the other sequels is how it maintains its sense of fun and excitement all the way through the film. What I mean, is that although (Part 2 and 3) were good films, they didn't maintain its on-going thrill like the first film did. All three films had a sequence in which Martys mother/great-great grandmother had recovered Marty in either the McFly home, Baines home or at Biff Tannens home at the casino hotel until he woke up some hours later. In sequels 2 and 3 these films were good up until those scenes and then went completely down-hill after. In part 1, this film never went down-hill from beginning to end. The only aspect of this film that I didn't understand that I'm sure many viewers have noticed are the contradictions this film made (ie. Why George/Loraine McFly didn't remember Marty in 1985, from 30 years before - even though Doc Brown remembered him) which included even more contradictions in parts 2 and 3. Also the scene when the Doc was trying to send Marty back to 1985(via. The Clock tower) when the Doc was up the Clock Tower connecting cables, for that scene completely dragged-on. Other than this, this film was perfect in every way; The acting was good (especially by Biff Tannen/Thomas Wilson) it had an original storyline, perfect soundtrack, had great stuntwork and had a good dialogue.

To top things off, he may have accidentally set history in a new direction - one that results with him never being born. <br/><br/>Not only is the movie fun to watch and well-written, but it just has the atmosphere. A lot of the good movies have it. Its almost a state of mind where you really get into the movie; you can feel the characters going through their conflicts, and you break through that barrier that says ""This is fiction.""<br/><br/>Back to the Future is definitely in my top favorite 25 movies ever, and I adamantly recommend this to fans of the genre, the cast...really, a fan of anything will like it, just because it has so much."

","Alright can someone explain this concept or paradox to me- This comes from near the end of the 1st movie. Marty has decided to set his return time earlier than the time he originally departed. This is so that he can warn the Doctor of his coming death. The thing is when he does this and gets to the car park because he's late, he sees the attack taking place from a 3rd person view and he sees himself get into the time machine and drive into 1955. If Marty, was able to get there in time to warn the Doctor and they managed to avoid the attack, what would have happened in 1985 because we would have had 2 Marty(s), from 1985, since Marty who jumped in the machine would not have had to go to 1955?"

","British paper The Guardian published few years ago a list of the 10 best Sci-Fi movies ever according to the opinion of scientists. I do agree with the ones who handed the prize over Blade Runner after a good bundle of titles were cast out in quite a sensitive selection. However, while scrolling down on the honor list I did not find Back to the Future included (Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back were there nonetheless and in my very humble opinion both films are space-epic rather than genetically pure Sci-Fi).<br/><br/>Back to the Future can be considered a typical yet serious Sci-Fi movie: all of the main aspects regarding time traveling, such as how the time machine's engine is put to work or how these kinds of trip generate time-space paradoxes, are present and clearly enough explained. This movie's progression was as well very carefully and dynamically put into sequence. Back to the Future is a classic for those who were teenagers (and the not so young ones of that time) when it was first released. Emmet Brown is arguably one of the most remarkable mad scientists ever created (by the way, mad scientists are another main topic in Sci-Fi) and I never tire of watching its re-runs over and over again, anytime.<br/><br/>Well, perhaps it's just me, being not an important scientist but a picky moviegoer. I hope this works as a recognition of MY own. Back to the Future will keep rocking yet far beyond the few years to come."

The science fiction storyline is so hilariously captivating that you easily find yourself caught up in cheering for the good guys and hating the bad boy, Biff. Back to the Future is certainly engaging, too, as many of us have wished at some point in our lives for a chance to alter our future. The characters are likable, memorable and admirable.

"alainenglish","Null","0","1","18 August 2004"," Clever, and inventive time travel comedy (spoilers)
","Directed by acclaimed Oscar winner Robert Zemeckis, and with a script by him and Bob Gale, ""Back to the Future"" is one of the better, if not the best, time-travel tale committed to film.  The key to this film's success is that it functions not so much as science fiction, but as simple human drama with an eccentric twist.<br/><br/>It's Hill Valley 1985, and Marty McFly (Michael J.Fox) is a carefree but insecure teenager with a beautiful girlfriend, a family of bullied losers, and a sole friend in mad scientist Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd).  The good Doc has just invented a time-travelling car, and it is in this vehicle that Marty ends up in 1955, at the doorstep of his parents when they were just teenaged kids.  Marty must secure the Doc's help to get back to the future, in the meantime ensuring his birth by uniting his nerdish father (Crispin Glover) with his outrageously flirty mother (Lea Thompson)...<br/><br/>The science in the story is conveniently glossed over, and the idea of time travel is really no more than a gimmick to explore a childhood curiosity of what our parents were like as children.  The script uses this to point out some humorous aspects of parental and romantic relationships.  This is especially true in the well-handled Oedipal twist where Marty's mother falls in love with him.  The parent roles are reversed when Marty chastises his mum for typically teenage behaviour whereupon he's told: 'Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother'.  There are plenty of other small, knowing jokes and plot twists in the story (there's a good onrunning gag about the town mayor). <br/><br/>The setting of the fictitious Hill Valley is well recreated for both time periods, although the effect (particularly with the 1950's section) is one more of rose-tinted nostalgia than balanced realism.  The action is well-paced by Robert Zemeckis, allowing the plot and the comedy to develop at ease.<br/><br/>The cast boasts a gallery of well-played, memorable characters.  Fox is a hit as the teenage everyman Marty, and Lloyd is on fine eccentric form as the scientist Doc.  Crispin Glover is excellent as Marty's dad, brilliantly conveying the transformation from bumbling idiot to confident, assertive adult. Lea Thompson gets it just right in all respects as Marty's mother, playing it subtley but emotively.  They are well-supported by Thomas F.Wilson as the bullying Biff Tannen, and James Tolkan as the school disciplinarian Mr Strickland.<br/><br/>The film builds to an exciting, suspenseful finale and ends with an opening for not one but two sequels to this superb original."
"Okonh0wp","10","0","1","9 June 2004"," **** Stars: Very underrated film
","This is probably the most underrated trilogy of the 20th century, and in my personal opinion it's almost up there with Indiana Jones and Star Wars in terms of adventure and fun. <br/><br/>It's perhaps the best science-fiction film, in terms of having widespread appeal while still being also appealing to those intrigued by the Time Travel angle. I do maintain, however, that this is at heart, a sci-fi film, maybe not in par with TV shows like Babylon 5 or Star Trek: The Next Generation in its complexity, but Doc and his time traveling contraption are really the movie's main draw, and furthermore, I think that the movie has enough scientific exploration within it, that it appeals to those scientifically-minded thinkers within ourselves.<br/><br/>At the same time, it mixes the science up with comedy, action, and romance, and practically everything else, and that's why I think this practically everyone who's seen this has liked it.<br/><br/>The ensemble gets a lot of mileage, just out of playing with type. Michael J Fox plays the epitome of the rebellious teenager of the 80s, Christopher Lloyd's mad scientist doc, who initiates the whole adventure, comes straight out of a comic-book, and just the same, it's probably the best performance of his career. Also, the protagonist's dad, George, and his nemesis Biff, are found in the standard nerd and bully roles. <br/><br/>Adding to a great ensemble, this is just an all-around solid film, the special effects are great, the soundtrack (Alan Silvestri) is one of my favorites, and it's just, overall, a lot of fun."

Marty comes from a miserable family, his father George (Crispin Glover) is constantly bullied by his superior Biff Tannen (Thomas F Wilson) and the rest of his family are just pathetic.<br/><br/>This is the year of 1985.

Now he must find Doc in order to get him back to the future and make his teenage parents fall in love with each other, otherwise Marty won't even exist.

Fortunately, Marty has got the exact information on when the clock tower will be struck by the lightning, so he can go back to the future. He also leaves Doc a note asking him not to open until 1985...<br/><br/>This is the film which made Michael J Fox to stardom and he is dynamic. Christopher Lloyd is perfect as the flaky Doc Brown.

","Always a favorite of fans of both comedy and science fiction/adventure genres, Robert Zemeckis's Back to the Future has both the comedy, adventure and science fiction all into one film. Executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Back to the Future was among the top grossing films of 1985, and spawned three sequels with a well remembered Oscar nominated song ""Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis and the News. For 17 year old Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) his future doesn't seem to be going anywere. He's a slacker at school, has a few troubles with his girlfriend and has never ending confrontations with his parents (Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson). For most of his time, Marty likes to hang around the old eccentric Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) who has a major surpise, he just invented time machine with a DeLoren automobile. Unfortunatly for Marty, he is accidently taken back to the past, 30 years earlier. For some, time travel might be fun, but from the moment, Marty steps back to the past, he has a number of problems. First he is nearly killed by Old Man Peabody (Will Hare) who thinks Marty is some kind of strange alien, then the people in town don't seem to care for him that much, he has problems with some of the local tough guys and meets his parents when they were in high school and his mother is falling in love with Marty. The only problem now, is that Marty won't be born in the future, if he stays with his mother and it's up to him to get himself back. I've always liked this film and the three sequels. It's fun for the entire famly and it's one of those motion pictures that an audience can't forget."

In this Marty will deal with Biff, make his parents fall in love, and change history.<br/><br/>This film is very funny.  From the witty Doc Brown to the nerdy George McFly, characters make you laugh.  But the fun of the film is seeing Marty encounter his parents and try to survive as an 80s kid in the 1950's.

","BACK TO THE FUTURE (1985) ***1/2(out of ****) Directed by Robert Zemeckis. Rated PG.<br/><br/>The first, and best, of the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy, this movie is a modern classic. Christopher Lloyd is marvelous as Dr. Emmett Brown and young Michael J. Fox shines as hapless 80's teen Marty McFly. I've enjoyed this movie since childhood, and the DVD boxed set I was given for Christmas last year is a real treat, with some of the best special features out of any DVD I'd seen. I think that what makes this film so very special and popular is that, in spite of all the sci-fi special effects elements, it never forgets to be a human story.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, yet complicated, and I won't divulge it here. Well, okay, maybe I will. Hell, you've probably already seen the film if you're reading my article. For those of you who don't know, Marty gets accidentally sent back in time to the 50s, where he meets his parents (Lea Thompson and a hilariously geeky Crispin Glover) and the Doc who sent him back in the first place. Since he catches his mom's eye (ewww) he has to help his dad ask his mom out or else he'll cease to exist. Plus, he has to adjust to life in the 50s. Got it!?<br/><br/>This film could have been a disaster, a low-budget piece of 1980s nonsense, but it wasn't. Thanks to the talents of Fox, Lloyd, Thompson, Glover, director Robert Zemeckis and especially exec producer Steven (the Man) Spielberg, you actually care about the characters. The script is witty, the effects are pretty good, and McFly even pretends he's Chuck Berry. Oh, and look for Huey Lewis (80s pop-rocker) as a high school teacher. Very entertaining movie, one of those very few movies you can enjoy with friends, by yourself, or with the entire family. Timeless and great fun!"
"rancyhotluv","Null","0","1","3 November 2003"," Brilliant! What can I say?
","I'm a very nostalgic person and ""Back to the Future"" is also extremely nostalgic in aspects of it's plot. It has been one of my all time favorite movies as a kid and has stuck with me ever since. I think ""Back to the Future"" is a perfect blend of everything mounting to a successful satisfaction to viewers of all ages. Watching it as a kid, I got the pleasures of knowing such things imaginatively exists as time travel and time continuum. Its' fast pace of the movie keeps you well focused, on the edge of your seat and always guessing the next plot. It really is a succsess in making it enjoyable for a wide range of age in the audience, a movie that can be watched with cross generations whether vertically(gernations within family) or horizontally(being in different decades). I must have watched it over 30 times and I still find myself discovering something new each time, and that's another trill of the movie, it never gets old.<br/><br/>
Another big success are the characters. They are so well given credit to as they are all very distinctive but inseparable characters. It's nice to sit down with a movie and find the character as lovable as Marty or wacho and unpredictable as Doc Brown. I think there's no chance for a better cast, they are undoubtedly the best duo for this particular film.<br/><br/>

"gabbahey10","Null","0","1","25 August 2003"," The best multi-part series ever. I speak for the whole trilogy.
","Warning: Spoilers<br/><br/>The Back To The Future trilogy is the most artistic, entertaining and well put-together multi-part series ever created.  Me and my budies just love watching them in order back-to-back. I am a big fan of director Robert Zemeckis and I even like his earlier movies which were flops.  Of all his films that he made which I love every one of them, I think the Back To The Future trilogy is his grandest design(even though it wasn't origionally going to be a trilogy).<br/><br/>Unlike other multi-part movies which only the first one is good and the sequels sucked, the magic of Back To The Future always stayed through-out the entire series.  Other movies with sequels just don't know when to stop. I mean come on, Freddie vs. Jason?  Give me a break. The Back To The Futures started and ended perfectly.  Cause here you have it: In part I, the characters, places and hardware is introduced and movie takes it's audience on a fun adventure showing its idea of time-travel and the effects of time-travel.  In part II, darkness falls.  We see the effects of time-travel at its most nightmarish way and Doc and Marty must correct it.  In part III, after what Doc and Marty have been through in the previous two movies, they must come to the conclusion to make the right decisions about what they should do and discover what their true destinies really are. Now THAT'S an example of good trilogy.  I know many people think part III sucked, they probiably just didn't look at the movie correctly.  What they don't realize is that part III wasn't a movie, it's the conclusion of a three part play.<br/><br/>
As for the characters, I like them all.  It was very interesting to see the families at all different generations like the McFlys, the Tannens, and even the Stricklands (if you noticed that Hill Valley's marshall in 1885 is an ansester to Marty's principal).  All the actors did a great job, however the true star of these movies to me is Christopher Lloyd.  He did such a spectacular performance in his role as Doctor Emmett Brown.  No actor could have played that roll better then him, man he rocked.<br/><br/>The DeLorean was always a good character of its own.  What's really interesting is that even the DeLorean was dressed appropriate to match each year that was shown in the trilogy.  For 2015, it had Mr. Fusion and a hover conversion installed.  In 1955 (in part III), it had 1950's wheels and a big 1950's circut board on the hood.  And in 1885, it was pulled by horses like a coach and then train wheels were put on it so it can be pushed on the railroad tracks.  It was sad seeing the car distroyed near the end of part III but then again, not too many cars live to be 70 years old.<br/><br/>The thing I think makes the Back To The Future movies fun to watch the most is Hill Valley.  In every year shown in the trilogy, we always got a good at Hill Valley's Courthouse Square.  We saw the Courthouse Square in 5 different versions:  1985, 1955, 2015, alternate 1985 and 1885.<br/><br/>Well I tell ya, they sure don't make si-fi/adventure movies like they used to.  It seems that now days, there are more visual effects and less creativity.  The Back To The Future trilogy sure made its mark in the film industry.  It's a series which in my opinion will never be surpassed."

The scenes that take place in the '50s are so brilliantly done. There was no other movie like this back in the '80s. That's why it was such a smash, and rightfully so. 'Back to the Future' was a big part of my growing up, and still blows my mind to this day."

","I can't believe I waited this long to watch the trilogy. I'm so glad I did. This movie amazes me and makes me laugh every single time. This is truly a classic. Michael J. Fox was riding high at this point in his life with the popularity of ""Family Ties"", this film at #1 on the box office and his ""Teen Wolf"" at #2. The acting was great, the music and score were awesome. This is a great film that deserves recognition as one of the greatest."

","I first saw ""Back to the Future part II"" in 1989 and it ignited my passion for movies.  I wore out the cassettes of all three films and just about wore out the ""Secrets..."" video with Kirk Cameron.  They are without a doubt my favorite movies of all time (not too crazy about Part III, but it's still great), and Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale couldn't have been more right with writing this film.<br/><br/>Although the movies are excellent, the direction is right on, and the cast is about as good as it gets, there is one person the movie couldn't have succeeded without: Michael J. Fox.  In 1985, Fox was at the height of his career, both with the Republican Alex P. Keaton of ""Family Ties"" and with his performance in the film ""Teen Wolf.""  I read his autobiography ""Lucky Man"" and learned about the fact the producer of ""Family Ties"" was the one that held the script for ""Future"" back in the first place, which is what made Zemeckis, Gale, and Spielberg go with Eric Stolz.  Don't get me wrong, Stolz may be a talented guy, but there is NO WAY Marty McFly would work with Fox at the helm.  His portrayal is timeless, as is the rest of the film.<br/><br/>
From Christopher Lloyd, to Thomas F. Wilson, and even all the way to Billy Zane (one of Biff's henchmen), the film is perfect.  To grab a cast like this, it was ""density"", I mean, it was DESTINY."
"Old Joe","Null","0","1","16 January 2003"," What if ... you could travel through time? Well now you can, when you watch this timeless movie ride back into the past and the future!
","I am sure at one stage or another that your parents would have said to you `I was young once to you know!' Yet for some reason we all find it hard to believe that our parents were once teenagers. In the 1985 classic 'Back To The Future', young Marty McFly gets the chance to experience what time travel is, how different his home town is in the '50s and also what his parents were like as teenagers.<br/><br/>The year is 1985 - but not for long. Because teenager Marty McFly is about to be blasted back to 1955 aboard the plutonium powered DeLorean created by eccentric genius Doctor Emmett Brown. But when Marty accidentally keeps his parents-to-be from falling in love, it triggers a time shattering chain reaction that could vapourise his future - and leave him in the past! Now, Marty's only hope is to change history - before the clock runs out on his one-in-a-million chance to get himself Back To The Future!<br/><br/>This film is incredibly clever in what it portrays. Its story is unique, original and different to the common time travel theme. The story for BTTF was written by Bob Gale and director Robert Zemeckis. Bob Gale one day wondered if he would have been friends with his father as a teenager, when he was a teenager. With that in mind the pair went about writing a script that had the element within it. Their comedic touch was exceptional, yet this story has many elements that make it very complex. The change that had to happen when Marty goes from 1985 back to 1955 is of major importance to the story or the whole project would have been a failure. It is no wonder that both men got an academy award nomination for their most intelligent script.<br/><br/>Bob Zemeckis was coming off his success of 'Romancing the Stone' (1984) when he took on directing BTTF. His grand vision for this project made it the great success that it still remains today.  It was of great significance that Bob had Steven Spielberg as Executive Producer of BTTF. I am not surprised, as this movie would have been right up his alley. Spielberg had a busy time in the summer of '85 when BTTF was released, with another of his productions being released at the same time including the classic kids adventure, 'The Goonies'.<br/><br/>The cast for this film was well chosen and acted. Michael J. Fox had a big work load when he took on the role of Marty McFly, as he was simultaneously doing the TV show 'Family Ties' as well. He was working days lasting 18 -20 hours. Taking that into consideration, it is the most professional performance from Fox. His character takes on so much, but Fox's performance is flawless. Fox also showed how versatile an actor he really was, learning how to use a skate board and showing off his guitar skills as well. Then there was Christopher Lloyd who was perfect as the nutty professor Doc Brown. Lloyd had a two dimensional role in BTTF which was entertaining to say the least. Marty is warned by his nemesis school teacher Mr. Strickland (James Tolkin) to stay away from the good Doctor, as he is 'Dangerous, a nutcase and will get him into big trouble'. This warning turns out to be so true.<br/><br/>Other notable cast members include Lorraine Baines (Lea Thompson) and George McFly (Crispin Glover) who play Marty's wacky parents. There roles called for them to be transformed into older people via the use of make-up. I like what they did for the movie, as their performances had to be different for each new part to the film. Marty's siblings include Dave (Superman star Marc McClure) and Linda (Wendie Jo Sperber), while Marty has a gorgeous girlfriend, Jennifer (Claudia Wells). I also like the bad characters in BTTF. They include people such as Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), who is a mean guy for the majority of the film, and picks on poor George McFly. It is fascinating to see George's son stick up for himself against a much younger Biff.  One of Biff's sidekicks happens to be a guy named Match (Billy Zane). In fact, this was Billy's first ever movie role. Bigger things were going to come for him in the future. Ironic?<br/><br/>The idea of time travel must have been a difficult to bring to life on a production such as this. Zemeckis toyed with the idea that a refrigerator could be used as the transporter through time, but he was afraid that young children might try and hop in their own fridge and get trapped. So he decided to use a car, which was a good choice. Having it be as unique a car as the DeLorean was excellent, as the car has funny doors and looks some-what futuristic. This movie is also clever in the way that it shows what an experience time-travel might be like. What can happen to your transportation and the way you are transported, are captured beautifully in BTTF.<br/><br/>This film is a lot of fun that the whole family can enjoy, whether it is Mum, Dad or the kids. I am not sure what genre to call it, perhaps a 'teen, family, sci-fi, coming of age, adventure story'. It is also a movie that gives hope to its viewers. I believe it is saying 'what has happened in the past or right now, might not happen in the future', which is a good a message for the many different people that watch it.  This movie has an incredibly good soundtrack (with Huey Lewis and the News smash hit - 'Power of love') and if you have access to DVDs, take a look at the 'Back To The Future' trilogy DVD, as it is one impressive pack.<br/><br/>CMRS gives 'Back To The Future': 4.5 (Very Good - Brilliant Film)"

Unlike so many movies from the mid-80's, the story is timeless, there is not too much emphasis on fads at the time, the fashions etc are all very low key.. which in hindsight is a bit of genius considering it may have been tempting to show the 80's characters in the wild fashions of the time to contrast with the 50's look.. <br/><br/>And the future view also still stands up as being modern! Although, ahem, flying cars by 2015? Doesn't seem so realistic now :) <br/><br/>Anyway.. love them all.. the 2nd has that great futuristic look and re-recreates the scenes from the original movie brilliantly!

","***SPOILERS HERE!***<br/><br/>I will comment on the whole trilogy here.<br/><br/>These movies, Back to the future 1-3, make up an immensely enjoyable sci-fi comedy trilogy. The story: Marty McFly, an ordinary teenager meet up with his friend Dr. Emmett Brown, to see his latest innovation. It turns out to be a timemachine! Things go wrong, however, and Doc is shot by angry libyan terrorists and Marty flees in the timemachine - and ends up in 1955. After changing the past he realizes that it may have consequences on his own future existence, and so the adventure begins as he tries to restore the past. And he must also find a way to make sure Doc wont get shot in the future! And will he ever make it back home again?<br/><br/>In the other two parts, he and Doc travels into the future and the past and back again, they have to make sure the past as well as the future is in order.<br/><br/>This is an amazing trilogy. It's not so much of a movie, as it is more like a daydream :) Surely I can't be the only one who used to fantasize about things like time travel when I was a kid? Check this out, this movie has everything:<br/><br/>* Marty McFly as the guy we can identify with, with all the trouble with school, love, his helplessly oldfashioned parents, and everyday teenage life.<br/><br/>* Dr. Emmett Brown, as the crazy scientist, with his weird gizmos, eccentric ways, a hair in a greater disorder than Einsteins hair, sometimes wearing goggles and a white coat, now and then using his favourite expression ""Great Scott!"" :-)<br/><br/>* A time machine. A time machine in a DeLorean! Do I have to say more? :) I love it.<br/><br/>
That's the story. As you can see, I have absolutely nothing to object. Over to the casting, which couldn't have been done any better than this. Michael J Fox is perfect as Marty McFly, and I can't imagine anyone else in this movie. Michael is perfect in this role. Christopher Lloyd is excellent in the role as Doc Brown. Claudia Wells is doing a great job as Marty's girlfriend, and also Thomas F Wilson is great as the bully Biff Tannen.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a movie that all kids - young and old - should watch :) Of course there will be some of you who will not like this movie, but that's how it is. I am sure most of you love it.<br/><br/>It's a perfect 10/10."

","I've never been a big fan of science fiction, yet for one reason or another, I manage to draw an exception when it comes to the Back to the Future trilogy. An extremely clever, amusing and well-crafted series, the first film in particular never fails to bring a smile to my face, no matter how many times I've seen it. It's a tremendous feel-good movie that's difficult to criticise. Congratulations, Mr Zemeckis!<br/><br/>The concept of time travel has always fascinated mankind.  When put into practice, albeit within the frameworks of fiction, it forces us to consider just which periods of time we would visit if we were ever fortunate enough to stumble upon a time machine. But surely the chances of this ever happening are as unlikely as being struck by a bolt of lightning. . .or is it?<br/><br/>A well-knitted cast, headed by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, provide wonderful performances. Many of the cast members appear in all three films, playing a variety of different roles. Although lacking scientific reality (though this has to be forgiven in science fiction), there are few flaws overall. The second helping of the trilogy, to many, proved a little lacklustre, though by the time of the concluding part, the magic and twist of the original film was undoubtedly recaptured.<br/><br/>Boasting a magnificent soundtrack - from the famous orchestral score and the passion of Huey Lewis and the News, to Marty's sparkling rendition of 'Johnny Be Good' in the style of Eddie Van Halen - and an effective dose of special effects, Back to the Future has infectious charm. Highly recommended for all, regardless of their approach to film."

You get a chance to see a screening and you do not know what to expect. You come out of the film knowing that this film will soon replace ""Rambo"" as the film everyone talks about. That is exactly what happened to me on this film. When I first saw it, it reminded me of a classic Hollywood movie, the kind Frank Capra or Preston Sturges would have made if they had access the effects available in the 1980's. I'll go you one better, the twist of the main character meeting his mother when she was in high school and the mother hitting on him is a perverse touch worthy of Billy Wilder! Bob Gale, one of the film's Oscar-nominated screenwriters said that when audiences saw the opening of the film, they were wondering why the dysfunctional McFly family was being shown; but when Marty goes back in time, the gags payoff one by one and the audience gets it right away.

","This is NOT one of the greatest films ever made, but it will STAND THE TEST OF TIME as >>one of the GREATEST MOVIES ever<<!<br/><br/>This film should be part of any film school study as a perfect example on how to make a successful commercial film.<br/><br/>Premise: (familiar concept but original plot that appeals to the imagination) Production Values: (Clean cutting and pace without distraction, no unnecessary SFX) Direction: Let the Actors GO! Casting: (Totally believe the characters, including typecasting eg; Lloyd, Fox) Script: Settings, set design, continuity, multi-level historical references using ESTABLISHED pop-culture icons Music, Soundtrack: Great selection. Return on Post production publicity.<br/><br/>Little appreciated career effects: Fox and Lloyd were already celebrities, but this movie REALLY sprang Lea Thompson's career.  She, more than any other cast member, had the greatest range of character in the series.  She played 3 separate characters, I believe.  She went on to several  different film roles as a result of her classical theatrical performances, then Caroline in the City. Now (Spring, '00) she has been cast as a lead in a resuscitation of ""Cabaret"" for the stage.  I can't help but think this role helped in her selection based on her ability to project character.<br/><br/>Overall, this will rank right up there with Breakfast Club as an example of '80s ensemble flicks.  But, unlike B.C., will never be tiring to watch over and over."

","I'm not going to divulge the plot of this film to you.  Chances are you've already seen it and know how wonderful it is.  All I'm going to say about the film is that it stands out as being one of the most visually and iconoclastic movies about the 80's.  Attitude, Walkman's, Skateboards, Van Halen, Rock bands, sports cars and Toyota 4x4's.  Visually clashing with the apparent 'innocence' that was the 1950's, sans Marty's hormone driven mother.  This film remains a 'time piece' of the teenage view of a decade that has come under a lot of flak.  Speaking as a teenager reflecting on the end of the last decade, Back to the Future reminds us that the 80's weren't all that bad right?  Right?"

","I don't care as much about who is directing a movie as some people do, as my top 20 movie list has 20 different directors, but Robert Zemeckis is probably one of my top 5 favorites of all time. <br/><br/>Even though I liked Back to the Future more when I was a kid, I think it is an enjoyable flick for both adults and children. Certainly there were things that strained credibility; like the 30-something Lloyd looking 60 something, the people in the picture fading out of existence, and the lightning coming on the exact second of the minute change. But, this is a comedy, as well as a movie trying to deal with time travel, and I am able to put those petty complaints aside enough to realize how entertaining this film is.<br/><br/>
I thought that Zemeckis and the actors did a very good job of blending comedy and action together in a smooth fashion. Fox's physical work was impressive to say the least, and I must have laughed at his athletic comedy 3 or 4 times. <br/><br/>In short, this is an exciting, funny and memorable film for all ages.

Then as his young mother-to-be falls for him, we are treated to a hilarious group of scenes in which he tried to shift her attentions to his future dad.

","July 3rd, 1985.  My all time fave is released and although I know most everybody knows about the film, I must recap it one more time.  Fox is Marty McFly, a cool, confident teen who plays a mean guitar, rides a skateboard like nobodys business, and has a sweet, pretty girlfriend.  One night in a mall parking lot his life is disrupted while helping his older friend, Dr. Brown (Lloyd, in a truly memorable performance).  The Doc is gunned down and Martys only escape from his own demise is to take off in Lloyds newly created time machine, an awesome looking DeLorean.  He ends up in 1955, when his parents were his age and oops, he interferes with their first meeting. And double oops, his mom has a crush on him!  Yuck!  The core of the film is his attempts to get them to fall for each other so that he'll exist in the future, while avoiding run-ins with a bully named Biff (what else?). The film is packed with one terrific scene after another; the skateboard chase, Johnny B. Goode, George standing up to Biff, the clocktower sequence, I could go on.  Two great songs from Huey Lewis and an exciting score from Alan Silvestri add to the films greatness.  Fox, replacing the fired Eric Stolz as Marty, is great, Lloyd is perfectly manic, Thompson is cute, Glover is a crack up, and Wilson's bully is right on target.  Two sequels followed, one in 89 one in 90, also an ok cartoon series and a lousy video game. Though most might not be with me that this is the best ever, youd be hard pressed to find anyone whod say this isnt one of the greats to come along."

Marty is a likeable kid who is forced, in a freak accident, to 1955 and has to save his and his sibling's future from never occurring. Even though he has a time machine his main problem is still time. Good thing he has the eccentric Doc' on his side. The plot has many twists, but is easy too follow. It is well-directed and well-writen and is followed with two, satisfying and successful sequels. Hop on the Back to the Future bandwagon. Now."
"Altaira","Null","0","1","10 July 1999"," The start of a very entertaining trilogy
","Ohhhh...such a great film, even after so many years!  I first saw Back to the Future as a seven-year-old, and while I enjoyed it then, I didn't grasp all the subtle implications.  The idea of a teenager accidentally mucking around in his parent's first romance is mind-boggling, but enjoyable.  In some ways, this is not only a sci-fi flick (which really it isn't) but a character drama, a comedy (at many times) and a period piece.  The contrast between the 80's and the 50's is comical in a time when both decades are part of America's colorful past. After you've seen Back to the Future at least a dozen times, you start to pick up on the attention to detail--and how one incident in the past can drastically affect the future.  The name of the mall, for instance, is changed from Twin Pine to Lone Pine in one fell swoop of an out-of-control DeLorean. Such comedy arises from Marty's encounters with his family-to-be. Lorraine, his mother, is infatuated with him, much to the dismay of her family; her father remarks, ""He's an idiot.  Parents probably idiots too.  Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that I'll disown you.""  If he only knew!!!<br/><br/>BTTF also sets the pace for the rest of the trilogy, and you really have to watch the first to understand any of the movies.  Plus, if you look at the trilogy as a whole, one big incorporate story, it's really a very inventive, involving joyride.  Plus, Christopher Lloyd makes a very amusing nutty professor-type, and the soundtrack's great.  The costumes are convincing, as is 50's Hill Valley.  A great experience for anyone."

Pulling off fun jokes and exciting set pieces with ease, BTTF follows the adventures of Marty McFly, as he travels back in time to 1955 to try and get his parents to fall in love. Christopher Lloyd is suitable manic as the off centre Doc Brown, the inventor of the sleek time machine, and Crispin Glover is an absolute standout as the nerdy George McFly. Lea Thompson is memorable as Marty's mom who falls in love with Marty in 1955 (leading to some great gags) and writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale ensure the film goes at full speed, and Huey Lewis provides a great anthem in the form of 'The Power of Love.' The sequels never matched the whimsy on display here, and for anyone who enjoys rollicking sci-fi, BTTF is the ultimate good time."

Michael J.Fox and Christopher Lloyd have such chemistry together on screen unlike what we see today in movies with co-stars. Michael J. Fox is without question one of the funniest actors around. He is not a comedian turned actor, just a talented funny actor.<br/><br/>BTTF came out during Michael J. Fox's successful run on Family Ties. He was a household name that brought us all to the theatre to see this gem. Robert Zemekis casts a terrific cast here. Lea Thopson (Caroline In The City), Crispin Glover (who co-starred with Fox in the TV Movie High School USA) to name a couple. I never found a boring part in this movie, from beginning to end it just keeps you entertained. I can't see why/if anyone would knock this movie as it just has so much going for it no matter what. Too bad no other comedy movies have been done as good as this one. But like always there will be one movie that will stand out in certain genres and this definitely does in the comedy genre. Fox has done a string of funny movies in the 80's and I think people should rent/buy his films to see that he is no matter what a true talent in Hollywood.

"t_stainforth","Null","0","2","9 April 2002"," Good but slightly flawed
","I have liked Back to the Future since I was a kid. It has a fascinating story and concept, but I think that the concept might be too much of the reason why I like it. The story is hugely entertaining, especially the first time you watch it, but there are so many plot holes and vaguely idiotic concepts that it can start to be a bit annoying. I won't get into the plot holes, since they really don't matter, as they say, you just have to suspend your disbelief.<br/><br/>
However, the 1950s are presented in such a cliche way that I think the movie misses a chance. So many people see the 1950s as a perfect time, a clean, simpler time, that movies just reflect this common misperception. The truth though is that the 50s was a time with its problems and issues too. I don't think that the movie should have been used as some sort of documentary, or educational opportunity, but I think it would have been more interesting if the moviemakers hadn't relied so much on cliches. For example, everything is clean, wholesome, the soda bar, etc... It would have been fun to make more fun of Marty's perceptions of the time.<br/><br/>Also, the fact that he changes 1985 ""for the better"" is kind of stupid. He wouldn't know any of those people, his family, or his girlfriend. They would all be totally different. He might have been better off staying in 1955 since the end result would have been the same, and he wouldn't have to cope with that sort of freakshow.<br/><br/>Those are only minor problems, I think it would have been a better movie if they had taken those two points into consideration, but it still is a really fun movie."

I know thats when its set and everything but to me the hallmark of a good film is that no matter when it was made it still seems like new.<br/><br/>Michael J Fox was the perfect choice for this role as he was new and was great at the teenager who got caught up in the middle of everything and had to get his parents together, this film launched his career and rightly so. Christopher Lloyd as the manic Doc Brown, pure class, whoever choose him deserves every award going plus a few medals as well for good measure, hes ace, great as the mad scientist and gets more and more funny as the trilogy goes on. Thomas F Wilson as the bully Biff(what a name haha!) who picks on everyone, including his father to brilliant comedic effect, wish i could have seen more of this guy in bigger films after this one as i think given the chance he could have been one of the big guns in america, but hey what do i know right.<br/><br/>I cannot be bothered going through the rest of this, just go and watch this movie, if you havent seen it, rent or buy it, if you have got it watch it, if you are from another country and cant understand this get it translated ok.

From this lies three movies which build upon each other for an enjoyable trilogy of time line mayhem.<br/><br/>Fox brings a fun element to a slacker teenager, thrown into a life or death quest that determines his own destiny. Lloyd, as the eccentric professor, makes a marvelous partner to the time bandits; and Thomas Wilson makes a bully that I think we all met in our younger days.<br/><br/>Back To The Future is one of those films that marks a time in cinema.

","This film is an impressive creation of the incredible adventure of time travel.  Many aspects of this film make it work, especially the talents of the great director Robert Zemekis.  It is a movie where the new kid on the block of the 80's truly shines with great acting.  The other main actors of this movie, eg the Doc, Biff, George, Lorraine were an excellent cast selection.<br/><br/>The musical score for this film by John Williams is as usual, a fantastically composed piece of musical art that fits perfectly in to Back to The Future.  The film was excellently edited, contained phenomenal special effects and many great moments.  In my opinion a movies main job is to create special moments, and this one had no shortage.<br/><br/>Other aspects of this film made this a success, ie the lighting, set, acting, props(which includes the DeLorean), the several motifs that run through the movie about 'time'(music, clocks, being late for something etc) and many more.  The camaraderie between Marty and the Doc in 1985 and 1955 is beautifully contrasted in that they make solid friendships in both time frames.<br/><br/>The audience can tell this movie isn't meant to be a totally series film and that it is also a comedy aswell as science fiction.  The deliberate over-acting sometimes visible, ie when the Doc says, ""..Next Saturday night were sending you back to the future!,"" and points straight to the camera shows this, and is appropriate in this comedy.  Also when George says, '..And not you or anyone on this planet is going to make me change my mind..""  This in addition to the comedy tells the audience that the film she be taken as a light hearted sci-fi comedy.<br/><br/>Robert Zemekis has shown in this film that he is indeed a prolific director. I look forward to writing reviews on his other successes but for y'all who haven't seen this movie it is smash, SO SEE IT."

","The BTTF-films may very well be the best movie trilogy ever, they sure are a lot more entertaining then the Godfather-films<br/><br/>First of all, the trilogy is a unique storytelling experiment, the 3 films make one big story, one can't be seen without the other ones. Everything about these films is great. The score by Alan Silvestri can compete with the best work of John Williams.  The special effects are (though a little bit dated) efficient and functional.  Lloyd and Fox are playing the parts of their lives, and they're doing a hell of a job! Robert Zemeckis, one of the most underrated directors of our time, keeps the pacing tight and the storyline even tighter.  Who cares if there are some plotholes, this is a sci-fi comedy people!<br/><br/>This really is a lot more then just another story for boys, everything fits together so perfectly.  I must have seen the films a dozen of times and I still discover new things!

","This is one of the great 80's films that has always stayed with me. In today's post-modern world, I think that it is constantly being dismissed as a less and less of an innovative movie.  For its time, the simple idea behind the film meant far more than it does today. The classic parental notion of ""I never did that sort of thing when I was your age"" becomes exploited and the film takes off.  But, like I said, these days films like this are withering away.

Great, wholesome fun, and Christopher Lloyd still steals the show!"
"TxMike","Null","0","2","9 June 2001"," Back To The Future, great start to the trilogy, movies in 1985, 1989, and 1990.
","As of this date, the 3 ""Back to the Future"" films have these IMDb ratings -- #1 (1985) 7.8 of 26,091 votes. #2 (1989) 6.6 of 9492 votes. #3 (1990) 6.4 of 8230 votes. So, it is clear that the first episode is the most popular, no contest, in both rating and number of votes.<br/><br/>I, too, think #1 is the best. In fact, I think it should stand among the best films of all time. Not for any one facet, but for the total entertainment that it provides. Almost all of us dream of ""time travel."" BTTF certainly is not the first to explore time travel, but the way it does it is unique. Plus the fact that this is clearly a comedy, but one that is so well conceived and written that I never find myself think of it as a comedy. I've been a long time fan of Chris Lloyd's, since his days as Jim Ignatowski (""flower child"" spelled backward), and he is so perfect as Doc Brown. And, of course, Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly ""defines"" a role as few have been defined in films.<br/><br/>The script is uniformly superb in all 3 versions, and to me that is what really makes them ""believable"" within the context of a pure fantasy. Plus, although all the ""science"" in the 3 films is ""bad science"", which for a scientist makes it even funnier, they don't overlook any details. They always offer a ""science"" explanation for what Doc is about to do, even though it is completely nonsense.<br/><br/>Tonight, at the end of #3, I first realized one of the reasons I like the BTTF films so much. Ever take a vacation to a totally different part of your country or world? And when you get back home after a few weeks, to the familiar, you sorta mentally pinch yourself and think, ""Just two days ago I was riding a train through southern France, drinking wine by the river, and sleeping in the 200-yr-old silk factory turned home in the country."" And you look around, you're back home to a totally different world.<br/><br/>That's what I believe Marty McFly felt when he arrived home, saw Jennifer asleep on the swing. He had just spent a week during 1885, evading a band of Indians, seeing his original ancestors from Scotland, fighting an infamous gunfighter, and making a harrowing escape from the past by being pushed to 88 mph by a train that blows up, and now he is back home to the familiar. We can all identify with that, and the end of each of the 3 BTTF films gives us that identification.<br/><br/>The original, #1, involved the existing friendship between Marty and Doc Brown. Marty accidentally gets sent back 30 years to 1955, and must enlist a young Doc's help to get home. Meanwhile he inadvertently gets his future mother interested in him, jeopardizing the future relationship of his ""parents."" The old newspaper accounts of the lightning strike of the clock tower is used as a source of energy to get Marty back home. His fight with Biff in 1955 has altered history and his 1985 family is apparently much better off as a result.<br/><br/>#2 hinges on Biff inadvertently getting a copy of an almanac for ""future"" events and he dishonestly uses future sports results to gain fortune and power, and drastically change the future. Marty and Doc have to retrieve the almanac before Biff uses it, to restore history to its proper order. It ends in a way that sets up the #3 sequel.<br/><br/>In #3 Marty gets a Western Union letter that Doc Brown had actually written in 1885 and requested delivery at the specific time in the future. Doc has ended up in 1885, is content, and insists that Marty not try to interfere. However, Marty discovers a tombstone and historical account of Doc being shot in the back over an $80 issue. So Marty has to go back and help Doc avoid that fate. <br/><br/>To me, the original is definitely the better of the 3. The second and third ones are totally different, and I would rate them about the same. The science is funky, a rigorous analysis can uncover a number of ""discrepancies"", but to me none of that matters. The BTTF films are just great fun, and the good guys always come out on top. And there's nothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>2015 UPDATE: I bought the 3-disk BluRay set and they really are an upgrade from the DVDs, better picture and sound."
"Darth_Stat","Null","0","1","17 May 2001"," The pinacle of Time Travel movies.
","This is one of the best flicks from the 80's, it is basically just family mind candy but it's charm is relentless and there is not another movie you can have more fun with, it's sequels come the closest.<br/><br/>So what would happen if you could travel back in time and meet your parents, anyone seen time cop, they break the rule that they so strongly state, a single alteration in the time would probably cause a time and space melt down, though all scientific theory is completely hypathetical in this matter assumptions can be made. As for causing your parents not to meet at exactly the right time you would not exist regardless of wether they got together or not. But stuff like that if they got serious in the movie would make this from the No. 1 time travel movie to on a par with every other one.<br/><br/>
No one has ever come up with a better time machine, that delorian with the gullwing doors is one I'd like to know even though the company went bust. The action, setting and especially the acting in these movies had to be perfect or they would have been a B grade mess, and since they were all perfect no more needs to be said.<br/><br/>Spielberg really proved his nouse backing Zemekis' idea with this one, and Zemekis proved great directing skills which he was awarded for a decade later. It's a shame neither are very present today despite Zemekis' latest blockbuster What Lies Beneath, another pinacle-of-the-genre. Back To The Future deserves no less than a 10."

","Robert Zemeckis is one of the better directors out there, and you can say what you want to about the movies he has done, but ""Back to the Future"" was his most memorable. This movie was done with style, and will always be the best sci-fi movie around. The acting is remarkable; Marty (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) are the standouts in the film. Fox does a wonderful job portraying the average 80s teenager, while Lloyd made his voice heard in his career best performance. As for Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson, they add another ring to the story, and give it comedy, a rare occurance in science fiction. There are several things that I could note telling how good this movie was. The concept of traveling through time has never exactly done well in the theatres before, but ""Back to the Future"" worked, as did its sequels. The small things also made this movie what it is today, like how realistic the 1950s were. During those scenes, you can imagine it being a 50s movie done in color. Also, the usage of the Delorean seemed like the perfect car for the time machine. To sum things up, I quote Doc, talking about the Delorean used for the time machine. ""If you're gonna make a time machine, why not do it with some style?"" And that's exactly how Zemeckis made this fantastic movie, with style."

If I have one wish as a film fan it is to see the footage of one-third of the film that was shot with Eric Stoltz as Marty before Zemeckis and Spielberg decided to re-shoot with the less serious Michael J.

","When this movie came out in 1985, it changed the world of film making forever. Zemeckis' well-crafted movie was a critical and box-office success and for good reason. I cannot even begin to describe the effect this movie had on myself and all of my friends. We literally watched it every single day during the course of a summer vacation and still could not get enough. So many elements of this movie are wonderful and should be used more in other films. The script is excellent and the direction is even better. The opening with the clocks was magnificent and Christopher Lloyd's acting was superb. The DeLorean time machine was a real gas and real horror show! Michael J. Fox really hit it big with this one and his character was one many people could relate to. Hill Valley was a great imaginary little town somewhere in California and Marty's girlfriend was pretty hot, too. It was hilarious when he gets hit by the car and is forced to stay in his mom's and grandparents house for the night. Much of the content in this movie was highly ironic and coincidental, but still managed to stay far away from becoming corny. I'm surprised it did not win as much awards as it did. Everything from Biff to George McFly was great and all the sets were awesome. The final scenes were pretty heart warming and the prom scenes were cool, too. I also enjoyed the scene where Biff crashes his car into the manure truck. Can we get any funnier? I own part 2 also, but have still not been able to get myself to purchase part 3. It is missing something that the first 2 had. I really loved part 2 because it was much darker than the first. The whole ""Hell Valley"" thing was pretty scary and also with the Libyan's in the first one. Wow! This movie is amazing. I can't get enough of it. It supplies everything a person needs for a night of watching movies with some friends. So like, anyone not like this movie? I cannot imagine a person rating this film any less than a 9. I saw the sets at Universal Studios a while back and that was a great experience that I will never, ever forget. I obviously recommend this movie to everyone who likes movies and I'm sure it will pass the test of time in every sense. I wonder what people in other countries think about this. Hopefully, everyone around he world enjoys it. Stars: Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas something, Crispin Glover and other people.
