"samyy_866","8","18","19","23 May 2010"," I found it quite difficult to watch
","I will start by saying I have never read the book so I'm basing my review solely on the film.<br/><br/>I actually found the film very hard to watch and cried most of the way through. It is a very beautiful film but I think what is unfortunately overlooked my many is that the strongest relationship in the film is that between John and his father and it is this relationship that made the film very emotional for me. In particular scene following his fathers stroke where John was reading the letter was beautifully done and very well acted and was the scene I found most upsetting.<br/><br/>I think the film explores a number of important aspects in particular having an autistic parent which I could only imagine would be exceptionally difficult for any child, particularly when said parent is their only carer. As seen with the characters of both Aaron and Johns father relationships are often quite difficult for those with some types of autism, routine is important and going against a routine can cause a lot of angst and distress. Its unfortunate that a number of people continue to see autism as an excuse for peoples bad behaviour and I think this film brings and important note to an often misunderstood illness. It also points out the issue of autism in parents which is another issue often overlooked.<br/><br/>The relationship between John and Savannah is only secondary to that of John and his father and I think its well acted by Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried. To me both actors seemed to really feel and understand their characters and the hurt between them and I did like how the ending between them was really left open to interpretation.<br/><br/>In all a very well done film which explores some important social issues but no review will ever truly do this film justice. I for one could not watch it again because it made me so upset but this just goes to show how emotive the film is. Its a film that needs to be watched, even if it is only once."

","For starters, i'm not a big critic of movies. And sure, this one wasn't very complex, the characters weren't surprising and there was no big twist at the end--but i thought it was compelling. I had just seen Amanda Seyfried star in letters to Juliet, and was surprised at the contrast in her two characters..so that has to say at least SOMETHING positive about her. plus i just think she's cute and likable.<br/><br/>and who knows, maybe i'm just a sap, or i watched it at the wrong time of day, but i did cry. It's the classic tragic love story. the relationship that everyone wants but no one really ever gets. and things just keep falling apart. Everyone knew the dad was gonna die and Savannah was gonna move on from John while he was gone..but something about seeing channing tatum cry broke my heart and i sniffled the rest of the movie through.<br/><br/>i certainly don't think you should buy it. i probably wouldn't watch it again. ( i rented it on 99 cent Monday at my local movie store) but my time wasn't wasted at all. you just have to be a girl in the right mood :)"
"misskirsty","8","56","70","5 March 2010"," A lovely story with great characters
","Not having read anything about the film (or book) beforehand, I went into the cinema with no expectations, (though I was worried it might be a soppy, pull-at-the-heartstrings epic like The Notebook).<br/><br/>This wasn't the case. There were so many times when I thought 'Oh, I hope this doesn't happen', or 'I hope they don't do what I think they're going to do', and they didn't. There are moments of sadness, but some of them could have been made a lot worse.<br/><br/>The story isn't unique, (neither is The Notebook) but it is executed in a way that makes you feel as though you're watching something new. Channing Tatum is the lovable beefcake reminiscent of Marky Mark, and Amanda Seyfried is cute, delivering well executed dialogue. And I did actually think they had good chemistry, despite what other reviewers have said. Channing's John is an army boy who had a lot of issues growing up, so you can't expect him to be overly forthcoming with his emotions.<br/><br/>Richard Jenkins gives a great performance as the father, and even Henry Thomas is likable as the neighbour (I must be the only person in the world who hasn't seen E.T. so I didn't recognize the name at first).<br/><br/>To me, this was acted out a lot better (and even structured better) than Twilight: New Moon, which I assume is meant to appeal to the same audience. I know to some that isn't saying much, but perhaps our expectations are a bit high these days. If you want to see a sweet love story with likable characters, then you might just enjoy this film."
"nicki9112","7","39","50","29 May 2010"," Not bad
","Wow...I was expecting this movie to be awful after all of the bad reviews I've read. Nothing is wrong with this movie! Nothing is wrong with the acting. It's actually a pretty good movie. I am not usually one for romantic movies...usually because I find them to be lame. There are definitely moments in this one that tug at your heart and get you teary eyed.<br/><br/>I really felt for John in this movie. His character had a tough life... and the relationship between him and his father...It made me really sad! That Nicholas Sparks! He knows how to stir up emotions...<br/><br/>I have not read the book, so I can't compare the two but I say the movie is worth watching."
"TheLittleSongbird","7","24","30","3 September 2010"," Touching and wonderfully filmed with some believable acting
","I have to admit I wasn't expecting to like this film. I don't hate this type of film, but I had heard mixed feelings on Dear John, there were those who said it was touching and others who said it was too clichéd. Well after been blown away by The Notebook(book and movie), I saw Dear John. After seeing it, I don't think it is as good as The Notebook, but it was surprisingly good in my opinion. The characters are clichéd, and the beginning was a tad too fluffy for my liking, while there are some pacing issues. But while the book is better, having more depth and emotional punch, I was surprised at how touching Dear John actually was. The story is nice and believable enough, and there is some decent scripting. The direction is good too, while the cinematography and scenery are breathtaking and the score beautiful. Channing Tatum(my sister kept raving at how hot he was) and Amanda Seyfried are great and are believable together, while Richard Jenkins is heart breaking as Tatum's autistic father(I immediately sympathised with him as I have real problems with communicating with people and feeling comfortable around people and places I am not familiar with). I also liked the ending, it was ambiguous but also clever and subtle, and I think an improvement over the ending of the book(the book's only weak link). In conclusion, touching and well made, definitely worth a peek. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"rooprect","Null","6","6","2 May 2018"," Dammit, Lasse Hallström made me cry again
","Lasse Hallström, the Swedish director who gave us Chocolat (2001), Gilbert Grape (1993) and Hachi: A Dog's Tale (2009) is at it again - making chick flicks for guys. This means, unlike your stereotypical chick flick whose leading man is a hollow beefcakey stud with as much personality as the scenery, here we get a complex beefcakey stud whom the chicks can swoon over whilst the bros say ""duuuuude he's cool.""<br/><br/>In this case the protagonist is ""John"" (Channing Tatum) who plays an Army Special Forces character who can kill you with a toothpick but has total control over his emotions. Until, of couse, he meets ""Savannah"" (Amanda Seyfried) over his 2 week furlough before going back to war.<br/><br/>As you might guess, the story explores the ultimate long distance relationship as John completes his 1 year tour as a soldier while Savannah waits at home. Sounds boring? Well wait, there are complications. John's father is autistic and his mother abandoned them years ago. So John is forced to be the responsible one, but the whole war/love thing throws him out of whack.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Savannah has a few secrets of her own (and I gotta admit I totally didn't see it coming). And on top if it all, 9/11 hits and this forces John to make a decision whether to stay with his platoon and most likely get his butt blown off, or retire once his initial tour is over. Oh, and the movie begins with John getting blasted by gunfire, meaning the story unfolds in a huge flashback leaving us wondering the whole time if John dies or not.<br/><br/>This is a very sentimental flick, much like the other Hallström movies I mentioned, but it doesn't get sappy or predictable. In fact at least 3 plot twists took me by total surprise. And I'm talking like ""whoa duuuuude I never saw THAT coming"" surprise.<br/><br/>""Dear John"" focuses on interpersonal relationships when duty comes into play - and I'm not just talking about duty toward your country (a cleverly woven parallel), but duty to parents, children and those who need help. This is juxtaposed against selfish happiness, or the storybook love. Pay close attention to the characters' choices & sacrifices, and how these choices are based on duty/selflessness rather than ""getting the girl"". I think that's what makes this a unique romance. Whereas most Hollywood romance flicks focus on the problems of 2 lovers, ""Dear John"" presents us with an ideal love that is complicated by external loyalties.<br/><br/>The trademark of Hallström movies is some other issue (not just love) driving the characters, and that's why these films aren't sappy or predictable. Another trademark is is use of gorgeous scenery, in this case the beaches of Charleston SC. He achieves a very nostalgic beach feeling, even for those of us who have only been to the beach once or twice in our lives (see also his film ""Safe Haven"" filmed in Southport, NC).<br/><br/>""Dear John"" is a quiet, sentimental film, so don't expect action, car chases & robots. But it delivers a few tricky plot twists, so it's never boring. If you're not familiar with Hallström's style, I'd say it's artistic without being over-the-top artsy. Think of Kieslowsky (Blue, White, Red trilogy) or Wim Wenders (Paris Texas, Wings of Desire) or possibly even Steven Soderbergh (Sex Lies & Videotape, Solaris, Magic Mike) and you'll have a general idea of how this film feels."
"vampirekittieprincess","1","52","77","10 September 2010"," I absolutely hated this film.
","I'm not much of a critic but this film makes me dislike it so much with a passion. Not only was it not all that exciting and entertaining in the beginning and after in the first place, but when John finally got the letter from Savannah after waiting months (which was when I thought things were finally getting good) it turns out from then on ..nor John or Savannah try to get back in touch with each other after that. It turns out later on when he visits home to see his sick father on his death bed that she did go through with the marriage after all the feelings that were ""supposedly"" floating in the air and all around them. She didn't come to see his father while he was deathly ill, nor to comfort John for all the pain and mental suffering he's been going through with the war and now the only person that he really had all along is dying. And even after his father dies she didn't show up to the funeral. I mean my god.... it seemed where they lived was in a small area how COULD THINGS NOT SPREAD AROUND such things like someone dying? So that didn't even make sense. And then after all the bullshitting around they did when they finally spoke to each other after so long, she gives him a bullshit excuse as to why she dumped him in the first place, and even that didn't make much sense. She said she left him because Tim needed her, and so did his son...and she was lonely and not thinking... lol I'm sorry but if you really care and love someone and think about them every single freaking day then no way in hell can you go through that much torture successfully, unless you're emotionally messed up. She was being selfish and didn't know what she wanted, so let's just put it at that. So then, John takes his father's coin collection and sells it (ok ..good for him) but only to spend the money on Tim's expenses so he can have more time with Savannah lol ...that's about it as far the story itself goes ...we don't really know what happens between John and Savannah after that because the film was done poorly. I have never read the book and I'm sure as **** glad I didn't see Dear John in theatre's because I would of wasted my money."
"hanin84","4","84","134","6 February 2010"," Don't read the book if you want to see and/or like this movie...
","I'll try to make this short and sweet, like the two weeks the two characters spent together before all hell broke loose:<br/><br/>If you read the book, lower your expectations. If you haven't read the book,...well, you can raise your expectations just a bit higher.<br/><br/>I was one of those girls who squealed every time they saw a TV spot, or watched the trailer on YouTube a million times. I bawled my eyes out when I read the book- both times I read it. Last night, I went to see the movie knowing full well that it wasn't going to live up to the book. Unfortunately, I was right.<br/><br/>What made 'Dear John' different from all the other love stories we've read and seen was taken away in the movie. I don't know how I would have understood what was going on in the movie if I hadn't read the book. Scenes were rushed (especially the two weeks where the two main characters fall in love), and characters weren't well developed at all. Heck, one of the main characters barely resembles (both appearance- and personality-wise) the character in the book. *cough*Savannah Lynn Curtis*cough*. <br/><br/>That said, there were a couple of scenes where the dialogue was sweet and funny. I also enjoyed the music, but that may be because I'm a huge fan of acoustic. Also, the scenery was absolutely beautiful. Not to mention Channing Tatum's body (pretty much the only thing worth my money). <br/><br/>As far as acting goes, Channing Tatum was the stronger one in this film. While I'm still personally neutral about my opinion on Amanda Seyfried, I found she's done better. She may be better off with comedy or musicals. And Richard Jenkins was lovable, as always. <br/><br/>If you've read the book, don't expect anything similar to it. I can't point out a single scene that even resembled that of the book. Part II of the book, especially, was almost non-existent. You will definitely be able to pick out the noticeable differences between the book and the film. Hopefully, you won't be TOO disappointed.<br/><br/>But like I said, you're more likely to enjoy the film if you haven't read the book."
"Boe-mari","1","19","26","30 April 2014"," This film only made me angry.
","I have read many reviewers that say that they have never written a review before, but they had to because of some movie that they really loved or hated. I have hated a lot of movies, I do not hate this one, but I rally really really did not like it. In fact I disliked it so much that I had to write a review. <br/><br/>So. <br/><br/>(NB! This review contains SPOILERS, do not continue reading if you do not want to know what happens. )<br/><br/>This movie absolutely made no sense at all. <br/><br/>The only good part was the emotional scene with John and his father, otherwise this was just completely crap. I mean, what? What happened?!? <br/><br/>For starters, as a man who has worked in the military for several years, if you find yourself in a combat situation where someone is firing bullets at you, you NEVER just stand straight up like John did when he got shot! Yes he was hurt during a combat situation and that is sad, but did it have to happen like that? It was just so meaningless! <br/><br/>And WHY did she even break it off? I didn't understand it, the explanation was just so lame! I can understand that she wanted to be there for Tim and Allan, but we never got any indication that there were any romantic feelings there, so why marry the guy? Couldn't she just BE there, without the marriage? <br/><br/>Looking at the film as a whole, the character development was nearly non-existent and I never cared for any of the characters. The script was bad and the time jumps were even worse. It was hard to keep up with how many years had gone by, and the story just made no sense.<br/><br/>As a side note I also find it highly unlikely that she did not know what happened with Johns dad. I will say it again: none of this made any sense!<br/><br/>I have been in a long distance relationship where my man was employed in the army and shipped off to distant and terrifying places. I never knew what was happening and I was always scared for him. This was 4-5 years ago, and I was hoping that this film would touch upon some of the things that I felt, and that I know my honey felt. But ""Dear John"" just did not cut it! They did not capture any real emotions (except maybe the scene with John and his dad), and I am deeply disappointed. <br/><br/>I am a movie-crier, I cry a lot when I see emotional films, but THIS film only made me angry with all the lost potential. This was just not worth seeing. My review had more emotions than this film. <br/><br/>1/10, and really not recommended at all."
"claudio_carvalho","3","45","69","20 September 2010"," Disappointing Soap-Opera
","In the spring of 2001, the Sergeant of the Special Forces John Tyree (Channing Tatum) meets the medical student Savannah Curtis (Amanda Seyfried) while surfing in Charleston during his leave and they immediately fall in love for each other. They spend a couple of weeks together and Savannah meets John's autistic father Mr. Tyree (Richard Jenkins) and John befriends her friend Tim Wheddon (Henry Thomas). When the enlistment period of John and his platoon ends, there are the attacks on the World Trade Center and John and the other soldiers decide to reenlist for two more years. John corresponds with Savannah until she stops writing and two months later, Savannah tells that she will get married. <br/><br/>I had great expectations with ""Dear John"", based on the previous works of the Swedish director Lasse Hallström. The beginning is nice, with Amanda Seyfried and Channing Tatum showing great chemistry in a pleasant romance. The reenlistment of John Tyree is acceptable based on a troubled moment of his country. However, the attitude of Savannah getting married with an older guy without any motive is inconsistent with her conservative profile and incoherent with the whole plot, and destroys the so far good romance, turning into a silly and disappointing soap opera. The terrible commercial last scene is corny and awful. My vote is three.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil):""Querido John"" (""Dear John"")"
"The_Fifth_Echo","8","94","157","30 January 2010"," A True Pearl.
","I saw ""Dear John"" at a special screening and I wasn't expecting much. I thought it was going to be a decent romance film. I hoped this movie came halfway as good as ""The Notebook"". My very low expectations of this film were pretty cynical. But I said Hey, what could happen? And when the movie finished, I was fulfilled. I didn't think it was going to be one of the best romance movies ever and it definitely wasn't. This movie is definitely for couples. The girls will like it cause they can connect with it.I recommend for everyone to see this film. It is touching, okay acting, and it does stick to the book. This film doesn't come close to the ""Notebook"", but people will like it no matter what. So if you want to buy a sad, romantic film. Then I'd recommend this film.<br/><br/>7/10 A Pearl"
"xodramaQueen","6","90","153","6 February 2010"," Disappointing and not what I expected.
","I was really looking forward to watching this movie - although, my expectations were not very high - but it turned out to be worse than I expected. I knew Channing Tatum was not the greatest actor - although, he is gorgeous - so I wasn't expecting very good acting. It was decent but I just didn't feel the chemistry between the two actors. The ""twist"" which I won't mention was where I thought the movie went completely downhill. It was very poorly executed and if you've seen the movie, you'll probably agree. Throughout, the movie was very slow- moving and not very exciting but there were a couple emotional parts! So far, the only people I've asked that did like the movie, seem to be the younger ones (12-15). <br/><br/>This movie is definitely NOT comparable to ""The Notebook"" like some people have been saying. It was nothing special, so I wouldn't watch it again, but I'd say it's good for a chick flick night. Another one of those movies like that looked SO much better on the commercials."
"the-movie-guy","6","34","56","5 February 2010"," Heartbreaking consequences as a result of war
","(Synopsis) Special Forces Army Sergeant John Tyree (Channing Tatum) is home on a two-week leave from Germany. He meets Savannah (Amanda Seyfried) after he dives into the ocean to retrieve Savannah's purse that had fallen off the pier. John is smitten by Savannah and falls in love at first sight. Savannah is a college student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She is on spring break and is helping build a house for Habitat for Humanity. John joins in with Savannah to help build the house. Along the way a budding romance occurs, and Savannah falls deeply in love with John. As she is about to go back to college, she promises to write John overseas during the next 12-months until he returns to her after completing his enlistment. Their love is put to the test when John reenlists after the 9/11 attack.<br/><br/>(My Comment) ""Dear John"" tells the story of what happens to young lovers when time and distance from each other begins to test their true love. Over the next several years, they write love letters to each other telling everything about themselves. As time goes by, Savannah finds another who needs her more than John, even though she still loves him. She writes John a final letter saying good-bye. This is one story that happened many times during WWII and is still happening to our current soldiers today. Our brave soldiers are sacrificing their lives and some of them come home to heartbreaking consequences as a result of the war. That is why this story seems so real to the audience. The movie will make you laugh, cry, smile, and relate to the characters. Women will like the movie, because they can stand in Savannah's shoes. Men will like it, because they know that it is better to have loved and lost then never to have loved at all. The story is truly touching with all of life's ups and downs. Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried are very good in their roles, along with Richard Jenkins as John's father. (Screen Gems, Run Time 1:45, Rated PG-13) (6/10)"
"astevensaz","4","45","81","6 February 2010"," Movie ruins the great story the book portrays
","Having read this story a while ago I was very excited to see the movie. I read the book again. It is one of my favorite Nicholas Sparks books. What I think what makes the story is the relationships. That was the down point for me in the movie because I think the relationships were poorly expressed in the movie. I have no idea what the point of changing main characters roles (Tim's and Alan's characters). The movie didn't at all capture John and Savannah's relationship. Maybe if you haven't read the book you might like this movie, but I thought it was so dull compared to the book. I thought Channing was a great pick for John,but I had a feeling he was going to bring all young adults out to watch it, so I think it was more geared towards them. The ending cuts the whole point of the book out so I was also unhappy with that. I was hoping the movie was more like the notebook or a walk to remember and the way they captured the books. I do feel like I wasted a Friday night out and 10 bucks on a sappy love story, not at all the story I was expecting to see."
"Dragoneyed363","6","45","82","5 February 2010"," Compelling and endearing, though some things definitely just don't click at times...
","I had mixed expectations when I was going in to see Dear John. I had never really given any thought about how good or bad it might be, because it was a night out with friends and I was unconcerned at the moment. Eventually, we started to watch the movie. At first, it was just dull. I mean, I know it was trying to build up the characters and establish a good story line, but I was a tad bit uninterested, just because the characters were so plain at the time. Though it does set up things rather well, it lacks in any really high appeal from the moment it comes on the screen, if that makes sense.<br/><br/>Anyway, on to the rest of the movie. Though there were times when I was very interested, it just overall was nothing special. The performances by each individual actor were extremely questionable. For instance, Channing Tatum was unable to display any real sense of emotion except for maybe two scenes in the entire movie, and Amanda Seyfried seemed like it was just too big of a role for her to play. While they both didn't do so hot separately, I have to say the chemistry between them when they were on set together was believable, intense and undeniably noteworthy; Certainly the best thing about the movie, in my opinion.<br/><br/>I do give Dear John a decent and satisfactory rating for it really strived to be a poignant and strong film, even though it fell a little short, and I was moved at times by the feelings Channing and Amanda expressed into their characters, though all together their performances were eh. It was interesting and entertaining, and I enjoyed it... lightly. With all that said, it again falls short of being rewatchable with it's extreme dullness throughout and lack of powerful, independent, likable performances. Not anything special, but certainly not anything bad, and I recommend you don't watch it with high expectations, because you'll be very disappointed, but if you're not an extreme critic and you're just looking to blow some time, or are extremely hard up for Channing Tatum shirtless, you can and will enjoy this in some way."
"Der_Schnibbler","1","104","207","4 February 2010"," The Poor Man's ""Notebook""
","I suspect this board will soon be full of comments from over-emotional people praising ""Dear John"" as a ""pearl"" and a ""rollercoaster ride"" and all the other vacuous words this film's target audience typically employs.<br/><br/>I am most definitely not this film's target audience, but I do not dislike romantic dramas either, as long as they are well made, so here is my objective take on the flick.<br/><br/>It is not good.<br/><br/>It's not a bad movie either. But the plot meanders, development stagnates where it should've been moving forward (right around the middle, to be precise), and as for the ending...it almost felt as if they had run out of ideas so they suddenly said, ""Hey, let's just film a last scene real quick, put some sentimental string soundtrack over it, and end it that way."" Even Amanda Seyfried's beauty could not save this. Channing Tatum too gave a good performance, but you can only do so much with a flawed script.<br/><br/>Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy. From the smokey voiced, irritatingly high-pitched female folk singer schtick (surely chosen to appeal to the majority of college-age girls that will go see this movie) to the overused ""shimmering strings and piano"" combo, it only annoys anyone paying more attention to the film as a whole rather than to his own ""feelings."" The film has a good beginning and the major conflict that launches us into the second act were all promising. So was part of the second act itself, as the story unfolded. Then the film just dropped the ball. Beyond that, I'd have to give spoilers.<br/><br/>""Dear John"" is not a bad movie, but it doesn't work as it should either. If you want to see a truly moving film about prolonged love waiting to be reunited, go watch ""Notebook,"" which was truly superb."

","The movie starts in spring 2001. A soldier named John Tyree (Channing Tatum) falls in love with college student Savannah Cutis (Amanda Seyfried) while on break. Within the space of two weeks they fall madly in love with each other (!). But he has to go off to war and she has to go to college. They do but keep in touch by writing to each other. Then 9/11 happens. He wants to reenlist--she wants him to stay home. What will they do? <br/><br/>Hysterically bad romantic drama. The leads ARE attractive--Tatum is certainly a handsome man with beautiful green eyes and a hot body (he's introduced walking shirtless out of the water after surfing)...but he can't act. Seyfried is a beautiful woman and she tries...but the dialogue here is horrible. When I saw it me and a friend of mine were fighting hard NOT to laugh out loud at some of the ""romantic"" dialogue at the beginning. It was just HORRIBLE. For the first hour or so I was either bored by the ridiculously predictable drama or amused by the horrendous ""romance"". Then, after that first hour, tragedy kicks in and, I must admit, had me in tears. However the filmmakers go out of their way to make sure that you're crying with death, funerals and meetings with people breaking down in tears. How can you NOT cry? This would have worked if the acting were better. Tatum's face never changes expression--not ONCE! He always had a blank look on his face. Seyfried was a LITTLE better but not much. To make it worse Tatum and Seyfried had no sexual chemistry on screen at all! They barely looked like they liked each other let alone love each other. There was some beautiful photography of the Carolinas but this is a boring and stupid romantic ""drama"". A 1 all the way...and I usually love silly romantic dramas like this!"

So I read the book and I have to say, that I liked the movie much more. I guess I would be the only one here to say this.. I admit, the relationship between John and his father is described in more details in the book and that makes it more touching, but I also understand that the movie cant be as descriptive as a book. And also I have to add, that I loved both Channing and Amanda in their roles, they acted great, no, they were Perfect! I was really surprised they got such bad reviews on their acting here... So I give it 10/10 and I made this one of the most romantic movies I have ever seen."

Tatum should stick to what hes good at, movies that are more about his physical ability, albeit horrible, like GI JOE, step up, and Fighting. The less he talks the better.<br/><br/>Try not to think of me as a jaded hater of Channing Tatum I went in to this movie with an open mind, because I've been surprised many a time by the likes of Adam Sandler in Reign over Me.

","John Tyree (Channing Tatum) is on leave from the U.S.Army's special forces. It is the summer of 2001 and he has returned to his father (Richard Jenkins) and home on the Carolina coast. On the beach one day, a group of young adults are horsing around and a purse falls in the ocean. It belongs to beautiful Savannah (Amanda Seyfried) and she is upset over its loss. Without hesitation, John dives into the water, finds it, and returns it to her. She is happy, although one of her companions, a male with an interest in Savannah, is less than content. Nevertheless, from that moment, the two begin a tentative relationship. John tells Savannah that he will be out of the army in about a year and asks that she wait for him. Although they only share a few kisses, the young couple are in love. However, they part, vowing to write to each other often. Complicating things is the fact that John's dad is autistic, relating poorly to the community, and so is the son of Savannah's attractive neighbor, Tim (Henry Thomas). Savannah communicates well with each of them but John does not. Then, 9/11 occurs and John feels he must re-enlist, knowing his unit needs him. On a very brief leave, Savannah and John spend a few precious hours together. But, then John is gone. What does their future hold? This is, surprisingly, a most lovely film and worthy of praise. A story that could have been melodramatic and trite is, instead, genuinely moving. The cast is quite nice, with Tatum and Seyfried making a fine couple, while Jenkins and Thomas deliver especially notable turns. The scenery, costuming, production values, and Nicholas Sparks' tale are good as well. Most importantly, Hallstrom ""mixes things up"" and uses some very interesting camera shots and scene arrangements to deliver a film of great style. Dear viewer, don't think this is another teen flick with little to offer for the general public. On the contrary, most fans of romantic drama will find it enthralling."
"g-se","1","16","28","2 July 2012"," Horrible Movie
","This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Not because of the actors but the plot. You have a decent young man who joined the military and turned his life around. He decided to continue to serve after 9/11 even though he really didn't want to do it. Also, it was a stretch to believe that he didn't know that there was a problem with his father.<br/><br/>You have a extremely selfish woman who decides that she can't deal being alone and marries someone who needs someone to looks after his kid when he dies. How pathetic. I noticed some people liked the book this was adapted from. Get a life, if the book was the same then I feel sorry for you."
"icecrmman25","1","9","14","22 September 2010"," Worst. Adaptation. Ever.
","Uh, to be fair, I read the book. So I know going in books are generally more descriptive then the movie, limited time frame and all. I didn't read the Notebook, but I thought the movie was fantastic, so I guess it could be said that had I not read Dear John, I would have liked the movie. Whatever. All that said, I believe this is the worst book-to-movie adaptation ever. Period. Seyfried was pretty good, the guy who played John's dad, Richard Jenkins I think, was the best actor. Channing Tatum was passable. Ugh. This adaptation was like studying for the NCLEX: No part of the movie had anything to do with what happened in the book. The only things that the book and movie had in common was John breaking Tim's nose into 10 pieces, and the letter Savannah wrote. That's it, that's the list. I was angry 15 minutes in, and I saw it on cable. I said ""worst adaptation ever,"" and there was still an hour and a half left. I threw up in my mouth. The final 'eff you' to all the people who read the book was the end, when John and Savannah got back together. Tragic. My life is worse after seeing this. I never saw Ishtar, but somewhere Elaine May just popped open a bottle of Dom. This had all the plot and foresight of Ernest goes to jail, only without the comedic value. Nicholas Sparks probably wept blood like vampire Bill after Sookie kicked him out of her house after watching the first draft of this movie. If you read the book, don't watch this movie. If you watched this movie, may God have mercy on your soul. Good evening."
"tavm","9","10","16","10 March 2010"," Lasse Hallstrom's adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' Dear John was a very compelling drama to me
","Just watched this touching drama based on Nicholas Sparks' novel with my movie theatre working friend this afternoon. While I haven't previously seen any movies based on his other books, nor any of director Lasse Hallstrom's other films (other than segments of ABBA videos shown on ""The Midnight Special""), I knew they both had a reputation of doing quiet dramas based on believable situations and characterizations. So I was looking forward to this tale of an Army man named John (Channing Tatum) falling for a college girl named Savannah (Amanda Seyfried). There were also some compelling supporting characters in John's father (Richard Jenkins) and a neighbor friend of Savannah's named Tim (Henry Thomas, who can still deliver years after his breakthrough as Elliott in E.T.). Now, I've only just found out about the changes from the novel but while watching the movie I was emotionally enthralled by the whole thing and, for the most part, I was satisfied by what I saw. Also, how cool was it to see Ms. Seyfried sing and play guitar to her own composition here especially after her recent stint in Mamma Mia! And how dramatic were those battle scenes not to mention the fate of John's father. So for all that, Dear John comes highly recommend."
"stephenrtod","4","24","47","5 February 2010"," Disappointing
","I was looking forward to seeing two bright young actors appearing in ""Dear John,"" but it was very slow moving; and I felt that both the screenplay and the direction hampered the flexibility of the principle performers. I usually do enjoy film adaptations of these novels. Ironically, I did think the movie did an excellent job of depicting realistic military action.<br/><br/>The cinematography was very good at segueing through love letters, focusing just enough on a key word or phrase in each letter. I felt that Channing Tatum became bogged down in what became a very ""hang-dog"" series of expressions in response to loss."

But the plot is as thin as a used tissue & about as useful. It is beyond my comprehension that this thing which seems like it was written by a prepubescent girl for an English class essay...complete with horses & dialog to match...was funded & actually became a #1 movie. I can only imagine that investors were counting on the war element to draw crowds and, sadly, their deception worked. <br/><br/>Every cheap, implausible, laughably foolish romantic element from beginning to end was used in this maudlin mess & all the many plot holes filled with sugar & spice & no charm, grace, style or writing ability at all.<br/><br/>Save your money & two hours of your life & just buy a can of sweet corn.

","Dear John does what it sets out to do, be an effective romantic little film in my opinion. I really enjoyed how they developed the relationship between Tatum and Seyfriend. It felt real and it really hit home for me, because It felt like true love to me. Some movie buffs might find this movie to be too corny or rather contrived, but I'm a sucker for some good romance, a rare bird as far as guys go. The story was very well done, and held my attention throughout. But what really made the movie for me was the chemistry between Tatum and Seyfried. Channing isn't the world's greatest actor, but he showed a lot of promise here. I also found the war scenes to be quite realistic and well done, even if there wasn't very many. I went into Dear John. Thinking it was gonna be your typical Romdrama that they seem to put out these days. To my surprise it's fairly intelligent, romantic, and wonderfully emotional, I enjoyed my time with it.<br/><br/>Performances. Channing Tatum still has work to do, but he was actually solid here for the most part. He had a few wooden moments, with that somewhat annoying blank expression on his face, but his effort was clearly there. He's growing up. Amanda Seyfried is delightful in her role. We are able to feel for her character, and become very attracted to her charming ways. She was especially good near the end. Richard Jenkins was the heart of the movie for me. His autistic performance was truly a sight to behold, and I really did feel for him. His hospital moment with Tatum was heartbreaking and heartfelt. Henry Thomas is excellent as the goodhearted, yet Weaslish Tim.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Dear John was a very pleasant surprise for me. It's just a very nice romantic movie, that I think even guys like me could get into, if in the right frame of mind. Grab your wife, girlfriend, or whatever love interest you have, and enjoy.<br/><br/>8/10"

","When producers refuse to screen a film for critics it's because they know they've made a turd and that the reviews will be sooo bad that they'll decrease the opening gross. This obnoxious trend of refusing to screen films for critics can be exploited by you, dear viewer, in order to avoid wasting your money on sheer garbage like this. Films that aren't screened for critics should be avoided like the plague!!! Don't say you weren't warned. This film is a bad sequel to an equally bad remake of a book that honestly wasn't that great to begin with.

","Based on a recommendation I went to see this movie a few hours ago. Have to say it captured the pain of love with someone who is on active duty in the military - commitment, not only to to your loved one but your duty as a serviceman in a time of peril.<br/><br/>The theme of commitment runs in 3 paths - to one's loved one, to one's duty and to those whose family members need care.<br/><br/>I thought it was a beautiful movie and in staying for the credits (a trick that a friend of mine, a movie connoisseur, taught me) - co-star Amanda Seyfried is multi-talented having sung in some of the movie's soundtracks.<br/><br/>One of the posters here expressed disappointment in the movie; having read the book. Each to his own, my opinion is certainly no better or worse than the others, but in my humble opinion, movies based on best selling books rarely run in perfect parallel; those movies that do follow a book 100% in the screenplay can be disappointing (Flags of our Fathers is one example for me).<br/><br/>I think most people would enjoy the movie."

","""Dear John"" is a Romance - Drama movie in which we watch a US Army Special operations soldier who returned home for a couple of weeks and is going to return back to his base, falling in love with a conservative college student. After they spend these weeks together he leaves and they agree to keep in touch and write to each other. He plans not to sign up again and return back home but 9/11 changes that.<br/><br/>I didn't like this movie because it neither had a well-written script nor an interesting plot. The movie failed to cover the plot holes that they were created and it also failed to capture and maintain the interest of the audience. Another thing that I didn't like in this movie was the wrong projection of autism something that I found very irritating. Despite that, I want to say that the interpretation of Channing Tatum who played as John Tyree was good and equally good was the interpretation of Richard Jenkins who played as Mr. Tyree.<br/><br/>To sum up, I have to say that ""Dear John"" is a bad movie with a poor and boring plot that don't make an effort of maintaining the interest of the audience if there was any. In addition to this, it was considered that projecting a very serious subject like autism it will gain more reputation and more people will go to watch it, something that I find horrible. I don't recommend this movie to anyone and make yourself a favor and don't waste your time watching it."
"cavemanben","1","11","20","5 February 2010"," Awful...please stop funding this machine.
","My wife and I both loved the notebook, I owned it and loved it before I even met my wife. She still makes fun of me for that. I have read two Nick Sparks novels, The Guardian and the Rescue so I know this man can write some great sentimental love stories.<br/><br/>Started off great, some laughs, some tears, the relationship with his Dad was really cool. Overall the movie was pretty slow and I got a little restless about hour and 20 minutes in.<br/><br/>As soon as you find out who she marries, everything this movie had going for it flew right out the window. I have no idea how you can identify with it after that or connect with her character at all. Just awful. The movie invites you into what you think is a typical girl, who can't hang with a warrior, and calls reliable Jodie back home who she knows won't die or leave her unexpectedly. But as the viewer I hoped to see a good ending to that sad reality. Instead not only my wife and I, but literally the entire theater started laughing and sighing at the close of the film. It was quite a sight, but refreshing to see that i wasn't surrounded by people who had been fooled by such an awful story that ended with...what?

Let me tell you how bad it is: my friend who always cries at movies got to the part that was meant to evoke tears, and she laughed so hard we thought she was crying!

"ironhorse_iv","5","3","4","25 May 2015"," Dear John, I'm breaking up with you. You're too mediocre.
","Dear Viewer, I have to tell you the truth. I'm starting to think that author, Nicolas Spark is one-trick pony. There are tons of Spark's novels that get the cinematic treatment and they all mostly look like the same. He's essentially writing the same story over and over. Dear John is a great example of this. This movie doesn't stands out more than the others. You'll see a lot of his tropes, here, like settling in Carolinas, love letters, kissing in the rain, and most of all, somebody ends up, dying from some type of disease or disaster. This movie seems like a carbon copy of his earlier books. It's the Poor Man's ""Notebook"". Don't get me wrong, I still love author Nicolas Spark, and I love some of his novels, but I just wish, he wasn't so lazy. Some of his works, is becoming very repetitive. I want to see, something new from him. Not this. Directed by Lasse Hallström, the movie tells the romantic story of a soldier, John Tyree (Channing Tatum) who falls for a conservative college student, Savannah Curtis (Amanda Seyfried), while he's home on leave. Instead of getting out of the military when his time is up, John re-enlists after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, out of civic duty. The long distance between them is shortened through a series of love letters they send to each other, but the time spent apart also begins to wear on their relationship. Can their relationship last, or will the years of separation, pull them apart? Watch the movie if you dare to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, the first thing to I like to say, is that, I really don't buy into these two characters being in love with each other. They don't seem believable. First off, they rarely spent any time, together. Technically, they only spent two weeks together, out of many long years, apart. That's pretty sad. Second off, the chemistry between Amanda Seyfried and Channing Tatum is pretty dull. Not only is, Channing Tatum's character kinda boring, Tatum delivers line, so wooden, that it's hard to believe, that Savannah loves him, anything else than his looks. Clearly, she didn't fall in love with him, due to his personality or morals. I don't blame her, Tatum does provides plenty of eye candy for the women and gay men, I suppose. Amanda Seyfried's character seem to have, more to do, than Tatum's character. She seem like a more well-rounded character. I like that she had emotional depth. I also love that Seyfried, not only act, better. She also sang, a song in the film, call ""Little House'. Still, I don't buy into the fact that her character; Savannah is so selfless that she would marry a dying man that she doesn't love, due to pity. It seemed kinda ludicrous to me. That's way, over the top. At least, Savannah and John didn't cross the line with regards to fidelity in marriage. I'm glad, they resisted, in committing adultery. As a romantic movie, it is expected that Dear John may include some sexual content. However, the sex scenes are pretty tame. The violence in the film wasn't too bad. It barely show anything, graphic. After all, it's late 2000's PG-13. Not 1990's PG-13. The War on Terror subplot is questionable, at best. The movie doesn't dig deep into the political debate, about the war. It just serves as a backdrop. I spent the better part of this film, wondering, why John was serving in the first place. The movie portrays John as going to war, as his civil duty, but in the books, it's more about him, trying to help pay all the medical bills of his dying autistic father (Richard Jenkins). In many ways, it's confusing, but genuinely interesting. Was John doing this, for his autistic father or his country? We might never know. However, this bring one of the movie's most touching scenes when John reads his hospitalized father a letter. I love the coin twist. One thing that I really didn't get about the movie, is how only letters can be sent to John. The film screenwriter, Jamie Landen try to justify it, by just saying that he's in some far off desolate places where they don't have email, or phone calls, but I really doubt it. Most servicemen out there in Afghanistan, are able to receive emails or phone calls, easy; just like that. Yes, it's limited, but I really doubt, John wasn't able to talk more to Savannah than he was given. It seem a bit forced. Another problem with the film is the pacing. At 1 hour and 42 minutes, Dear John isn't that long, but it does drag at times. Then there's the big change toward the end that really anger me. The book ending is pretty alright, but the movie's happy ending is down-right sell-out. Honestly, the alternate ending seems more true to the spirit of the story. Overall: With more heartwarming and memorable love stories already captured on film, Dear John runs the risk of being forgotten, over time and I think it has."

"myroseblooms","5","8","16","4 February 2010"," Good, not great,--turn in the story was not well executed
","First off, the scenery was gorgeous, lots of beach and marshland, just like I love, and plenty of hanging Spanish moss, palm trees and blue sky. However, the story itself left me cold. There is a turn in the story that makes NO sense to me--though this could be because of Amanda Seyfried playing a cute, tiny little blond with long curling locks and big eyes--she was fine in something like 'Mama Mia', which was more like a fairy tale, but she failed to show the acting chops needed to explain the story angle presented. Lots of folks put down the choice of Channing Tatum for the soldier's role, but actually, he did quite well. I live in a city with a large Army base, and he reminded me of SO many soldiers I've met. No, he's not a big talker. Yes, he's got some issues in is past, but basically he's a good guy. I think Richard Jenkins as his father, played with a big dose of autism (maybe Aspergers Syndrome), was fantastic. We have more than one child in my family with this and he got the characterization right on the nose. Tatum played John with just the right amount of masculinity--he was strong, passionate (without being oversexed,), tender when he needed to be, but no wuss--and when his heart was broken, he showed a kind of manly grief that tore me up, that really touched me. Amanda Seyfried's sorry-ass hysterics when he confronts her later, well, was unconvincing and called up NO sympathy at all--maybe because I'm not a guy overwhelmed by her prettiness, but to me, the acting was awful. People around me were weeping left and right,and I just wanted to grab her and shake her 'til her teeth rattled. The ending is changed from the book, but it doesn't make the movie any better for me. This 'eternal love' story just didn't work, and left me feeling sorry for John, but irritated and angry with Savannah."
"Geff","10","9","19","14 February 2010"," Been there... and a comment on the DEAR JOHN film reviews
","I went to see Dear John just to see if they caught the emotion involved with this sort of thing. Mine occurred in 1969, and it is still sometimes painfully disturbing to me. The film caught the intense youthful attraction, the relationship that can develop in a short period of time before deployment, the love that resists separation, but only for so long, the intense feeling of loyalty for comrades that you've trained with and fought with, the addition of the 9/11 country-at-war component into his decision to reenlist, and the painful solitary existence suffered by a youthful female waiting and living only by letters and consequently driving her to another relationship, despite her love for her soldier. ""Frailty, thy name be woman."" (Shakespeare) As to many of the comments, I can say to the negative ones, I saw the film and disagree. The film was right-on. I don't care ever about comparing a book to a movie. You can't compare apples and oranges. One should judge a film for its making and its cast and acting. The book is the book, and the film is the film. I'll give you an example of the reverse, a bad book made into a classic film. The Graduate is a classic film that broke many Hollywood moulds and was superb as a film. As a book, however, it was cheesy and redundant and, in my opinion, poorly written. So, one should judge a film solely on its merits, not on a comparison to a book. It is not a legitimate judgment, nor does it make for a legitimate review. The only time I would include a book in a review is if the filmmaker leaves out a detail in the film that is included in the book, and it is a necessary component to understand the meaning of the film or the outcome of the film. For example, the ending of 2001 A Space Odyssey, was completely unintelligible to the ordinary viewer if one had not read the book. That was a major flaw that affected one's ability to understand and enjoy the film. This is an example of when the book can be introduced into a film's review. Dear John was a perfectly clear and understandable film. There's one more thing. Some of the male lead's (Channing Tatum's) detractors said in lengthy reviews that his acting was abysmal. I thought he was accurate in his portrayal of a young soldier living with the thought of imminent combat or deployment to a lonely and difficult assignment anywhere in the world. Also, his father stole the joy of life from him, and not intentionally. He, as an actor, portrayed that perfectly. I have never seen nor heard of him before, and I've never seen his prior work, but he was right-on for the character he played. Why do reviewers waste their time comparing films to the book? It is not a legitimate component of a review other than what I mentioned. Please don't waste your time and mine with comments like, ""The book was much better."" Who cares?! Dear John is a very good film."

I was upset that they chose Amanda Seyfried for his leading lady because she is ugly and I thought she wasn't ideal to play Channing's woman. But, she is a pretty good actress and even though she isn't that attractive her nurturing qualities came off well in this movie, and it made you like her. I was so happy for Channing's acting in the film. I think this movie will put him on the map as a good actor. His emotional connections to the characters were evident in his acting skills, and you were cheering for him the whole movie! You see a sweet sensitive side to him that is lacking in Step Up, Gi Joe, and Stop Loss. There were a couple of things that were different from the book, so if you're real stuck on the movie flowing exactly like the book, you might be a little upset.

","Dear John was an excellent movie and I'm so going to watch this again, again.<br/><br/>Firstly, I hope its box office no.1 as I think it deserves to be and stay there for a good few weeks. I'm all for romance especially a good one and don't listen to the critics but judge for yourself, as they don't seem to have a clue when it comes to this movie.<br/><br/>I'm not going to give a background synopsis, just watch this movie.<br/><br/>However, having read the book plus watched Channing Tatum in A Guide To Recognizing Your Saints and Stop Loss, truly amazing performances plus roles that are more recent. I was interested to see how he would play John and I was not disappointed. He was fantastic, solid range = great chemistry with Amanda Seyfried.<br/><br/>Richard Jenkins as John's father outstanding performance give him an Oscar now.<br/><br/>Especially at the hospital with John and everyone was crying buckets. I lost the amount of times I cried but that's how excellent this movie truly was. I don't cry for all romantic movies not even for the Notebook, which was amazing, but I cried for this movie. It was bad as in Michael Jackson bad that means excellent people.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum doesn't get enough credit for his movies but I know with this movie it puts him on another level, whether the critics like it or not his fans old and new have seen a different acting range from him and I loved it.<br/><br/>There are variations from the book which is to be expected as books tends to be played out differently in all movies and I'm smart enough separate the book and this movie. Which is why I enjoyed this movie so much and just thankful that it was given the opportunity to be on the big screen. Whether it's a Nicholas Sparks movie or not it's excellent.<br/><br/>If you hate this movie simply because it's not similar to the book then your mind is very closed and what a shame because you are missing out on an excellent movie which I know the ending is different but that was the point so we could all have a Dear John 2.<br/><br/>Nicholas Sparks always said that if this movie was a huge hit he would make another hence he gave his blessing for the end change. I strongly want to see Dear John 2 so I advice all fans of the book and movie to step up and make sure it's no. 1 which means watching again, again so I can have my Dear John 2.<br/><br/>An excellent movie should not be pushed aside because of the critics or a small amount of haters of the book or movie.<br/><br/>See you all at the movies and appreciate the art of what all actors try to do for us the viewing public.<br/><br/>Go watch this movie it's not disappointing at all in terms of relationships and what you have to sacrifice when you join the army.<br/><br/>I admire anyone who joins the army and thanks for an excellent movie."

","the movie is boring and the love story is totally unoriginal and dumb. the dialogs are really bad. normal people don't talk in such a boring way. and there are lots of clichés in the movie, like- guy going into the army, girl waiting, sending letters, blah blah... i can't believe that the same guy made notebook. notebook was a really good movie, but this isn't. the main characters have no real character. the girl is blonde and perfect (except she curses sometimes in her head). and the anti-terrorism war as a main part in the movie is a complete fail. i can't sympathize with a guy who is going to kill ""the bad bad terrorists"" from another part of the world (if someone watched zeitgeist or another documentary, you will know what i mean). America was never in a war on their own territory, when someone really attacked them. but that's another story. they wanted to add some ""impossible love"" stuff in the movie, but they did it really bad- john didn't need to go to the army for more than 1 year and the girl didn't need to marry her friend because of his child. i mean, who is crazy to take such a big responsibility without need?! the kid could move to its family or something. she's not the only person in the world. i couldn't wait for the movie to end and i hoped they would both die."
"eighteenalways","8","4","8","9 February 2010"," A Romantics POV
","I must say that I would have to disagree with what I have read so far about this movie. I saw it on opening night and fell in love with it immediately. Tatum's character was more than likable and even though I could never imagine him falling for someone like Savannah as quickly as he did, it was charming and refreshing. And yes, it may have been a little dramatic at times but it was sweet and endearing. Finding ""love at first sight"" is rare, if it exists at all. But to see it on screen gives people like me, who revel in anything and everything about love, no matter how unrealistic or dramatic it may seem sometimes, hope that maybe life could play out like that. It was easy to escape into the lives of John and Savannah because they seemed so real; people I know and speak with every day remind me of them. And as quickly as it happened, it was easy to believe the two were in love. I never once thought ""Oh yeah, what a line."" or ""Who would write something like that?"". It flowed well and I was completely upset when the ending came. I wanted to know more about their lives and what would happen to them. Overall, I think this is a movie I will want to watch on rainy days. It's wonderful and heartbreaking all at the same time. And I would say definitely a must see for anyone who is as romantic as me."

","Never have I fallen asleep so many times during a movie. Perhaps it was my brain's defence mechanism, hoping to protect me from the cerebral poison of the worst kind of chick-flick, or perhaps my mind was attempting to kill itself, sending me to the suicide of sleep, but either way I fell asleep eight times during the film. I would have missed it entirely, but my wife kept nudging me awake to inform me that I was snoring loudly. The plot, if such a word is appropriate, was the ubiquitous boy-meets- girl, problem arises, obstacle is overcome, happy ending. How many times can they make this movie? I knew from five minutes in to the film what was going to happen and I had to repress the desire to turn around and address the audience, like a movie messiah, hollering that this film was a repeat, that the ending was proscribed, that we should immediately demand they change the reels and offer us another film in its place. However, in the insane world we live in, this kind of free speech is not considered appropriate, and instead I sat in silence, nodding in and out of the movie hell. Satre only believed that Hell was other people because he hadn't kept waking up in this movie. Like a bear hibernating through its first zoo winter, I wondered if I would ever be free of it. The protagonist is the incongruously named Channing Tatum. I would make a joke about that name, but it's funny enough in itself: Channing Tatum. What kind of drugs were his parents on? He is what I believe the average teenage girl would describe as a hunk and this is presumably why he was chosen for the role. It certainly could not be for his taciturn delivery and expressionless face. And let's face it, he looks good in a uniform — a real Action Man physique. Channing, or the 'John' of the title, is in the Special Forces, and travels the world's hot spots giving candy to children and shooting their parents. His squad have equally large necks and broad shoulders, and he is torn between his loyalty to them and his love for the female lead. Of course, that's a no-contest win for the girl, so then 9-11 is thrown in, and we have love of one's country versus the girl, and if that country is America, then the all-American hero just has to sign up for another two-year term, and deliver what to me was the only funny line in the film, ""I'm going to extend."" The actions of the plastercine beau, needless to say, peeves the female lead, Savannah, played by the woman with largest eyes in the world, Amanda Seyfried. Suffering the pangs of disprized love, she marries someone else, but we are later informed that this was only because he had cancer and his son was autistic –isn't that always the way? Tying this overcooked spaghetti together was the motif of epistolary love. After an initial two-week summer romance, the distant lovers commune through hundreds of heartfelt hand-written letters, since the American Special Forces don't have internet and it hasn't occurred to Amanda that she could write it on Word and then press print. The film could have inadvertently raised an important issue here though. I mean, could the Americans current military problems be due in part to their lack of a satellite broadband connection? It could help them with the jihadists and as well as eliminate time lags for these star-crossed lovers. However, it was nice to see the epistolary form rising from its eighteenth century ashes, and perhaps this bodes well for my recent novel, Letters from the Ministry, and its missive-writing protagonist, S Fox, who also eschews more modern forms of communication. Plugs aside, this was a truly awful movie, and I needed several pints to help me forget it, which I shall be billing to Messers Tatum and Seyfriend. ""Dear John, I love you"": Dear God, please help me."

","I first watched the trailer from this movie in January. I could not wait to watch it then realised it did not come out in cinemas in the U.K till Apil 14. So when i saw the competition on E4 I entered and won two free tickets to see it on April 12,i was so happy. I really enjoyed watching this film as it didn't drag out. I did read the book before watching the film and i could spot the things they changed or cut out.(And there were a few things)The film cut out most of part 2 but it still worked. (Personly i think they should have kept it in there.) All in all this is an amazing film with great performances by Channing Tatum(John) and Amanda Seyfried (Syvanna.)They make a convincing couple. If you like anything with Amanda or Channing in it then i advise you to watch this film and i hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"

Was hoping to see a film where karma slaps a lying skank upside the head for her unfaithfulness.<br/><br/>There's almost always an excuse when these kinds of skeevy women abandon their men while they risk their lives defending our nation.
Absolutely ruined this film when they invested so much time trying to portray the skeevy skank as a sympathetic figure who had 'good reasons' for her faithlessness.
All I wanted by the end of this film was a happy ending...
Something along the lines of the skank being the only victim of an ISIS kidnap/torture team. and her last thought, as she bled out from weeks of abuse, was the face of the soldier she abandoned."

","Nicholas Sparks writers another novel that was adapted for film production entitled Dear John.It stars Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried together with Henry Thomas and Richard Jenkins which tells the story of a romance between an idealistic woman and a male soldier who gets deployed at different places.Only the love letters they exchanged with each other starting ""Dear John"" sustained their romance.<br/><br/>John Tyree is a young soldier that is currently serving on the U.S. Army Special Forces.He is currently on leave on spring vacation.He meets and falls in love with a college students who is full of idealism named Savannah Curtis.Things start to become worrisome in their relationship when they could barely see each other due to John's increased overseas deployments.They sustained their romance by exchanging letters.But their inability to see each other led to fateful consequences with Savannah as she started seeing Tim.This was made painful when Tim was known to have a terminal disease.Savannah become married to Tim and took care of him until her husband died.In the end,we get to see John,who is no longer part of the army after his father suffered a stroke and now a civilian citizen,re-unite with Savannah.<br/><br/>Well,this was basically a romantic story wherein the viewers are treated to a U turn in the end when both lead romance couples John and Savannah had to go through with some respective incidents in their life before they could go through their happy romance in the end.Some may find it funny and a bad soap opera especially coming from Nicholas Sparks as viewers are normally treated with many of his novels that get adapted on film.But for others looking for a love story,they will definitely enjoy it especially those who are still hopeful in their relationships that have ended."

Felt it started a bit slow but liked the building tender relationship between John and Savannah. thought all the acting sensitive and not overly-dramatic. There were areas that could have been explored a bit more, quite a lot of big themes here that had to be whizzed through in under 2 hours, but the central one of John and Savannah was well, just purely romantic, in an old-fashioned way. I'm also not a great fan of overly-sugary endings targeted at the American market, but I don't think this was the case here. Having watched the alternate ending, felt the choice was right- enough to leave you thinking but more appropriate.

His son, an army man, proving that the army builds character and leads to maturity.

","Much better than the average score given here, in my opinion, Dear John is one of the rare movies that I started watching again as soon as it was over, mainly because I couldn't get enough of looking at Amanda Seyfried. She is such an attractive young woman in every way, but she kind of sneaked up on me. I thought that she was attractive when I first saw her, but that was an under-estimation on my part. Due to her unique and ultimately stunning looks and way of acting, talking and apparently feeling, I was completely captivated by her by the end of the movie. Somehow, over the course of the movie, she came to represent everything that I want in my life, and everything that is missing. (It probably didn't hurt--or yes, it did, hurt, I suppose--that she is as similar looking and acting to my first love as probably any woman I have ever seen on the screen). Anyway, solid movie, overall, and poignant love story, but Seyried absolutely stole it, and stole my heart in the process.

But, you know what, I actually liked ""Dear John"" and, what's more, I think that most of you will too. It has its problems, including an awkwardly-executed twist that leads the film into a murky second half, but the love story at its core is charming and its two leads, Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried, inject it with passion and electric chemistry that carry it even when its occasionally weak narrative does not. On top of that, one of my favorite working actors, the incredible Richard Jenkins, delivers a remarkable supporting performance that, though limited in duration, is packed with emotion and honesty. When the film is dissected beyond the superficial, one realizes that his character is just as integral, if not more so, to the plot than even Seyfried's, though she receives much more screen time.<br/><br/>Please Read My Full Review Here: www.the-last-review.blogspot.com"

They decide to pursue their long distance romance and he promises to leave the Army after a year. Alas, 9/11 occurs and he is forced to extend his service indefinitely.

","Dear John,<br/><br/>Romance is a bitch, ain't it? Especially when you don't hear from someone for longer than the usual duration, blaming the delay on everyone else except the sender, then the sledgehammer comes aimed squarely at your heart, smashing it to bits, and it had to be done when you least expected, without preparation, without a chance at attempting to put things right again.<br/><br/>Been there, done that my friend, although you did demonstrate you're a decent chap who can forgive and extend a helping hand toward someone who had essentially taken advantage of your situation given the pitiable situation. You're out there defending the notion of freedom for your country, and that's exactly how a countryman capitalizes on your absence. You're a soldier, so you'll probably know that all is fair in love and war, just too bad that you got on the losing end as you're fighting with one hand tied behind your back.<br/><br/>Hope you don't get stuck or conned again by another confused girl, but sometimes, once bitten we're still not twice shy, and we go into the same old, tried and tested loop again, don't we?<br/><br/>Your Friend, Stefan S<br/><br/>At least that would be my letter to John Tyree, a Special Forces GI Joe type which Channing Tatum seemed dangerously stereotyped to play, and the girls like Savannah Curtis (Amanda Seyfried) go gaga over when he plunges into the water to rescue her girlie bag which had dropped in. So boy meets girl by chance, they like each other, and spend the most incredible two weeks hanging out and declaring their affections before summer's over. It's like the opening shot in Grease, only that they take a pledge to keep one another in their minds, and write each other from miles away, since Mr Career Soldier is assigned a stint overseas, made worse with the events of 9/11, finding himself being torn between his lady love, and the call of duty to fight for freedom.<br/><br/>You've got to take your hats off to the novelist Nicholas Sparks, who can craft a romance as easy as spreading butter on toast, be it an elderly one (Nights in Rodanthe), or a teeny- bopper puppy first love between a quietly violent man and a teenage girl, both of whom do not know exactly what they want except to spend as much time with each other as possible, before they got to have to carry on with their lives. Peppered with enough romantic scenes in the first half such as stolen glances, the rain, the long walks on the beach and such, nothing's really gonna prepare you for the relatively more brutal, more realist development.<br/><br/>Characterization in this film was spent more on John I felt, than on Savannah. After all, we're following his story from the onset, and his relationship with his dad (played by the wonderful Richard Jenkins) had a lot more oomph than that between Savannah and her parents (very superficial), or even between the lovers themselves. There's a very thorough, meaningful and moving sub-story with regards to father and son's coin collection, which I deem as the ultimate highlight of the film, rather than the gimmicky sending and reading of letters back and forth across time and space, which other stories such as The Lake House had utilized.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book so I cannot comment on the ending if it stayed through, but the way it was delivered by Lasse Hallstrom, of the latest Hachiko fame, one would have thought that it would be planned in a better manner, rather than to rely on a convenient and somewhat abrupt finale that unfortunately in today's screening, the music wobbled at a critical point, making it all seem rather amusing rather than touching. At least the story steered clear of the usual romantic twists and as such keeping it fresh though safe, and tolerable rather than to roll your eyes at another clichÃ©. <br/><br/>Dear John has its moments, though I don't exactly call this one a date movie, unless you're watching this for the first half. Oh, and the way the lovers make love one fateful night was deemed too risquÃ© by the censors, so their recommendation to have it badly butchered was heeded if the distributors wanted a safer PG rating, to the groans of the female audience who were all anticipating more of Tatum's John (pardon the intentionally bad pun). So there. We can see blood spurting out of John's uniform when bullets pass through his shoulder, but we have a lower tolerance for love."

This movie really did take an emotional toll on me. Besides that the movie has a great cast I love both Amanda Seyfried and Channing Tatum and the rest of the cast also absolutely killed it. The soundtrack is also fantastic, I listened to ""Paperweight"" on loop for weeks after I watched it. Now lets talk about the plot. There are so many aspects to the story its not just about a couple's relationship with each other theres also their relationship with their families and their friends and their careers and their passions. There are so multiple plot twists that I personally didn't see coming at all. They also do a great job of portraying autism, I personally have family members have been diagnosed with autism and I think this movie shows it very accurately.

"Raptorclaw155","4","0","0","5 May 2020"," A Worse Knockoff of The Notebook
","Since The Notebook was popular and is a genuinely well-made film, of course that means the doors are blown open to lesser films being rushed out to try to capitalize on the new big thing.<br/><br/>I don't know if Dear John is the worst of these clone films, but it is strikingly lacking. This has mostly to do with the film having a lack of focus on themes and characters in particular. There are conflicts that go barely developed before they are suddenly and unceremoniously resolved and completely dropped as if they never happened and leaving little-to-no effect on the overall story. There are characters that are introduced that seem completely unnecessary; specifically, there is a character you meet in the very beginning of the film which, as soon as I saw him I thought to myself, ""he dies off camera, doesn't he?"" and as it turns out, I was right. Does his character mean anything at all to the film or characters and their development? No. You can erase most of the characters in this film from it and not miss any of the substance of the story. It simply feels like so much fluff- and the weird bait-and-switch in the introduction makes the film feel so unfocused.<br/><br/>The one thing I can say that does get, at least, some respectable amount of development in this film is the relationship between John and his father but, again, it's kind of filler- fairly inconsequential.<br/><br/>There's also this strange fixation this film has with people with autism- sometimes framing it as something cute which seemed a bit offputting to me. And as you can probably guess now, it has no bearing on the story or characters' development whatsoever.<br/><br/>There's a whole thing where John's past is brought up where we are told that he used to be pretty rough and violent but that goes completely unexplored. We are only told these things, but John is perfect now because he's in the military and he only lashes out on people who deserve it so it's alright. This one opportunity the film has to develop a character where we can see them grow and change into better version of themselves goes wasted. I guess it's good enough to have the big buff guy to squint his eyes a little and say that he has a dark past and expect that to be development enough for the intended audience demographic? Honestly, that's kind of insulting.<br/><br/>The problem with this film is that there is no reason to be invested in these characters and their relationship. They are both perfect, despite being told that they have their issues, those issues are never portrayed in their character- it's only talked about- and that does not make for interesting characters. At that point it doesn't really matter how good or bad the acting is, the characters have no real reason to change because all that changed happened before the film takes place.<br/><br/>All that said, the film isn't terrible. At worst it's pure chick-flick schlock and it could be worse than that. I would still recommend The Notebook over this, but I guess if you want a similar scenario of two lovers pulled apart by forces outside their control, and don't mind it being more contrived and fan fiction-esque, this is a film to consider. At the very least, it left me craving lasagna."

Annoying is a better word for that. The ""twist"" seemed so clichÃ©. ""how can I be mad it was a guy I actually like."" the movie is literally titled Dear John to reflect how many the experience of receiving a Dear John is supposed to be, and to give some insight. All it seemed to show was that while he is away, getting shot at and serving 8(?) years over seas, she's struggling with independence. Seemed accurate when they made the point of showing she signed a letter as ""always"", since that's how most of those start anyway. Then reality sets in, or so this movie portrays. I'm sure there are stories like this one out there, but I could have done without this one."

","It is tough to adapt a Teen adult romantic novel (just ask Twilight) but the problem with Dear John- which is a Nicholas Sparks novel is that there just isn't a great deal of emotional quotient to invest in. The pacing is uneven and the translation from book to screen is hampered by an uneven flow and pacing issues. Another factor is that the main leads Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried spend more time away from each other corresponding through letters and voice overs than with each other. The middle act is a drag and the third act somehow manage to shift the film's genre from romance to drama with all the focus on Tatum's character in Afghanistan and his relationship with his father. Dear John is a miss in many ways."

","Okay sooo... I've watched this movie because my cousin was quite sick, and she wanted to watch a romance. I gave up on my idea of listening to Hamilton the whole afternoon, but whatever.<br/><br/>* REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS * <br/><br/>How do I begin? The beginning of this movie is so Grease-ish. Summer love, and then they follow different paths. Everything alright till then. John's father was portrayed amazingly, and so was Alan. But anyways, the beginning was okay. <br/><br/>In the middle of the movie, is where things get interesting. I was already imagining John's father would die, and that made me cry. I was enjoying the movie a lot, and the ""she found a new guy""/ ""they're engaged"" part, was quite cliché as well. I thought they were going to be together at the end, but we'll get to that. <br/><br/>When John comes back, and writes the letter to his father, we all understand he was writing to him, not Savannah. That was okay as well, but, why showing that in the beginning of the movie? I mean, I think we all thought the letter was for ""the girl"", but apparently it wasn't. That confused me a lot. <br/><br/>What made me dislike the movie a lot, was Savannah's last letter. I guess we all were like ""oh damn. She's going to marry that blond dude"", but when her picture with Tim showed up, I started mumbling something like ""Tell me that's Tim taking her to the church. It's not what it looks like. It can't be"" That Tim-Savannah relationship was quite disgusting for me.<br/><br/>I mean, Tim was like a father to her, it was disgusting when I found out they were married. ""Tim needed me, he needed me for Alan as well, and I was alone and I didn't know what I was doing""<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but you're practically a grown up woman, how can you not know what you're doing? When John came back, her face was practically telling him she still loved him, but they did nothing for that love. Even John knew it, for gods' sake! <br/><br/>I've read one review here, and apparently, selling his dad's coins was to pay Tim some kind of thing. Why that, John? The line ""If you love her, you need to let her go, even if you get hurt, because you want her to be happy"", is a line that is explicit (?) in this movie. He gave Tim the time he needed to be with Savannah and Alan, but what the hell?! It was so useless!! He was about to die anyways, and he barely showed her he cared about her!! Savannah was a bit bitchy tho. She didn't even visit John's dad at the hospital, or went to his funeral, she just stopped showing up. <br/><br/>My point is, I didn't like the movie for this simple reason. The ""SHE MARRIED TIM"" plot twist was awful and completely disgusting, and the final scene is awful as well. What happens next? Are they finally together? We don't even know, because the movie didn't want us to know. Thanks a lot, Mr. Sparks. I won't even read the book. Reviews have said it was awful, and I guess I will believe it, until I finally want to find out what happens in the book that's so special.<br/><br/>I guess there are way more Nicholas Sparks movies that are better than this one <br/><br/><ul><li>inescid</li></ul><br/><br/>P.S - This is only my opinion. If anyone thinks other way, I totally respect it."
"saletehnolog","7","0","0","31 October 2017"," It's good
","The story of the movie is extremely good. Sparks also showed the skill in this case. Still, I can not say that I liked this almost two hours. According to me, the main and serious lack of performance occurs when John receives a letter from Savannah that she believes. This is something that in my opinion the whole movie was taken in one direction that is completely wrong. First, I can not imagine that you love someone and you believe in the other way you have sworn in love. Second, more importantly. I'm sure it would be absolutely unrealistic to expect that they will be together after its release. Let's not forget, the two of them decided to return to the field and practically she betrayed him at the moment when he needed it most. As hard as it was, it was harder for him. He is a soldier, whose head was in his bag every day. Every letter from her, for him was the light in total darkness and chaos. It would be much better if the film was made to follow their common story while it is on one side of the earth, and it is on the other. And so until the final merger. There was room to do something like that and make a story that is happening in reality. Music in the movie is extraordinary. The movie would surely have gotten a much higher rating, only that the action was first found in the last third of the film.<br/><br/>7,1/10"
"sakram","6","0","0","28 October 2017"," Leaves so much to be desired.
","Least to say about Dear John is that it's a typical Romance movie. With not-so- much to fill in the entire playtime, decent Soundtracks, acting, and directing. It didn't deliver much and came out short, although it could've done otherwise, potential wasted.<br/><br/>I am not a big fan of Channing Tatum, but I like his movies, most of them, well as for this one, I wasn't very contented by his acting, and it felt a little bit made-up, if I am not wrong. On the other hand, Amanda Seyfried nailed her role very well. But that all doesn't matter, and is nothing when put face to face next to the plot line importance, because that's where all the criticism should go. Provided that the movie is based on a book, I felt like this has much to give as an adaption, but I was wrong, the adaption was made in a wrong way, it was wrongly paced, and the screenplay left so much to be desired.<br/><br/>I can't say quite much without spoiling. 6.5/10"

","Dear John is a movie about an Army soldier named John Tyree, who meets college student, Savannah Curtis, after he rescues her bag from the ocean. Within two weeks, they fall in love with each other. Savannah gets to meet John's father, Mr. Tyree, whom she observes has autism and John meets Savannah's neighbors and friends, Tim and his son who has autism too, Alan. After two weeks, Savannah goes back to college and John returns to the Army for a year. They agree to send letters to each other throughout the year of his tour. Right before John's tour ends, 9/11 happens and extends his tour. A few months into the tour, Savannah sends him a letter saying that she's engaged to someone else. John is extremely hurt and continues extending his tours until he's sent home because his father had a stroke and is in the hospital. His father passes away and John goes to see Savannah to get some closure. John finds out that Tim is the one she married and that he has stage four lymphomas. Savannah explains that she broke up with him to help Tim out and she couldn't bear the pain of not having John around any longer. John says goodbye to her forever and they go their separate ways. The movie ends with them seeing each other again and they hug each other. <br/><br/>Since this is a romance movie, I think the basic message the film is trying to convey is that there will be circumstances that will keep lovers apart, but true love will always find a way. I would say that the film does convey this message in the romance between John and Savannah. In the movie, there were several circumstances that keep them apart. One of those circumstances is the fact that John was still in the army when they met, so they couldn't be physically together for most of the time and 9/11 occurred when John was still in the Army. Another factor that kept them apart was Savannah's marriage to Tim and Tim's cancer. Savannah felt that Tim needed her help, so she married him. Also, since Savannah and Tim were married, John and Savannah couldn't be together. In the end, though, Tim passes away, so Savannah isn't married anymore and they see each other again and hug. Since the movie ends with them hugging, it's assumed that they get back together and get married. <br/><br/>My reaction to how the movie portrayed individuals with disabilities was overall positive. There were a few things that I noticed that may portray people with disabilities in a negative light. Fortunately, most of the time when it happens, Savannah is there to shed more understanding on the situation than John does. The first thing is the lack of person first language. Throughout the movie, the characters comment how John's father is autistic or that Alan is autistic. If the characters were to use person first language, they would have said ""Alan has autism"" or ""Mr. Tyree has autism"" because person first language puts the person first and then the condition. The second thing was also the part where John gets offended when Savannah tells him that his father has autism. He says, ""You're saying my dad's retarded or something?"" There are two reasons why John's reaction bothers me. First, he uses the word ""retarded"" which has become widely rejected to use in any context because people with disabilities used to be called retarded as an official term, but then people started using it in different contexts to mean stupid. Using the word ""retarded"" in place of the word ""stupid"" is offensive because it's insinuating that individuals with mental disabilities are stupid. Therefore, I do not agree with the choice to include the word in the movie. In the movie's defense, though, Savannah immediately responds to John's comment saying, ""No, Alan's not retarded, John. He's autistic."" I give the movie credit for making the distinction between ""retarded"" and having autism. The second reason is because John is offended that Savannah is saying that his dad has autism. Denial may be a common reaction to news like this, but his taking offense to it means that having autism is a bad thing. Having autism should not be viewed as bad, it's just another form of the human condition. The good part, though, is that John still loves his dad. <br/><br/>The third part is when Savannah and John try to get Mr. Tyree to meet her parents, breaking his routine. After they start driving, Mr. Tyree can't go through with it and has to be taken back home. John's reaction is mostly annoyance because he blames his dad for ruining his only night in Charleston. John's feelings and reactions to Mr. Tyree's break down shed a negative light on people with disabilities because he seems to be blaming his father for not being able to make it to meet Savannah's parents'. This blaming is problematic because it's blaming him for something that he can't control. Fortunately, Savannah does point out that he tried, showing that he did want to go. <br/><br/>I think that everything else concerning people with disabilities was good because it showed that they are people too. Also, Savanna comments on how people with autism seem to have a horse sense, meaning that they have good intuition about certain things. Her comment about people with autism having horse sense sheds a positive light on people with disabilities. <br/><br/>I'm giving the movie a 6 because it was a good movie with an okay plot. I would say it's your typical, run-of-the mill romance that I might suggest watching once, but it's definitely not a movie that I would watch again. Also, it definitely wasn't as good as The Notebook because it didn't really have any incredible plot twists like The Notebook does, but overall, a decent romance movie."
"katiemay-01684","7","0","0","24 April 2017"," Film Critique
","*May Contain Spoilers*<br/><br/>Out of 10 stars, I would give this star a 7. While it was a well- done movie, there could have been more development is some of the sub- plots. Overall, I enjoyed watching the movie and would be willing to watch it again, I would not consider it one of my favorite movies. <br/><br/>Dear John is the tale Savannah and John who show that while love may have obstacles, it can travel around the world and last a lifetime. Savannah is a college student who met John in South Carolina during a volunteer trip. John is a resident of South Carolina who is in the United States Army and lives with his Dad who may be on the autism spectrum, even though it is not confirmed in the movie. As stated in the movie, it only took two weeks for Savannah and John to fall in love but when those two weeks were up, the reality of life settled in an Savannah and John had to face long distance, deployment, friends who have fallen ill, and accomplishment of personal dreams through letters written to one another. While some may believe that love has no bounds, Dear John sends that message the life will throw obstacles at love and choices need to be made that can affect the relationship despite the love shared. I found that Dear John portrayed a realistic version of love for young lovers who not only come from different experiences but also have different goals. Dear John showed that while someone may love another, sometimes other responsibilities need to take priority but the love one has for another will never truly disappear. <br/><br/>The main character that was perceived to have a disability was John's father. It was hinted by Savannah that he may have autism because he is obsessed with coins, has a schedule for dinner, and lack social skills. However, when she addresses this with John, John reacts negatively and automatically assumes that Savannah thinks that something is wrong with him. This is considered a negative barrier because it promotes stigma that autism means not right. However, a positive advocacy if autism occurs in the movie through the love Savannah has for her neighbor who has autism. Savannah shows that autism is not bad and through interventions such as horse-back riding, children with autism can build connections. <br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this movie for those who enjoy love stories. Since this movie is based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks, I would highly recommend this movie to those who enjoy Nicholas Sparks's works."

","After having read the book I did not want to see the movie, because I really did enjoy the book a lot. The movie was different from the book, but that is common when making books into movies. I did think that it was a good movie, but not my favorite. <br/><br/>The movie is about a solider, John, who meets a girl, Savannah, while he is home from the war. They meet and spend two weeks together and fall in love. They seem to be perfect for one another. He then has to go back to active duty, but the two continue their relationship through letters. At home John's father has dementia and forgets many things, and it frustrates John. Savannah is very good with his father, and that is something that John loves about her. Savannah has a close friend, who she ends up marrying, Tim, who has cancer and Tim's brother, Alan, has Autism. All of these relationships are shown throughout the movie, and you are able to watch how they change as life events such as 9/11, deaths and deployment occur. <br/><br/>I believe that a purpose of this film, and the message that this movie tried to convey was that you cannot take anything or anyone for granted. I believe that this movie really did a great job of conveying that. John took his father for granted, and when he eventually passed away he regretted being mean to him and not spending enough time with him. When 9/11 happened it showed how everyone took for granted how safe and protected our military truly keeps us. <br/><br/>As for those in the movie that played the roles of people with disabilities, I believe that they were portrayed well. Tim, Savannah's husband who eventually was diagnosed with cancer showed how that can affect everyone in that persons life. Now he, Tim, relied heavily on Savannah to take care of Alan who has Autism. I think that Richard Jenkins did a great job portraying someone with dementia. It allowed the viewer to see how that person does not realize that they have memory loss, and also showed how frustrating and stressful it can truly be on relatives and those that are close to that person. <br/><br/>I do recommend this movie to people who are interested. If you have already read the book, just be aware that it is not exactly the same, but it is still good in its own way."

","Dear John is about a brave solider, John, meeting a beautiful college student, Savannah. Within two weeks of spending time together they fall in love, but distance takes a toll on their relationship. They attempted to stay connected while John was overseas by writing letters, but the long distance relationship was too hard for Savannah to handle. Even though the two were still in love with each other, Savannah abruptly stopped writing John back and ended their relationship.<br/><br/>I personally love anything Nicholas Sparks related, and this movie has the perfect amount of love and tragedy all at once. Bring out the tissues, because you will need it to get through this one. I love how real and related the plot is, because dealing with family, illness, and relationships can get tricky at times and this film doesn't sugar coat it. The way they went about the characters who have disabilities was very real and how it's hard for family members to come to terms with those disabilities. I think the moral of the movie is to be there for the ones who need you the most. I definitely recommend for a girls night in!"

While,the book is very descriptive about the relation between John and his father, you can't have that in a movie simply because it will just make it longer!

If only the plot was little bit more interesting this could have been an outstanding love story, but, of course, it was very predictable, therefore not the greatest thing you will see. But eh... what can you want from a standard romantic drama.<br/><br/>The couple of these two actors wasn't the worst out there, although, i didn't feel the chemistry between them a 100%, it was better than many reviewers here have said, i don't think these two actors were particularly bad picks for this film at all.<br/><br/>Nothing crazy, very linear, slow paced and calm.

I thought the movie was actually going to be good because so many people said it was worth watching. People said it is up there with other good romance movies, it is not at all. It is not worth watching, watching John's character have to go through the bs Amanda's character puts him through is enough to skip it in my opinion. You would think that she would understand that he would be away for a long time and respect that and if she couldn't she should of have told him that she couldn't deal with the fact that he was away from her for so long. Instead of just leading him on and breaking his heart."

","Dear John is similar to that 2012 film The Lucky One with Zac Efron as both Tatum and Efron both joined the army in Afghanistan and fell in love only The Lucky One is sorta different. So back to this review.<br/><br/>The movie stars off in the year 2001 and we see John(played by Channing Tatum) at the beach and saves this girl's bag that fell into the water. This girl is called Savannah(played by Amanda Seyfried)who is smitten with John and the two fall in love.But since John has to go back to Afghanistan again leaving her alone again as well as caring for his Autistic father (played by Richard Jenkins)can him and Savannah ever get together? Well since John is gone to the Army again she ends up marrying Tim(played by ET star Henry Thomas) who happens to have cancer and has a son that is also autistic like John's father.<br/><br/>So what did I think of this movie,well to be honest and call me cynical but I never shed a tear at this movie in fact I found it rather complicated at times and the chemistry to its credit was great between Seyfried and Tatum. Also the story has been done in that 2012 film The Lucky One and Nichloas Sparks LOVES using the same formula every single time. The poor guy had a hard life as he lost his sister and his parents so any wonder he writes these clichéd stories that happen in almost every romantic film. Boy meets girl check,falls in love check, something bad happens in the 3rd act or 2nd act check check,some dies check,sad depressing music check.<br/><br/>Now I loved The Notebook and A Walk To Remember in fact these two are my favourite Nichloas Sparks movies of all time in my opinion as the story was better and more believable,here its kinda boring and clichéd.

","Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried star in a tender romantic story of a soldier on leave in South Carolina and a college student who have one of those once in a lifetime romantic affairs and who want to make it permanent. Tatum in fact is ready to leave the army once his enlistment is up, but the attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon interrupt that. He and the rest of America go into a permanent state of war which sad to say we'll be in for the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>Her main support in this world is Henry Thomas and his autistic son R. Braden Reed who ages into Luke Benward. One day while out with his unit on some unknown battlefield in the war on terror, Tatum gets that dreaded Dear John letter. <br/><br/>Neither party though deeply in love is exactly truthful to the other. Tatum is not your average GI, he's in fact with Special Forces, otherwise known as a Green Beret. Patriotism is not something trotted out on the Fourth of July or other occasions. He may make the army a permanent profession.<br/><br/>As for Seyfried her reasons for breaking off with Tatum border on the noble and self sacrificing. For that you see Dear John for, but I know in real life of a similar situation that Seyfried faces here.<br/><br/>Also in the cast is Richard Jenkins who is Tatum's mildly autistic and eccentric father. His is a touching performance, the bond between him and Tatum runs very deep.<br/><br/>Tatum and Seyfried are as romantic a couple as I've ever seen in the new century.

","Another Nicholas Sparks adaption, so of course it's a total chick-flick which ultimately I enjoyed just not as much as the book. Its actually a pretty depressing love story and in the film version it annoyed me that neither character aged a day (or changed a hairstyle) over the 7 year course of the movie. The book ending is also much more realistic than the one presented here.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum, plays ""John"" a soldier who falls in love with an idealist college student (Amanda Seyfried) while on leave and continues to communicate with her via a series of letters throughout his military service.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum. As much as I adore him his portrayal of John is kinda bland. He doesn't (or can't) convey much emotion so he just kind of dumb-de-dums along while looking super good. I did enjoy his scenes with Richard Jenkins who plays his autistic father (and is awesome as usual). This relationship seemed to bring out the best in Tatum, acting wise. The romance angle was just okay for me, a nice Notebook-ie reminiscent kissing scene in the rain. The scenery is beautiful too, wherever this was filmed. 08.13(2)"

","Since i don't expect much of any love story i found Dear John a relaxing movie to watch. Also, i don't care much whether the movie was better or worse than the literally template, i prefer to watch it and let it speak for itself.<br/><br/>Dear John is a love story involving a beautiful girl and a professional soldier. I guess this story might resonate well also with men, especially those who had some experience in the army. Even if you've served only a mandatory military service, you might relate to a situation where you meet a girl during your summer vacation and think of her in the barracks.<br/><br/>Otherwise there's not much i might tell about Dear John."
"sofie_a","9","0","0","25 March 2014"," Heartbreaking story with some wonderful acting
","'Dear John' tells the story about a soldier and a college student. These two young people fell in love after spending only 2 weeks together. John needs to fulfill his military service, so they will be separated from each other for one year. But this lovely couple made each other a promise to let their relationship grow further by writing letters.<br/><br/>Then 9/11 happens unexpectedly. Like every other soldier in his group, John decides to re-enlist. He keeps continuing that, until he receives a final letter that begins with 'Dear John', as the movie title suggests. Savannah's new love is a good man, but John never expected that this would happen. In the end, he accepts the fact that he 'lost' her, but he would not give up yet. After 2 more years of military service, John returns home on leave from the army, and seeks out Savannah<br/><br/>This romantic drama is based on the eponymous novel by Nicholas Sparks. The movie is directed by Lasse Hallstrom and the two lead actors are Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried. He stars John Tyree, a handsome Army-Special-Forces specialist. Channing feels good in his character as a soldier. He's a strong young man, despite him also being an emotional guy who is brave enough to always show his feelings. Amanda plays the role of the student Savannah Curtis. Like her character, she really is a natural beauty. When she has some time free, she's always willing to help anyone. Amanda was definitely the most appropriate actress for this role. John's father (played by Richard Jenkins) has a particular role in the movie: he is autistic and has a difficult relationship with his son.<br/><br/>In a Sparks story, for example ""The Notebook"", problems like autism and Alzheimer are always seen in their good stages. The victim enjoys the little things in life, and tries to make every day count because their only hope for the future is to get a little bit more time. Time to say goodbye to their loved ones. That's something we also get to see in this touching movie.<br/><br/>If you're a true fan of romantic movies, ""Dear John"" won't let you down. It's a story that you'll remember for a very long time. The movie also added some beautiful quotes, the most important one reads as follows: ""No matter how many years go by, I know one thing to be as true as it ever was: I'll see you soon then""."

","I had a certain amount of trepidation going into 'Dear John', not cynicism, but expectations that were not exceptionally high. I found that I liked the movie somewhat more than I expected. It is about two beautiful people, John and Savannah, who meet one summer and fall deeply in love before he is deployed to Iraq. They then spend the next two years writing letters to one another with the promise that they will be together again. The fact that every one of her letters opens with the words ""Dear John"" had to make him slightly jumpy.<br/><br/>The basic nuts and bolts of the story are a perfectly good recipe for a great romance: Two people get to know one another and continue getting to know one another even though they are half a world apart. The problem is that the movie gums up their romance with needless plot developments that only distract from our time getting to know them. I can get behind John having to go when he country calls but I probably didn't need the autistic father, the horse ranch for kids, the dying neighbor who vies for Savannah's heart, or even that inevitable Dear John letter. The ending of the movie is a contrivance that just got in the way.<br/><br/>The story involves John (Channing Tatum) and Savannah (Amanda Seyfried) who meet one summer at the beaches of South Carolina. John, handsome and well-sculpted, is in the Army Special Forces on a two week leave. A poor kid, he lives with this father (Richard Jenkins) who is a recluse who collects coins. Savannah is a rich girl who is not just beautiful but ethereal in that way that doesn't seem possible without special effects. She loves kids and opens a ranch for kids with Autism. The two meet when he dives off a pier to retrieve her purse. Good thing she didn't bring the cat.<br/><br/>The couple fall into that kind of romance that makes you want to spend two hours just listening to them talk. You want to watch them getting to know each other, building a relationship and eventually a life together. This is not to be, however, because the movie loses focus and pushes them into the kinds of plot developments that might make for a cuddle-up romance novel but make for a very frustrating movie. That's especially the case when John is deployed to Iraq after 9/11 and receives a Dear John letter that seems to come out of nowhere. Every subsequent scene after that feels forced, as if you can feel it being written rather than flowing naturally from the characters.<br/><br/>That's too bad because Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried make a wonderful couple. They aren't just two actors pushed together, but really seem organically made for each other. They are beautiful people who have genuine chemistry together. Tatum has that kind of pretty-boy smolder that lets you know that the inside is as pretty as the outside. Seyfriend is gorgeous but also has a brain and a personality (if she doesn't play an angel at some point in her career, I'll be disappointed). They connect in a very nice way, but who are these two characters outside of this plot? Director Lass Halstrom, I know, is at the mercy of the fact that he is working from a Nicholas Sparks novel. One deviation would have brought on the ire of Sparks' legion of fans, but as someone who is not a follower of his books, I have only this movie to go by. I could hope for a sequel, maybe an original screenplay that would simply allow this lovely couple to get to know each other."

","It's obvious that a Nicholas Spark's movie can't be good. So don't watch it is just a waste of time. The acting isn't very good, Channig Tatum does a good job but the character is pretty basic, same case with Amanda Seyfried, it's basically two stereotypical characters doing what they supposed to be doing, so the plot becomes predictable and can be discovered in the first 10 minutes. No surprises here , i was hoping at list that at least they wouldn't end up together, but even that i couldn't get. The only good thing is the photography, with some nice pictures of beaches, it's also remarkable the way the movie approaches to autism, with not the classical ""mentally ill guy"" but with functional people, obviously with some features that lets you see that they have that condition. Hope people doesn't waste time watching it at least you're very bored."

","John Tyree (Channing Tatum) is Army Special Forces on leave back home. Savannah Curtis (Amanda Seyfried) is a sweet popular girl. She falls for him right away after he dove off the pier to retrieve her purse.<br/><br/>They're reusing the same formula again. Take two lovely young leads, and combine it with a Nicholas Sparks novel. There's even a rain soaked kissing scene in an unfinished house. There is basically nothing here other than the two likable leads. Richard Jenkins puts in a limited performance as John's autistic father. Their big fight seems manufactured. Too much of the movie has the two leads mostly communicating through letters. It's not a terribly dramatic movie. Even adding 9/11 doesn't make it any more compelling."

Letting him down, leaving him and letting him know by letter, and then finally when he gets the urge and manages to control his feelings; and wants to leave her; she has the urge to freaking start to cry! What the hell girl! Either you leave him or you don't. You can't leave him and then expect him after wards to come running after you and wanting you to get back - uh uh - forget it.<br/><br/>John wanted to what he loved to do, while his loved girlfriend was safe home; writing each other letters. Sure 24 months is a long time - but seriously?! Leaving him?! How the heck could she? She is such a bitch and i must say, that what John did in the end; leaving her with only a single goodbye - is what she deserved. <br/><br/>The only thing that makes this movie a 8 and not a 10, is because the ending is a little predictable. Not the part where he leaves her, while she cries; saying his farewell. But the part, where she writes yet another letter and tells him that 'oh time this time that' and so on AND the final part where he is outside a café that she happens to be in and that is so not predictable(sarcasm), where she then goes outside and they hug once again. Throughout the whole movie after they have split, the 'back and forth' relationship is (for me) too predictable. If the movie just had stopped, when ha had said goodbye and left her crying; that would have been perfect! Sorry, but I just miss those romantic movies with a not so happy ending."

","This film has some very emotional scenes, but in between them there is not enough chemistry between the main characters. I like the idea of the story but casting in this film was a bit off. I definitely liked how they explored the character of john's father and the relationship he had with his son. It is brave of them to tackle the mental illness that the father has and show how it effects the father's life, personality and relationship with his son. Some bits made me cry and made me think about my own life but the start was poor and for periods the film seemed to meander along in a cold and unemotional way. This film is neither a great war film like Saving Private Ryan or a romance film like the notebook. It tries to cover war, romance, mental illness and drama. The only genre it truly seems to get right is mental illness. Overall this film has a great story to use and a lot of potential but it doesn't quite deliver in a number of genres that it tries to tackle."

I used to like What's Eating Gilbert Grape (with Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio) more but still I find Dear John a nice romantic film where Channing Tatum (former model and commercial performer) has made his best performance so far. His character fills all the scenes and he looks very convincing - often more than his female partner Amanda Seyfried (ex-model as well).<br/><br/>The plot is realistic, not with big surprises and twists, but I guess lots of viewers can identify themselves with the same or similar situations.

","Love is not an infatuation with a person of the opposite sex but rather a choice and commitment that is unshaken through even the most difficult times. Dear John is based the young love story of John and Savannah. John is a Special Forces soldier who lives with his father at the beach and Savannah is a college student who is on summer vacation. They have an attraction to each other immediately and eventually commit their love to one another. While he is diploid overseas they write to each other for awhile but she eventually stops and marries another man without any explanation. This breaks John's heart and he doesn't know how to deal with it so he tries to extend his stay in Afghanistan but is unable to because he is sent home because his father is dying. Shortly after coming home John runs into Savannah and she explains why she did what she did. While his father is on his death bed John reconnects with him and restores their relationship. John sells what his father gave to him as an inheritance and gives the money to Savannah so that her husband can try a new drug that is very expensive and live two more months to be with his son. This act of kindness John did for Savannah affirms his love for her even through everything. This movie is a good example that love bears all things, keeps no record of wrongs, and that love never fails."

","No, I don't too often watch these sort of romantic and dramatic movies but it's not like I hate the genre. It's just so, when you have seen one of these movies, you have basically seen them all already. The only way a romantic movie can still satisfy me is if it's doing something new and original, or truly something realistic and heartfelt. This movie does none of those things really though unfortunately.<br/><br/>But to be honest; I was quite liking the movie at first. When everything was still good and all between its two main characters, the movie was a quite maintaining and sweet little one, that got beautifully shot by Swedish director Lasse Hallström. However with these sort of movies you already know that things can't go well for very long. There is always a conflict, that sooner or later comes in between of the love, of its two main characters.<br/><br/>And in this movie it's a whole bunch of different stuff that comes in between of its main characters. War, dreams, death, it's all a part of this movie, that forces the two lovers apart from each other. And I could had dealt all well with this, if it got brought better to the screen.<br/><br/>It's not only too much and not really realistic and believable enough, it also all got really cramped in, in its second half. Things happen way too soon after each other, as if the movie was constantly in an hurry. Also none of this ever worked out too well because of that, which makes the movie mostly emotionally an ineffective one.<br/><br/>Still I can see this movie having some value to it as a typical chick-flick. And there is nothing wrong with that, it just clearly isn't really my cup of tea though.<br/><br/>Because there is so much drama in this movie, it also all felt far too forced. I had a real hard time getting into the second half of the movie because of this, while the first half of the movie was perfectly told, in a slow and beautiful way. I bought into the love between its two main characters, played by Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried. In the second half this feeling was completely gone and the two of them really didn't seem to fit together at all.<br/><br/>You could also blame the casting because of this. Now, I'm not necessarily complaining about Channing Tatum's acting skills in this movie but he still is very miscast. This guy just isn't made to play the lead role, in a romantic movie. He totally doesn't has the charisma for that. He shows far too little variety and emotions in his role, even while this was obviously crucial for its story and the overall credibility of it all.<br/><br/>It's only a half good movie really. It has a good and likable first half and a not so good, or very credible and powerful second half.<br/><br/>5/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Now I know people who have watched this movie before and they seemed to have enjoyed it, so I figured what the heck! It's based on another Nicholas Sparks book and I loved (A Walk To Remember, The Notebook, etc) I'll go watch it! But to be honest, it wasn't that great. It's not exactly terrible, but it wasn't anything special either.<br/><br/>Okay so let's start off with how they met, I don't want to spoil anything so I'll just say I thought it was a bit cliché but it was a promising scene. I was expecting more excitement, but I knew it was too early within the movie to really judge it so tried to be patient. <br/><br/>As their relationship progressed I thought it all happened a bit too fast. They had some good, meaningful moments but there were a lot of choppy scenes that didn't even really relate to each other. But still, I was hoping it would get better as I got further into the movie. Yeah, not so much. <br/><br/>I needed more excitement, more drama, more surprises! But 'Dear John' was predictable. Or maybe it's just because I've seen many movies with basically the same story line before. Boy likes girl. Girl likes boy. Boy goes to war. They can't be together. Cry. Cry. Cry. At least they put a little twist to it ... kind of (at the end). But it wasn't very strong. Not once while watching the movie did I go, ""OH MY GOSH! I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT!""<br/><br/>So overall, the movie was decent. It had some good moments and looked very promising, but it wasn't anything special. I've seen better."

","When I was introduced to this movie by a family member of mine, I had a few concerns. None of the other Nick Sparks-based movies out at the time were really my cup of tea, but I decided to give this movie a shot, anyway. I can now say that it would have been better to overlook the movie entirely. What could have been a very emotionally charged and powerful film failed to do so because of a few key factors. First of all, gorgeous though he is, Channing Tatum simply can't act. You can tell the wonderful Amanda Seifreid desperately floundering to salvage any tenderness in the love scenes that wasn't beaten down on by Tatum's imposing presence. The lack of chemistry between the characters was a real turn-off. Also, too many small plot lines and points of interest were carelessly shoved into the plot without a second thought from the directors. SPOILER: Autism, 9/11, death, old age: each one is placed in the plot without having it really go anywhere. Large parts of the script seemed as though the writers didn't really know what to do, so the scenes in question just become awkward. I had never really cared for movies based on Nicholas Sparks novels, and this movie has confirmed that. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with a short attention span, because it drags terribly in certain parts, most especially the end."

","A big old-fashioned weepie, set in the recent past and coloured with its references to 09/11 and the succeeding war in Iraq. The story of star-crossed lovers- strong, silent, but with a violent streak, soldier John & beautiful, intelligent guitar-strumming Savannah, their relationship is put to the test by the intervention of the war and their coincidental interaction with people with autism, namely John's father and Savannah's family friend's young son. <br/><br/>If that sounds like a fairly contrived story-line, then the reason that he ends up receiving her ""Dear John"" letter while serving abroad will stretch credulity even further as will the way that it still ends up all happy ever after for the two by the very end. One senses too that life in the army today is not quite the buddy-fest that is portrayed here. <br/><br/>The film is beautifully shot in warm colour tones and in the acting stakes, As Savannah Amanda Seyfried gives an appealing and attractive performance. I was less convinced by Channing Tatum as John, although his surly character certainly gives him less to play with. Correspondingly I didn't quite buy into their relationship and actually thought that his receiving the title letter was the end of the film, rather than the springboard to reunion it later turned out to be. <br/><br/>That said, it was nice to watch a latter-day film in the old tradition, without profanity or violence, the love scenes between the couple in particular being sensitively filmed. All in all, a pleasant film my wife and I could both watch together quite happily although there were probably too many coincidences in the story for it to properly hang together."

","I loved this film very much, it's a emotional story of how people need to stick together, and help each other out, just like how Savannah helped Alan and his Dad, and helped John's dad. It's very moving, especially when John sells his Dad's coin collection, but keeps the one he knows his dad would of kept, the expensive mule. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves romantic movie's. I like the way how the film is spaced over, I think, 10 years, and how the letters keep moving from John to Savannah, and their point of view when they are reading them. The film has more than one story behind it, not just a tale about how two people fall in love with one another, but how Savannah helped out someone and accepted them as a family and tried to do what she thought was best. We should all learn from this film, we should all help each other out and try to do our best in life."
"SavyV","7","0","0","27 May 2011"," It started out really good, but went downhill about 80 minutes in.
","First of: I usually give side comments about the movies I watch when I watch them. Like when the mean character does something mean, I sometimes say ""Bitch!"" or ""asshole!"" out of nowhere, totally in sync with the movie. During the 100 minutes of screen time this movie has, I spoke out once, about 75 or 80 minutes in and it was this: ""Whaaat. no. way."" And honestly, for me this movie turned into a so-so movie about ten minutes earlier.<br/><br/>I won't recap or summarize the movie here, because seriously, watch it yourself if you want that, I'm just reviewing it. So, ever since I saw the trailer, I had to see the movie. I almost cried just watching the trailer, how could I not cry during the movie? But I only *nearly* cried once, and that was when John reconciled with his dad. And I wanted to shove something down Savannah's throat by the end, because no one should be so selfish as to harm someone else they love. If she really only married Tim for Alan and Tim's best interest, she should have explained that to John when she told him she was engaged. Because making others (who by the way love you as epically as he loved her and are as damaged as he is) suffer like that without a real explanation, aren't good people. And they aren't people who care for others it seems, because then they would think first about the person they claim to love the most. So I guess to me the characters didn't fit their storyline. Then again, that's probably not the movie's fault, but the author's, so no blame on the movie. The movie (the actors, the acting, the stage, etc) was really good, but the storyline went downhill for me. It's about a 7 out of 10, but I think it'd be better to donate that vote to the author instead of the movie, which probably is a good portrait of the book. What the movie should have showed though (If the book did, I don't know because I haven't and won't ever read the book), is what happened in the very end with them. I mean, they met and they hugged old style and seemed oh-so-close again, but did they end up married? Is he still in the army? I DON'T KNOW!!! AND IT BOTHERS ME!!! grrr... All I'm gonna say."

","I have always believed that how you perceive a movie depends a lot on what you expect from it and whether your expectations are met or exceeded. As I was not expecting much from this movie, I was pleasantly surprised by it, as it is quite touching and well acted movie. Both the leads have done a very good job. It is also quite family friendly and both the lead characters are very sweet people who are good at heart.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that the movie could use a bit of clarity as somethings were left a little vague. <br/><br/>I am really surprised at the low ratings though. The movie is about a soldier who extends his duty voluntarily after 9-11 without asking his girlfriend and then the girlfriend leaves him. <br/><br/>I think the bad rating maybe partly due to the fact that even though the girl leaves her soldier boyfriend, she is shown in a positive light which may be seen as unpatriotic. But I have a different view, I thought the decision for extending his duty should have been a joint decision and the guy basically loses her trust. Also I think she is afraid of not only losing her but also of him extending his duty again.<br/><br/>Still quite a nice movie, though I didn't like a few plot points I don't want to nitpick. Generally now days I like 1 out of every 3 movies I see, so when I do like a movie I don't try to find faults.<br/><br/>Just while writing this review I discovered that it is directed by ""Lasse Hallström"" whose many movies I have loved in past most notably ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"", Chocolat and Casanova."

After two 'magical' weeks together, it's back to school for her, and back to the battlefield for John. The only thing keeping them together is pen and paper, while the forces of time threaten to split them apart<br/><br/>I know now that nothing Nicholas Sparks writes will be inspired, and not even a veteran like Lasse Hallstrom can make a strong movie from his material. We've seen this kind of story before, though usually in historical settings such as with Cold Mountain or Atonement. The history helps a bit. In the late 20th century, there is no real sense of distance between the two lovers. It's a smaller world. Montage editing plays a key role here, and to some degree it achieves effectiveness, while at the same time, it keeps Dear John from going in depth. As a studio production, intended for a pg-13 audience, the film unfortunately must keep within the public attention span. It's a body film not a brainy film, one intended to provoke tears, not thoughts.<br/><br/>On an emotional level, Dear John works a bit, but only a bit. The roles are somewhat beyond the acting range of Amanda Seyfried and Channing Tatum, but a few sparks fly between them. I've seen better and I've seen worse. Dear John is probably good for a weep, but not a huge one. otherwise, it won't be of much use."
"hesket01","9","0","0","2 May 2011"," Dear John is a very good romance movie!
","Dear John is about two people who fall in love in a short amount of time. I think the theme of this movie is very noticeable that love will conquer all things in due time. John Tyree who is played by Channing Tatum is a soldier who is home on leave. He falls in love with Savannah Curtis who is played by Amanda Seyfried. John wasn't expecting to find love but that is exactly what happened when he was home on leave for only two weeks. When John had to go back to where he was stationed at Amanda and John decided that their relationship would be able to make it through this tough time. However, things change when he reenlists after the attack on 9/11. I actually liked this movie for many different reasons. I liked it because it shows that not every relationship is perfect. It makes you feel like they have the same problems as any normal couple does. I'm not going to lie this movie did make me cry. It was sad to know that John was over in another country fighting a war and he received a ""dear John"" letter. That is sad to me because I know this happens every day in real life. I didn't like the movie for a few reasons though. The major thing I didn't like about the movie was the ending of the movie. I feel like the movie could have ended it a little better. I mean after all it is a romance movie. I think that it should have had them back together or something. Yes, it did show them meet back up but that don't mean that they were anything more than just friends. The motifs that I liked about Dear John are actually the letters. I think it plays an important part of the theme because while John is away on duty that is the only thing that is keeping their love strong. The lighting is another important aspect when it deals with the theme. It is mostly all high lighting which I think makes it more cheery and makes you feel like the couple is in love. This movie reminds me a lot like all romance movies, such as, The Notebook, Sweet Home Alabama, and P.S I Love You. It lets you know that true love does exist and you will have to work at it, but the reward is so much better. It is a great movie and I think people who love romance movies will love this movie."

","I know what you're thinking cause I thought it too. Here is how I got to seeing this movie. I saw the trailer for it and I was like oh HELL no. Then, I heard the song from the trailer on Pandora. My ears perked up to this vaguely familiar, sad song – and I thought – hey, that's a good song! I had to listen to the song on repeat for a few days and then watch the trailer again. That's when I decided I actually needed to watch the movie. And I'm glad I did. Despite the horrendous preview (for my tastes), I sat through the movie, suspended by the good-looking actors and decent love story! I do like to surprise myself from time to time, keeps me on my toes.There are several crucial elements to this movie that makes it a good romance. First of all, the leading lady, Amanda Seyfried, is a charming and intelligent young woman. I can actually see why a stallion like Channing Tatum would fall madly in love with her in two weeks. That's the problem with many of these movies (eg The Notebook), I just don't see what there is to love, but a pretty face. Secondly, it's not just about two lovebirds, but about other important relationships and priorities. Channing Tatum's father, played by Richard Jenkins, is a neurotic shut-in with autistic tendencies. I appreciated the inclusion of people with disabilities with subtly and grace. Fourth, I enjoyed the incorporation of 9/11 in the film. I haven't seen very many movies where the writer/director successfully includes an important, recent historic event. Usually, it's a complete distraction and utter failure (eg Benjamin Button). But here, it fit well and flowed with the story. I even enjoyed the moment it happened – a creative and subtle reenactment of the experience. Maybe because it's personal for me, but that's almost exactly how I found out – on my way home from class in college. Lastly, there's an element of keepin it real that I like – I don't wanna spoil anything, so I've got to limit it to that. I think this movie is under-appreciated. If you like romantic movies, go for it, watch Dear John. http://fatkidslist.wordpress.com/2010/09/21/dear-john/"

Personally, I thought Channing captured the personality of the man he portrayed, perfectly. As for Miss Seyfried, she exuded warmth to top off all that cuteness and loveliness. Sigh-h-h.<br/><br/>I must mention that the portrayal of autism was letter perfect, captured, perfectly, thanks to two brilliant portrayals. The script and the old man and little boy helped us understands the trials and tribulations of those who are autistic.<br/><br/>There was much criticism about her decision to marry a man she obviously didn't love.

","First, I'll admit that I am prejudiced against stories that have stupid characters who jettison their True Love and marry out of sympathy for another person like themselves: weak, unworthy, and pitiable -- or pitiful, however you'd like to describe them.<br/><br/>The girl Savannah can't take the worry and fear of having her True Love, special forces soldier John, be away from home and in danger. While he is fighting and risking his life in Afghanistan, dumps him and marries another man for reasons that some might find noble, but those are the same people that think Romeo and Juliet is a terrific romantic tale.<br/><br/>She sacrifices her own happiness (although presumably she does get a martyrdom kind of joy from her actions) and marries a weak man with an autistic son, and causes utter heartbreak and pain to her True Love John in the process. I'm sure she thought her actions were noble. So did Tess of the D'Urbervilles. Boo-hoo-hoo. They are indeed pitiable, but not admirable.<br/><br/>Savannah is a terrible role model and her actions should be condemned rather than praised. No, we shouldn't live only for ourselves, but True Love is a rare gift and she was utterly faithless to herself and to John.<br/><br/>The end of the film shows them finding each other again, but I have to say he is crazy if he still thinks she would be worthwhile. However, unless she finds some other poor schmuck with personal problems and who is a sucking black hole of need, maybe she'll be faithful to him this time.<br/><br/>Tatum Channing has sex appeal that melts the screen and conveys a universe of emotions with just a simple look. Amanda Seyfried is lovely and very appealing, and does a good job with her flawed character. But can I recommend this movie? NO. Watch Step Up instead."

","The best part of this movie was Richard Jennings, playing John's autistic dad. He was the best actor in this and gave emotion to the film. Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried are not that good of actors and the chemistry was not there. I just don't call a movie with the actors reading letters out lead as being that much of a love story. The best parts were the dad telling Savannah about his coin collection. And after what Savannah did to John with just breaking up with him like that, I don't think John would ever get back with her. It just portrayed her as being cruel and insensitive. Also, in a small town like that, how could she not know that John's father had died.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Just not that well written nor acted. The Notebook was much better. I don't recommend this one."

","Nicholas Sparks writes immersive romances that touch the heart and spirit. Sometimes both his books and the cinema adaptations of them are somewhat exasperating (for example, ""Message in a Bottle:"" I GET IT! HE LOVED HIS WIFE!).<br/><br/>""Dear John"" was one of Mr. Spark's more popular recent novels, especially with younger people, since the characters are college age when the novel begins, and the book deals with contemporary issues of the middle eastern wars, and how they affect lives on a personal level.<br/><br/>The casting for the movie was excellent and Channing Tatum fills out the role of stoic marine John Tyree very well, giving women of all ages something to swoon over. It helps that he is often shown shirtless or with torso accentuating, tight tees. Amanda Seyfried as Savannah is one of the freshest faces in movies today (with what another reviewer described as ""anime"" eyes and Rapunzel hair).<br/><br/>""Dear John"" excels in its art direction of showing the South Carolina low country as the backdrop for John and Savannah's whirlwind romance and in depicting the brutal reality of military tent life in a country half a world away. Unfortunately the love scenes were also filmed much like a landscape scene, with the camera panning over the curves of swaying backs and the elegant lines of upper arms and thighs. At one point they show a glimpse of Savannah's face and she seems to wish she were somewhere else.<br/><br/>Chemistry between actors and actresses in a romantic movie such as this can be a crap-shoot, however.<br/><br/>The plot of ""Dear John"" contains all the tear-jerking twists of the novel will leave most viewers satisfied, especially by John's portrayal of courage and compassion."

But changing overall situations, relationships and outcomes made me feel like I was cheated. However, if I hadn't read the book first I would have adored it. The cast I thought was chosen very well. It was beautifully made and delivered. It still made me cry and it took a lot of energy not to sob. I would recommend watching the movie before reading the book. Especially, if you're a fan of books.

","This movie was a unique twist on the romantic chick-flick sentimental film that men only ever seem to see because their girlfriends force them to, then sit and groan about how awful sitting through the movie was for them for days afterwards. <br/><br/>This movie was eloquent, gorgeous, and a classic tale of what life in America is truly like for her children. I think that critics and some viewers often have difficulty digesting movies like this one because it does not provide either a happy ending or a rose-colored view of the impact the military has on young men.<br/><br/>The only part of this movie I did not appreciate was that the director was not from the U.S. I felt like that was a note I did not appreciate, because the movie is so distinctly an American story. The note of irony and judgment that this outsider's perspective created was the only note in this entire symphony of a movie that I found not merely off, but off-putting. <br/><br/>I also found it more difficult to accept the criticism of the U.S. military and its decisions, command structure, isolation, and tragedy because it so clearly came from somebody who was incapable of truly grasping the reasons behind the choices that the members of the military have made, wrong as they might be.<br/><br/>The men in this film actually seemed fairly real, with flaws and selfish moments and times of startling generosity and honesty. The lead male was a GUY, not always understanding towards his autistic father and entirely capable of acting out and imperfection and fear of inadequacy and bad decisions. <br/><br/>The army segments felt very real to me. That aspect made the film devastating for me, thank God, because it's been a while since I've seen a devastating movie. <br/><br/>This movie was not a chicks' movie, which was startling at first but quickly struck me as a welcome break from the emotionally impoverished films I'm used to being told have been developed for my age group and gender. The characters fell into negative patterns in their lives, made decisions for the most unselfish reasons and watched their good intentions crumble into dust. <br/><br/>This movie really exposed the way gender can impact the ways that we conceive the world, and can cause us to make decisions that seem insane to an outside observer, particularly one of the opposite sex. John rejoined the military in spite of his doubts because he did not want to let down his country or look weak in the eyes of the military men who had obviously long doubled as his family. Savannah married the man who was capable of being around and who ""needed"" her, in spite of the fact that her heart didn't want him. I have seen so many men and women in my life struggle with similar decisions. I really appreciated that insider's look into the difficulties we face in interpreting what is true through emotions which have been shaped by the military-industrial complex. The complex sees us as consumers and potential cannon fodder and baby-making machines, not as human beings whose souls and feelings matter; the industries attached to war benefit from us being unhappy."

"smiley_pat77","6","0","0","17 July 2010"," I felt it at least wanted to do something profound at times
","I really felt this movie desired to say something profound. Particularly as the ending didn't seem to specifically aim for a sentimental and teary-eyed moment as other films based on Nicholas Sparks books have done. Actually, I'll be more specific and call out ""A Walk to Remember"" for its watered down, flat, pathos-centered denouement. Even the very well handled adaptation of ""The Notebook"" sought to create some waterworks in its final moments, but that movie earned the right for that opportunity. But ""Dear John"" aims to end on a more thoughtful note about the timing of relationships in our lives and the affect of those timings. It wants to leave us pondering the ""what if's"" of life and how it's never too late to bring them back into play. The problem is that we aren't provided a story with enough depth to fully support these themes.<br/><br/>I was very thankful not to see the conventional third act that is present in movies like ""The Proposal"" or ""A Walk to Remember"" even if the rest of the movie plays out in a typical manner. The opening voice-over and montage is very effective, but any momentum you have coming off of it is killed by a rather lame inciting incident. The characters proceed to fall in love over the course of a couple weeks. Though they do have a slight argument when Savannah proposes that John's dad might have autism (why this wouldn't have been a fairly logical hypothesis to John, given his dad's behavior, I don't know), but they overcome this and begin a pen pal relationship when John goes abroad with the Army Special Forces.<br/><br/>9/11 happens and John decides to extend his time in the army. Consequentially, Savannah argues the decision claiming that she should have a say in the matter. But at this point these characters have only spent a couple weeks together in person so how can either really claim to have a decent stake in the other's decisions?<br/><br/>John reenlists and ends up spending the next 6 or 7 years in the army. All the while whatever longing these two have for each other is not truly illustrated. The movie plays out as if these are characters that have lived a chunk of their life together and are trying to hold on to it when the focus needs to be more on a longing for the potential they have for a relationship and the desire to carry out that potential. (For more on this, see ""Atonement"" [2007])<br/><br/>At one point it seems as if the script is going to perform a pleasant trick on us and demonstrate that it's really about something other than these supposedly star-crossed lovers, but then that excitement tapers off and the movie walks back into being more of what we expected it to be. I was very excited though to see that it wasn't trying to indulge me superficially during the last half hour or so. The lone tearful scene was well earned, even if not built up to its fullest.<br/><br/>This film didn't so much disappoint me as it did just fail to fully satisfy me. It at least wanted to be something with meaning and purpose, and that I must be thankful for because there are so many stories put into production that lack that quality."

","Actually i just watched this movie and I would have to disagree. I think that Channing Tatum is a very good actor. His style is much different but very believable to me. The chemistry advanced between them throughout the movie which I expected because more time went past. I think the twist was good cause I was happy that he didn't die because i mean look at him. I think the storyline was really good and I enjoyed it greatly. The spark between them was clear and you could tell that they grew together and she made him give his dad a real chance whenever he met her and brought them closer.

","Well, after passing over this movie in theaters and figuring it was going to be another run of the mill ""chick flick"", I finally saw it was out on DVD today and decided to give it a chance. I went into my viewing of the film with an open mind and was really hoping that this movie would be a cut above the other romance films that had come out lately. This review will contain only very light spoilers, nothing to actually spoil any type of surprises in the plot whatsoever.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it was nothing new or special. The story involves a girl named Savannah, who meets a boy named John, who happens to be a special forces operative for the United States Army and when not on assignment, lives with his father who has autism. Savannah is spending the two weeks of her spring break helping out a family who's home has been wrecking by a hurricane in John's coastal home town. The two quickly fall in love and the film chronicles the journey they share through the ups and downs of their relationship.<br/><br/>The major problem I had with this film is that the pacing is way off the mark. The film moves at breakneck speed to establish John and Savannah's relationship, which ends up cheapening any type of romance that develops between them. It just never seems believable that they fell in love so quickly.<br/><br/>The other problem I have with the film is that many of the subplots, which are more interesting than the central love story, are never developed. John's relationship with his autistic father never seems genuine either because it is thrown together so quickly that the reason for strain between them in taken care of in a flashback lasting about thirty seconds. Another underdeveloped portion of the film is Savannah's relationship with another character's autistic son. It is just thrown in at the beginning of the film and never really explained. Loose ends abound throughout the rest of the film as well and it is really unfortunate that the film didn't take more time to build on these intricate side stories.<br/><br/>The scenes where John is in combat bring a much needed air of reality to the film, but they're too brief to elevate this film over it's weak script and under-developed characters. This is a film that could have used more script polish and could have been much better had it not been simplified for a wider audience. The love story involving war gives it a current tone, yet the script makes it unbelievable. I haven't read the novel so I cannot speak for it's merits, but the film misses the mark if it intended to differentiate itself from many other romantic dramas that have hit theaters lately."

","I couldn't disagree more with what some people have said about this movie. People tend to go in with the mind set of 'the notebook,' and therefore come out feeling disappointed as its clearly not the notebook. I wish people would give it a chance before they see the film.<br/><br/>Firstly, the acting was excellent. Channing Tatum was excellent as John, and his acting was very convincing, especially when the twist came. I felt his character was portrayed very well, and came across in the right light. Amanda Seyfried also was very convincing, however, i think the best acting came from the father, (i don't know who played him), as his acting was convincing and emotional. An exquisite performance.<br/><br/>Now, i would recommend you only seeing this film if you are a fan of other movies such as - a walk to remember, the notebook, PS i love you, etc etc. Its a classic chick flick but will really bring a tear to your eye! Its not the best of endings which does let the film down a little, but, the plot is very interesting, with twists and turns along the way.<br/><br/>Oh and one last thing, you get to see Channing Tatum surfing - worth paying for if you only enjoy that part!!!!"

And to be apart while sharing in that love through letters. It shows the power of the heart and the compassion that they had for one another. Savannah supporting John's decision to re-enlist even though she knew the dangers. As hard as it must be for a man to go out and face that danger, I don't think they cold ever realize what it is to be the one waiting for them and the not knowing that comes with it.

","I'm one of those people who write reviews either if they are very pleased or very annoyed with what they've seen. This time, I'm annoyed.<br/><br/>After watching the trailer several times, I said to my boyfriend ""we have to go watch a screening of this"", but we never got to, since it never came to the cinemas in Romania. ""Never mind"", I said, ""we'll just rent the DVD"". And so we did, although he protested ""If it never got to the cinemas, it must be bad"". ""No way"", I told him, ""Nicholas Sparks wrote the book, you know, the guy who wrote The Notebook"". I ended up watching ""Dear John"" by myself, this morning.<br/><br/>OK, enough with the intro. <br/><br/>I'll start with the root of all evil, the script (the book, that is). It was shocking to see how the main characters had very similar backgrounds as the main characters from The Notebook. He's a middle class boy, and being raised only by his dad, she's from the upper social class, living in big farm house.<br/><br/>The plot is also disturbingly similar: they meet one wonderful day while she's with her friends; he does something out of the ordinary to catch her eye, and she eventually agrees to date him. They date for a short time, everything is heavenly, until he needs to go away and fight for his country. He stays away too long, she marries someone else, he's heartbroken. Somewhere along the way his dad dies and John comes home on a short leave. He sells his dad's belongings, and returns to the army. Eventually John and Savannah randomly meet and (probably) reunite. <br/><br/>OK, the cast. Well, the chemistry between Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried is really intense and it is one of things that saves this movie. The acting, I would say, is acceptable, but not necessarily the best. I would say they did what they could, given the circumstances. Music? Probably (just like the rest of the movie) intended for heartbroken teenage girls.<br/><br/>The only genuinely emotional moment (and one of the few original things in the movie), in my opinion, is when John reads his letter to his dad. Although far-fetched (I doubt an autistic person would reach out to hold another person... speaking of which, I'm wondering, how ever has John has been conceived?!), quite a touching scene.<br/><br/>I'm really sorry this film is so much under anything I had expected. And I'm really sorry I didn't choose to watch The Notebook all over again. That's a wrap!"

","Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried both give excellent performances in this film. I can tell that they are definitely two young actors with a bright future. I am a Sergeant in the Army and could immediately identify with John. He is a fine young man who wants to serve his country. This film opens in the spring of 2001, when he is on leave surfing and falls in love with Savannah, a young, idealistic college student. We see their whirlwind romance and how they pack a lifetime of joy, laughter and love into only two short weeks. He promises to come back for her when his term of enlistment is up, then America's darkest day happens and it changes everything including their promising relationship. The scriptwriter for this film is a real wizard with words especially in the touching letters the two exchange. I think that the most heart wrenching scene in the film is where he burns all her lovely letters after getting the ""Dear John"" one. This film eventually goes to 2007 when the two meet again after several years. He has been injured in combat and she has married the man we saw earlier who had the autistic son. SPOILER ALERT, I was so glad that before John's father died that he finally learned to connect with him. His father was probably autistic as well but he truly loved his son. SECOND SPOILER ALERT, John sells his father's coin collection to buy Savannah's terminally ill husband more time and that was such a noble sacrifice. The way this movie ended sort of reminded me of Sleepless In Seattle because you wonder what ultimately happened to these two people you have come to care so much about, did they finally have a happy life together as they deserved? I wanted it spelled out in the end that these two were married and lived happily ever after. John and Savannah, now older and more mature, meet in 2007 in a coffee shop after her husband has died. Earlier, the dying man said he wanted John to care for his autistic son. When they embrace, you just hope for the best. This movie is excellently acted by all involved but I wanted to especially mention the actor playing John's dad. It also has a sweet, touching musical score and a great screenplay. However, this is a movie I only want to see once in my lifetime because it is so downbeat. As a Soldier myself, I have seen what war and prolonged separations can do to even those truly in love."

It made my wife cry; we could relate to many things in it with our own, continuing love affair and even I fought back choking up.<br/><br/>This afternoon, after lots of chores, yard work and eating, we decided to actually catch a matinée. When we got to the theater, having seen most of the current batch of films playing, we elected to see ""Victoria Day"" which for some reason was not at the theater, even though both IMDb and my phone movies showed it playing there. So, instead we looked at the poster for ""Dear John"" and that it was written by the same writer as ""The Notebook"", making it the obvious choice as we enjoyed 'TN' so much.<br/><br/>What a disappointment! First, the characters did not have the same believability or sense of empathy as 'TN'; and we kept commenting throughout all the similarities -- two dozen or so -- quickly causing us to realize this movie was nothing but, as another reviewer commented, ""a poor man's Notebook!"" It had a real 'cash cow' feeling, meaning the Sparks simply threw a story together, based on the exact template of 'TN' simply to make a quick buck. Not only that, after the 'bug-eyed' trollop improbably 'Dear John's-John' for the wimp cancer patient, we ridiculed the movie with each, passing soapy stupid line all the way through to the end. There were only about 6 of us in the theater during this 4:45pm Monday matinée and my wife even told me to keep it down so I wouldn't ruin it for the others...it was so bad.<br/><br/>Seeing this on the heels of 'TN' ensured that the rip off similarities were vividly recognizable and Sparks blatant, cheap attempt at template writing painfully obvious. We only wish we could've seen ""Victoria Day"" instead...no matter how bad it might've been after seeing this poor entry to cinema. And oh..., for the last 30-minutes, I kept saying ""...don't give that cow the coins ...don't give that cow the coins?"""

","OK, it's watchable if you are sick in bed or have nothing else to do. The suspension of disbelief required to get through this movie is significant though. First, in today's modern society do you believe college coeds get THAT committed to someone in that short of a period of time even if you are a ""virtuous"" Habitat volunteer who likes autistic kids? And the 2 week romance blossoms into a letter exchange that leads to John's ""conflict"" of whether to re-enlist right after 9/11/01...REALLY? He asks her what to do? Every guy we know was NOT gonna be sitting on the sidelines after those Towers came down(my husband was one of them and I love him and am proud of him for going) John's character is so flat. He's nearly expressionless the entire movie. He's good looking but not Spec Ops...he seems unsure not confident, quiet instead of a hell-raiser, no tattoos, gets into a ""fight"" with the preppy boys that is nothing more than a pushing match really...walks around without a cover on his head nearly the whole movie...and there are military technical flaws everywhere (epaulets upside down?). The war scenes are dumb...John and another guy heading off on their own...huh?, then other guy gets shot and John drags him 10 feet and starts giving buddy aid before securing the area or back-up arrival or even having their backs against cover...it's a gunfight for God's sakes, you don't stop fighting until its over...heck I wanted to shoot John in the back. Back home, when the truth is revealed and she spills the wine...we hated her for removing her shirt in his presence...WTH? break his heart and THEN tease him into adultery? She's a head case trollop. Best part of the movie is when he drives away from her...at least he had some self respect and honor there. Overall unbelievable story and we generally did not care about these characters or their love. Dismal!"
"LogicIsEverything","Null","2","6","5 July 2019"," Ruined the true meaning of Love
","What is love? It means that once you fall in love with someone, the feeling is not just a temporary emotion, it won't change unless the one you love turns out to be unfaithful and fickle. Love someone means the whole world only that particular one you deeply care about and really care for, no matter that person is not at your side 24/7, you only focus and concentrate on that person. If love is so easily changed like what we saw in this movie, a one-sided faithfulness is meaningless and it's not love. Love is a reciprocated giving and taking to each other, not just one-sided giving but not receiving. The love in this movie didn't resonant, didn't prolong enough, didn't even pass the test of time; it's a temporary encounter, a short-lived relationship. It's just a shallow emotion, it can only hang on by seeing each other daily, not even ""often"" seeing each other could be ensure the steady growth of love.<br/><br/>As to the cast of this movie, both male and female were not an ideal choice, and the female cast was even worse. She got bulging eyeballs, three permanent deep wrinkles on forehead, lot of horizontal folding wrinkles around her neck; so young but almost looked a bit old. The male one, well, didn't look a bit like a seasoned ""Special Force"" guy but a regular grunt or a jar-head. Sparks and the director of this movie obviously got no knowledge of any military stuff.<br/><br/>Wife is a die-hard romance addict, but after watched this movie and ""The Vow"", she suddenly got so tired of this romance genre. Why? I asked her. ""Well, both movies were shallow. It never touched your heart, never gave you a deep feeling to those two characters in both movies. Watchable, but too tiresome to watch such shallow love of the younger people. There's no depth in both movies and it just ruined the interpretation of matured love and romance."""
"zardoz-13","7","2","6","8 February 2010"," The Pain and Anguish of a Long Distance Relationship
","The only thing romantic about this movie is the pain and anguish of a long distance romance and the dire consequences that occur when you are separated from your lover. If you are expecting this cinematic adaptation of another Nicholas Sparks novel to follow the surefire formula of Sparks' previous films, such as ""Message in a Bottle,"" ""Nights at Rodanthe,"" and ""A Walk to Remember,"" think again. Nobody dies from a tragic accident trying to save somebody else, though the romance here does transform these characters, but in seemingly the worst way. If anything, it makes them even more miserable than they were unless an implied eleventh hour happy ending that seems to come as an afterthought so the movie closes on an upbeat note. This is one of those romances where the least competitive character wins the girl, strictly because he is around when she needs him. Indeed, the man and the woman back home qualify as villains, while the patriotic hero is ironically the martyr.<br/><br/>A soft-spoken U.S. Special Forces Army Sergeant, John Tyree (Channing Tatum of ""G.I. Joe""), is on leave from the military when he has a memorable two-week fling with an impressionable college girl, Savannah Curtis (radiant Amanda Seyfried of ""Mamma Mia""), who is spending her spring break in South Carolina. John has spent the morning surfing. He is lounging on a pier when she spots her for the first time and she drops her purse—(""her whole life is in that bag'')-into the ocean. Before the guy with her, Randy (Scott Porter of ""Descent""), can recover the purse, John plunges into the water and retrieves it. Randy asks for the purse, but John has no intention of giving it to him. Randy and John eventually settle their differences. Anyway, John is interested in Savannah. They go out on a romantic, night-time date, and he wants to repeat the experience. Savannah doesn't drink, smoke, but she tells John that her head is filled with profanity. Inevitably, John and Savannah topple madly in love with each other and launch an endless exchange letters of love letters that are sleep-inducing by any standard. Tyree is off in the world serving the military in some godforsaken corner of the globe while she is away at college perusing his letters in class. Just as they are getting hot and heavy between them, suicidal terrorists crash planes into the World Trade Center. John reenlists along with his buddies in a wave of patriotism without discussing the option with Savannah.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, another guy, shaggy but likable family friend Tim Wheddon (Henry Thomas of ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"") who has a motherless, autistic son named Alan (Luke Benward) becomes the object of Savannah's sentiment. She is the kind of girl who helps build houses for the less fortunate and wants to start a summer horse ranch for autistic children. She is an idealist without a clue. She delays what seems forever –actually two months--before she finally contacts Tyree with the eponymous letter. Basically, Savannah dumps Tyree for a scruffy guy afflicted with cancer! This reminded me of the standard scene in a movie where the heroine rushes to the rescue of the guy who gets beaten up rather than the one who does the beating up. Later, she confesses to John that she knew the sound of his voice would have shattered her resolve to marry Tim, so she doesn't make that fateful call. <br/><br/>Predictably, John agonizes over Savannah's lack of communication. During a routine mission, our hero takes a couple of terrorist bullets in the back and winds up in a military hospital in Germany. The circumstances surrounding John's wounds are rather ironic. He is reassuring another soldier who has been by the same sniper but who survived the shooting because his body armor saved them when the bullets struck him. While all this is transpiring, Tyree is trying to come to terms with his own coin-collecting father, Mr. Tyree (Richard Jenkins of ""Step Brothers""), who suffers from Asperger's Syndrome. Their relationship is poignant and a lot is left unsaid with only the performances of the two actors to flesh it out. It seems that his father was on his last legs after John got out of the hospital. The physician who attended Mr. Tyree explains that he—John Tyree—couldn't have intervened in his father's death. Richard Jenkins delivers another devastating performance as a peripheral character whose hobby is coin-collecting, something that initially enabled him to bond with his son. The lead female character lacks a shred of respect and her betrayal of Tyree constitutes an incredibly low blow. Tyree, his father, and Tyree's commander, Captain Stone (Keith Robinson), are the only sympathetic characters in this long distance epistolary romance.<br/><br/>""Dear John"" leaves you feeling pretty low until the final scene. Tyree is a civilian who is locking his bicycle to a downtown parking meter when he spots Savannah in a restaurant. She rushes outside to hug him. ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" director Lasse Hallström and ""We Are Marshall"" scenarist Jamie Linden give us the impression that Tyree and Savannah will live happily ever after since Tyree is finished with the military and Savannah has laid Tim to rest. If you've ever had a girl dump you, this is the kind of movie that will hit you where you live. One of the best things about this film is that it knocked James Cameron's ""Avatar"" out of the top spot at the box office when it came out."
"snowflakebound","3","2","6","8 February 2010"," Silly story
","Sure, the acting was decent, the script was well written, and the music was fairly engaging. But speaking as a woman who has experienced sending her husband overseas, I think they should make a movie about a strong and capable woman who has to keep her family going when her husband leaves. Why would you write a story about ""undying love"" when the silly girl ends up marrying someone else? True love waits, there are thousands of us still waiting for our sweethearts to come home. The author of the novel obviously had no idea what he was writing about. You cannot write a good story about something that you have never been through. If you want to see what real women do when their sweethearts leave for war, watch ""We Were Soldiers."" It is the best vision of what wives experience being married to a soldier. Those women waited."

And usually that means the characters and how the character acts. Mmk? If you are complaining about Channing's acting.... Pick up the book and READ it! You will understand why his character, John is the way he is and why his acting seemed poor. <br/><br/>You will also understand his father more too. It's frustrating reading these reviews from people that are too lazy to read the book then complain about the movie. You learn A lot more about a character in a book than you do on screen. <br/><br/>I'll admit that I did expect a little more out of it but by reading the book fills in all the gaps that isn't shown in the movie. So do don't just judge a movie a base it or compare it to others.

"davispittman","1","1","2","31 March 2017"," Lackluster Sparks film adaptation
","Dear John is a movie adaptation of the popular Nicholas Sparks novel. It stars Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried. I did not enjoy this movie, it's very flawed in many ways. I love a good love story, so don't think I rated it 1 because I hate romance stories, it's just because this romance film is very dull one. From the dull acting/characters to the ever slow moving plot and boring dialogue. There isn't much in the film that isn't dull and boring. The two lead actors look the part and you'd think they'd be good fits and work well, but I just couldn't see the chemistry between them, they never made me believe they were really in love and believable chemistry is CRUCIAL in a movie like this. And to be honest, even when Seyfried or Tatum were alone, I still didn't really buy or enjoy their performances. On to the writing. It's not good. It's just about that simple, the dialogue is very dull and uninteresting, I couldn't stand the script, with dull characters saying dull lines of dialogue, one gets bored and increasingly uninterested as the movie goes along. It really does nothing to keep your attention. It's very difficult for films like this because if the romance between the two leads doesn't work, then what more do you have?? That is what the movie is ALL about, it's the basis for it and it's why people are watching it. This film just really didn't work. 1/10."

"Heffernan99","5","1","2","10 August 2013"," Good romance, easy watch, Horrible climax.
","Most romantic movies are too good to be true. Most movies have a twist towards the end due to which the relationship does not work out and its this very twist that determines the fate of the movie. A young soldier John Tyree (Tatum) is home on vacation and falls in love with a college student Savannah (Seyfried) over the summer. Savannah has to return to college and John needs to report to duty and they both promise to meet after a year. 9/11 happens and John is compelled to extend his duty and cancel leave and to serve his country. The young romance that happened over a year ago just over a couple of weeks, has blossomed to large levels over the regular exchange of letters. However, everything is too good to be true and disaster strikes. Like I send before, there always is a twist that determines the outcome of the movie. In this case, the twist was just simply lame. In fact the whole climax goes mostly unexplained and makes you wonder how that even happened and why would anyone do that. It comes across as stupid and irrational and kills the otherwise steady movie. Most of the movie is the normal blossoming of love between the two without getting too boring or too interesting. What entirely kills the movie is the final outcome. The movie is watchable for romance fans but it really wont touch you or make you go 'awwww...' towards the end."

Channing and Amanda were great together; and, just as he was perfect for a Special Ops soldier, she was perfect in just about everything she did in the film.

Amanda Seyfried's ""Letters to Juliet"" and Channing Tatum's ""The Vow"" both made me cry, and when they put them together, it certainly made me cry. It deeply moves you and it makes you think of the times when your heart was hurt by someone you love or maybe when a relationship didn't work out. It's sad but sweet, honest, and beautiful.

"rawiri42","6","1","2","5 October 2012"," What an indictment!!
","Dear John..... Well, we've heard that line before haven't we? This could have been a beautiful movie but, for me, it was totally ruined because I spent the better part of it being incensed by the way young American men allow their government to brainwash them into some sort of belief that by throwing their country's weight about all over the world, they are doing some good. They really do believe this and it's SO sad. Once upon a time, when one country wanted power, they went along to another country and had a straightforward war in which the victor became the conquering ruler and, rightly or wrongly, that was that. In fact, when you think about it, the first European settlers did just that in North and south America. The native peoples were decimated under some guise of ""civilization"" (which is simply a word meaning ""OUR way of thinking"") in which untold atrocities were committed and it was all OK! The ""cowboys"" were the good guys and the ""Indians"" were the bad guys and no one ever disputed that (except, of course, the native Americans whose ancestral lands were simply annexed by the superiorly armed immigrants.) <br/><br/>Well, nowadays, that isn't so fashionable. Modern conventions dictate that, when one country colonises another, they not only reap the natural resources but they also have something called responsibility - and that can sometimes be expensive! So modern America has realised that a much more economical strategy is to simply ""help"" countries where there is political unrest to ""democratically"" install their own leaders (just so long as those leaders are the ones that America wants!!!) and then reap the benefits without any of the responsibility. (It failed miserably with the Taliban in Afghanistan didn't it?!! And now America is spending even more of her taxpayers' money and, in the context of this movie, her young men in a pathetic attempt to rectify it. And, what's even worse, by using bullying tactics like guaranteeing ""security"" to smaller nations, they have conned them into joining them in their conflicts.)<br/><br/>OK, so what has all this got to do with ""Dear John"" the movie? Who else but such a brainwashed, virile young man with a beautiful girl waiting at home to be his wife would volunteer to extend his tour of ""duty""? I put the word ""duty"" in quotes because that is exactly what the American government have so successfully indoctrinated so many of her young men and women to sincerely believe it is - when, in actual fact, all they are is cannon-fodder for the politicians' power games. And what is truly SO sad is that they don't even realise it!!<br/><br/>A (very) few Islamic extremists committed vile atrocities on September 11th 2001 and, within hours, the American government assisted by the irresponsible American media succeeded in inflaming practically the whole population into a frenzied hatred of anything Muslim or even middle eastern (but they didn't stop them using middle eastern oil!!!). I believe that even after over ten years since the New York attack, there are still Americans who don't realise that it probably caused more embarrassment and shame to Islam than it did to anyone else. There will always be extremists in all walks of life. (What, for example, is the general American attitude towards the KKK right there in their own midst?) How many American citizens are Muslims who just want to live in peace with the freedom to follow their own faith IN America? And how many of them are ashamed of what a small minority are costing their country because their own government haven't got the brains to see what's in front of their noses?<br/><br/>But then I suppose there wouldn't have been a story if John had acted rationally and taken the opportunity to return to a normal life and be with his dad when he had a stroke and with his girl who gave him a hell of a lot more chance than he deserved! The love story of movie is lost in a sad political statement on corrupt American politics!"
"garden-17","10","1","2","19 May 2012"," Dear John--An Honest Review
","John Tyree (Channing Tatum) is a rebel, who has been changed by life in the Army; Savannah Curtis (Amanda Seyfried) is a caring, compassionate woman. The two meet, and have an immediate and intense connection; however, September 11th will change their lives and loves (and the lives and loves of everyone else in the world) forever.<br/><br/>Acting: I think the acting is stellar! Channing is very believable and sympathetic is John; Seyfried is perfect as Savannah (when I read the book that the film is based on, I always envisioned her as Savannah)! While I think the actor playing Tim is miscast (it should have been a younger actor, in my opinion), he still wasn't too bad. Everyone did a fine job! Music: The score in this film is, by and large, one of the best scores I have ever heard. Ms. Lurie did a fantastic job, blending classical-type instruments with a sort of Southern style. It's amazing! And the non-instrumental songs used in the film (like ""The Moon"", for example) are also excellent! Editing: The editing is a little sloppy, but it didn't really detract from my enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>Differences Between The Film and The Book: There are many differences between the novel and this movie. Tim is older in the movie than he was in the book; Tim has a lymphoma in the movie, while in the book he has melanoma; in the book, Alan is Tim's brother, not his son; John fights in Afghanistan in the movie, instead of Iraq; and so forth, and so on. While differences like these definitely changed the film, it could've been a whole lot worse. In my opinion, the book is more about emotions that build up over time, while the movie is more about spontaneous emotions. Either way, I think that these differences are endearing. And even if I'm wrong, the movie still shed light on an excellent novel! Overall: Yes, this film has flaws. The editing is okay; some characters are under-developed (.i.e.: Mr. Tyree), while others are over-developed (.i.e.: Randy); the film is long, too. But, in the end, I believe it to be a very beautiful, romantic film. I will defend this film--and the novel--'til the day that I die. I give ""Dear John"" a 10 out of 10!"
"ruthnoakes","5","1","2","6 September 2010"," Dear John, sob stories don't ensure a great movie. Richard Jenkins was the best part!
","Despite my reluctance, I just watched Dear John (2010), directed by Lasse Hallström. This is because my friend insisted.<br/><br/>It's not entirely fair for me to slate the filmmakers just because I did not enjoy it at all. My lack of enjoyment came mainly from the fact that I'm not a stereotypical girl who falls for the lead male every time, or dreams of that kind of thing. I have everything I need in that department. I do like films about love, but they must have something more to offer.<br/><br/>So, aside from getting people to relate to the smushy love scenes, what else does this film have to offer?<br/><br/>Well, my favourite aspect was John's father, played by Richard Jenkins. He has always had an affinity to play loner roles, and fatherly ones. Six Feet Under, the Television series which ran from 2001-2005, is a good example, with his role as Nathaniel Fisher.<br/><br/>I loved his fragility, it evoked more feeling from me than Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried's love scenes ever did. His coin collection made a great metaphor throughout the film, and was like another character.<br/><br/>Sympathy tactics are not enough to make a great movie for me though, it did not change the fact that the film was predictable, relatively shallow, and did not fully convince me. Despite all-round acceptable performances, Richard Jenkins was the only fully convincing part."
"TxMike","Null","1","2","22 June 2010"," A rather nice romantic story, I found it better than the critics suggest.
","The story is set in 2001 and the years immediately following. The year is important because the event of 9-11-2001, the destruction of NYC's twin towers by terrorists, becomes the big event that deflects an otherwise simple relationship story. Set in Charleston, South Carolina and surrounding areas.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum is John Tyree, Army Special Ops, and we meet him as he lies wounded in Afghanistan. But the story then quickly flashes back to 2001, in the summer when he was 21. The handbag of a very cute girl accidentally gets knocked off a pier and into the water, and while one suitor goes towards the shore to try to retrieve the bag the easy way, John jumps directly into the water to get the bag. He becomes the girl's instant hero.<br/><br/>The girl is pretty Amanda Seyfried as Savannah Curtis. She will soon be starting her final year of college. While John is on two weeks' leave they fall into, as Ebert says, ""PG-13 Love."" (Roger Ebert gives this movie a low rating, but to me it is better than that.)<br/><br/>John is to finish out his remaining year of duty, while Savannah finishes out her remaining year of college, they will reunite then live happily ever after. That was their plan, until the 9-11 event. But then everything changes.<br/><br/>The other key characters are Richard Jenkins as Mr. Tyree, quiet, shy, methodical, and consumed by his coin collection, which is extensive. <br/><br/>Henry Thomas (of 'E.T.' fame) is Tim Wheddon, local friend of Savannah's family, with a small autistic son.<br/><br/>Good movie, examines the realities of life and how major events can cause plans to be scrapped. <br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS: After 9-11 John re-ups along with his squad, he and Savannah keep in touch by letters, until he fails to hear from her for weeks. When he finally does she tells him she can't wait anymore and is engaged. He eventually finds out it is Tim that she marries, but now Tim has cancer and money has run out. Also John's dad dies. Anonymously, John sells the coin collection and donates the money to Tim's cause. In the end, much later, we see Savannah in a café and John outside, they see each other, she goes outside and embrace. The ending isn't explained, but one possibility is they eventually got together after Tim died."

He was also supposed to be only a little older than Savannah. They cut out most of the middle of the book and the ending was totally different - Savannah and John never ended up together.<br/><br/>The story was changed completely and you didn't really get an idea of how much they loved each other - it all seemed a bit superficial.

"tomb_92","4","1","2","12 May 2010"," Not what I expected at all. Really don't bother
","I wasn't particularly looking forward to this film, yet I did like The Notebook, a film also along the same lines and by the same author. The reason The Notebook works is that it tells a story of love and human emotion over the course of a lifetime- something not really done by many films, but not just that, it's a heartwarming film. It's not necessarily realistic, and yet it's the story of true love above and beyond all else, something most couples like to relate to. The problem with Dear John was not the storyline. I thought the story was very appropriate, given the circumstances the armed forces find themselves in at the moment and I was intrigued by the situation. The problem was thus, apart from the war and a couple of other things throughout the film nothing much happens. The problem is lack of plot. The Notebook was a story about a man telling a story about lovers, which worked because it was interesting and there was always a sense of mystery. In the case of Dear John the story is virtually none existent. They fall in love, he leaves, and that's just the set-up, and it takes a while for that to get going, after which nothing much of any interest happens. It is nowhere near as emotional as The Notebook, mostly because the characters in Dear John just aren't as likable, I actually started to find one in particular very annoying. The acting isn't great in Dear John either, in complete contrast to The Notebook. I have already mentioned that The Notebook is the definitive story about a story above and beyond all else. In the case of Dear John, I just wasn't feeling that at all. It was actually very depressing at times. The Notebook deals with one very difficult subject, yet I think it does it very well, Dear John just made be think- why go to see thins film? You will get nothing out of it, and the ending, whilst realistic, is not satisfying at all for the genre. I did enjoy the subplot about the boy's autistic father, whose acting is the one good exception. If you want to see a story about autism though you watch Rain Man, not this.

","well, i have not read the book so this is not a comparison between the book and the screen.the plot is running a bit fast and the romance is built up rather quickly and the worst part is the story deviates its course in an abrupt way. the story is so simple and predictable.<br/><br/>but the characters have really put themselves into it.as many complains channing tatum is not giving too much expressions but taking into account his character its acceptable. he is a soldier and a tough guy with a tough past but how he changes himself for love is impressive.his appearance and built is appealing.he does a nice job in the last melancholic scenes.<br/><br/>amanda seyfried has done a wonderful part 'living' the character.'acting' as we see it of julia roberts or meg ryan is not seen here but she is simple,sun shine and just lively.its more natural.especially the last but one shot where tatum leaves her home,she has done a wonderful job.the music is so lively and strengthens the moments. the last scenes may not break you into tears but i am sure you will enjoy watching it again.<br/><br/>the plot was never ending in a doom or destruction as many has said but its beautiful in that the couple still loves each other,how badly she needs him and how he understands her situation and forgives her and helps her at the same time he cant accept her as before because she is another man's wife.the reason she has for leaving him is not a selfish one but is from her deep love to tim and alan and her sacrificial caring.even though an apparent tragedy follows when tatum says goodbye the movie ends with a ray of hope.<br/><br/>its a good movie,an ordinary story with beautiful moments and natural characters and a good message."

","Green Beret John Tyree (Channing Tatum), home on two week/s' leave, falls for student Savannah (Amanda Seyfried) and vice versa. When he goes back to his unit and she goes on to university they console themselves with the fact that they will only be apart for a year until John's discharge and, during that time, they can bridge the gap between them with letters. Then 9/11 happens and John signs up for another tour. And it isn't long before John gets a ""Dear John"" letter (OK, so they all are, but you know what I mean).<br/><br/>Much of this is amiable enough, mildly emotional if essentially somewhat inconsequential, and enlivened by some rather unexpected plot developments towards the end.<br/><br/>An interesting wrinkle is added by John's father's borderline autism, sensitively portrayed by Richard Jenkins, who is head and shoulders the best thing in this movie. Jenkins is one of those actors who has been in loads of things, is always first rate, you always recognise him, and you can't remember his name. He is excellent here, although the character's condition begs the question of how he managed as a single father to bring up a son on his own: indeed, how he managed to have paternity attributed and custody awarded.<br/><br/>I didn't care for the ending or how it was arrived at."

","When I saw who the actors were I had a few doubts (Seyfried comes across as a little one dimensional) but after watching the film (Tatum in particular!) I stand in awe. It's a very simple, very strong story about real people and experiences we all can connect with and for me it was a testament to love in a hard, confusing world. Tatum channels genuine emotion and looks like a million bucks. Strong control of the dramatic and emotional scenes opposite a worthy heroine, Seyfried. The way the director has set up the scenes and let the story flow is mesmerising and the filming has clarity and transmits emotions well. Great settings and compositions. It's refreshing, inspiring and inasmuch as some might expect another 'Stop-loss' this story is solely about the characters, not the same message he portrayed so well in his previous war film. There's a great amount of depth to the purity and hope in this film. And while moving at an easy pace it certainly doesn't drag but rather lets the audience transport into their lives. <br/><br/>Best film i've seen in months."
"grungeandglitter","1","2","7","11 February 2010"," A disappointment for Nicholas Sparks fans!
","After reading the reviews I am so relieved to know that I am not the only person who was very disappointed in this movie! I am a HUGE Nicholas Sparks fan, have read ALL of his books, most of them more than once. Of course I LOVED The Notebook and A Walk to Remember...I haven't yet seen Message in a Bottle or Nights in Rodanthe so I can't comment on those...<br/><br/>But I did go see Dear John this past weekend and I was terribly upset! The movie was not good at all! When looking at the movie alone, and not thinking about the book at all, it was still a terrible movie. I did not get the rush and range of emotions from this movie that I have got from other movies I enjoyed, especially The Notebook. I was not smiling and laughing and crying and worried and scared...ever! From the very beginning all I could notice was how they changed everything! The only thing about this movie that is similar to the book is that there is a guy named John who is in the military and a girl named Savannah who is not....the part about his Dad being obsessed with coins is about the only other part that went along with the book. Everything else was totally off!!!! First of all, in the book, Allen was Tim's little brother, NOT his son! WHY they had to change that, I don't understand. It made a lot more sense how it went in the book when Tim was just a little bit older than Savannah and they grew up together and Allen was Savannah's inspiration for wanting to work with horses and autistic children....that didn't happen in the movie....ugh...And in the book they spent a lot more time together than just those initial 2 weeks and then the 1 night...why did they leave those times out??? I could go on and on and on but then I would run out of space! So basically, if you are a great fan of Nicholas Sparks, don't waste your time or money on this movie...just read the book again...because it's terrible and nothing like the book!"
"babie_gurl_16","10","2","7","8 February 2010"," Beautiful Film
","Truly a great movie. Movie adaptations of Nicholas Sparks's books are never a disappointment, and Dear John was not an exception. The casting was great and the acting was very convincing. The storyline was very engaging and took you on an emotional journey from the beginning to the end. There is also a touching subplot which makes the movie that much more interesting. The storyline was great and was anything but predicting and cliché, as many romantic films are. The storyline is relate-able, even for people who don't know any soldiers, as it deals with love and family and the complexities of life. Definitely worth watching."

"someguy2013","4","1","3","15 June 2010"," bad girl porn
","I am a male, but I do like some romantic comedies. Before I saw it, all I really knew about this movie was that it was a romance and it had Amanda Seyfried in it. Yes, Miss Seyfried is beautiful. Also. Mr. Tatum provides plenty of eye candy for the women(and men of a different sexual persuasion, I suppose). Seyfried's acting is OK, but Tatum's is fairly terrible. His wooden performance and his looks would make him perfect to be a third love interest for Bella Swan in the Twilight movies. <br/><br/>Like Twilight, this movie is pure girl porn! I felt like I needed a brown paper bag just to take it from the Red Box. The movie starts off as a fairly sweet love story:soldier on leave meets college student on spring break(one that apparently lasts two or three weeks,oddly), they fall in love over the next few weeks, they have to go their separate ways but agree to write each other letters(only snail mail, no email and very little cell phone interaction; This is all justified by just saying that he's in some far off desolate places for the military where they don't have email, etc),etc. He's only supposed to be away for a year, but then Sept. 11 happens and he re-enlists for two more years at least. She oppose this, but he does it anyway. This is perhaps a mistake in terms of their relationship, but it is understandable. <br/><br/>As he stays overseas at war, her letters start coming less frequently. Finally, she sends him a stereotpyical ""dear john"" letter(what else, give this movie's title?) where she tells him that she is now engaged to another man. Up to this point, everything seems sad but believable. It makes sense that she would move on and marry someone else with him gone for so long, but the reason eventually given just seems ridiculous to me. Her proverbial ""dear john"" letter, causes him to burn all his other letters from her, and he stays overseas in the military for a few more years. <br/><br/>He is finally brought up by his father's impending death. The subplot with his father is actually one of the better parts of the movie, the constant reference to coins is annoying(though necessary, I suppose, given his father's apparent autism and his obsession with coins). Anyway, he stops by the ranch owned by Seyfried's character. He finds he there, and they talk. <br/><br/>Here is where the story jumped the shark for me. We find out that he man she married is actually her much older family friend- a single dad whose son also has autism. The man got cancer, and somehow Seyfried's character got so entangled in the lives of him and his son that she actually married. From the dialogue, it doesn't seem like she really ever loves him like a husband. In fact, she seems to still love Tatum's character like that the whole time. But she says that she ""had no choice"". Really? Certainly, there are other things she could have done to help a much older man with cancer whose son has autism. Did she really have to marry him even if she didn't love him like that? Did they ever actually engage in marital relations, or was this just a scheme to get her guardianship of the boy when his dad dies? Aren't there easier ways to do that? And surely her family could have helped give him financial support during his cancer without her marrying him. He was an old family friend. Maybe the book explains the situation better, but it just seemed kinda ludicrous to me. <br/><br/>Then there's the end. Tatum's character and her husband get an ""anonymous"" donation(three guesses as to who the donor is!) that allows him to get an experimental treatment. From what I gather on the internet, the book ends with her husband living for a while longer and her not seeing Tatum's character again. That is also the alternate ending of the movie. But the more ""happy"" ending use in the movie is that the ""miracle drug"" only gives her huband a few more months(some miracle). He dies, then Tatum and Seyfried are free to get back together. We see them meeting again at the end of the movie. Which ending is better? The alternate ending seems more true to the spirit of the story. The actual movie ending seems like a typical cheap movie sellout. It doesn't really matter to me though. The story seemed somewhat implausible to me anyway. Also, the dialogie is not very good. The part at the beginning about Tatum's character being a ""coin in the army"" is just laughable. If this is what a typical Nicholas Sparks book/movie is like, I should probably skip the rest of them."

I could hear her sniffling beside me which brought me to tears.<br/><br/>The part that got her the most was when Tatum is giving his father the speech and the father slowly passes away.<br/><br/>This movie was very moving and if you are ever in a situation like this then you will know what I mean .. Granted the storyline was a little slow but it made for a more in depth movie worthy of the 9 dollars(CND) one would have to pay just for the ticket.<br/><br/>Channing did a wonderful job in this movie especially with the emotionally charged death scene.<br/><br/>Where as I found Amanda to be very calm and honestly just Meh through out the movie I did not enjoy her acting but I could be bias considering the last movie I saw her in was mean girls and that seemed to suit her better Still its a very good movie"

","As much as all the teenage girls (myself included) enjoyed Channing Tatum, the lack of accuracy from the book to the movie ruined it. I thought that I would have liked it more as it is a happier ending for their relationship (not so much for Tim). When I read the book, I truly loved following their relationship through the ups and downs, and I loved that ending, just knowing that they were all happy how it turned out. Their whole relationship feels so rushed and not as sweet and innocent as in the book. You get little to no information about Savannah's background. I hate to say it because I love the characters in the book, but you kind of begin not to care about John and Savannah because you know very little about them. The character I cared for the most was his dad. That is the only part where I cried. Again, either read the book after the movie or prepare for change and disappointment."
"Eunjeen","6","1","4","8 February 2010"," The book was much better
","I had read the book a few weeks before the movie, and will say I was disappointed by the movie. Though Channing and Seyfriend give great performances (I was very pleasantly surprised by Channing's), and the father-son scenes are very touching, the plot itself was rather confusing. The ending did not have nearly as much insight as the book did, only indicating that John paid for the treatment, but not his motivations and reasoning behind it, like the book. The first few scenes of the movie didn't seem to give the characters enough time to develop the chemistry that was later seen between them. It seemed a bit too ""fast-fowarded"" for me, but some make take to that. The best scenes in the movie, by far, were the intense scenes with John and his father, especially the ""hospital scene,"" in which Channing gives a great performance. Overall, a good movie, but the book is much, much better (as with many films adapted from books)."
"xoxoJuliexoxo","6","1","4","6 February 2010"," Poor Nicholas Sparks........ Another One of His Stories Wasted
","I feel terrible for Nicholas Sparks. The only one of his books that was done correctly on screen was The Notebook and that was only because of the amazingness of Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, and the rest of the cast and crew. That dedication that The Notebook cast had was missing from this movie. <br/><br/>First of all, putting two big names into a movie can be both good and bad. For the good, they will bring interest to the movie, but they are sometimes not the best for the part. When The Notebook was casted (Sorry to keep bringing it up, but it is a good comparison.), I don't think I had really heard much of the two leads. Dear John on the other hand has Channing Tatum (Step Up, She's The Man, movies that people who will watch this movie have seen) and Amanda Seyfried (Mamma Mia, Mean Girls, Big Love). These two are well-known in the chick- flick genre. I'm pretty sure that both Tatum and Seyfried were most likely offered the roles. <br/><br/>(Spoilers) Getting down to the actual movie, the beginning was great. It showed how John and Savannah were falling in love quite well. But, unfortunately, it failed to show the relationship between Savannah and Tim, therefore, shocking most of the audience who had not read the book when it is revealed that Tim and Savannah had gotten married. Also, I would have preferred to see less of the military life, and more of Savannah's story back home which might have held my attention a little bit better. <br/><br/>So overall, I give it a six. It could have been way better, but it could have been worse. So, although disappointed, I recommend you see for yourself."

","Having not read the novel, and having no expectations, Dear John is about what expected it to be. It's passable due to the characters and their motives. Several critics claim Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried didn't have great chemistry but thought it was believable.<br/><br/>The film may be slower than other romantic dramas but there is a pay off in the end, and unlike many of these types of films, Dear John isn't completely predictable. Then the twist in the film happens regarding a tragic event (9/11) which took off guard but was plausible.<br/><br/>Though what did not completely like was near the ending in regards to Savannah ending the relationship with John because her close friend and neighbor Tim was sick and his son needed care. This has obviously been brought up by reviews but made little sense as to why she needed to marry him in order to take care of him. There didn't seem to hint at any romance with one another throughout the film.<br/><br/>Then of course in the very end more years have now passed and she's writing a letter to John mentioning that Tim has passed away from cancer. And eventually (at least what is implied) is that John and Savannah end up with each other at last- when he meets or sees her in a coffee shop. So in the end, a sad yet happy ending."

Every single person in this world has at some point experienced some form of heartbreak and tragedy whether that be through cancer, death, a heartbreak from a lover, or illness. <br/><br/>""Dear John"" is no exception to this pattern. The two fall in love, become separated by John getting deployed to help with 9/11 and by the time he comes back she is already married to someone else. Of course though they are still in love. John makes a big decision to help pay for Savannah's husband's treatment when he is diagnosed with cancer even though John would have liked to be the one to end up with her. John and Savannah do not end up together. Despite heartbreak and tragedy the theme remains the same. <br/><br/>However, it is to make the point that heartbreak and tragedy are very real and occur in real lives.

","Dear John (2010): Dir: Lasse Hallstrom / Cast: Channing Tatum, Amanda Seyfried, Richard Jenkins, Henry Thomas, Scott Porter: Terrific romance about sincerity. It stars Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried as a love lorn couple who are separated when he goes off to serve in the military and she goes back to school. Well written love story with a little touch of reality in the end. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom with great war footage. Hallstrom previously made such films as The Unfinished Life and Chocolat. His films often deal with affliction from an emotional stand point but this is one of his best efforts. Tatum plays off the grief and frustration of balancing family, relationships and careers. When first seen he is on the beach home visiting without realizing that his yearning to return to combat will be tested. Seyfried glows in her performance as her dedication to Tatum is tested. She has a love for the mentally handicapped that may stem from her inability to express herself correctly. Richard Jenkins steals scenes as Tatum's father who collects coins and suffers from a mental disorder. He is widowed but passes time by cooking for his son who struggles to understand or relate. Henry Thomas factors in as a friend of Seyfried's who has a son with a mental disorder. He comes off as a protective sibling who sees Seyfried as good yet perhaps naive. Scott Porter ends up playing the target of Tatum's fist. He is a friend of the Thomas character and mainly seen as a character of conflict. Great romance that tests the endurance of relationships and those other elements that are worth writing home about. Score: 9 ½ / 10"

"pc95","4","0","1","10 August 2013"," Too Many Problems
","""Dear John"" directed by Lasse Holstrom is a poor effort with a bunch of different problems. (Spoilers) Neither Channing nor Sieyfried are very good, and the direction doesn't help either. Sieyried looks too young the part, and an older more mature actress would've improved this minor problem. They sometimes sleepwalk through scenes, but that's not the main problem. The main issue is the cruddy Music Video Cuts that occur at least in 20 min of the movie. We've seen this in too many movies of late - it's a lazy out for directors who don't want to spend the time to hash out good dialog or real scenes. Here, it's over-indulged like food to a glutton. These scenes are wash-overs, contributing little if anything, and they last too long. Something else, watching letter writing scenes with narration doesn't work - it's b-o-r-i-n-g and should've been cut. Actor Richard Jenkins has a good supporting part in the movie but is underwritten. And the last 3rd of the movie doesn't work, it feels like the filmmakers want to create some sort of fairy- tale scenario - it wasn't at all believable.. Yes, There's just too many problems - and it's a poor movie for it. Can't recommend - 4/10"

","I really thought it was a good movie. Romantic, but not to cheesy. I think mostly women would love it. The Notebook is one of the favorite movies for most of the women, but I think this almost could compete with it. At least, I enjoyed it. I love to see Amanda Seyfried play. I love the way she acts. Normally I'm not really a fan of Channing Tatum's work, but this time, I thought he pulled it off really well. He always plays the tough guy. He also does that in this movie, but he can also show the emotions. Maybe this movie isn't really cultural or literal or something like that, but I think it's a movie you can enjoy, with a few tears now and then."

","The two leads have chemistry on screen and are attractive, which is why films are made in the first place. The movie does a better job than the book in showing a realistic portrayal of John. His voice in the book seems too similar to that of Wilson Lewis from ""The Wedding"" and I wasn't convinced that his voice and actions matched - he didn't come across as a soldier to me. The film, however, shows a guy who seems like he would have been a rebel, makes a believable soldier and is a handsome match for his pretty love interest. This may be way too cliché for some, but you would guess that from the movie poster, let alone the trailer. Some of the low ratings are based on not liking these types of films. There are some choppy moments especially at the end. (SPOILER) It's hard to know if they're meeting in Germany and if he's in or out of the service. I like his bicycle, a change from his dad's big, old Lincoln. Speaking of Lincoln, the coin imagery at the beginning was a good tie-in. If you like these kinds of mushy story lines, you won't be disappointed. Now a film like ""The Vow"" seems more unrealistic than this one."

The filming, locations, characters and storyline all make for a movie worth watching. My advice is, don't have amazing expectations, it wont be as good as the notebook, but if thats a film you like, then definitely watch this, its a really great film, easy going, enjoyable but still with a worthwhile and believable storyline, and it will leave you feeling happy, so what more could you want :)"

","From director Lasse Hallström (What's Eating Gilbert Grape, The Cider House Rules) and writer Nicholas Sparks (The Notebook), this looked and sounded like it was going to be a very worthwhile tragic or whatever romance story, so I had to see it. Basically John Tyree (Step Up's Channing Tatum) is on two weeks leave from Germany as a Special Forces Army Sergeant, and he has returned to his hometown and father Mr. Tyree (Richard Jenkins). After saving her purse from the ocean water, he meets University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill college student Savannah Curtis (Mamma Mia! star Amanda Seyfried), who is on spring break, and they start a very quick friendship. After just helping out rebuilding the house that collapsed, John and Savannah did not expect to fall in love, but of course they have to part ways when he goes back to the army and she returns to college. But they both make a promise to write letters and keep in touch during the twelve months, and for many months this does work out and they tell each other everything, but John makes the hasty decision to stay behind after events of 9/11. There is a point however when Savannah stops writing, and John is very concerned, and eventually she does write and reveals, to his devastation, that she has been seeing and is now married to cancer suffering Tim Wheddon (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial's Henry Thomas). After avoiding it for almost two years, John does eventually go home and obviously has to face Savannah about what has happened since they last wrote to each other, and Tim himself knows that she still loves him. But after the death his father, John decides to let Savannah go, he anonymously donates the money needed to help Tim, he sells his father's beloved coin collection, apart from his one favourite coin, and he and Savannah remain good friends. Also starring Scott Porter as Randy, D.J. Cotrona as Noodles, David Andrews as Mr. Curtis, Keith Robinson as Captain Stone and Cullen Moss as Dan 'Rooster' Rooney. Tatum and Seyfried give both loving and tragic performances, and as a couple they are pretty perfect, despite its cheesy moments and slightly predictable material, it is quite an emotional story that can affect both the women and the men, a most watchable romantic drama. Very good!"

","Another reflection of our times! The theatres seem crammed with movies revolving in some way around 9/11 now, and I don't think I have seen a bad one yet. This may not be a great movie but it is worth seeing.<br/><br/>Of course there is the love story, and I think there is great chemistry between John and Savannah, and it starts with his chivalry from the very beginning on the beach. Fantastic! Then there is the historical value. Pay attention to the dates! (Your watching a movie about a soldier that starts in ""Spring, 2001."") And then there is the autism. Another incredible piece of work by Richard Jenkins.<br/><br/>The three themes are all very realistic, there is no mushy fantasy in this film. In fact, there is the hardcore reality. Savannah is revealed as a girl who just wants to do the right thing, John is damaged goods, suffering from the same neglect by his mother, that little Alan is. Som great, intimate conversations throughout the movie, lots of little nuances only the astute will pick up.<br/><br/>Don't be getting up and down during this movie because you will miss something.<br/><br/>I was glad that they did not belabor the war effort here. We got a good flavor of it but it was more about the pain of leaving love ones behind, then the pain of the war itself.<br/><br/>I almost forgot to mention the coins, What a phenomenal use of symbolism. ""I was minted in 1980."" Just beautiful.<br/><br/>I encourage anyone to watch this movie. Touching, riveting, and just deep enough to choke you up every now and then."

I've read a few reviews and part of the audience didn't get the right feel of the chemistry between the lead actorsI don't know, for me it was genuine and realistic, I might be looking at it from a different perspective because I found in Channing Tatum's character many similarities to my own person and situation that I was also faced with so maybe I had a better take on that.

"svs95","10","0","1","14 October 2010"," Movies are works of art unto themselves
","People who read the book and were disappointed with the movie need get a clue! I love books (I work for a major publisher). But I also love good movies (of which there are not nearly enough IMHO). This is a good movie. Forget the book. Please! If movies adhered slavishly to books, there would be no cinema art. A book can be the inspiration, the idea, the launchpad of cinematic art, but faithfulness to a book is not the gold standard of movie greatness. If it were, most movies would fail miserably.<br/><br/>Sadly, what I think is really behind most of the negativity about this movie is that this story reveals the shallowness of contemporary American culture. What do modern audiences care about things like duty, honor, sacrifice, and the denial of self for a higher cause? Savannah says to John, ""don't ever tell me I don't understand."" And she's right. In the end, her choice is just like his - no choice at all. People who have the capacity to give whatever it takes to make the world a better place, in whatever way life presents that opportunity, and the sense of duty to do so, find that they really have no choice. They simply do it.<br/><br/>That's the key to understanding and loving this movie. These are two people I fell in love with for the depth of their honor, the gut-wrenching sadness of their sacrifice, and the hope of a reward no less sweet for having been postponed by cruel circumstances. They each did the right thing, more than once actually, and we could use a lot more like them."

Aren't there any discussions with the director or the production designer out there that will clue me in on the ending a little better? Clearly, he was either on leave or out of the army completely because he had his gotee just like in the beginning of the movie. I need more background on this.

","Right when I viewed the trailer for this movie I knew I had to read the book first. The book was amazing considering it was by Nickolas Sparks and I couldn't wait to see the movie. I went and saw Dear John the day it came out and the theater was packed. I was thinking this movie is going to be a hit. However, I was disappointed in a lot of ways. I didn't enjoy the movie like I thought because it didn't follow the book as well as I think it should have. The movie would have been great if I hadn't read the book. I only knew what was going on throughout the film because I had read the book. If it wasn't for that I would have been lost throughout some of the parts. They made things happen too quickly and being a movie about two people falling in love things shouldn't have happened as fast as they did. Yeah it was only two weeks that the are together when they meet before he goes off to Iraq but they didn't show enough of the two weeks of them together and them falling in love. They also messed up with the characters. Tom, Savannah's close friend is married and has a son. The son in the movie however is supposed to be his brother. I don't think they should have swapped it around. Also I feel they should have had John visit her while Savannah is at school like he did in the book. I feel that was an important part and it made the sex scene more meaningful instead of outside in the barn. There are a few more things here and there but the main thing I did not like was that they changed the ending of the movie. In the end they are not supposed to end up back with each other. In the book it closes off with John selling the coins and it saves Tom's life. Then she steps out on the porch and looks at the moon with her thumb and John is standing outside from a distance watching her. Yeah its not a happy ending but it was the original ending from the book. In the end the movie wasn't a disaster and renting it the other day made me realize its not so bad of a movie however they should have followed the book all the way. In my opinion The Notebook did a better job when it came to sticking to the original story."

","Dear John Oh, great! A movie about a prostitute making amends for her misdeeds by writing personal letters to each of her past clients. Oops, this movie isn't about a penitent whore; it's about a useless war. While on vacation, Savannah (Amanda Seyfried) meets John (Channing Tatum), a soldier on leave. Forming an instant rapport, he allows her into his life, which includes his autistic father (Richard Jenkins). Later – when school and the War in Iraq separates them – they stay in contact via letters. But when Savannah sends word that she's engaged to another, John's correspondence abruptly ends. Years later, her reasons are explained. Though it contains the same hallmarks as every other adaptation of a Nicholson Sparks novel, i.e. love, death, Dear John's love story is more paternal than heterosexual and its various deaths are entirely unexpected.

There is a twist coming here and it does not make sense because during this time away the audience never gets to see Savannah's pain and longing to be with John. Instead she all but disappears from the film for a while as the trauma and horror John faces in the army takes precedent. Therefore Savannah's revelation to John - which ultimately ends their romance - leaves the audience hating her as oppose to understanding her pain and heartbreak she must have obviously went through being away from John for so long.<br/><br/>There is a scene in the film - it's the one where the film's poster is taken - where they're both sitting on the shore by the beach and she whispers something to John that ultimately turns out to be a silly joke. Had the writers chose to go down that route and make it that what she whispers to John turns out to be true which she later keeps from him, this film could have been saved.<br/><br/>Otherwise the current ending falls flat and I don't believe Savannah is ever redeemed in the audience eyes that will make the audience want to see her with John again."

"montera_iulian","6","0","1","3 May 2010"," Not boring, not bad directed, not bad acted but not what I expected
","I was expecting much more from this movie, not in the matter of acting but storytelling. The script was mediocre, it was not bad but nothing to get me impressed, nothing to really touch me. At point the story lost it's credibility and became dull. The movie started well but was filled with some scenes that don't have a sense to be in this movie, it was a little bit slow-paced and that disturbed me also. The dialogue was clicheic, nothing impressive.<br/><br/>As far as acting goes, I was not expecting something outstanding from the main characters but Channing Tatum really delivered an OK performance besides Richard Jenkins who shows stability and consistency as an actor. What I wasn't feeling was the chemistry between him and Amanda Seyfried because there is no chemistry between them. They don't fit together, they were too distant for that kind of relationship they had. It didn't matter if they were fighting, having fun, kissing and holding each other or having a serious conversation, they were not believable as a couple.<br/><br/>The movie was edited very nice, audio and video, and the cinematography was actually pretty cool, nothing extraordinary but on point and not stupid made. The music used in this film did fit the scenes were it was involved character relationships and all of that but did not fit the ""war""-scenes. And by the way, about the war, the movie sucks as far as scenes from the actual life that John has on the battlefield. Just watch the movie and you'll see what I'm talking about, but why am I surprised? It's supposed to be a movie a love-drama movie not a war-epic theater experience so... don't blame me for wanting more from it...<br/><br/>At the end the movie was not boring, was not bad directed and definitely was not bad acted but it was not what most of the people I think they were expecting, but to not talk for the ""audience"" I'd just say that I was expecting much more from it based on the actual trailer. The story should have been more complex as far as inner conflicts and actual inter-relationships between the characters."

","Nicholas Sparks is the mastermind of incredibly-moving ""The Notebook"" (2004). Lasse Hallström tries to tell another Sparks's novel in a movie. Recently, we have seen other Hallström's direction in heartwarming ""Hachiko: A Dog's Story"" (2009). Both of them made thiz romantic drama worth it to be waited. But in the implementation, something is out of track. The story is about Savannah (Amanda Seyfried) who accidentally met John (Channing Tatum) in one fine summer on the beach. They fell in love with each other and now they have to go through a long distance relationship when John is sent away to his military mission. The Director Lasse Hallström tries to capture it with simplicity. In fact, almost all of Hallström's movies are filled with simplicity. It seems to me his simplicity made the drama comes out naturally and effectively. Richard Jenkins made a brief but incredible small role as John's father. Seyfried always looks lovable, her character is gratifying. She is able to represent up and down of all emotions very well. Once again, he shows his singing talent here. I've already fell in love with her since the first time I saw her on ""Mamma Mia!"" (2008). On the other hand, Tatum's performance is awful. His character looks awkward and empty. I doubt his acting skill at all. As the result, the chemistry has a serious gap. But once again, Nicholas Sparks's novel is always worth it to be told. Thiz is fifth Sparks's novel that has adapted to movies, since Kevin Costner's ""Message in a Bottle"" (1999), Mandy Moore's ""A Walk to Remember"" (2002), Rachel McAdams's ""The Notebook"" (2004), Richard Gere's ""Nights in Rodanthe"" (2008) and also upcoming Miley Cyrus's ""The Last Song"" (2010). It's always about everlasting love and long term relationship. We could spend one fine evening with anybody or even a nice whole memorable summer, it can come and go. But it's the person who always stands beside us in all these times who is truly the one.<br/><br/>Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"
"lounisproduction","6","0","1","13 April 2010"," Just another ordinary love story...
","The script: Basic storyline, predictable scene. Could have been much better but rush for some scene. The beginning is very boring. The flirting is so lame like two 14 years old kids flirting each other. The relation with the dad make the story a bit more interesting even better than that the relation with the two main characters. the few last scene with Tim Wheddon was too much, seem to be there just to fill up the blank. The end is awful, it lost one star just because of it. <br/><br/>The acting: Channing Tatum was definitely not the good choice. over acting kill the acting. Tho he seemed to be more into the character through the end. His dialogues from the script didn't help him.<br/><br/>Amanda Seyfried was all right. Sadly no chemistry between the two characters.<br/><br/>Richard Jenkins was just excellent playing an autism. Very lovable character. I gave two more stars just for his scene.<br/><br/>Henry Thomas was fine. <br/><br/>Watching this movie is not a waste of time. but it won't be one of your favourite."
"georgii_ehh","3","0","3","4 April 2010"," not a good film
","i loved the two main characters in this movie, and anyone who says they cannot act is lying. maybe if they had received a decent script to work with they would have been better able to showcase their talent. as a person who generally enjoys a good romance movie i was quite excited to see this movie as were my friends. however from the start to the end of the movie i was either bored, frustrated or rolling my eyes in disgust.the romance portrayed was not entirely believable but was OK, the fact that they fall in love in just two weeks was fine. but the directer possibly should have gone into their romance with more depth as it was the main part of the story, from there it just got worse going from tragedy to tragedy in a most unbelievable way. the obvious aim of this movie was not a well written enjoyable storyline- it was to see how many people they could make cry by the end of the film. with the female protagonist ""forced"" to marry her older neighbour as he is dying and the male protagonists father dying all in amidst their romance going up in flames while (channing) is overseas participating in a war due to 9/11, it is just unbelievable and gets to the point where it is a series of depressing events crowded together instead of a put together story, I'm a teenage girl and while all my friends enjoyed it because it was ""soo sad"" i feel that a well maintained storyline would have had a greater affect than just creating a movie for young girls to cry in. i wont see it again."
"dafarr","2","0","2","19 March 2010"," what a waste of time
","The only reason I rated this film as 2 is because Channing Tatumis beautiful however the whole film lacks emotion and was boring to watch. Usually I adore a good romance but this was just a waste of time, I didn't shed a tear despite it containing sad content it just wasn't acted very well at all. I'm no film critic but I just advise girls to avoid this really unless the only reason you're watching it is to see Channing Tatum lol the rest of the film is rubbish and if he wasn't in it (not that his acting was any good) I would have stopped watching much quicker. It's a shame really because if the right actors were chosen for this film it could have had the potential to be a real tear jerker. .. If you're looking for a good cry or a film for a girly night in...give this one a miss!!"
"bsam5886","4","0","3","3 March 2010"," Dear John....why ?
","I was talked into seeing this by a girlfriend..John was a good guy, sweet, sensitive and looks great with no shirt on!! I thought it was a love story about both of them but it was mainly about his reactions to her letters. Savannah was a likable character at the start of the movie but once she dumped him I lost respect for her. She said it tore her apart being away from him and it was hard - he was the one a million miles away, he was killing people and the only contact he got was through her letters!!! She didn't have it hard, she had family & money and he had a tour of duty!! I was so frustrated at the ending when he forgave her - he was too much of a sweetheart. I would have waited the 3 years and welcomed him home with open arms."
"burnsg74","5","0","2","27 February 2010"," Continuity Failures=spoiled experience
","This movie would've been great if a few of the scenes were scrubbed for continuity. Channing Tatum is chiseled-handsome and Amanda Seyfried is the long-locked blond who pines away in this long-haul love story. First of too many to mention ""Fail""(s) is that Tatum's ""John"" is referred to as a Staff Sergeant or ""ssg"" when he had a ""buck"" sergeants rank. Huge turn- off for Army Veterans! When he finally gets promoted he does have the 3 chevrons and a ""rocker"" all the way through the end of the movie. And one of the pivotal scenes in particular had the Tatum's shoulder boards upside down the entire time! You say ""not a big deal? Like I mentioned before a bad, bad job by a continuity director (and there had to a military consultant on the set) can completely ruin the impact of the scene, ergo the moment, and I actually started laughing. However, save for that egregious continuity errors it was predictable bu good, one tissue tearjerker. Don't pay to see it in the theater, just wait for the rental."
"canadasmoviefan","6","0","3","16 February 2010"," Decent but a disappointment for all women
","OK so as much as i hate to ruin the fantasies of all the women that are going out to watch this movie, i have to say it's going to lead u to disappointment. Unfortunately the writers and director were not able to demonstrate the true core of the love story and it needed to be much further developed. As is evident by the movie trailer, this is a sad love story as many of Nicholas Sparks' stories are, and should've made female fans across the globe cry and did not do its job. It was difficult to grasp the emotion the characters portrayed because there was hardly any chemistry among the two leads. Though Channing Tatum is a surprising choice for the male lead in such a huge romantic story, the true letdown was Amanda Seyfried. She's supposed to be a complex, and torn character and really didn't do portray her emotion well enough. Overall, i'd caution everyone to wait until the movie is out for rent."
"bluepolkadotsxo","7","0","1","14 February 2010"," Decent acting, beautiful scenery, and an effort at being an endearing romance, but fell a little short.
","First off I'd like to say, I don't think this movie deserves the criticism it's getting. But then again, I am on IMDb.com, and I know there are a ton of people on here who bash the majority of movies out there.<br/><br/>I came into the movie of Dear John with somewhat high expectations, since it is, after all, #1 in the box office, and I came out thinking, ""that was really sweet and almost had me in tears at one part of the movie. It wasn't as good as what I expected, a bit disappointing, but I'm glad I saw it."" I really liked seeing these actors (Channing Tatum, Amanda Seyfriend) in a more serious drama, and I loved the father-son aspect. There were definitely some strong points to it, and the beaches and everything were beautiful. There were a couple of holes and unresolved things- like John's past and how he ""caused trouble"", but we do know he is a violent person after his encounter with that guy who also liked Savannah, plus the scar on his face, so he probably just got in a lot of fights, and I don't think his past was an extremely important part of the movie. <br/><br/>Over-all, the movie had it's flaws and strengths, and had the power to be amazing but fell a little short because of the mediocre acting in some parts and lazy directing/producing. The people who put everything together in the end barely did their part in some ways. For some scenes, it seemed like they only asked the actors to run through it once and then said ""okay, this is good let's use it"", when clearly it needed a little more work. The script wasn't great at parts, too. The beginning was slow-moving and a little awkward, but the movie got much better as it went on. And of course the idea/writing of the movie itself, being a Nicholas Sparks story, was beautiful. The music was also phenomenal. <br/><br/>My advice; don't go into the movie with high expectations, try to draw your own conclusions from certain things/read the book, and please don't listen to most people on here who are basing their whole review on the flaws. Give it a chance and recognize the good parts of the movie. For me, it was worth seeing one time."

","i was extremely excited for this movie! my expectations were under control because i read the book first sooo i expected differences. what i didn't expect were how great the differences were. Starting off by the characters physical appearances...like Channing Tantums lack of tattoos n Amanda Seyfried not being a brunette lol but i let that go...the character developments were not there at all...you didn't have time to love amanda seyfried character and you couldn't feel for her or for john when they first separated...i thought the two weeks were rushed and i hated that she left first then him...it took the emotional separation away...and why did they change Tim from the book...why did they make him a dad instead of a brother and why did they make him sooo old looking and the movie lacked that intense moment when they find out what happens at the end (didnt want to spoil it lol but for those who watched it u know what i mean) and whhhyyyy ooooo wwhyyyy did they change the ending...in the book it was heartbreaking and emotional and it emphasized on Channing Tatums character's decision whhyyy did they twist it...it just made it look like a rushed ending...it was terrible...thats what disappointed me the most...the ending of the book should have been exactly the same :("
"Chris Knipp","6","0","2","11 February 2010"," Blue-chip corn
","Nicolas Sparks is a perennially popular novelist who specializes in weepy tales of star-crossed lovers. He's written fifteen. 'The Notebook' became a movie. So did 'A Walk to Remember.' And 'Message in a Bottle.' And 'Nights in Rodanthe.' Now Lasse Hallström, a specialist in glossy crowd-pleasers, has directed an adaptation of Sparks' 'Dear John,' a story whose lovebirds are separated by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. If you want a simple fantasy about an inarticulate but brave soldier and a saintly young woman, this will do the trick. Otherwise you may wonder at the lack of rounded character development or convincing storytelling. <br/><br/>At home by the water in Charleston, South Carolina on leave from soldiering with an elite Special Forces squad, John Tyree (Channing Tatum) dives off a pier to rescue a young lady's dropped purse. Its grateful owner is Savannah Curtis (Amanda Seyfried).<br/><br/>Channing Tatum (of 'Step Up' and 'Public Enemies', and a comer) looks like last year's Bruce Weber model -- muscular, square-jawed, wide-eyed, all-American, uncomplicated. He photographs as well with his shirt off as in a tight dress uniform. He has sweet cow eyes. He is the epitome of the manly hunk. He's so tight-lipped it's hardly surprising that his father (character actor Richard Jenkins, of 'The Visitor') is full-on autistic and can talk coherently only of his coin collection. It turns out Savannah is drawn to autistic folks, and one of her friends is Tim (Henry Thomas), a single dad with an autistic child. Savannah gets along really well with Mr. Tyree, but then she's also interested in Tim and young Alan (Braeden Reed, Luke Benward).<br/><br/>Well, guess what? John and Savannah spend his two weeks of leave together and when it's over and he must return to his secret assignment, they're -- totally in love! So he promises that when his service is up in a year, they will be together. And they agree to wait. Their cloyingly repeated wish-fulfillment goodbye is ""see you soon.""<br/><br/>Military service in this movie is strictly an opportunity to engage in passionate correspondence of the old-fashioned snail mail kind. Savannah and John exchange declarations of love and loyalty revealed to us in voice-overs. But just when John's remaining year of service is over, the 9/11 attacks happen. Poor John! Duty calls. His squad members, after a weekend during which John goes all the way back from some top secret exotic country to Charleson, all decide to re-up for duty in Afghanistan, and he can't desert them.<br/><br/>Again during that weekend John and Savannah spend an impassioned time together. In honor of the War on Terror, she (apparently) gives up her abstinence from almost everything -- drinking, cursing (except in her mind) and premarital sex -- to make love with John. And then again they part, pledging once more to wait and ""see you soon."" <br/><br/>But Savannah's already waited a year, and this time ""soon"" starts to look pretty far off. The title gives away what happens, if you know what a ""Dear John letter"" is, as pretty much everybody does. There are only tear-jerker scenes from here on -- not that that's much of a change. <br/><br/>The epistolary saga ends. There's finally a tiny combat sequence in which John takes two bullets. Eventually, though not right away, he's retired from the service. The time period of this movie is eight years. But Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried are as pristine as ever at the end of them. Time takes its toll on John's autistic dad, and the autistic boy, Alan, is taken over by an older actor. The feel-good ending is far-fetched and trite.<br/><br/>It's hard to see how a good movie could be made out of material like this: Lasse Hallström's good taste, polish, and restraint as a director are such (A.O. Scott calls him ""a blue chip hack"") that you think he's done the best that could be done. The movie belongs to the inarticulate. Tatum comes through well. John emerges as seething with emotion, but strong in holding it back -- except for one moment of violence at home that, it's hinted, was his regular style when he was younger. But this is conviction in appearance; Tatum is given nothing realistic to do. As John's father Richard Jenkins is terribly twisted and mannered, but he has to be to project both the total repression and the sweetness the story calls for from him. Amada Seyfried is not distinctive but she is adequate, sincere -- and very pretty. But when you remember Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams in Nick Cassavetes' 'The Notebook' -- though I'm still wondering why an actor of Gosling's caliber and daring took on such a project -- you realize this kind of material can be handled better. It's hard to see what Nicholas Sparks is an expert on: not war experience, certainly; not autism. Even the behavior of his two lovebirds is only minimally convincing. Maybe coin collecting? Lasse Hallström and the writer of the screen adaptation, Jamie Linden, have not added anything to compensate. All that's left us are some acting tics and Tatum's strong silent meaningfulness."
