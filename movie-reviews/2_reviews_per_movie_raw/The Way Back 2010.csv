"MR_Heraclius","9","46","50","23 February 2020"," love this movie highly recommend.
","I think it's always difficult to portray hardship and endurance in films purely because you only experience it for a couple of hours or so. This had me understanding the terrible conditions for real....i think. The search for water in the Gobi desert had me thinking twice about attempting the same thing as a holiday. Make up was fantastic and the bleakness of the scenery was soo beautiful"
"sparsons-7","10","195","238","2 January 2011"," I will never complain about going on a walk ever again!
","I went with my friends to see this the other day - we picked whatever film was on soonest at the cinema. The Way Back was on...and we went in. I had no idea what the film was about only that I'd heard that ""People walk out of Russia"". <br/><br/>This film really had you captivated for the entire journey - and you really connect with the characters within it, so much so you experience their emotions with them - you laugh with them, you are on the verge of tears at moments, and you feel their determination. <br/><br/>The acting was great - there were some familiar faces in the likes of Jim Sturgess (21) and Ed Harris (everything else)...and they do very well in their roles. Colin Farrell finds himself taking a respectable role in a respectable film - and does a very good job at it - and even manages to work a Russian accent, which he pulls off - and he pulls it off well. Surprisingly well, actually! Saoirse Ronan, at 15/16, is incredible in this. Given her youth, she manages to draw in the audience with her character's history and gravitas. The other actors within this, despite them being relatively unknown on the Hollywood stage, join the cast well, and the chemistry is there to make the journey and the true stamina of the group believable.<br/><br/>The cinematography was immense, with shots overlooking parts of Russia, Mongolia, Tibet, and India - just helps you realise the vastness of the journey. Most of the journey is filmed looking closely at the characters, but this is what is crucial to the audience enjoying the story. You can't have 2hrs and 13 mins of beautiful scenery and see the intimate struggles with each of the characters...therefore the director does well to mix the two. The audience can see just what the struggles and difficulties are...but are treated to some amazing shots of the scenery, which make you realise how incredible this journey was. (I even got a map out later and routed the journey they took)<br/><br/>I should expect that this film would receive some Oscar nominations, maybe for cinematography, director, perhaps even best picture, but I would love to see Jim Sturgess having a nomination for his role."
"nyshrink","8","95","115","23 January 2011"," Epic Survival Tale
","This is a film for people who appreciate epic landscapes and survivor stories. It has some engaging characters but not brilliant dialogue or complicated characters. Mostly, it is a visual film, displaying the vulnerability of a few people in a harsh, vast, beautiful landscape. They must depend on each other, and they develop an intimacy based on their shared struggle rather than on deep conversations and emotional revelations, or at least, not until a young girl joins them. Weir seems to be commenting on the yin yang of masculinity/femininity at times in this film. I also liked the subtle underlying commentary on the brutal oppression of the Soviet regime under Stalin.<br/><br/>All of the actors were good; Farrell adds a touch of humor, Sturgess portrays anguish well, and Harris is a good tough old guy--his usual persona. By the way, Manohla Dargis in The New York Times complains that Farrell is too good-looking to be a Russian gangster. What this assessment is based on I can't imagine; doubt Dargis hangs with Russian gangsters."
"dvc5159","7","93","115","22 January 2011"," An epic, exquisitely shot and harrowing adventure about survival and the pursuit of freedom
","So the book has been proved false. Does this mean that the ""true story"" isn't true after all? There have been many claims by others that it is fact instead of fiction. Whatever - it doesn't matter, Peter Weir's ""The Way Back"", this movie about that book, which tells the tale of gulag escapees and their harrowing journey to freedom, is a well-told and inspiring tale than anything else.<br/><br/>All of the actors are terrific in their roles - Jim Sturgess as the de- facto leader of the bunch, showing a more improved and mature side to his acting since ""21""; Ed Harris as the gruff American Smith, who is hard-edged and iron-willed until he eventually befriends...; Saiorse Ronan as Irene, the runaway girl who joins them on their quest - Ronan here shows a perfect balance of various emotions while not overdoing it like many child stars her age... she definitely is one of the best young actresses today; Colin Farrell as the violent yet humorous soldier who protects the team from danger in Siberia and provides comic relief when needed - Farrell shows that he can be tough yet likable at the same time without being completely overblown and shows his versatility as an actor; European actors Dragos Bucur, Alexandru Potocean, Sebastian Urzendowsky and Gustaf Skarsgård round off the remaining escapees and they all acted great in their respective and differing roles. The chemistry between all of the actors at parts are great.<br/><br/>Having said that, the film's only flaw is that it sacrificed substantial characterization for realism and visual spectacles. The characters are thinly but not overly so fleshed out, and the interactions between them are short before the next walking shot. But when it comes to realism and believability the film succeeds. I was surprised when I saw National Geographic was one of the co-producers of the film, but I wasn't as soon as I saw how realistic the depictions of survival the characters did in the film. Men will do anything to escape to freedom, and the determination and spirit to survive in a harsh and unforgiving natural world, is what Weir and his script is trying to say, but the walking parts are written in masterful detail that any line of dialog may ruin it, so silence is sometimes golden in these parts. The screenplay also challenges the usual Hollywood clichés that usually are found in this film genre, and it transforms them into better, more realistic and sometimes unsettling situations.<br/><br/>Production-wise, the film is a triumph. The production design is great and makes extremely well use of real locations. The cinematography by Russell Boyd is dazzling, simply marvelous, it is wide, sweeping and epic, with lush scenery of forests, deserts and the snow-peaked Himalayas exquisitely shot throughout. The wide cinematography makes the experience even more harrowing thanks to Lee Smith's fluid and crisp editing and Burkhard Dallwitz's great music score and terrific music timing - Dallwitz and Weir know when and how music/sound can be used in a scene, and that sometimes, silence is crucial to certain moments. Here, Weir uses that silence to terrific and very intense effect, and with his extremely focused direction, manages to being out a very exhilarating and at the same time excruciating (in a good way) experience. So much so that I forgot about the controversy surrounding the ""true story"" and found myself hugely engrossed in the movie, not wanting it to end.<br/><br/>In short, the film lightly suffers from lack of proper characterization, but is heavy on almost everything else - acting, directing, cinematography, production value and music. If it had proper characterization, it would have been an instant classic and a contender for the Best Picture Oscar. Still, as it stands, ""The Way Back"" is still an epic adventure; an inspiring, sometimes funny, and often intense and harrowing experience that also proves that Peter Weir is still an ambitious tour-de-force filmmaker.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 77/100"
"kropacek-933-872346","10","208","269","2 January 2011"," Superb
","This was a long film but I was unaware of the length because I was so thoroughly engrossed. The scenery and the photography were simply spell binding but more than that, this was a story about the indomitable spirit of people faced with desperate odds told with sensitivity and at times, humour. Others have commented on the quality of the acting, the accuracy of the story and the cinema-photography; I want to comment on a different aspect of the film. We hear and see a great deal about the crimes of the Nazis during this period but very little about the crimes of the Soviet system. This film is not a ""dull metaphor"" of the Cold War as one reviewer has said If this films sparks a little enquiry amongst its audiences it will have done a great service to the memory of Poles and other eastern Europeans who suffered the double tragedy of Nazi and then Communist occupation. When Nazism was defeated in 1945, half of Europe was just beginning a sentence in Communist bondage that was to last another thirty five years. This aspect of the story is all the more effective because it is told through the eyes of a small group of people and at a personal level. At the end of this film, the entire audience sat still for about fifteen seconds. There was not the usual end of film scrum. People just needed a moment to absorb what they had sen. This was the best film of the year!"
"jonnyhavey","9","93","120","2 February 2011"," Impossible, Incredible, Freedom
","Six-time Academy Award nominated director Peter Weir (""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"", ""The Truman Show"") directed and wrote the adaptive screenplay for ""The Way Back"" based on the book ""The Long Walk: A True Story of a Trek to Freedom"" by Slawomir Rawicz, a Polish POW from the Soviet Gulag where the story begins, and on real life accounts of the journey. The film unluckily missed a very well deserved 2010 Oscar birth telling the tale about an unthinkable journey of kinship created between a diverse group of Soviet Gulag escapees. Their journey covers 4,000 miles from Siberia to freedom in India giving meaning to the word incredible. The cinematography is used most majestically by capturing panoramas of the strikingly dangerous yet breathtakingly beautiful landscapes. The splendor of the film goes beyond the wilderness with the selection of a very accurate and diverse cast starring Jim Sturgess (""21""), Ed Harris (""The Rock""), Colin Farrel (""In Bruges""), Saoirse Ronan (""The Lovely Bones""), and Mark Strong (""Sherlock Holmes""). Together they recreate the peril and wonder of the impossible journey on foot that started with the idea of a man named Khabrov (Strong) to break out of the Godforsaken Soviet Gulag in Siberia. A Polish man named Janusz, driven by the fire to get back to his wife, puts the idea into action. An older, wise American known as Mr. Smith (Harris) joins ranks when he hears about Janusz's plans and warns him that Khabarov never had any aspiration to actually leave the place. However, the idea becomes a reality attracting an indebt prisoner named Valka (Farrel) and four other men escaping the Gulag and meeting a young girl named Irena (Ronan) on the path to freedom.<br/><br/>The story is synonymous with walking more than a marathon every day through harsh terrain, uncontrollable elements and lack of food and water for an open-ended amount of time. The gravity of the story is unmatched by any film released this year; told through the art of cinematography and the acting talents of the cast. Both Oscar worthy aspects of the film, however, the cinematography itself is unmatched by any 2010 film. Also, a lot can be said about the all-star cast concerning Jim Sturges, Ed Harris, Colin Farrel, Mark Strong, and Saoirse Ronan and their superb character portrayals; however, there is one other actor that stands out. A man in the group named Zoran played by Dragos Bucar is able to break through the thin layer of dramatic tension in the film with his clever social humor. The comedy he creates does not take away from the story and instead adds to the story allowing the characters to unwind and have a good time. <br/><br/>The outcomes to films within the ""jailbreak"" genre are inevitably easy to predict, therefore, causing films like ""The Way Back"" to work hard in order to be original. ""The Way Back"" does a very good job by differentiating the way it is captured on film through its beautiful cinematography; however, great films such as ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Great Escape"" will always be on top of the genre. ""The Way Back"" isn't far off though with its main shortcoming stemming from the ending relying on a storyline tangent not fully developed (not the montage, the montage is great).<br/><br/>This is the most underrated movie of 2010 with its limited advertising exposure, release and lack of award fulfillment with only one Oscar nomination for Best Make Up (well deserved as the group of survivors' skin is torn apart by the elements). A 4,000-mile true story taking place in the World War II era with excellent cinematography and great acting seems like the ideal candidate for the Oscars. So why was this must see film left in the shadows?"

","Peter Weir's follow-up to Master & Commander (2003) is the unflinching, stark, & brilliant The Way Back, which takes on the weighty theme of man's struggle for freedom.<br/><br/>At the dawn of WWII, several men escape from a Russian gulag. The film details their perilous & uncertain journey to freedom, as they cross deserts, mountains, & several nations.<br/><br/>The cast is a clever mix of seasoned pros & relative newcomers. Ed Harris, in the role of the sole American, lends his usual gravitas. Colin Farrell borrows from his In Bruges character, but the addition of bad jailhouse tattoos is wildly amusing, & his Russian is quite passable. It's always nice to see Mister Farrell doing serious work, rather than bland fluff like Miami Vice or SWAT. Mark Strong's brief, but plot-essential appearance is joyous.<br/><br/>Jim Sturgess gets a chance to redeem himself from the disastrous flop 21, & does a fine job here, as the central character. & the adolescent Saoirse Ronan belies her extensive & impressive resume with an understated performance that sparkles against the men's terse asperity.<br/><br/>Breathtaking vistas that serve as the backdrop to the cast's efforts lend The Way Back an epic feel, echoed by mature editing, & mavellously restrained use of music.<br/><br/>This is, quite possibly, the most serious film Peter Weir has ever directed, & the result is both thought-provoking & inspiring.

"richard-1967","10","142","194","19 December 2010"," Peter Weir returns with a masterpiece
","Anyone familiar with Peter Weir's incredible body of work - particularly his earlier Australian-produced movies - knows that a new Weir movie is an important event indeed. Almost all Weir's too-infrequent movies are at least noteworthy (Witness, Dead Poets Society) if not downright great (Year of Living Dangerously, The Last Wave).<br/><br/>With The Way Back, Weir may have made his greatest film ever. An epic and unrushed (2 1/4 hours) trek from a Soviet Gulag to the green hills of India, this is a beautifully filmed and superbly acted piece. Let it take its time; it is thrilling and appalling, but also beautiful.<br/><br/>The story, which Weir apparently has long wanted to film, is based on the account of a Polish army officer who later moved to England and wrote (with a ghost-writer) the book ""The Long Walk,"" describing the journey he took with seven others. The movie is quite true to the book, right down to the American ""Mr. Smith,"" Ed Harris' character. While the veracity of the story in the book has been questioned, that doesn't interfere with the great film-making.<br/><br/>Harris is fine as always, as is Colin Farrell as a Russian thug, but it is Jim Sturgess, as the Polish leader of the expedition, who has the most bravura performance.<br/><br/>Bravo to the cast, cinematographer, and most of all, Mr. Weir."
"Philby-3","8","65","86","1 March 2011"," A beautiful but very long walk
","The story of a small group of people escaping from a Siberian Soviet prison, part of the ""Gulag"" in wartime and walking 4000 miles to freedom looked a trifle grim in the trailer, but Peter Weir has managed to produce a rather beautiful film out of it, using Bulgaria and Morocco as locales rather than Siberia and the Gobi desert. Only Darjeeling in India plays itself. My only trouble with it is the rather uneven character development. The story lends itself to ensemble playing but we learn little about two or three of the walkers. In the case of the lead character Janusz (Jim Sturgess) who is the source of the story this is explicable as we are seeing the others though his eyes, but it has to be said that both ""Mr Smith"" (the excellent Ed Harris) and the Girl (Saiorse Ronan) leave a lasting impression.<br/><br/>I know there is some doubt as to the authenticity of the story, taken from a 1955 book by Slavimir Rawicz a former Polish army officer, and indeed what the group are supposed to have done looks impossible but that's not a problem, because the relationships ring true. It is remarkable how an almost random collection of individuals, including one with a very unsavoury past, can, driven by sheer necessity, wind up functioning as a team. Partly this is due to the leader actually having some navigational knowledge and therefore inspiring confidence in the others. Mr Smith remarks early on that the Janusz has a serious weakness; he is kind, but when the chips are down we see that even the hard-bitten Mr Smith is capable of compassion.<br/><br/>Strangely enough, after the initial scenes in the prison camp, and the escape, there is not a lot of drama. The group encounter very few people on their travels and those they do meet take little interest in them (perhaps they had not heard about the bounty for escapees). Obtaining food and water is obviously a big issue, so mind out for the messy hunting scenes. I was astounded at how well their footwear stood up to the punishment; my hiking boots are not good for 400 miles let alone 4000. Actually they must have wandered around a bit - the northern end of Lake Baikal and Lhasa in Tibet are about 1800 miles apart, though the prison camp was somewhere north of the lake. It's also not clear how long the walk took, but at times it seemed like years. Weir's great achievement is to keep us watching a very drawn out tale. Personally I think I would have died of boredom if I had been in this particular walk, if starvation hadn't got me first."
"zvg-1","10","82","115","17 April 2011"," A Soviet Schindler's List
","This film tells two stories. The literal one involves a group of Gulag escapees that cross the whole Eurasian continent in order to escape from Russian oppression. <br/><br/>The scenery is amazing, the acting is solid, but, as it has already been noted in other reviews, the action isn't driven by dialogue. At first glance it could seem that some of the characters lack depth, it could seem that the supporting characters lack complexity and history that is so needed for emotional attachment.<br/><br/>But to achieve full understanding of the film, some knowledge of the history of Europe is mandatory. When the metaphor provided by the literal storyline is understood, the characters light up in a completely different light. Suddenly the unrealistically long and hazardous trip takes the revealing shape of the 50-year-long European genocide, repressions, suffering and struggle for independence; a struggle that has been wrongfully forgotten by many in the West.<br/><br/>Thank you for telling our story."
"filmdocumentar","9","6","6","20 January 2016"," A great adaption.
","This is a beautiful adaption of the book. However, the real story is quite different. There's a lot of fiction in the movie. A lot of events are not shown in the movie, or the movie has a lot of events which don't exist in the book. Anyway, I do recommend to be watched and as well I recommend the book which s extraordinary and has a curios, even shocking end that makes you question yourself about human mind and human strength in front of life problems. The movie has great acting and the cinematography is really beautiful. The actress (Saoirse Ronan) that plays Irene character, the orphan polish girl, is chosen very good, exactly like in the book's description (her name from the book is Kristina). The story is a great, beautiful one to be screened, and The way back is a really great adaption! When watched makes you think they do the impossible, almost unbelievable strength and desire to stay alive!"

","I mean these men escaped a Russian gulag and WALKED 4,000 miles from Siberia to India, come on...<br/><br/>So this movie is based on the 1959 memoir ""The Long Walk"" (of which there is some debate over its validity). Regardless I really enjoyed it, the story is incredible and I'd been looking foreword to seeing what they would do in the movie version. Throw in a top notch cast as our Siberian gulag escapees (Colin Farrell, Ed Harris, Jim Sturgess) and this should have been fantastic. All I can say there is maybe my expectations were too high because honestly I came away a little disappointed, actually preferring the book.<br/><br/>The movie itself was very long and kind of jumped around. Granted they had a lot of material to cover as our men escape under cover of a snowstorm and undertake a treacherous journey across thousands of miles of hostile terrain. They face freezing nights, lack of food and water, injuries, mosquitoes, an endless desert, the Himalayas, and moral questions of when to leave someone behind.<br/><br/>The cinematography is beautiful, the scenery breathtaking and everyone does a great job. Ed Harris is excellent as the American Mr. Smith (love him) and Colin Ferrell (love him a bit more) was awesome as a tattooed gang-style prisoner, with an amazing Russian accent. As a point of interest his character is not in the book. The scenes in the blizzard and the Gobi desert stand out to me and are brutal but well done. 08.11"
"ecstatic-tickle","7","67","106","2 January 2011"," When Irish actors go all Polski
","Peter Weir's first film in seven years is another exercise in sturdy direction with strong social themes running through it - recalling many of his previous works in style and content. It follows a group of escaped prisoners from a Siberian gulag in 1940 as they brave the treacherous wilderness of Asia for freedom from the Soviet regime. It's tough viewing for the most part but there is a surprising amount of comic relief along the way, provided chiefly by Colin Farrell's salty character. The group scavenge for food, even fighting off wolves for the carcass of an animal at one point - but the constant bickering and relentless doom and gloom does begin to wear. The film picks up however once Saoirse Ronan enters the picture and her youthful feminine presence brings an interesting dynamic. Emoting with a flawless Polish accent (almost like a mini-Streep) her character is one of the more compelling and layered and gives this emerging young actress a chance to display her skills. The cinematography is serviceable but hardly spectacular - capturing a harsh, arid landscape as opposed to Malick-like celebration of nature.<br/><br/>As the film wears on, the struggle to survive intensifies, particular when they reach the Ghobi desert - the scenes are very well done but viewing becomes quite grueling. Harris bring a certain integrity to his role in a rather unshowy performance with not much character introspection (I can see why his Oscar buzz has disappeared). In fact character development across the board is quite lacking, and watching the plot unfold, with the knowledge of the outcome of the story already provided in the opening titles - the narrative becomes quite arbitrary and the story doesn't always sustain interest. The final leg of the journey through the Himalayas almost seems rushed compared to the bloated second act. Still, it's a very well-made film with good acting and visuals - just don't expect to be inspired."

","The Way Back is the story of a a group of prisoners breaking out of a siberian Gulag and walking across Siberia, Mongolia, China and Tibet, an epic journey of 4000 km to reach freedom in India. Its one of those movies you don't want to miss out on seeing. The cast is wonderful, and the cinematography is breathtaking. Exotic and grandiose shooting locations contrast nicely with the all-too human struggle for survival of the characters. <br/><br/>There are no specific flaws in this movie that you can point out and say,""There! Thats where they screwed up"". No, but the movie somehow leaves you unsatisfied in the end. Its not about what the movie did wrong, but there were so many places where it missed out, where it could have transcended the gap between Good and Fantastic. For one, the characters seemed to mould into one another, there wasn't much to tell them apart, you could have easily switched the back-stories of any two characters and it wouldn't have made a difference. As such, there was no emotional bond you form with any of them, deaths hardly matter to the audience. There have been movies where a character dying would break the heart of the viewer, but here it barely registers. <br/><br/>Also, it hardly brings out the true nature of suffering. Apart from the extensive make-up and the occasional staggering-and-falling, there is not much of an indication of the physical toll and mental trauma that a person would go through in such a circumstance. As such, when they do finally make it to their destination, the happiness that the viewer feels is short-lived and minor. <br/><br/>A Way Back reads more like a documentary. It doesn't manage to pull off the human side of it. One movie which had so much potential, I would be glad if there's a remake, by a better director and cast."
"ccthemovieman-1","8","12","16","4 May 2011"," Grim, But Beautiful
","Having read several books about escapes from Siberia, I was interested in seeing one of them put on screen. I say this because the film is a bit slow in a number of parts so it helps to have a great interest in the subject matter. The film isn't boring - at least, to me - but I can see some people seeing it that way, especially if you're used to today's action movies.<br/><br/>The scenery is magnificent and some of the shots by director Peter Weir are jaw-dropping. This is Weir's first film since the 2003 ""Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World."" The man does quality work.<br/><br/>Ed Harris one of the few, if not only, actors in here whose English you can clearly understand, so it's a good idea to play this DVD with subtitles. You get a fair of amount of subtitles with the Russian characters, anyway, but none are distracting from the scenery or story. The characters and acting in here are good, too.<br/><br/>If this subject matter interests you, find the book, ""As Far As My Feet Will Carry Me,"" about a one-man escape from a Siberian Labor Camp following WWII."
"bob the moo","Null","14","20","24 July 2011"," Solid story that looks great but is told with far too much reverence and respect – to the point of being hard to engage with emotionally
","A group of men break free from the security and barbed wire fence of a Siberian gulag in search of freedom, however the guards are very small beer to the real prison – the ravages of nature itself and the great distance which must be crossed before they can be truly free.<br/><br/>Given that the focus of the film appeared to be one of endurance in the face of great suffering, this film is a bit of a hard sell for the casual viewer looking for something to watch of an evening; certainly for me this was part of the reason it took me a minute to decide to watch it. While it was an OK film, I'm not entirely sure if it was worth the two hours plus that it took to watch because it gives the viewer very little to engage with in doing so. The story is impressive in terms of the toll and also the sacrifice involved and accordingly the film wears it very seriously indeed. Hollywood excess is avoided and any crass sentimentality is absent, both of which I appreciated being omitted and restrained, and Weir documents the journey with a solemn air throughout. The first problem is that it feels like you're in a church – bowed with reverence witnessing things of importance but not really engaging with them because you're not really worthy. This feeling of worthiness really kept me at arms' length from the characters and the challenge they faced, to the point where it felt a little indifferent towards any specific one of them – not in a cruel way, but the feat appears to have been the focus rather than the people.<br/><br/>This is still able to make an interesting film though, because the feat is quite a thing and, as I said, the film is very careful to do it justice and not sentimentalise or trivialise it. This is my second problem with it – it probably overdoes it in this regard considering that so much of the story is questionable. I try not to let ""facts"" get in the way of enjoying a good movie because as a Brit I am used to seeing Hollywood twist history to make it more sellable to the mid-West etc. Thing is though, it is hard to accept that this is a good story when the film emphasises that it is true and also treats it with such reverence and respect for fear of getting it ""wrong"". Quite how one can get it ""wrong"" when so much of it is in doubt is anyone's guess, but the film takes this route and it hurts it in the process. It still makes for a very sturdy film but there without caring about the characters or really feeling in their trial, it didn't do a terrible lot else for me and I was surprised by how much of it I was just able to watch with very little involvement other than my eyes and ears.<br/><br/>One thing the film does do really well though is the delivery (visually speaking of course). The locations are immense and are put on the screen by director Peter Weir and cinematographer Russell Boyd in such a way that captures not only their natural beauty but also the sheer, uncompromising size of the places. It looks great throughout and I was surprised when I looked it up to find that Boyd didn't even merit an Oscar nomination for his work here (although it is an award category that has yet to give one to Roger Deakins so no surprise). It perhaps contributions to the ""look at this epic story"" worthiness that the film has, but in the case of the looks, it is worth it.<br/><br/>The cast also match the worthy tone and don't have a lot of time for character in between portraying hardship and perseverance. Sturgess struggles to really make an impression but he is OK in a central role. He is fortunate though to have Harris, Strong and Farrell with him, because they both bring presence and charisma in a way that looks easy. The rest of the group are good as well, but they also struggle to make an impression in all the worthiness.<br/><br/>The Way Back is an interesting film that looks great, but it is also overly worthy and serious to a point that it is hard to really engage with it because it is hard to reach the characters on the pedestal that Weir puts them on."
"robbie-mcmahon256","9","11","15","16 April 2011"," Amazing
","This film is awesome, the script on Stalin's regime and how they fought for survival is in doubt the biggest struggle. The scenery that was shot in this film was amazing. Peter Weir as the director is brilliant as he has brought this script and the theme and put it together really well. Colin Farrell and Ed Harris play both their parts really well as 2 of the best actors of our generation even Saoirse Ronan who I haven't seen before in film played a fantastic part as a young actress. The script brought the facts as how they should be portrayed well in the motion picture. This film is well worth watching, the courage that these strangers had is unbelievable and I think Peter weir shows in the direction how far we are able to achieve determination. The ending was brilliant it shows a fantastic outcome,a very fulfilling experience."
"The-Sarkologist","8","10","14","13 October 2011"," Not really based on a true story
","Now the question that is raised regarding this film is 'is it true?' There are a lot of suggestions that it is not, and Weir is deliberately vague at the beginning where he says that he 'dedicates this film' to three men who reportedly appeared out of the Himalayas in 1945. He does not suggest that this film is based upon of true story, though it is based upon a book by a Pole named Slawomir Rawicz, who alleges that he escape from a Soviet Gulag in Siberia during a blizzard and travelled over 6000 km to freedom. However, documentary evidence suggests that this did not happen, but rather that he was freed and sent to Iran. Another story is that Rawicz stole the idea from another Pole who made that claim, and further, there is a suggestion that the British in India debriefed a trio who had claimed that they had walked from Siberia.<br/><br/>The question is, is it possible? Well, my suggestion would be that it is, though the journey is fraught with dangers. Not only does one have to evade the Soviet army (and the locals, as any escaped prisoners have a bounty on their head) but they would have had to cross the Gobi desert and then the Himalayas. Of the seven that escaped from the camp, only four of them survived, and one departed in Tibet when he decided to return to the United States through China. However, I would suggest that the most difficult and gruelling part of the journey would have been across the Gobi Desert, and the film is very clear about that.<br/><br/>I did think that this was a good film, despite the authenticity of the story being doubtful. Peter Weir does make very good films, and this is no exception. However it is very long, though that is to be expected of such a film like this. One in a way would like to have followed their course on a map, and I am suspicious that not only a directly southern route would have got them to Tibet (it wouldn't have) or that once they had crossed the Gobi desert they would have come to the Great Wall of China. I suspect the Great Wall, or at least the section they encountered, was much farther to the east than where they would have been.<br/><br/>I could say that this movie is all about human endurance and survival, and while it is, it is not necessarily the case. The main character (whom Weir deliberately did not name Rawicz) was sentenced to the Gulags on a trumped up charges based on evidence that was tortured out of his wife. However he does not hold a grudge against his wife and he one desire is to return to her so that he may forgive her. This is what motivates him, and drives him on, however, as we know, it was going to be another fifty odd years before the wall comes down enabling him to return to his wife."

","I know what you're thinking... the scene has been set up before so many times before in film history. A group of men held captive in a POW camp during World War 2... A covert plot amongst them to break out...Well, normally I would agree with you if I hadn't have just set through what is now my favourite movie of 2011 so far.I hadn't heard a lot about this film but I decided to see it seeing as Ed Harris is one of my favourite actors. The film is very well acted on all parts, and most impressively in my opinion the best actor nod would go to Colin Farrell! The film is a power house of emotion about a journey to freedom, and the trails and tribulations these brave men struggle through. The film is very well paced and the cinematography is simply break taking. I was also taken back by the fact that this film was inspired by a true story, and believe you me when the end credits role you will understand why they had to make this story into a movie.<br/><br/>I love it when a film surprises me on all fronts and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent way to spend 2 hours in the cinema this weekend. All in all I would rate this movie 9.5 out of 10 and look forward to seeing it again on blue ray"

","Better than expected. Great scenery and filming and editing made it feel realistic and shots changed. 
Although, not the snappy dialog some expect from modern writers, I doubt in such austere conditions , the dialog was real, especially after escaping a gulag , under harsh conditions of Soviet occupation. 
Truly shows how mankind would rather die in freedom than live under slavery, and risk all for even a small shot a freedom."

"shattenjager777","8","12","18","23 January 2011"," The Journey Away from Communism
","Note: There probably won't be any spoilers, but I'm afraid to submit a review without clicking the box. I will mark any that come up.<br/><br/>Peter Weir is one of the great directors in recent history, having directed three absolute masterpieces (""Dead Poets Society"" (USA 1989), ""The Truman Show"" (USA 1998), and ""Gallipoli"" (Australia 1981)) and a decent number of good films alongside them. His greatest strengths as a director have been his incredible facility with leading actors that has often lead to excellent performances from surprising performers and his ability to create a backdrop in seemingly all scenes that is realistic enough to accept and yet so perfectly controlled that it paints the picture for his camera. Both of those skills are on display in ""The Way Back."" The film's story, while dull-sounding in the abstract, is an interesting metaphor for many countries' (though Poland is the obvious example here) long journey away from authoritarian Communism toward individual freedom. *Spoilers* We see how Communism tore down the old religions and yet rather than its return, a new, western religion is attempting to take its place. We see how the definition of ""freedom"" becomes so weak that the characters consider the ability to die outside prison walls ""freedom"" in Siberia. We see how wandering through the tightly-controlled, dangerous, cold, ruthless terrain of one type of authoritarianism in Russia shares similarities with the hot, wild, dangerous, dry terrain of another in Mongolia. We see how it's a nearly-impossible final trek through dangerous mountains of doubt, asking for help repeatedly along the way that finally brings our heroes to the lush greens of freedom. *Spoilers Over* The acting is universally excellent, highlighted by Ed Harris, Jim Sturgess, and Colin Farrell. Harris has the only dynamic character, one who begins knowing only too well the value of hiding his emotions and slowly learns that he no longer needs his mask. His performance is nothing short of amazing. Sturgess, while not playing a very dynamic part, still has plenty to sink his teeth into and hits every right note. Farrell is a scene-stealer as a vicious-but-not-stupid true criminal who doesn't know how to operate free and knows it.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most memorable part of the film is the score. Burkhard von Dallwitz's score in this film is one of the best I've ever heard, with an impressive combination of variety and cohesiveness and absolutely pitch-perfect emotionality for every moment.<br/><br/>Weir, as is his wont in later years, keeps the editing and camera work minimal. We have still camera shots with relatively little cutting throughout the film, which allows us to remain connected with the characters as they journey. There are notable exceptions in the beautiful fly-by shots of the environs that remind us just how far these men are going and the close, intense, steaming-but-still-freezing, loud environment of the mine that is shot with quicker cuts, different colors, and more close-ups. His work is stunning.<br/><br/>There are some problems with the film. The third act is rushed and drives home the metaphor so obviously that it's almost laughable. The journey through Siberia is a bit repetitive. But those are relatively minor flaws in a beautiful film. Peter Weir remains a genius."

"rpvanderlinden","10","6","8","26 November 2011"," The Long, Long Journey
","Australian Peter Weir is one of the great artists and craftsmen in cinema of the past 40 years. As a storyteller he seems interested in the the plight of the stranger in a strange land, the man who stumbles into a world where he is totally out of his element and the rules of the society he knows and believes in no longer apply. The two films that brought him to the world stage, ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" (1975) and ""The Last Wave"" (1977) depict the fragility of our civilization as it crashes full tilt into a spiritual world that exists beyond time and space and rational comprehension. In the truly wonderful ""Witness"" (1985), violent cop Harrison Ford, wounded and pursued by crooked cops, hides out in an Amish community in Pennsylvania. A real fish out of water tale. I saw this film on its opening in a packed Toronto theatre. There was such a hush from the audience I swear you could hear a pin drop, and at the end the entire audience broke into spontaneous and prolonged applause. Okay, pardon my digression. I once knew someone knowledgeable who illuminated some of Weir's earlier films for me and helped to made that director a personal favourite.<br/><br/>In ""The Way Back"" (2010) a group of political prisoners and one bona fide crook and con artist, in Stalin's Russia ca. 1948, escape from a prison camp in Siberia. Their journey takes them across frozen Siberia, the Gobi desert and the Himalayas to their ultimate destination, India and freedom. Some of them don't make it. The elements are the enemy. The film does a fine job of juxtaposing the most minuscule details with the vastness and harsh beauty of the landscapes (the photography is by Oscar-winner Russell Boyd). Along the way the men discover that the world they once took for granted has been recast in the molds of the hammer-and-sickle and the red star. Colin Farrell plays the hard-done-by con man who, nevertheless, will brook no mockery of his tattoo of Stalin. Ed Harris plays an American known simply as Mr. Smith, a grumpy old bear and an expert at survival, who harbours a deep hurt. He's the weight at the movie's core. Jim Sturgess is the new guy, a Polish army officer and resident artist, who has an especially compelling reason for making it back. Then there is the persistent, stray young woman (Saoirse Ronan) whom the men, some grudgingly (a laggard and another mouth to feed), allow to tag along. Observant, talkative and direct, she brings the healing power of conversation to the men and a much-appreciated softer texture to the movie.<br/><br/>""The Way Back"" has a feel to it reminiscent of the epic films of David Lean (""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Doctor Zhivago"", ""A Passage to India"") and Steven Spielberg's ""Empire of the Sun"". It's a nice change from the testosterone-charged epics currently ruling the box office. Weir hasn't culled a melodramatic storyline from the true-life material he is working from. The struggle to survive, physically and spiritually, seems dramatic enough, and the movie is never plodding or boring. It's been edited to just the right length, a trim two-and-a-quarter hours. The Himalayan leg of the journey is quickly dispensed with because, after all, the story that Peter Weir wanted to tell has been told by that point. Well, almost. The journey is not over. Using ""walking"" as the movie's predominant metaphor, there is a bold and thrilling final sequence that made me gasp with delight. It's a leap of the imagination that few movies manage to take.<br/><br/>For anyone who likes ""The Way Back"" I can't recommend highly enough the 2003 mountain-climbing survival movie ""Touching the Void"", a dramatization of a true story. Go out of your way to get hold of it."
"Danusha_Goska","10","27","50","23 January 2011"," A Masterpiece. Grueling but Rewarding for the Adult Viewer.
","""The Way Back"" is a masterpiece, a must-see film for thinking people and for lovers of cinema as a serious art form. I was on the edge of my seat through the entire film, and was stifling tears. I could not resist applauding at the end. I couldn't wait to discuss it with friends. Several hours after I left the theater, I kept seeing everything – a meaty sandwich, clean water flowing from the tap – through the prism of ""The Way Back."" I'm a long-time fan of director Peter Weir, who gave us classics like ""Picnic at Hanging Rock,"" ""Witness"" and ""The Year of Living Dangerously."" Weir has outdone himself.<br/><br/>""The Way Back"" depicts a long walk that Gulag escapees took from Siberia to India. I've been lucky enough, under luckier circumstances, to travel some of the world the film references, from Poland to the Himalaya. The film's authenticity in language, costume, even hairstyles, swept me up into its world.<br/><br/>Both Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia attacked Poland in September, 1939, thus beginning World War Two. At first, the Communists killed and deported more people even than the genocidal Nazis. Over a million Poles were deported in cattle cars. Many died; many never returned. No one knows exact numbers. Many struggled to return home, traveling on foot through Eurasia, making shorter treks comparable to that depicted in ""The Way Back;"" I've met such people.<br/><br/>Janusz (Jim Sturgess) is a young Pole falsely accused by Soviets. His wife is tortured to force a confession. Without ceremony, he is shipped to hellish Siberian concentration camps and mines. Janusz determines to escape, with a ragtag, multilingual crew of followers.<br/><br/>Janusz is not particularly handsome, or muscular, or super intelligent. He doesn't have a commanding voice or swagger. His potentially fatal flaw, in this environment, is kindness. Jim Sturgess' Janusz is one of the best aspects of the film. In real life, true leaders usually are not like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Janusz grew up in the woods, and knows how to jerry-rig a compass to point his group south, and a mask to survive blizzards. In the world of Gulag escapees, that's enough to make him the big man. Indeed, Valka, (Colin Farrell), a very tough gangster, declares, or diagnoses, that Janusz is the leader, the man whom the other escapees must obey, both for their own individual benefit and the benefit of group survival.<br/><br/>Prison escapees traveling thousands of miles of the Eurasian landmass with minimal gear face multiple dangers, from malnutrition-caused blindness to mosquitoes to snakes to dehydration. Some succumb, and die en route. You can't help but bet the same horrible game of chance that Valka proposes: who will die next? And will his meat be tender – that is, will we resort to cannibalism? A crew member falls. Surviving companions, in stunning testimony to their own humanity, take the time, burn the calories, devote the effort, to fashioning makeshift graves, and funerals. And then they march on.<br/><br/>What looks very beautiful on a calendar – an unspoiled mountain forest of snow-dusted evergreens – is actually all but an execution chamber for a hungry fugitive with no tools and only rags for shoes. The last thing a good man sees after making the simple mistake of walking too far with a limited light source will not be a breathtaking natural vista but a comforting, wrenching, hallucination of home.<br/><br/>Weir's best choice as a filmmaker here was simply to get out of the story's way. ""The Way Back"" does not want to be your best friend. Weir makes no attempt to cozy up to the viewer, to sweeten the story with phony warmth or touching crescendos. Weir makes no attempt to juice the action with cinematic steroids. For much of the film, the viewer is watching one grueling step after another.<br/><br/>Guess what? This is what it's like to suffer for a goal, this is what it's like to be crushed, this is what it's like, purely by chance – not because you are a better person or because God likes you more – to survive. You go on, hour after hour after seemingly pointless hour toward your questionable, impossible objective. This film is an endurance test. It will separate the men from the boys. Folks who think a movie about fantasy, sexy ballerinas is ""great"" filmmaking, and who think that temporarily losing their cell phone service is a human rights violation, will probably walk right out of ""The Way Back."" Characterizations come slowly and are not forced. We discover, in a ruined monastery, that one character had been a priest. We discover that a girl can get taciturn men to talk. Characters speak of food, as hungry people do. ""Add more salt!"" to a fantasy meal, one begs. Valka makes a decision that caused this viewer to cry. I never thought the film could make me care about this murderous thug, but it did. There is inevitable, and surprising, laughter, also not forced, but integral to the circumstances.<br/><br/>There are moments of high drama. The men must fight wolves. Weir could have lavished lengthy close-ups on those sharp teeth, snarling snouts and prickly pelts. He doesn't. The wolves are on screen only long enough to establish what they are and what they are up to. And then the next deadly and impossible challenge rolls down the shoot at the viewer, just as it did for those who took this long walk, and the millions of other humans like them, who have survived life and death challenges under impossible conditions. ""The Way Back"" is, like those poignant grave-markers the marchers make en route, testimony to those who have lived anonymous and agonizing lives in this pitiless world. If you don't think about the big questions while watching this film, and if you're not grateful to the film for that, you don't deserve it."
"Panther826","5","25","48","16 July 2011"," Forgettable!
","The plot is too lean, the dialog is dry and the film editing is horrible, we often see one scene jumps to another without much explanations or transitions. There are few to none in characters background and development. All the actors in this film can be replaced by someone else and the quality of the film would still be the same. The lead actor, whatever his name is, does not have enough charisma to pull it off. <br/><br/>In my opinion, it's definitely not one of the worst films I've seen, but it certainly does not contain any interests for me to be attached to. Overall, this film is forgettable.<br/><br/>I give it a 5 and I'm being generous. And what's up with all the 10s, 9s and 8s??? Are you people serious??"

"ihrtfilms","3","28","57","30 March 2011"," Epic, but far from engrossing
","As war begins to rage in Europe and Poland is split between Germany and Russia, a young Polish man finds himself in a Gulag in Siberia in squalid conditions among a motley group of men from various backgrounds. Conditions are horrific, made worse by the harsh winter weather and life is made even worse if you are chosen to work in the mines. One inmate declares he knows a gap in the fence and a group of inmates decide under the cover of a winter storm to make a run for it. They manage to get away, far into the surrounding forest as the blizzard rages around them. But being free of the Gulag doesn't mean total freedom, not only do they have to fight the elements, but there are wolves as well a bounty given to locals if they capture runaways and somehow of course they have to get out of Russia.<br/><br/>The men make their way south, with the idea of getting to China. It's a long way, through the frozen lands of Siberia and along the way one of them succumbs to the elements. Further south, they pick up a young woman, another runaway Pole and on reaching Mongolia they discover that Communism has taken hold there, meaning safety is not guaranteed, leaving them the only option to cross the Gobi desert and make their way to Tibet and over to India.<br/><br/>This film by Peter Weir is based on the 'true story' - although that's been debunked- and it's an epic tale. The journey is huge, yet somehow for most of the group they will endure anything to survive and get back to those they love. It should be an engrossing story, but it really doesn't manage to maintain interest. For starters this mammoth trek feels like a mammoth (cinema) trek, which goes on far too long; I found myself not wanting them to reach safety for themselves, but for me as I couldn't wait for the film to end. Also, it's difficult to relate to these people, some are criminals, some are viewed as criminals by others, but we rarely get to know more about these people other than a few snippets gathered (conveniently) by the woman. Because of this it's difficult to find an emotional connection to these people who by all accounts are going through a huge life altering journey.<br/><br/>It's a shame as it really should be an engrossing story, but it all feels very formulaic in it's presentation and while performances are okay, with actors playing various nationalities and there's an abundance of accents (and surprisingly all the characters speak fluent English!), the film just drags towards the end and it's main redeeming feature is the glorious variety of landscapes that fill the screen.<br/><br/>More of my reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com"

No bother about how authentic the story was, so long as it does not purport to be. Each of the characters were very believable and well acted.

"minjoo-00707","8","2","2","29 March 2018"," Surprisingly Interesting
","To be completely honest, this is not one of my favorite genres of movies. People are bound to die, scenes tend to get repetitive, and some parts are usually very gruesome. However, I found myself liking this movie more and more as I think about it deeper. The movie The Way Back tries its best to be as historically accurate as possible and incorporates fascinating graphics and visuals to add on to the possibly boring story. <br/><br/>It is hard to separate the historical analysis when viewing movies like this, as The Way Back touches on the Russian Gulag camps. Surprisingly, this movie did a relatively good job in depicting the Gulag. Although the description may not be extensive enough, it shows the lethality of the landscape and the climate, as shown in people falling and dying in the snowstorm. By showing the prisoners working in mines and in forests, it illustrates the heavy manual labor that the prisoners were subjected to. Moreover, it portrays how the prisoners were divided, with professional criminals dominating others. It also accurately represents the presence of people supporting Communism even within the camps, as shown with the character Valka, and the presence of Americans in the Soviet Union who moved to escape the Depression. Personally, I found the exchanges of goods very interesting, because this is the first camp-related movie that I saw that shows what people did exactly to survive in detail. <br/><br/>Outside of the historical perspective, I think the movie also did a good job in depicting the journey from the camp to India. Although it is slightly longer than it needs to be, we have to acknowledge that it is hard to make a movie out of people walking for months. The themes can be very repetitive as well - traveling in hunger, coldness, heat, and lack of water. However, it did not feel as repetitive as I expected it to be. Every time the scenes seem too long or start to get boring, something happens. For example, one of the travelmates die, find a well in the desert, discover something new about a character, or find helpful people. These elements are scattered throughout effectively to not lose the audience's focus. Additionally, the make-ups and graphics are on point, which adds the realistic and thrilling feeling to the story. <br/><br/>One thing that could have been better is the ending. I got a sense that it ended too abruptly after the characters reached Tibet. I understand that if the movie continued on, it would get extremely repetitive and long, but I think it could have at least showed the audience what their lives were like after the journey, giving a better closure. Nonetheless, it was definitely an interesting movie."

","*** WARNING this contains some spoilers *** I don't know where to begin with this movie. I was expecting something better organized and put together. I am a big fan of this type of genre-films like The Great Escape, Cool Hand Luke, The Shawshank Redemption etc. I was waiting for this movie to be released for quite some time, but after seeing it a big disappointment came to heart. The movie starts off very well, and begins to captivate the audience right from the start but as soon as the prisoners escape the compound the movie starts to dull out. Some of the things i really didn't enjoy in it were some of the scenes that were shot in the forest. In those scenes you could tell that it was a still studio shot because the trees and snow looked really fake. That is not the case with all the scenery you see in the movie thou. Another thing was the audio and sound bites, if you pay close attention when the young kid goes missing in the forest, when they search for him and yell out, the echo you hear just plainly ""screams"" we are filming in a small studio. I must admit i really found the movie to be kinda boring after the escape, there was not much plot and climax, and the poor dialogue between the actors was unsuitable. Another thing is, on top of things, I mean come on Collin Farrell playing a Russian thug... i was expecting his role in the movie to be more versatile, so he is got a knife, so what? He doesn't use it very much and after you see the other escapees talk amongst themselves and saying that they should take him along for the escape because he has a knife you would think that you would see some hunting/survival techniques etc. but you don't. You see Collin Farrel with a blood stained shirt bringing back some food and vodka that he loots from a village they cross paths with. Overall i rated this movie a #2, and i must admit it hurt to do that, the lowest score i ever gave a movie since i been on IMDb.com from early 2000's and that is just because the only thing you could find worthy in the movie in my opinion its the scenery, it's what saves the movie from being deplorable."
"dwm51","3","29","66","27 December 2010"," Dull Metaphor for the Cold War
","This film is a big disappointment. There are some decent acting performances but the actors are let down by leaden dialogues and the requirement to deliver their lines in crudely accented English. The long trek itself was lacking in drama and rather implausible. There is very little detail of the survival techniques employed by the group and it is difficult to see how they crossed huge deserts with virtually no food or water. It is also difficult to imagine that the group crossed a huge continent at war with virtually no hindrance from other human beings. The sets are a clumsy mixture of natural and studio settings with a sprinkling of CGIs. The camera work and music are routine. By the end is clear that the long escape from the Gulag is a crude metaphor for the Cold War with Ed Harris representing America's unwavering support for the long struggle of eastern Europe to be free. Far too long and very dull."
"Reel_starz","8","8","14","23 January 2011"," An uncompromising story of survival and the search for freedom and home
","The Way Back is a bit of a puzzler. It's directed by Peter Weir, whose last picture, 2003's Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, was a surprise commercial hit and racked up 10 Oscar nominations, including two wins, and the cast, while not blinding with star-wattage, isn't exactly completely unknown. Based on - or, rather, inspired by - a popular, though later debunked, memoir, this movie had all the makings of a prestige picture ripe for awards and critical praise. However, aside from a brief rumor of an earlier-than-expected release all the way back at the end of 2009, The Way Back has rarely been talked about, receiving a muted screening at the 2010 Telluride Film Festival and a barely-there, Oscar-qualifying run in mid-December before entering theaters nationwide with little of the fanfare one might have anticipated.<br/><br/>At the same time, though, once you have seen the actual film, the reluctance of major studios or distributors to back it is surprisingly understandable. The Way Back isn't what you would call audience-friendly. There are subtitles (in fact, the entire opening scene is in Russian) and characters with hard-to-pronounce-or-remember names, and the plot is at a bare minimum; long stretches of the film consist of little more than people walking and scourging for food or water. It's a World War II movie, but instead of battling soldiers or the Holocaust, it focuses on those oft-overlooked victims of the war: the prisoners in Soviet gulags, which ultimately claimed the lives of more than one and a half million people.<br/><br/>Weir approaches this material the way a documentary or news article views its subject. Using stark, unstylized cinematography to capture the brutality and harsh beauty of the landscapes involved and a stripped-down score by Burkhard von Dallwitz, he's unsparing, almost methodical, yet there's something strangely impersonal about the whole affair. In the hands of another director, Steven Spielberg for example, The Way Back would probably have been a grand, tear-jerking opera about survival against the odds and humanity's struggle to find freedom, the sort of epic spectacle the movie-going public loves. That's not to say Peter Weir doesn't address these themes; he simply does so without much showboating. Instead, he opts for realism over overt emotional catharsis, and as a result, we sympathize more with the characters' situation than with the people themselves. When someone dies, and that happens quite a few times, we process it as an unfortunate yet inevitable occurrence, rather than a genuinely heartbreaking tragedy. We learn names, professions, backgrounds, but the characters, even Janusz, our chief protagonist, remain stubbornly enigmatic.<br/><br/>That said, there's little, if anything, technically wrong with this movie. The cast is the definition of a good ensemble: all involved give strong performances, no individual rising - or seeking to rise - above the others. Keith R. Clarke's script is well-paced and surprisingly engaging considering the rather repetitive nature of the story. If anything, I would have liked it to be longer as the film-makers completely skipped over the final leg of Janusz's journey, the daunting trek over the Himalayas into India, a move that feels prompted out of fear of scaring audiences away with a lengthier running-time (the film as it is already clocks in at 132 minutes). Peter Weir's direction is admirable. Like he did with Master and Commander, he injects life into material that might have otherwise been stilted and un-cinematic.<br/><br/>The Way Back isn't the easiest movie to stomach. Weir refuses to gloss over or sugarcoat the realities of either life in a gulag or the adversities the prisoners must face once they escape; this is a world where kindness is a weakness that can be deadly to those who exhibit it, and in one scene, two characters discuss which one of their companions they should eat first, if necessary. The make-up department deserves some kudos for their efforts to make these normally attractive actors convincing as rugged, beleaguered travelers struggling to make it through each day.<br/><br/>Yet, there is one question that lingers at the heart of this film: Is it worth it? Not only does Janusz endure 4,000 miles of what looks like hell on Earth, but when he finally comes out alive, he's unable to return home, exiled by an oppressive government for crimes he didn't commit. Rather than simply ending with the characters' victorious arrival in India, Peter Weir puts their tale into perspective by using black-and-white newsreel footage to trace events from the end of World War II, through the Cold War and, finally, with the demise of communism and the Soviet Union. These historic clips are accompanied by the shadow of two feet continuously moving forward, one in front of the other, and as the montage fades to show Janusz reuniting with his home and beloved, long-suffering wife forty years after his journey across a continent, we realize the answer: yes."

","'Freedom' sounds a regular, effortless word when you think you have ample of it. But when it's taken away from you, or it becomes scarce what would you do to gain it back? You might risk anything or sacrifice anything to die free, as a free soul. 'The Way Back' is the epic true story of such few individuals, who risked their life's in order to become free men, amongst the thousands who never tried under the circumstances and many who died trying. <br/><br/>This wonderful story of human ambition and its remarkable representation as a movie is one of a kind. Lasting 15 mts longer than two hours it will grab your attention so deeply that you might feel glad of the freedom what you have and will determine to cherish it as long as possible. <br/><br/>The movie is about a set of escapees from a Siberian prison (known as a Gulag) in 1940s. Having a solid plan to reach Mongolia passing the Baikal Lake they set foot on unknown territory, beaten up by weather and hunger and challenges unforeseen. Miraculously surviving a horrific and tedious walk across 4000 miles over jungles, mountains, deserts and wastelands they reach India. Challenged by snow, sand, water and what not, this larger-than-life journey is purely an impossible task even for the modern man but they conquer their fears, exhaustion and pains just to taste the sweetness of freedom. <br/><br/>Main leads played by Jim Sturgess, Ed Harris & Collin Farrell this movie is not a walk in the park to perform in. Filmed in challenging environments in Bulgaria, Morocco and India it sure does bring out the best in each role. Very well played by others too which is not mentioned above, 'The Way Back' is a well acted movie. And it will be a grave mistake if I forgot to mention how striking the makeup department was. They make you feel thirsty in the deserts and cold in the winters by making the actors suite to fit the scenes by their looks. Wonderful job on that I must mention and it got a nomination for Oscars as well. <br/><br/>Cinematography is very impressive as well. Scene after scene the story unfolds in landscapes which is a bliss to see in national geography style, but in the same time give the viewer the sense of hardship embedded in each territory. It is quite arduous of me even to explain this journey let alone to do it in real. But maybe the score does a god job at it. <br/><br/>Skillful direction by Peter Weir has indeed made this movie a masterpiece. Having a taste of bringing reality in to movies which happens way back in time he has done it again after the Oscar nominated directing of Master and Commander. 'The Way Back' is not a movie which you must miss even by mistake as such movie crafting is seldom. <br/><br/>Read my reviews at flickshout.blogspot.com"
"Laafite","8","7","12","9 January 2011"," Clunky drama but this will be remembered for its sense of history
","The Way Back is a big film, as other reviewers have commented. The Gulag scenes at the start were immense, and the dramatic tension was held for two hours. The escapees journey, the heart of the plot, was credible - most of the time. Was it poor editing or simply a gap in the storyline that caused the film to jump jerkily across large parts of a continent, fast forward across the Trans Siberian Railway without even a frame of action, and to 'miss' the Hymalayas almost entirely? And for a journey of such magnitude without anything like adequate nourishment the guys that made it managed to maintain their weight and flesh throughout.<br/><br/>The controversy surrounding the veracity of the published story may have impacted negatively on the film but despite this Peter Weir has succeeded in subtly weaving in much more historical background than many 'historical' films deem necessary. Film goers went to see an action film but will have absorbed more understanding of the catastrophic and deadly events in Poland and Russia of the period than perhaps they realised on coming out of the movie.<br/><br/>My interest was kindled after hearing accounts from two friends, separately, of their Polish fathers' journeys from prison camps in Russia in the middle of WW2. Both were released after being granted amnesty - Hitler had just invaded Russia and Polish captives were offered the chance to fight for the allies. Both made their way to Tehran in Persia, a journey of similar epic proportions but this time (two years later than the events in the film) with the approval, if not the material support, of the Russians. Not Siberia, and no Gulag breakout, but a historic episode all the same, one experienced by thousands of Poles who had been incarcerated after the invasion of their country in 1939."
"markymark70","5","12","24","14 April 2011"," A long walk would be better for you than watching this...
","I watched this with only a basic understanding of what the background was to the story. Also - I did not know previously that it was Peter Weir's first film for 7 years. He should have stayed where he was.<br/><br/>The premise of the story is an extraordinary one - a group of prisoners escape from a Siberian Gulag during the second world war and manage to walk all the way to India. Amazing stuff - especially as it is supposed to be true. However, the articulation of this story left me disappointed.<br/><br/>The opening credits tell you the entire story from start to finish through the use of a couple of sentences. Because of this - the whole dynamic of 'what will happen next?' is taken from the viewer, as we already know the end. <br/><br/>Anyway - that disappointment aside - the story starts off well enough and a strong early performance from Mark Strong augers well. Then what? The escape happens - off screen - and no more Strong. Things then seem to take the repetitive, undramatic route as we embark on our looooooong journey. Essentially the weak story goes like this: - escape Gulag - start walking through Siberia - encounter hardships - somebody dies - start walking through Mongolia - encounter hardships - somebody dies - start walking through China, Tibet....etc etc. you get the picture until we end up in India. And that's it !!! <br/><br/>I ask myself - ""So what?""<br/><br/>The characters are one dimensional at best. I got to the stage where I couldn't tell one from the other. And as for the Polish / Russian accents. They may be authentic - I don't know - but the fact that I see two Irish actors (Farrell and Ronan) with strange accents didn't help matters.<br/><br/>Acting: Farrell is good here to be honest. He carries that menace and unpredictability around with him with great aplomb. His accent though sullies it for me. Harris and Ronan are okay too. However, Burgess didn't do it for me. His presence, or lack of it, let the film down I fear. But he is new enough to this game so it might get better for him - if he gets another chance.<br/><br/>Photography: As you would expect - the landscape dominates the story and is captured beautifully.<br/><br/>Overall - watching the film was just as much of an endurance test as the walk itself. And the rushed ending twee to the extreme.<br/><br/>Poor - 5/10."
"FilmRap","6","12","24","17 December 2010"," We cared about who these characters symbolized but not about them
","This movie has all the ingredients for an epic movie. The story is that a handful of prisoners escape from a Russian gulag in 1940 and trek across Siberia to the Himalayas and ultimately into India more that 4000 miles. There are freezing cold temperatures, snow storms, sand storms, blistering hot desserts, gigantic mountains, starvation, lack of water. The actors include Ed Harris, Jim Sturgess and Colin Farell all who do a terrific job as does the the supporting cast, especially Saoirse Ronan a spirited 15 year old actress, under the direction of Peter Weir who had a 29 million dollar budget. The scenes are quite realistic as you can almost feel their numbness in the frigid temperatures, the pain from the blisters on their feet and their parched throats or deliciousness of an occasional oasis of water. The story is based on popular memoir written by Slavomit Racuwicz in the 1950s which sold 500,00 copies worldwide. It was ultimately determined that the author, while he was prisoner in the gulag for awhile, did not make this trek himself but based it on stories that he had heard about. Peter Weir and his team or writers and producers extensively researched the subject and ultimately this adventure is also based on the experiences that some real people actually went through. Certainly it is tribute to the human spirit, the will and ability of man to survive the horrors of mankind and the harshness of nature. The problem that we had with this two hour and 13 minute movie is that the individual stories of each of the characters were not developed in a manner, which engaged us. Yes, we ultimately learned about some of them, usually through a brief conversation. We did not find that their stories came together nor did it made us care about them as individuals as much as we may have cared for them for who they symbolized. As survivors who were seeking freedom through an almost impossible (and very long) path, we rooted for them. But in the end, we don't think we shall remember them. FilmRap.net"
"intelearts","9","6","10","7 March 2011"," My 382nd Review: Epic without sentimentality - a better film for its straightforward approach
","Research affirms that 56 millions Soviet citizens died in the Gulags.<br/><br/>The Way Back focuses on one story, without melodrama or fuss (and some will want it to be more an adventure film, but it is a more realistic take than that). It is serious about suffering - not in any generic horror fashion - but genuinely, how much can humans survive and are willing to survive to get to freedom. This is film-making where the plot is foremost - and what a plot. The film reveals in the first 20 seconds that plot, but takes over 2 hours to show how it is achieved.<br/><br/>I personally came away from this deeply inspired, partly because it really makes you think that if they can achieve what they achieved, then how can I not complete any task in front of me, and secondly, because it is not glorified story-telling - it keeps it focus and keeps this pretty plain and simple - and yet it totally hypnotic.<br/><br/>At every stage the detailing and the relationships are well done - but it is the effort that carries this to the heights - and like 127 hours you can complain that it's not full-blown production heavy filming - and you'll be right, but like 127 hours what you'll get instead, if you can let yourself become involved, an extraordinary journey that defies all sense of human effort.<br/><br/>Well worth the effort. It is a story of the triumph of the human will and a very good watch."
"Ryan_MYeah","8","6","10","23 February 2011"," The Way Back isn't for the faint of heart, but it's visceral, and visual creativity makes it an experience worth taking.
","I recently got a chance to see the grand epic The Way Back. This isn't a perfect movie, but I'm gladly going to give it thumbs up.<br/><br/>Based on an impossible, but incredible true tale, the film centers on a group of people who escape from a concentration camp in Siberia, and attempt to travel all the way to India on foot. This includes the leader, a young Polish POW named Janusz (Played by Jim Sturgess), a no crap from anyone criminal named Valka (Played by Colin Farrell), an American immigrant simply known as Mr. Smith (Played by Ed Harris), and the mysterious Irena (Played by Saoirse Ronan), an orphan who tags along with the group.<br/><br/>The film is a dazzling epic directed by Peter Weir, a visual artist best known for films like Dead Poets Society and The Truman Show. And while it certainly isn't his best directed, it's certainly one of his most beautiful. He doesn't fall back on the well known three act structure, but that's probably for the better, as the film beholds plenty of things to keep us watching. The journey is a long and visceral experience, and his ensemble cast is deeply effective, specifically that of Saoirse Ronan, who steals each and every scene she's in by delivering brilliance through understatement.<br/><br/>Each and every one of Weir's technical crew deserves nothing but praise, such as Russell Boyd for cinematography that calls back to the epics of David Lean, Lee Smith's smart film cutting, and the incredible Oscar nominated makeup team of Edouard Henriques, Greg Funk and Yolanda Toussieng. Their work which includes hardships like overheat, illness, exhaustion, and malnourishment adds a subtle depth to the pain of the characters, and makes it feel more genuine.<br/><br/>The Way Back isn't for everyone, but it's an experience I think most should have at least once.<br/><br/>I give it *** out of ****"

","This is my second review, and I just had to do it...<br/><br/>As I am from the Eastern part of Europe (and though a young man) I know of all the sufferings our people from that time, and this is partially a slight view what they had to deal with... <br/><br/>The first part (and for me the toughest) tells us what was it like to be a (mainly falsely) accused person in Siberia. By the way, most if the prisoners were driven there by trains, thousands of miles. And no, not in first class, not even tourist class wagons, but in cattle cars... And they had to travel all that way without any stops, being packed in small wagons dozens of them trying to stay alive... Many of them left their lives while the train kept moving... <br/><br/>And what was the life in Siberian prison camp, well, you will have just a glimpse of that in that movie, hopefully there will be another movie one day (hopefully from Russia, if they finally admit the manslaughter the CCCP = USSR did) to take that subject in further details...<br/><br/>But lets keep the politic s.. behind now<br/><br/>To go further, this movie has several layers, and the second biggest for me was, how darn big this world really is, one day you are in snowy wasteland and then you are in the desert (of course, actually it takes several months to go either ways). You just have to admire the world as it is and the scenery, which was brilliantly captured in this movie!<br/><br/>There are minor details you can complain about this movie (how can they be so fit after this whole journey etc) but all after all, this is a great picture of not only that time, but a great story to tell us and something to think about!

","My top 10 list is sure gonna be hard to make this year. There have so many great-but-not-GREAT movies this year and The Way Back is one of them. Don't get me wrong, it is an excellent film but the screenplay isn't quite as good or interesting as it has been in some of Weir's other movies. Not that that stops Weir from directing this film in the masterful manner that he usually shows, seriously, I think he is one of the few directors in film history who can ""do anything"" if that makes sense because despite any flaws this film may have, it is a beautiful piece of work and if DP Russell Boyd doesn't get an Oscar nom then eyebrows will be raised. The acting is as reliably good as we've come to expect from the cast (I still can't believe that Saoirse Ronan is ONLY 16 with the number of great roles she has on her CV) with the exception of Colin Farrell, who is absolutely fantastic as the violent Russian criminal whose ""skills"" the other escapees may come to need. With this and In Bruges, his transition from Hollywood bad-boy to respectable actor is complete, the performance is Oscar-nomination worthy at least and he stands out to the point where it is weaker in sections without his character. Some critics have labeled The Way Back a disappointment and whilst I can see why, its still matches a lot of the other beloved films this year for quality and I hope it isn't completely ignored come January 25th."

"DICK STEEL","10","7","14","18 March 2011"," A Nutshell Review: The Way Back
","Once in a while a film comes along to reinforce the point of Man's propensity to survive against near impossible odds, where if we put our minds to something it's usually mind over matter to get to where we want to despite that of naysayers. It's also a tale of conflict between being trapped and free, where the flight to freedom comes with insurmountable risks, that it may make better sense to survive under captivity than to die free men. If given a choice, which option will you opt for?<br/><br/>The opening scene is chilling, where a Soviet interrogator gains the upper hand in his session with Pole Janusz (Jim Sturgess), accused of being anti-Communist, speaking bad about then leader of the Soviet Union Josef Stalin, and being a spy. Worse, intelligence and accusations gathered come directly from the confessions of one's wife, whether coerced or under threat and duress, and becomes the death knell of a sentence being sent to Siberia for decades of hard labour. And as a reminder, the camp commandant advises that it is Mother Nature who will prevent any inmate from escaping.<br/><br/>This will deter all except for the most determined, and assembling a rag tag crew of men desperate and hopeful enough to get out of their predicament, many there because of being in similar boats, each with varied skills to count on from somebody lighting up the mood, to gatherers and hunters, to cooks and painters, and so on, who also add as the unceremonious fodder in biting the dust when the time comes. Amongst the crew are Ed Harris as the American prisoner Mr Smith who got jailed by the Russians, and Colin Farell's Russian Valka, a gangster who's in jail to maintain ""law and order"" and who is tired of being stuck in this sole mission in life. Saoirse Ronan shows up midway through the film to stir up team dynamics as being the only female in the group, and outside of the age demographics being the youngest of the lot.<br/><br/>It's been a long time - some 7 years - since Peter Weir last helmed a film, and in some ways this celebration of the triumph of man's spirit is quite in line with his The Truman Show starring Ed Harris too, where a man journeys beyond his comfort zone to seek true freedom from the clutches of an engineered life brought about by a television producer. Here he puts you right into the thick of the action, as if you're constantly alongside the group of escapees, and having to feel every predicament, and highs and lows in their quest for freedom, feeling every bit of elation as they overcome small obstacles, and feel their despair when the whole world seem to conspire against their escape. <br/><br/>From the icy cold winds and snow storms in Siberia to the ultra dry Mongolian desert, the special effects and makeup departments deserve every bit of respect for the realistic recreation of the external human condition under such extreme weather circumstances. Cinematography is also top notch be it to enable the freezing cold temperatures to be felt, or the heat wave across sandy landscapes, and the rich greenery of the mountains in India. You'd come to expect plenty of food rationing, sourcing, hunting, and perhaps it is this outdoor survival instinct that makes the film a little more interesting, yet also sticking to expectations without surpassing it.<br/><br/>And the best of Man get brought out, rather than to focus of negatives that would usually plague escape films like these. Sure a bunch of relative strangers put together have their differences, but I believe like them, everyone understands the power of sticking together, pulling resources and contributiing to their strengths, and in doing so increases the odds of survival. It's like Survivor the reality show, only that everyone belongs to the same team in the building of shelters and food contribution. A reminder that unity comes strength, with a poignant finale brought about by a haunting score. Definitely recommended!"

","A seven-year gap separates Peter Weir's last film, Master and Commander (2003), and his latest, The Way Back. The respected Australian director of Witness (1985), Dead Poets Society (1989) and The Truman Show (1998) delivers a visually spectacular film that pits Man's unwavering will to survive against the merciless forces of nature.<br/><br/>Inspired by true events, Weir's film is set in the 1940s during a time when Eastern Europe was besieged by Nazism and Stalinism. Told from the perspective of a Polish man named Janusz (Jim Sturgess) accused by his wife of spying for enemy nations, The Way Back chronicles his escape together with a few other men from a POW camp in remote Soviet Union.<br/><br/>Weir's handling of his cast is remarkable. He places them in hostile environments and pushes them to act as their characters' circumstances dictate. In one scene, out of extreme hunger, a man scrambles to pick up a millipede and chews it in his mouth. In another scene, a group of men desperately laps up mud water.<br/><br/>Despite the unbearable conditions, the actors manage to dramatically convey the physical torture and suffering their characters are forced to endure as they trek thousands of miles on foot over freezing Siberian snow, arid Mongolian desert, and across the Himalayas to India where they finally find freedom.<br/><br/>Shot by Russell Boyd, the Oscar-winning cinematographer of Master and Commander, The Way Back features a number of wide, aerial shots that show the fragility of Man in an environment that, on many occasions, threaten to consume him. The events that occur in this film are at times so incredible that it seems more fictional as the clock ticks. How could anyone possibly survive such a death trek?<br/><br/>A sudden appearance by Saoirse Ronan, who plays a Polish girl, midway through the film seems like a character conjured up out of thin air. Moreover, she looks too clean and beautiful for someone who has been lost in the woods for days, without food and water. Speaking of sudden occurrences, Colin Farrell, who plays a snobbish and volatile man, also leaves the group midway with a reason that is not clearly backed by character motivation.<br/><br/>All these are surprising because Weir is quite an excellent writer, and many of his films are memorable for their characters. The performances, however, are top-notch, with special credit going to Farrell, who normally does not command the screen that well. In a nutshell, The Way Back is a beautiful film, well-directed, and acted, but let down by poor characterizations and a screenplay that is too far-fetched to be plausible.<br/><br/>GRADE: B- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"

","Director Peter Weir, who also wrote the screenplay and produced this movie, has managed to create an epic film with some marvelous landscapes where the main message here is the constant struggle for life and freedom. He explores extreme situations lived by the characters in a very effective way. You can almost feel all the desperation and the great effort to keep going even in so many radical circumstances like the climate changes and starvation. In addition, I found interesting that Weir focused more on the philosophical and reflexive state of the characters instead of just showing us their day-to-day relations and interactions.<br/><br/>About the story, after being accused of espionage in Russia during the height of communism, Zoran (Dragos Balkur) finds himself wrongfully imprisoned in a gulag in the heart of Siberia, his only thoughts ones of escape. At the gulag he meets Valka (Farrell), a thug and gangster with a knife that Zoran needs to escape. He also enlists Mr. Smith (Ed Harris), the only American in the gulag, to help with the escape and together with a few others they manage to break free from the gulag, but that's only the start of the story. From there they need to travel, on foot, thousands of miles into India, the only communist free country anywhere near them. Ronan stars as Irena, a Russian girl the escapees pick up along the way.<br/><br/>This is a moving film, based on a true story, told beautifully by Peter Weir. The locations are gorgeous. From the harsh snow-covered trees of Siberia, a terrifying blizzard blowing through the trees, to the stark, barren landscape of the deserts between Russia and China as they travel over the sand. The viewer gets the full brunt of the harsh conditions these men needed to survive to get to safety.<br/><br/>There are moments of rye humor, and deep emotion. And a quietly growing bond between men who have nothing in common but the journey, and their individual capacity to endure it. But some may find the film a bit slow in a number of parts so it helps to have a great interest in the subject matter. The film isn't boring, but I can see some people seeing it that way, especially if you're used to today's action movies.<br/><br/>The finale is the most intriguing part of the movie. Tricky almost but it resonates with the sadness of these broken humans, how the woman has stood in place punishing herself for a lifetime for her betrayal, the man having to wait a lifetime to absolve her. But everything said, I just felt the emotional factor was a bit less.<br/><br/>The performances are also great. The director took a huge risk casting Sturgess as the main lead because he is new to this game, but he did an amazing job as a man that needs to escape inescapable odds to right a wrong he didn't even admit. Farell as Valka is as brilliant as always and shows his versatility again. His scary performance as a killer and psychopath that loves the people who put him in the prison he finds himself in, is a treat to watch. He carries that menace and unpredictability around with him with great aplomb. He and his distinguishable accent are remarkable. Ed Harris has also given a solid performance as always. Ronan is great as a girl who gets help from men that shouldn't be able to give it. She has the right balance of vulnerability and strength to make her great to watch. She is great actor and a worthy Oscar nominee for her performance in The Atonement. This great cast including every other supporting actors really makes you care about the slowly bonding group as they travel mile after mile through harsh conditions and dangerous environments.<br/><br/>One should also mention the make-up done in the movie. The make-up crew did an incredible job on how the aspect of the human body changes along such a hard journey and they certainly deserved the Oscar nomination they received.<br/><br/>All in all, this is great inspirational movie that anyone that who enjoys a good prison escape film should watch. Big production, excellent actors, big scenery, extremely cold weather, extremely hot weather, lots of suffering by everybody involved, it's worthy to watch this movie just because of the landscapes, so vast and majestic. After all these praises, some may find my rating a bit low but the movie just lacked the heart-wrenching emotional moments that this kind of movie should have. Besides that, its a must see the movie for the amazing cinematography and commendable performances. I rate it 7.5 out 10."

","This is a grand and touching movie about the human spirit and quest for freedom. A real great escape. Good points: Well directed makes you feel the cold of Siberea and the thirst and heat of the desert. The Gulag and its horrors are quite well portrayed. There is an epic sweep and some very beautiful scenery. The acting is good. Ronan does a good job. She looks the part is very angelic looking and provides a good balance to the male actors. Colin Farrell provides some comic relief though he is not too Russian in style. Ed Harris is always convincing and looks quite haggard for the role. Jim Sturgess is very competent - though not very Polish sounding - maybe it's better than a bad accent.<br/><br/>Faults: Don't really get to know who the secondary cast are. Not much introduction to them prior to the march beginning or during the march. Maybe a bit less of the walk and a bit more background and later life would have balanced things a bit.

","There are lots of nice ideas - more in suggestion than in the realisation by this film. Committed to a Gulag in deepest Siberia - apparently Nature will take its toll upon the prisoners rather than the conditions in the camp. This early statement strikes a wrong note right at the beginning and, unfortunately, this error is replicated for other overblown assertions in setting up the tale. The uneasy relationship between the escapees throughout their 4,000 mile journey also strikes a false note. Visually, there are some nice scenes but it doesn't make up for the thinness of the characterisations, the brevity of the detail in the survival skills necessary for this trek and the inevitable bonding that occurs - if only for the duration of the enforced comradeship. A tolerable film experience but not a classic."
"AlexM77","5","5","10","5 November 2013"," ""It is better to die on your feet than live on your knees""
","Every nation tells stories with its emotional tone. Americans love happy endings, Russian mentality makes us think about the gloomy ""eternal"", British stories are dry and melancholic. In this movie we see Polish history. The most vivid expressions of ""Polish history"" can be found at the Henryk Sienkiewicz's stories. Their striking contrast - the complete lack of causal/effect relationships and the construction of stories in the format of ""chain of miraculous events"". It is very important that this is not a chain of circumstances, exactly the chain of miracles. A kind of Polish religiosity does not give them opportunity to tell stories without the full intervention of God. ""The Way Home"" - a typical Polish work. There is no reason, there are only evil and satanic effects. Endless gratuitous evil consequences. Someone was arrested for being a good actor, another - for photographing the Kremlin. Movie with the maximum gain of hysterical expressionism. This even has some logic... But further becomes more frightening. The camp somewhere in Yakutia is full of Poles. No Russians there. Only criminals. In addition there are also the Poles, Lithuanians, and even an American of Finnish descent. All this confusion should not be confusing. Further - better. They walk on foot very, very far away. Here we can indulge in a long discussion on the subject of how long they walked, with no falls, how they didn't inadvertently turn to Kazakhstan, how they passed 4 borders. These little things are not important in this history... I repeat - a chain of divine miracles. On the way, in the taiga (Russian forest ;), Polish expedition meets (a miracle!) Polish girl who followed them a couple of days. From where she was walking and with what point - Polish viewers should not worry. And the further plot is in the same format. Dying from cold wind and hunger, without stealing food (they believe it is wrong and immoral), suffer moral questions, etc. There is no sense to destroy this movie. It is itself pathetic as idle charge. Film joked at itself, making the leading and the most interesting character Valka-Farrell, the Russian criminal, who, by an order livelier, becomes more believable and risky of all these stereotyped characters, for whom the greatest cynicism - is not to give his bread and dying itself to survive. How much idiocy in this movie because of religious fanaticism...<br/><br/>The plot of this film. Briefly. A handful of foreign political prisoners, grinded by millstones of the GULAG, because ""Stalin hates foreigners,"" diluted by one Soviet felon, escapes from pokey. Escaped easily and naturally, under the noses of guards, through meter gap in the barbed wire (probably because there was not enough wood for the camp's (located in the deep wood) fence). Anyway, the writers just did not have time to work on this piece of the script, they were too busy with the anti-Soviet propaganda. However, everyone already has habit for such films, and I wasn't ready for political subtext, so been waiting for the development of the main plot. But the story was not there. At all.<br/><br/>A bunch of motley prisoners of different nationalities, communicating in some way in one language goes, goes and goes to the South... Simple as it is, and all want to eat... Sometimes, they want to drink. No plot, no disputes and disagreements or even no live or ""animal"" communication (in such conditions and with such contingent!). The problem can't be solved even by a Russian prisoner Valentin (played brilliantly by Colin Farrell, BTW), at the same time being the most appropriate, sober, vibrant, cynical and most paradoxical, the most honest person of all this company. In a short, a film about the tourists who ran out of sausages. Apparently realizing the absurdity and boredom of such a scenario, the authors in a quickly way made a small correction (to create suspense and sentimental tears), consisting in a new fugitive - girl Irene, Polish orphan, whose appearance in the middle of the movie was just as absurd as the film itself. So, going together, they moved and moved on.<br/><br/>But where they were going - is a special dialog...Bad mark for your geography, gentlemen authors! Walking to the South along the shore of Lake Baikal, which extends to the South-West! Then, stubbornly continuing to go to the South, suddenly turn up in Gobi Desert, located far to the east (logically they should have hit the western parts of Mongolia, where rolling hills, numerous lakes, and at least one major river). How the characters could die of thirst all the way long on the open spaces of the Mongolian, immediately after crossing the border, despite the fact that the whole northern part of the country (in the west, and in the east) is covered by numerous rivers?.. It's amazing that our characters are dying from the heat both at day and night, the authors apparently don't know how cold it gets in Mongolia at night. What's next? And then, after passing the Gobi Desert, and continuing to go to the South (even turning once to the east direction), lucky fugitives are in the West, in Tibet! In Lhasa. Did they then cross the Himalayas and they stomping to the south, remained unknown, but I would not be surprised and about this. It is also strange that all this motley crowd, educated, well-rounded cultured and with inconceivable outlook, was not aware of the fact that Mongolia, for more than 15 years (from the 1924th) is ruled by communists. But about Japanese-Chinese War, which began in the 37th, they know. Awesome ... I give 0 points for a ridiculous movie, and 5 for Valka. Let him be the most negative character, but at the same time, the most adequate."
"moviexclusive","7","5","10","23 March 2011"," Peter Weir's tale of man against the elements is a compelling tale of survival that is as harsh and sobering as it is heartening and uplifting
","Famed Australian director Peter Weir's first film in seven years is the survival yarn ""The Way Back""- based on the 1956 novel by Slavomir Raciwz- about a small group of prisoners who escape from a Soviet gulag in the 1940s and brave the elements across a 4,000 km trek from Siberia to India. The veracity of Raciwz's tale has been called into question since its publication, but let that not distract you from Weir's utterly compelling drama, harsh and sobering in its telling, yet thoroughly uplifting in its display of the indomitable will to live. <br/><br/>Weir, who co-wrote the screenplay with Keith Clarke, begins his story through the incarceration of a young Polish cavalry officer Janusz (Jim Sturgess), sent to a Siberian camp after being accused of criticising the Communist party and spying for foreign powers. In case the bleak wintry surroundings haven't already smothered any hope Janusz and his fellow inmates may have had of escape, a Soviet official proclaims on the day of their arrival, ""Nature is your jailer. And she is without mercy"". <br/><br/>History has taught us that there are two kinds of people under these circumstances - the first who would sit out their fate and wait for things to get better; and the second who are determined to take life by their own hands. Films like ""The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas"" and ""Life is Beautiful"" have told of the former, but Weir's film is about the latter, so Janusz will find like company in the form of an enigmatic American Smith (Ed Harris) and a vicious Russian gangster Valka (Colin Farrell). <br/><br/>Weir makes their dreary prison environment come alive with details as Janusz slowly develops a routine for staying alive- saying as little as possible, staying away from Valka's gangster company and avoiding his innate kind inclinations towards other prisoners. Most of this he learns from Smith, who also warns him of another inmate Khabarov (Mark Strong) who may speak fervently of escape but has little real intention of doing so, instead using the hope of others to give his own miserable life purpose. <br/><br/>Weir briefly touches on the psychology of prison life before moving on to the psychology of something much more elemental- mankind's basic will to live. Together with Smith and Valka, Janusz is also joined on his journey of escape by three other prisoners- an artist (Alexandru Potocean), a joker (Dragos Bucur), a mystic (Gustaf Skarsgård)- and later on a young Polish girl Irena (Saoirse Ronan). Aside from Janusz, Weir keeps most of the details about his characters to the trek itself, and their process of learning about each other becomes a mutual one for the audience. <br/><br/>Nature however is a character of its own of many different faces whom our heroes will need to endure against all odds- first the dense subarctic forests where temperatures can dip below 40 at night; then the scorching plains where it can be hotter than 40 in the day, then the blazing Gobi desert with hardly a drop of water to be found for miles on end; and finally the daunting mountains of the Himalayas. Weir's depiction of Nature is vivid and startling, brought to life on location in India, Bulgaria and Morocco instead of some soundstage, and complemented by frequent collaborator Russell Boyd's stunning cinematography. <br/><br/>Weir also does an excellent job of pacing the film, starting with a tense and gripping first hour as Janusz and his fellow inmates plot their escape, make their daring run for it, and are confronted head-on by the severity of the elements. The film seemingly loses some of its initial momentum after the halfway mark, but the more deliberate pace allows for the audience to appreciate the weariness and despair of our heroes journeying from one harsh environment to another. <br/><br/>In this respect, the talented international cast go a long way to give their characters humanity. Ronan brings her signature tenderness to Irena, while Sturgess is restrained and thoughtful as the unofficial leader of the pack. Best of all is Ed Harris, whose natural screen charisma and gravitas is clearly evident in every shot he is in. Harris has always had a knack for playing such stoic strong-willed characters, but he makes Smith something different altogether when his character forms an unlikely bond with Irena. <br/><br/>It is this display of kindness for one another that makes ""The Way Back"" an even more moving experience, as our heroes share what water they have with one another, make hats out of twigs and leaves for one another as shelter from the blazing sun, and carry each other's load when the other is tired- especially as it is amidst the harshest of circumstances. Indeed, Weir's film is humbling and uplifting at the same time, an epic tale of survival whose message of willpower and humanity will resonate long after the credits are over.<br/><br/><ul><li>www.moviexclusive.com</li></ul>"

And examines it in the most beautiful and extreme of settings: Each character being tested to their physical, psychological, and (in one case) spiritual breaking point. <br/><br/>In this movie you will feel the characters' pain and cold, their fear and doubt, their wonder, and their hope. But it is the journey, not the characters, or the scenery that is the star of this show. <br/><br/>This movie will leave it's mark on you."
"robbierunciman-1","9","6","13","21 January 2011"," awesome scenery
","I enjoyed the film, though agreed with other reviewers that it could have been better edited. The main thing I loved about this movie was the way that it showed the brutality of the Stalin regime and how big events have an impact on real people. Those who died nameless and unremembered and unmourned deaths were 'rescued' by this film. I liked way its showed there was respect but clearly not friendship between the men - but who could not communicate with each other about themselves. The saddest part of the story was the young girl who joined them on the trek and died before reaching safety and the critical role she played holding the group together. Colin Farrel was good and his role neatly illustrated the hold that Stalin has on the Russian people, who no matter how abused - still saw him as a hero. It reminds us behind the numbers of deaths that occurred in WW2 there were real people with real stories, just like us, who had to endure much worse than those in the west and did not enjoy a peace dividend.<br/><br/>I loved the scenes in Siberia with the flies (midges in Scotland and Mossies in Spain always find me and I know how they felt).<br/><br/>The great trick that the director pulled off was the subtly contrast the claustrophobia of the camp and the work parties with the epic distances and landscape that they had to cross to reach safety."
"tieman64","Null","3","5","29 March 2015"," Walkabout
","Directed by Peter Weir, ""The Way Back"" watches as a group of men escape a Soviet Gulag. They then travel south from Siberia to Mongolia to China to India. The film was based on the memoirs of Slawomir Rawicz, a Polish POW.<br/><br/>Though it purports to be based on a ""true story"", every inch of ""The Way Back"" oozes implausibility. The actions, mannerisms, words and survival tactics of Weir's characters ring false, and the film's plot is blatantly a tall tale based on phony memoirs. Whilst it is certainly possible to travel from Siberia to India on foot, Weir's film never convincingly conveys why human beings would risk their lives doing this. Aware of this fact, Weir inserts various heavy-handed subplots about ""freedom"" and the ""drive to escape communism"", as though Eurasia were so small, so devoid of hiding places, that one must logically scale the Himalayas and trek across China and Mongolia in the name of liberty.<br/><br/>""The Way Back"" boasts gorgeous location photography and fine performances by Ed Harris, Jim Sturgess and a young Saoirse Ronan. Actor Colin Farrell steals the show as Valka, a murderous Russian inmate with a fondness for Joseph Stalin. Unfortunately Valka - whom Farrell imbues with wonderful textures - exits Weir's picture early. A better film would have perhaps followed him, as everything after his departure reeks of incredulity.<br/><br/>6/10 – Worth one viewing. See ""Papillon""."

Yes, these Characters do get some skin irritations, and some do die from the trek, it is played out with as little investment as possible from the Audience.<br/><br/>It is sprawling, to say the least, and the escapees do bond enough to make it as a team, but there is, unrealistically, not enough conflict and Drama. It is all handled in such a delicate way, that it is too Artsy for its own good.

","The computer graphic images were very good--most people don't realize how much of the film is computer graphics...most of the scenery...the make up effects sunburns etc...even Irene's swollen feet. The scenes in the river--the snake--all of it anymore is suspect! It has gotten so good that most people are not even aware of it.<br/><br/>Computer graphics work best in films like this which don't have a lot of indoor scenes--there is a tendency to make things too perfect that they need to fight and are most identifiable in city and indoor scenes. The real world is blander and more imperfect.<br/><br/>Anyway finally to this film. It is all quite good and follows what I read years ago in Gulag Archipelago...the vast majority of prisoners were innocent. Stalin produced incalculable misery and murder--no unbiased person who reads Solzhenitsyn thinks other wise.<br/><br/>The actual story itself (6 prisoners escaping) is not true not even as an embellished version. If you want that try As Far As My Feet Will Carry Me....but be warned! that film is highly embellished and this movie script although fiction covers details of the camp and Soviet ""ambiance"" much more accurately and is a much more enjoyable watch. Suspend your disbelief.<br/><br/>The movie has a Polish accent literally...but represents the Stalin and Soviet repression very well.<br/><br/>The girl although contrived was handled nicely....I was fearful when she appeared that the movie would deteriorate into some stupid romantic drama---it did not.<br/><br/>Good entertainment RECOMMEND."
"sunraider","7","3","5","31 July 2011"," Good but runs out of steam at the end
","I had avoided seeing this movie for some time because the critics had not been too kind to it. But I finally gave it a chance and am glad I did. It's a long journey, but what kept me interested were the spectacular visuals and the fact that I liked the little group of disparate characters that had banded together. It didn't matter that individual character development was slight; I liked the ""group."" I was particularly pleased that the film didn't resort to the cliché of having a traitor emerge who sells out the group. This group were decent people (even Coin Farrell's criminal has some honor) and they didn't turn on each other. When members succumbed to the elements it was because they simply couldn't withstand the physical punishment anymore, not because the other group members had cheated them out of their share of food or left them behind. The most tender scene was when the lone female of the group is on her last legs and one of the men scoops her up in his arms and carries her while she pleads with them to simply leave her behind.<br/><br/>The film can be divided into three parts--Gulag, forest & desert trek, and crossing the Himalyas to freedom in India. Unfortunately, the last part of the film feels rushed. Crossing the Himalyas on foot when you're already half starved and recovering from frostbite and other ailments is quite a feat and deserved more attention than was given here. In addition, the actual conclusion or ending is emotionally unsatisfying. We're told nothing about any of the survivors except the main character and even with him it's not much. He goes back to Poland once communism collapses in Europe in 1989--but what did he do after reaching India? Fight with the partisans; go to America? What did the others do? If the ""author"" of the book on which this is based didn't know, then say so. At least give us something to take away with us after following these characters on such a long and arduous journey."

That's all right if one watches the projection on a huge screen, not so impressive at home on a small screen. I don't know, it seemed to me like a lot of effort for not a great deal of a movie experience. We have seen this plot so many times before! in black and white, in color, in mono and in stereo and finally gets to be quite repetitive. Watching the locations and time of the year --hard winter in one place, hottest summer in another-- one tends to imagine that the actors involved in this project didn't have a lot of fun under those circumstances.

But the struggle of the ""run"" from the gulag is well represented in the sheer inability to go on from the cold of the Siberian winter. <br/><br/>Each of the characters are given plausible traits and back-stories.

My father had the pleasure of meeting Slavomir many years ago (before he passed). They shared a cup of tea in his modest front room and for several hours he generously gave my father his time as they talked about the harrowing experiences and miraculous survival described in the accounts of the book.
Before my father left, he asked if Slavomir would sign his copy of the book and of course he graciously and humbly obliged, a kind, a humble, a modest and inspiring man. This is the copy I now have. It will always be one of my most treasured possessions.
The passion, the depth, the feeling in this book, it is like nothing else I have ever read. It has affected me and stayed with me from the first time I read it. It just captivated me and made my heart ache. No matter how many times I read it, I cannot stop myself from crying. You come to know each person Slavomir travels with, you come to know Slavomir himself and you feel his pain and you feel the pain of his losses and the pain of his struggles. You wonder how any person could survive one, yet alone all of the undertakings he describes. 
The writing just blows you away. You are left in awe. You are left wondering how you have ever complained in your life. After finishing the book you sit completely numb, completely humbled. You wish you could tell this man he is a hero. 
You are thankful for everything you have ever taken for granted and for everything you have. You will never forget this book.
Slavomir told my father, he did not want a movie. That it would be dramatising the terrible deaths of the people he described, who he thought of as family, and a dishonor to their memory.
The film was made after he died.
It is terrible. It misses whole miraculous accounts from the book that are crucial to its structure. It has no depth. It has no heart. It completely lacks the gut-wrenching, heart-wrenching feeling the books carves into your soul.
It is horribly American type dramatisation, empty, shallow, without feeling, without power, exactly what Slavomir feared. It bears no resemblance to the book.
I actually watched it by accident when my partner had it on and it wasn't for half an hour that I realized it was supposed to be an adaptation based on Slavomir's book. Please read the real story. If they ever made a film, I hoped it would be a masterpiece. The book was a masterpiece. Slavomir deserved a masterpiece. This is hollow, failing to encompass any emotion or any of the magic of the book. Read it. Then come back to the film and see it for what it is. Garbage.

","I was very disturbed about the one-sidedness of the otherwise great movie. It was an epic human adventure. Just let alone the politics and show the human side on the movie. The good point is, that aspect IS actually on the movie. But when you get into politics, the lack of objectivity bothers me a lot. Stalin is just as much hated in Hollywood as Hitler. With forgetting Russia suffered the most by the world war II and Stalin damaged hitlers powers the most, and after all it was Stalin's forces that destroyed Hitler. I am not trying to create sympathy, I am just trying to balance the over- biased view. There were innocent people falsely accused in the gulags, yes. There were people politically critical or the regime falsely accused of spying, yes. And then there were real spies and conspirors, lots of them! (from Germany, US and Japan) But to show the prison full of completely innocent people? As I said, hating Stalin is easy. And obviously, it is an easy formula to sell movies to add some anti-communist propaganda. (just like the old recipe of sex and violence) <br/><br/>Other than that, great movie, great acting, great plot. Even everybody speaking in English is not really disturbing. Well, only a fool would expect an objective movie from Hollywood about communist Russia anyway. Objectivity would seem as sympatizing with communism.

"raiaishwarya","7","2","3","30 August 2015"," A long determined journey
","The Way Back released in 2010 is a survival adventurous drama film directed by Peter Weir. The film is inspired by The Long Walk (1956), the memoir by former Polish prisoner of war Slawomir Rawicz who escaped from a Soviet Gulag along a group of 7 other men and walked 4,000 miles and continued across Mongolia and the Gobi Desert, ending finally months later in India for freedom in World War II. But through the movie we learn about only two or three walkers. Later they meet a women also on there way who added a small element of clamor in the film.<br/><br/>The movie is beautiful with the aspect of locations shot, the acting was brilliant by every actor, the comedy is hilarious hardly whenever it's there and the story is damn inspiring. Director Peter Weir has crafted a film that's thoroughly involving and also leads the audience to struggle throughout to complete the long journey. The way the director portrayed two death scenes in the film were awesome and well acted. In whole, it is an entertaining deterministic and adventurous prison escape movie with a touch of the epic about it. <br/><br/>After the starting scenes in the prison camp, and the escape, there is not much drama, continued with monotonous survival attempts. Also there are many facts in which the movie seems to be lacking to provide: details of survival- How exactly did they survive death by exposure in subzero Mongolia? Why didn't some of their meat spoil? How did their footwear hold up along 4000 miles when it was not even good for 400 miles. This makes the movie a bit incomplete.<br/><br/>The film was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Makeup. The movie has lot to learn from it but at times the movie leads to bore down, so it would have been better if it was a bit shortened."
"ivan2012","7","2","3","28 April 2012"," Amazing journey but did this really happen?
","It is amazing that this group of people walked so far, first through Siberia during winter, then the Gobi desert, and finally the Himalayas. And the things they had to eat and drink along the way to survive like muddy water. I felt the part about crossing the Himalayas was rushed at the end. The movie spent so much time showing their travels in Siberia and the desert, but so little time showing how they crossed the Himalayas. It would seem to me that crossing the Himalayas would've been the most difficult part. This movie could've easily been stretched out to 2.5 hours.<br/><br/>The movie claims to be inspired by real events, but there seems to be questions about whether the book it was based on was accurate. Also, the cover photo for this movie shows Colin Farrel with the desert in the background. Ahh ... this is extremely misleading because (**SPOILER**) his character was only in the first half of the movie and never actually made it to the desert."
"dutchs-1","7","2","3","22 April 2012"," Why the Changes?
","When Peter Weir directs and Ed Harris is in the cast, it's a foregone conclusion the result will be pretty good. Also, we all know that changes have to be made when adapting a book to the screen. Complex events have to be simplified, minor characters and events have to be dropped, and so on. But when the changes make the film LESS compelling than the book, that's a riddle. In the book, Janusz' wife isn't tortured. Instead he's drugged into signing the confession. The month long death march to the camp site is completely missing. The deal with the commandant's wife to time the escape until her husband is away isn't in the film. In the book, nobody dies of frostbite in Siberia, and nobody turns back. Two men and the young woman die crossing the Gobi Desert, and a fourth dies within sight of India when a snow cornice gives way. Smith (Ed Harris) did not bring his son to Russia with him. I find it really hard to believe nobody in the group knew Mongolia was Communist - in the book India is the goal from the outset because that's the only place the prisoners know will be safe. All four survivors make it to India - Janusz does not take off on his own. In fact he spends a month in the hospital. This is still a very good film but I don't see how the changes improved in the least on the book. Also, while I'm perfectly aware the authenticity of the narrative has been questioned, I give literary debunkers next to zero credence. Literature as a field of study is a moribund, completely exhausted field and the only thing left for ""researchers"" is tearing down others' work."

"bnair-14502","9","1","1","29 March 2018"," The Inspiration of all Inspirations!
","First of all, I just want to point out that this movie was extremely inspiring and one of the most inspiring movies I have ever seen. The fact that the need to get out of the Siberian Labor Camp, where the group of men were put, made them go on a voyage to India, which in my opinion was a death wish. The brutal weather conditions, the exhaustion, the constant walking, the tiredness, and the weight they had to carry to ensure they had necessary things to remain alive all played a role in the death wish they embarked on. These group of men were on a mission and their freedom and break away from communism was super important that they had to get as far away as possible, except for the one guy that decided to stay since he has been a communist all his life. 
Before being set upon their journey, the conditions at the Siberian Labor Camp were pretty accurate, in terms of how it seemed like it was every man for them self and the men there would trade their food rations or other items for clothing in order to keep warm, given the weather conditions. The shaving of heads was also another accurate portrayal that, believe it or not, was present in many other camps as well such as the Gulag and Nazi Concentration Camps. 
Overall, this movie was by far the best movie we have seen because it just goes to demonstrate the lengths that people are wiling to uptake just to get out of a camp and how much people really cared for the lives that they wanted to have."
"hritchey-40709","9","1","1","28 March 2018"," Intentionally Frustrating Film
","If you're looking for a film that makes you feel as if you're suffering along with the protagonists, you have come to the right place. The frustration I felt while watching this film is a testament to the wonderful job of the filmmakers and actors to make the plight of the characters palpable. In my opinion, what is the point of making a film about the very boundaries of human suffering if you do not make the audience feel as if they are suffering along with the main characters? Here, my feeling of frustration began in the Soviet Gulag, which is decently depicted in this film. The audience gets a real sense of the crowding, lice and power structures that were an ever-present part of every concentration camp. I was personally impressed at the addition of Valka's character and the representation of the role that ""career criminals"" played in the camps as the most powerful men in every barrack, namely because of their ability to incite fear and thus get what they want. It was also nice to see the point raised that some detainees in the camp still supported communism. It is important to see this depicted in the film since it is historically accurate that even though these people were imprisoned by the government, they were still loyal to communism and what it stood for. Consequently, in terms of the films accuracy, I was very impressed for a film about the gulags, which are a highly underrepresented subject in Hollywood. If I could change anything I would have added more casualties to the gulag than were shown in the film. It almost makes the conditions of the camp and the brutality of the environment not look as harsh without the almost constant death that would have defined actual life in the gulags. 
The feeling of frustration continued as the group escaped and eventually made their way into the desert on the way to India. I kept feeling as if I wanted the scenes in the desert to end so that I would no longer feel the irritation that rose in me as I just watched them walk over miles and miles of desert. I realized later that this was a choice that the directors of the movie consciously made in an attempt to convey to the audience the real frustration and desperation of the characters. Though there is debate about whether or not this walk to freedom did occur, there is no denying that the walk made you feel the pure despair and hopelessness of the protagonists who would go to such lengths to avoid concentration camps. In this sense, I would recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a film about Soviet Gulags. Not only does it provide a painfully real representation of camp life, it conveys the shear desperation that led several men to take on this type of journey. What does it say about the camps that these men would be willing to walk across a continent to escape?"
"acanaan-25253","10","1","1","23 March 2018"," A Must-See Film for Anyone Remotely Interested in Camps
","""The Way Back"" realistically portrays the somewhat subtle, yet incredibly important aspects of living in the camp system, how it affects those within the physical and mental space, and how the camp can act as a form of social molding. In the beginning of the film, we see the main men of the movie in a Gulag in Siberia that is in many ways historically accurate, leaving very few stones unturned. We get a peek at the camp hierarchy, where convicted criminals run the camp and have more power than political prisoners in the Gulag. This is illustrated when Valka, a criminal, stabs a man when he won't give Valka his sweater. Naturally, there's no consequence to Valka as he has his own blade and is allowed to use it at will. We also see that there is a differentiation between death of the body and death of the spirit. Janusz, a newcomer to the Gulag, has a spirit that others try to pray on. This is due to the fact that the camp system leads to physical deterioration, but also is dehumanizing, which can ultimately be key in whether or not someone has the motivation to survive. His mental strength is an asset that the camp system tries to break. We also see the manual labor aspect of the Gulag and how the labor could be dangerous, especially when working certain jobs like the mine. The cigarette currency was also given its own scene in the movie, illustrating how the camp can act as a microcosm for society. The emphasis on the fact that the camp extends beyond the physical structure was also a key aspect of the camp system that other films sometimes fail to recognize. It took the escapees multiple years to finally get to ""freedom"" in India, but the effects of starvation and paranoia from everyone was clear. The camp also had harmful effects on people who never even stepped foot in the camps themselves. Janusz's wife, who ended up testifying against him to the communist party to save her life shows how the camp acted as a form of warning for society, reminding everyone to stay within their boundaries and to not disobey the party, or else. <br/><br/>The best part of the film may have been the humanizing of all of the characters. We see that camp guards are human, especially when during the snowstorm, a guard threatens to shoot the American man, but ultimately stands down. We also see Valka, the criminal, who isn't ""evil"", but just a man trying to survive in the conditions he was brought up in. We see that Irena, the female traveler lies, and that Mr. Smith's actions led to his son's death. No one is purely good or evil.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie has a refreshingly realistic portrayal of camps that we rarely see in other ""concentration camp"" films. Its subtle nuances are accurate, the story it portrays could have actually occurred."

"rmax304823","7","1","1","19 August 2013"," The Big Hike.
","It takes a lot of patience to watch this long movie through. There is nothing to keep your attention glued to the screen. Nobody's head gets wrenched off. There are no high speed pursuits. Not a gun is fired. No explicit sex, not even gratuitous nudity. If the pace were any slower you'd think you were watching something by Werner Herzog.<br/><br/>Peter Weir has shown a taste for the deliberate and the mysterious, especially in his early films. He has a taste for landscape, a sense of place, too. Here, there is not much mystery and the landscape overwhelms the characters until, as the footage rolls along, the characters become clearer and define themselves.<br/><br/>In 1941, half a dozen men are penned up in a gulag in Siberia, some for good reason and some not. Conditions are utterly miserable. The men escape and trudge their way through a forest of snow-laden fir trees that looks like a Christmas card signed by Beelzebub because it's dark and dangerous. Wolves threaten. People freeze to death.<br/><br/>The escaped convicts must avoid any villages because there is a bounty out on them. So they steal and kill their way through the Soviet Union, past Lake Baikal, to the refuge they seek in Mongolia. Except that they find Mongolia has shaken hands with Stalin. So it's on to China, picking up the elfin Saoirse Ronan along the way, then Tibet way up in the Himalayas, then finally salvation in India among the tea pickers of Darjeeling. About half the trekkers have survived the several thousand-mile walk, ragged, filthy, starving.<br/><br/>Lamentably, Saoirse Ronan is not a survivor. It's too bad, too. She's a cute, pale, little pixie. I hated to see her go, not just because she was so fragile but because I could tell her from the men. That was part of the problem. We don't really know the men. We meet them in the gulag but for the most part they only exchange a few words. And when they're all covered with dirt, lice, and sweat, they all resemble each other. I could tell Ed Harris from the others, and Colin Farrel, because I've seen them before. But the main character, the one whose story we know best, the one we're supposed to identify with, is Jim Sturgess. He was a cipher to me. He handles his Russian accent well, as they all do. Russian accents aren't hard to do. They come easily to the native English speech organs, the way Irish accents do. ""So vare do you tink you are GOINK, Meestair?"" See? <br/><br/>It's not a dull movie, once you get past the introduction to the gulag and put on your pelzkappe. Some of the escapees don't change much, but some do. They begin as Darwinian survivors, every man for himself. But, little by little, they reveal themselves. Ed Harris's motto, as the cynical American, is, ""There's no room for sentiment on this trip."" He winds up caring for Ronan and when she gives up the ghost he can barely bring himself to leave her grave.<br/><br/>The final scene carries with it a weighty sense of relief. Not just because the movie is over but because the suffering is."

","A group of prisoners of war escape from a Russian Gulag during the second world war and trek thousands of miles through hostile terrain into freedom. Sounds like a great movie, and it is.<br/><br/>At first the viewer is introduced to the characters inside the prison. The harsh and brutal reality is well portrayed. The actual escape is not shown and they don't seem to be followed. Which seems strange.<br/><br/>The trek through the snow, the mountains and then the deserts is very captivating and dramatic as some of the escapees die. I am not sure where this has been filmed, but I don't think it has been filmed in the real locations. Some visual effects are poorly made (sometimes you can see that they are sitting in a studio, and not in the mountains). This takes away a little of the feeling that the viewer is involved.<br/><br/>Also, some of the actors are not Russian but speak with a Russian accent which at times is appalling. I acknowledge that having some stars in the movie is quite appealing but the accents are dodgy.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a great movie that fits in very well with Peter Weirs previous work."
"rooee","6","5","14","30 December 2010"," Shrunken
","Weir makes no claims to this story – about escapees from a Siberian gulag, and their 4,000-mile trek over the Himalayas – being true as he tells it. So it's fitting that the chameleonic craftsman has created something almost entirely unambiguous: none of Master and Commander's moral tug-of-war; none of the fable-like metaphor of The Truman Show; none of the ghostly near-surrealism of Picnic at Hanging Rock.<br/><br/>The performances are very fine across the board. Farrell (as violent gang-leader Valka) and Harris (as the grizzled American Mr Smith) stand out particularly. Like Robert Duvall or Michael Caine, Harris has developed a face marked with history, etched by happiness and hardship. Like all the players, they enjoy a solid, unfussy script, and hurl themselves into native tongue with admirable vigour.<br/><br/>My main issue with the film is probably lying on the cutting room floor. The work of Terrence Malick, John Hillcoat, Andrew Dominik et al shows that there are fine visionary, worldly, painterly directors out there producing work that is both crowd-pleasing and patient. The quality and relevance of the scenes in The Way Back are not in question – so why do so many of them feel truncated and thus hurried? For the escape itself to burst out of nothing makes sense as this could be argued to mirror the sudden confusion of the escapees and the guards. But too many sequences thereafter feel cursory, silencing their own reverberations. Too many shots of the vastness of this chilly hemisphere are all too brief, stealing away that vital sense of dismal isolation.<br/><br/>Perhaps this was intentional. Perhaps Weir wanted to focus on the brutal close-up, rather than the romantic long shot. But if this is at the expense of the expanse, then I feel it does a disservice to the magnificence of the 4,000-mile task, and we're left with something that feels just a bit too small."
"LydiaOLydia","5","3","7","12 October 2011"," This movie should be about Ukrainians, not Poles.
","Finally - finally a major motion picture that paints a sobering picture of the brutality of Stalin's gulags. Even though roughly equal numbers of innocents died under Stalin as did under Hitler, this brings the current score in terms of major motion picture to something like: Holocaust/Hitler: 84,245, Stalin: 1 or maybe 2. Anyway, it's a start.<br/><br/>The movie follows a small group of a prisoners on their long walk / escape out of Siberia to freedom. Amazingly, a significant percentage of the group are Poles. One other is a Latvian, and another an American. To say that this mix would be unusual in a Gulag in 1939-1940 might be the understatement of the year. Why, by comparison, are Ukrainians, who would make up a noticeable segment (if not an outright majority or close to it) of political prisoners in an actual Gulags strangely absent? The story would be historically plausible were the actors Ukrainian nationalists taken from western Ukraine. The Soviets would not have bothered to send a polish military man (as the lead character was) all the way to Siberia--certainly one accused of sabotage and spying, as ours here was, would have likely been shot outright. However, I guess it's hard enough to get audiences, even ""enlightened"" ones as might go watch this film to warm up to the story at all, so the director had to anchor the main characters as Poles, something that western audiences might be able to latch onto easily. It's a pity nevertheless.<br/><br/>While the gulag scenes were obviously not filmed in Siberia (and nor, I'm guessing, was any of the film) they were more or less well done. However, the film as a whole lacked authenticity and believability. Even if you believe the story to be a metaphor for the whole soviet experience or something, it still should be told well, and I can't say that it was. The characters are remarkably well fed. It is difficult to get a sense of space. And, crucially, it doesn't feel like a walk.<br/><br/>I've done some long walks in tough conditions. The most obvious thing is that when you are tired, you walk in a file, not abreast, as walking in a single line saves brain energy as you just look at the feet in front of you. the characters here must have found that to be not photogenic.<br/><br/>so, 10/10 for the idea and concept, but, alas, 3/10 for execution. it just didn't resonate. i don't think it was a good parable of the struggles under communism, and, by its focus on poles, i don't think it's particularly good history, either. finally, despite what some critics say, i don't really think the characters flesh out that well.<br/><br/>5/10 stars."

","In 1958, Dr. Hugh Richardson, a civil servant and scholar who was one of the world's leading authorities on Tibet, wrote a review of ""The Long Walk"" for The Alpine Journal (UK). Based on his knowledge of the geography of the region, including India, Tibet, Sikkim, Bhutan, and the Gobi, and of the cultures and habits of the peoples there, he concludes that the journey did not happen. Aside from the claim of going for 12 days without water, the descriptions of places and of people do not jibe with the reality on the ground during the time of the walk.<br/><br/>Some examples from his review: ""Apart from Lhasa - which was 'bypassed' - there are no place names; there is also rather scanty detail of scenery, local customs, etc, and what there is is quite uncharacteristic of Tibet.""

It is really amazing how an Irishman (Farrell) looks like and speaks as a real Russian crook! The others, incl.

","I guess I was under a rock somewhere in 2010 when the film came out, but I'm so glad I happened to flip through and found this gem for a stay at home movie night with my dad. Had plenty of action, great dialogue that mixed heart-stopping action and heart-breaking emotions with a hearty dash of humanity and a pinch of humor, and maybe a bit of insanity to tell an astonishing, but doable, tale based on true events.<br/><br/>Ed Harris is phenomenal--tough, emotional, selfish, caring--he's great, as usual. But the big surprise was Collin Farrell. At first I didn't expect much from an hot-tempered Aussie trying to play a Russian thug, but I'm tickled to say I was soooo wrong! Farrell did an amazing job of walking the tightrope between a brazen psychopath and a human jaded and kicked by the struggles to survive in a ruthless world.<br/><br/>Honestly, the whole cast deserved an Oscar nod, and the directing and filmography are amazing! Do yourself a favor and check this one out. It's worth every minute."

","This film was truly an experience to watch. The events of this film are based on the story recounted by Slavomir Rawicz, a polish army lieutenant who managed to escape from a Siberian gulag during the second world war and walked to freedom in India. Peter Weir uses this story and some imagination to produce the sometimes fantasy-like plot for the film. In the opening scenes, Janusz, the protagonist, is being interrogated on charges of spying for the Allied powers, but refuses to sign a confession even after his wife is forced to falsely testify against him. This sort of corruption was not unusual in the USSR during this time, further developing the exposition for the film. The film also does a great job of depicting the experiences of prisoners in these gulags. Upon their arrival, the commandant of the camp explains the true viciousness and harshness of the natural environment in these camps, and that this ought to be feared more so than the guards, officers or work. This is an accurate picture of the gulags, especially in Siberia, where bitter-cold temperatures, sudden storms and other harsh conditions took the lives of both prisoners and guards at only marginally different (but still alarming) rates. Work in these camps was often tough labor like the logging shown in the film, and was possibly even more dangerous than the film depicted. Trees would often fall on people, accidents often occurred that resulted in serious injuries, and there are recorded incidences of people who chose to harm themselves to get a reprieve from this dangerous environment. 
In addition to the work and conditions, the types of prisoners in the gulags depicted in the movie were also accurate to a great extent. Gulag populations were far from homogeneous, and often held career criminals, political prisoners, and many common people who were charged falsely with some crime, as well as people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. The career criminals often took control of the prisoner population, and were able to manipulate others in the camp to get what they wanted. Often times, the guards even supported this behavior. Similarly, there were people of all walks of life, all levels of health, and all manners of allegiance to the soviet order. While many of the main characters were in open opposition to the Soviet system, people like Valka - who still praised Stalin even after escaping the camp - did exist. 
Overall this film paints a relatively accurate picture of gulag life, and the types of conditions seen within the camps. The characters are at times overplayed, and the story itself becomes slightly monotonous after a period of time, but I would recommend this film to anyone interested in a story of true human will."
"kj4","7","0","0","30 March 2018"," A story of courage & strength
","The Way Back, a story about the escape and bid for freedom of several prisoners from a Russian Gulag, is a film about people's abilities to survive in seemingly impossible circumstances. The conditions shown in the prison camp itself are fairly realistic, as they emphasize the presence of career criminals who clearly are more in control inside the camp than other groups, such as those who were incarcerated on charges of espionage or conspiracy. The film also emphasizes the all-important role of food and hunger, as indicated by several scenes in which prisoners dive for spare pieces of bread that have fallen on the ground. However, the majority of the film does not take place within the camp itself, but instead is a story of the escape through Siberia, the Gobi desert, and the Himalayas to India. The themes of hunger and dehydration were prevalent throughout the film, and as almost certainly would occur in such circumstances, the group spent the majority of the film searching for water, food, or both. The group encounters many obstacles along the way, both physical and mental, and the audience is left to imagine what the characters are thinking during long scenes in which they are depicted walking across vast expanses. Regardless of whether or not it is a true story, The Way Back is still inspiring as it taps into a vein of human strength and determination that can be found across time, countries, and cultures. People have a way of surviving even the most difficult of circumstances, and stories in which people have survived situations as trying as these scatter our history. Though it is a slightly idealistic plot, such as when by some miracle the group happens upon a well in the middle of the desert, The Way Back nonetheless is another example of this human strength that only appears in the most dire of circumstances, and which most of us are never forced to find."

","The film The Way Back is a thrilling story which details the escape of prisoners from a Soviet Gulag and the journey they must embark on in order reach a nation without communist sympathies. The opening of the movie was the strongest and most poignant part of the film as the first thirty minutes details the prisoners' experiences within the Gulag. The sequences in the Gulag make the viewer feel extremely claustrophobic, particularly during the scenes which take place in the mines, and creates an overall feeling of dread which causes the experience of viewing the film to feel more real. Moreover, the depictions of the day to day occurrences in Gulag are fairly accurate as the bartering systems displayed in the film and the prison social hierarchies were prominent features of life within a Soviet Gulag. The film was also able to explain how small infractions such as performing in a film could result in one's imprisonment within the Gulag. 
To improve the depiction of the Gulag from both a historic and emotional lens, the director, Peter Weir, could have taken more steps to make the death displayed within the Gulag more impactful for the viewer. Gulags were incredibly dangerous as about one in four prisoners in the Gulags died each year (Alexopoulos, ""Illness and Inhumanity in Stalin's Gulag""). While the film shows that some prisoners died from exposure, all the prisoners who die within the camp are nameless Gulag prisoners. It would have been more impactful if one of the detainees who was planning on escaping the Gulag died before they were able to leave. 
Following the escape from the Gulag, the six prisoners embark on a journey with the goal of reaching Mongolia. The actual journey depicted within the film suffers from poor directing and screenwriting choices. Some parts of the journey depicted in the film such as when the escapees are traveling through China felt rushed whereas other aspects of the journey such as the initial trek through Russia could have been edited down. The strange depiction of time within the film prevented the viewer from having an accurate sense how long the journey took. Moreover, the survival aspects of the film such as the encounter with the sandstorm or the intense heat were not as interesting as the narratives the characters told about their experiences in the Soviet Union. 
The most disappointing part of the entire film was the ending which involved the leader of the prisoners, Janusz Wieszczek, reuniting with his after fifty years of separation. The ending seemed impossible even when compared to the almost impossible feat of traveling from Siberia to India. I would have preferred the film to end with the completion of the journey instead of the strange husband and wife reunion as it appeared to cheapen the quality of the film."

","The first part of this film is the more important and historically accurate section. The film begins by depicting the torment of informing against a loved one. This not only destroyed families but often left each member feeling either extreme betrayal or guilt. Throughout the entire movie the man whose wife informed against him wanted to return to her so that she could stop living this life of guilt and torment. This is important because part of the torture of being inside a camp is being separated from loved ones or having loved ones turned against you. The film then moves to life inside the Gulag, which though a short depiction, highlights many important aspects of the Gulag. The divide between the criminals and politicals is clearly demonstrated, as well as the economy of the camp. We see who has the power and how this power can truly determine whether one lives or dies in the camp. The huge divide in beliefs within the camp was demonstrated clearly through Valka, who has tattoos on his body clearly showing his support for communism. We also see the dangers the prisoners faced, from the cold siberian weather to the deathly mines to the threat of other prisoners right alongside them. The film does a good job depicting these factors as a threat to the prisoners, however in real life there were far greater deaths from these cold winters than the movie depicts. The movie then moves on to the main portion which is the trek from Siberia to India. Throughout this walk, we do see deaths along the way which makes it somewhat realistic, however 4 men surviving such a journey was a rare occurrence that in real life only happened once, at the most. Overall, I thought this movie was interesting, especially for a movie significantly focusing on a walk. It was pretty historically accurate, especially the portion on the camps, however I wish there was a little more focus on camp life."
"eritchey-46322","8","0","0","27 March 2018"," Compelling, (Somewhat) Accurate Film
","Peter Weir's The Way Back is a film chronicling a group of Gulag escapees' journey to freedom in India. While I found the film enjoyable and mostly accurate to the characteristics of the Soviet Union's Gulag camp system, I must acknowledge that the story's origin is a bit fuzzy. The film was based on a nonfiction book The Long Walk, which has been disputed. Although there are records of one or two groups of Gulag escapees turning up in India, the author of the book, who claimed to have accomplished this feat, did not actually escape a Gulag. <br/><br/>While the origins of the story may not have been accurate, the depiction of the Gulag camp was accurate for the most part. For instance, Valka, the criminal character, had the authority in the barrack, which was true of most Gulags as guards tended to let criminals keep order. As was discussed in the film in the mining scene, heavy labor like mining work was fatal-it was just a matter of time before the inmate met their demise. Though comical, Valka's chest tattoo of Lenin and Stalin provides a good example of the blind loyalty to Stalin during World War II. Many inmates believed that their being in the Gulag was benefitting the regime and still held intense loyalty for the Communist government that had usually wrongly arrested them in the first place. Where this film fell short was showing how insanely fatal the Gulags were, especially in Siberia. Although we get a sense of the bitter conditions and their lethality in the scene where the guards allow the prisoners to take shelter in the forest away from the blizzard, I think that the film could have expanded upon how deadly a sentence to a camp like the one in The Way Back would have been.<br/><br/>Straying from my discussion of historical accuracy, I must acknowledge that, as a viewer, the film seemed to drag on at points, especially as the group trekked across the desert. Despite this, when I think back on the film, I wonder if the long time in the desert was of some artistic significance. I wonder if Weir consciously chose to have the scene go on and on to mirror how the escapees kept walking and walking and never seemed to make much progress through the desert."
"shannonclare","Null","0","0","25 March 2018"," Decent Depiction of Camp Experience
","The Way Back is the film adaptation directed by Peter Weir of the book, The Long Walk, written by Slawomir Rawicz. The film is a depiction of the Soviet gulags, but is largely about the escape and trek to freedom by a small group of prisoners. Although the film time that is actually spent in the gulag is short compared with the rest of the film, there are many elements within this section of the movie that are extremely reminiscent of the actual camps. The film depicted the camp economy which is often unexplored in camp films, but was sometimes a major contributing factor to an internee's survival. Additionally, the brutal hierarchy of the criminal class and the extreme punishment of being sent to the mines were some of the greatest dangers for prisoners of the gulags. However, the film does a great job of highlighting the fact that the men were not held prisoner by the fences, but rather by the extreme climate of Siberia. This notion was explored both within the camp as seen by the snowstorm, as well as throughout the film as the characters ultimately died of starvation, fatigue, disease, and dehydration. 
 Although I felt the film did a fair job depicting the decline of the characters, the historicity of the film is very implausible. Although there were 1-2 accounts of gulag prisoners that arrived in India, it was a very small group that did not have an exact reference as to where they came from and how far they travelled. The possibility of 4 men surviving the trek from the northern parts of Siberia to India, especially one being in his later years, is highly implausible. Although this is an inspiring story, possibly based off of true events, it is important for viewers to recognize that this was an outstanding circumstance and the outcome for many others was not survival."

","The beginning of the film contains the most valuable and accurate historical depictions. In the first scenes, we are shown how family members were coerced into informing on their spouses, or parents, through means of torture. The gulag system not only tore apart families by physical distance, but through emotional trauma as well. The guilt of being responsible for a loved one's imprisonment is imaginably as tormenting as the gulags were.<br/><br/>The scenes that took place in the gulag showed the hostilities of Siberia's climate and the unforgiving nature of the criminal prisoners who ran the show much like the Kapos did in concentration camps. The film did well to highlight the different kinds of prisoners who ended up in the gulags, ranging from political prisoners, to convicts and even on the rare occasion, an American.<br/><br/>As the escaping group got further from the gulag, the film became more and more about surviving in the wild than about a significant historical event. Of course there were people who escaped and many who met their end in the surrounding wilderness. But the 4,000 mile walk depicted seems to have been an unique exception or perhaps an impossible dream at best. The journey, though, illustrates what is better than being in a gulag. They were willing to risk the unknown in the wilderness rather than stay and die in the gulag as prisoners. The escaping group took ownership of their lives back, and for some, their deaths too.<br/><br/>Purely as a film, it was a compelling story told in an engaging way. I appreciated the many different kinds of prisoners that had their characters expanded upon and a voice given too. Not often is a criminal prisoner seen as much more than a criminal, and I thought that Valka was a crucial character to the film."

","""The Way Back"" is certainly a wonderfully shot film, with beautiful landscapes and does a great job capturing the daunting terrain. The men who escaped from the Soviet Gulag in Siberia certainly had a journey cut out for them. With that being said, there were certain positives and negatives about the film. One, it had a sound portrayal of Gulag life. From the very beginning you see how quickly time in the camp is turned to savagery. Rations are hoarded or traded or stolen. All that matters is survival, rather, your own survival. There is certainly a camp hierarchy in place with the ""criminals"" calling the shots. This was a useful tactic that the guards employed in order to create fear and order within the barracks. The hard labor of the camps was also depicted well in the film. The labor of the Gulag was an imperative aspect that came with many dangers for the men. Any one caught not doing their job would be shot. We see close moments such as these in the film, especially when Jim Sturgess' has a moment of hallucination and tries to walk out of the mine. Life was grueling and difficult, with few moments of hope. ""Mister Smith,"" Ed Harris' character sums it up well later in the film: ""In the camps some saw death as freedom.""
 Despite some of these positive aspects, the overall journey left me in disbelief. The whole thing was like the ten biblical plagues. One thing after another, I was surprised they weren't all dead sooner. That being said, there are questions about the veracity of the story itself as even though the film is supposed to be based on a true story, the 1956 memoir that it is based upon is heavily disputed. Yet the purpose of the journey was not entirely lost on the film. For one it gave us a reflection of Soviet life that we didn't see in the Soviet Union through the scene with the destroyed Buddhist monastery. This was a reflection of what life would have been like in Soviet Russia as the monastery was completely destroyed and desolate. Churches were demolished and priests were shot and taken to camps. Under the communist regime religion was banned, yet another aspect people found solace in taken away. Overall the film showcased an immense amount of strength on the part of the escapees and the struggles of maintaining hope. An interesting story whether fact or fiction."

","Peter Weir's depiction of survival in The Way Back is raw and gripping in its cinematic artistry. Wide shots of the landscape and geography complement the pain and suffering endured by the escapees. The opening scenes depict the Soviet Union's interrogation tactics that forced friends and family to turn on one another, as Janusz's wife turned on him. Janusz's twenty-year sentence to a Gulag labor camp in Siberia is realistic. 
 The film's depiction of camp life is also historically accurate to a degree. In the opening camp scenes, the audience sees new internes getting their heads shaved and the deterioration of internees, who have been in the camp. Some of these internees are blind. Furthermore, hierarchy and bartering is explored within the camp. An inversion of hierarchy is observed as the criminals have power within the camp system. One of these criminals, Valka later expresses his fondness of Stalin and communism, when the escapees trek from Siberia to India. Gulags often had prisoners with various political persuasions. The addition of this character complicated the narrative and added to the heterogeneity of the escapees. One of the other escapees, Mr. Smith is an American played by Ed Harris. Some Americans living in Russia were sentenced to years or decades in the gulags because foreigners were seen as threatening to the Soviet regime. The insertion of Saoirse Ronan's character, Irena, served the narrative as she bonded the other escapees and revealed their histories to the audience. Ultimately, the film portrayed how desperation and hope coexisted within the camps."

","Peter Weir's epic wartime drama The Way Back is a feast for the eyes and ears, if spread a little emotionally thin. It presents us people dealing with severely hard times, and unlike many films like this, it actually shows the toll that living back then took on both the body and the soul, as the characters it focuses on are put through a wringer and then some. It concerns a handful of prisoners and their escape from a Russian prisoner of war camp. It then chronicles their subsequent journey across the vastness of the Gobi desert and their hopeful arrival in the safety of Tibet. The opening of the film in the dank, unleasent and overcrowded gulag is a stark contrast to the open air natural beauty which comes later in the film. Ed Harris plays the stoic leader type like he does best, a caged animal of a man looking for any option for escape. A blustering fool (Mark Strong) keeps talking of making a break for it, but that's all he ever really does is talk. It's not until Harris hooks up with a skeezy bandit (a nicely nasty Colin Farrell) that the opportunity comes, and the pack of them seize it, making a harebrained scattershot run for the hills. And so their adventure begins, set against some of the most beautiful, awe inspiring scenery ever put on film. Across the Russian plains and into the unforgiving, immeasurable expanse of the Gobi, seeing many sights along the way, and tested by both man and nature at every turn. They are joined by an orphaned village girl (a heartbreaking Saoirse Ronan) as well. The film let's the characters take a backseat to the sheer scope of the natural world around them, a narrative and tonal choice which may leave some viewers feeling alienated. I was reminded of the expression 'Figures In A Landscape', a term used in many paintings, films and abstract discussion. It can mean a lot artistically, but it came to me in the notion that we almost watch the film from nature's perspective itself, only half understanding the creatures who blunder around in its playground, full of secrets and above all, harsh but fair in its treatment of humans. A film bereft of much of the melodrama often found in the genre, but rich in visual splendor and scope."

It's also not like Into the Wild where there is a sense of hopelessness. It's in between. This movie isn't about the destination, it's the journey and the solemnity of survival.

","Mostly with this site I just vote 1 to lower the vote the most I can or vote 10 to heighten it the most I can but in this case I feel compelled to vote fairly.<br/><br/>The Way Back was a very ballsy film that fell sadly short in many ways. The caricatureish aspects of many of the characters made it less believable and sometimes the acting felt a little hollow. The makeup was consistently great and gave the impression of the ravages the environment was doing. Pacing was a little inconsistent, when they escaped hardly a deal was made of it and it just sort of happened without build-up, along with a variety of other scenes that seemed abrupt. I like how low they sometimes resort, when they are eating the wolves' kill raw and drinking water out of mud I got a very strong impression of how much they were willing to do but you rarely see psychological results, they are beaten done, but they never seem shaken or disturbed by the ordeal, just very very tired, and sometimes even that doesn't increase over time, how the old man was about to give up and then didn't was a bit silly. My biggest problem for bullshit was the bit where the girl died and she went out without a whimper, just laying down at a convenient time and dying, she would suffer under those conditions and by those causes, dehydration is not a peaceful way to die. The movie could have done with being an hour longer in terms of character development and less images of scenery with sort-of dramatic and samey music, and the way it took so long to leave Russia and then they were through Mongolia and Tibet with ease, culminating in events with feet on them to show the remainder. Now I understand they couldn't have shown the whole journey but it was pretty sloppily done. By extension it needed a far larger budget and Colin Farrell's Russian accent was weak. I also consider the fact there was no sexual aspect to the group and the female incredibly historically inaccurate considering general views of women, things that were happening in the world at the time and the sheer mental deterioration that would result from such a trip.<br/><br/>All in all this was a very ambitious film, I was impressed, it was damn sentimental, poorly paced and could have done with more financial oomph but it's rare to see a film try such an ambitious mode of storytelling, journeys are rarely done well and rarely attempt truth to the harsh realities of travelling by foot in much of the world, but this film tried, and it didn't quite survive the trip."

","THE WAY BACK is a highly effective survival drama that tells the true story of a group of Siberian prison escapees who undertake an incredibly arduous trip to India after deciding to travel there by foot. The first half an hour of the movie sets up the prison camp scenario while the rest of it charts the almost impossible journey. Of course, much of the suspense arises from seeing as to whether any of the characters will actually make it.<br/><br/>This film has the edge over something like THE GREY purely because it's more realistic. The characters are at the mercy of the elements and the story becomes a battle between humanity and nature. There's an epic, almost LAWRENCE OF ARABIA style feel to the movie at times. There's also a gritty edge to the proceedings which makes it feel very non-Hollywood, and the performances add to that. Colin Farrell is probably the best he's ever been as a rough Russian gambler while Ed Harris is almost unrecognisable as an elder member of the group. Newcomer Jim Sturgess is sympathetic as the erstwhile leader, and there's an oddly touching minor role for Mark Strong, who reminds you how good he can be when he's not typecast as a villain."

Overall despite what I say the story is fine and unravels well before a good ending where you can never predict what will happen.<br/><br/>I found Jim Sturgess good in the main role and his character is a voice of rationality, and with Colin Farrell playing a more ferocious role he is perfect to use and portrays him well. Ed Harris and Saoirse Ronan also lend there support and do solid jobs but overall the acting isn't fantastic and to be fair could have been a little better for me here.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the script and it well done for this, each character is suited to what they are saying and the exact right words are chosen throughout. It is based on the book by Slawomir Rawicz who's personal experience this is supposed to be, although many consider him to be lying so it is not truly known if it is a true story. I loved the setting finally and some great camera shots over large areas make for a lovely shot film and as I say some locations are wonderful and would work in any film.<br/><br/>The story can be a little boring and especially towards the end because you kind of get sick of the point of the movie, but it isn't a thing you will hate by the end by any means. I said the acting wasn't that great and also the pace of the movie can be maybe just a little slow and the feeling this film is an epic adventure quickly diminishes as it goes along, but I can't criticise it that much in all truth.<br/><br/>If you enjoy a WW2 film then this isn't for you because although it mentions it a lot, it has little action in a sense. If you love a Drama that is unpredictable then this is for you because that is what it is in a strange sense but see for yourself what you think. This film I think was serious all the way throughout and the chemistry between characters never grows much beyond having the one goal, I felt a little more friendliness would have made the group more felt for and would have worried more for them.<br/><br/>Overall it is a 7/10, as I say a firmly good movie and I think most will enjoy this, unless you hate walking. It is the kind of the movie that you can enjoy but then again it can also not be enjoyed but hey as I always say, see for yourself and witness what may or may have not been a true story, because if it truly true, witness the great harshness they went through, and what pushes Humans to the brink of death."

The panoramic shots of the Mongolian steppe and Lake Baikal are beautiful. This film gives us an amazing tour of some of the world's less well known scenery but no less stunning, as well as giving a gripping story to view.<br/><br/>The criticism I have is that the scriptwriters could have been a lot more creative with the challenges the escapees face, all of whichever were pretty generic. I think they missed an opportunity here, but I guess the film is supposedly based on a true story (although there has been a lot of doubt cast on its authenticity). An enjoyable film nonetheless."

There is a British officer somewhere who was stationed in India in the Second World War and claims he did record the emergence of three emaciated soldiers from Tibet who said they'd escaped from Siberia. It was almost certainly not the author of the 1955 book of the same title and we know nothing of the veracity or details of that journey.<br/><br/>The claim ""based on real events"" has been so abused at this point as to be meaningless from any Hollywood source."

And start a 4000 miles walk to freedom. With the surrounding and what they had to overcome, it's a miracle the distance they go. Although it could have more substance to it, in my opinion like with the friendship and interactions. But it's still a emotional, heartfelt and psychological journey. That revolves around survival and redemption. The strength and will to survive comes off very real in this movie. Since this is based on a true story, it's somewhat like a realistic version of ""Lord of the Rings"" kind of. Also it's nice to see Saoirse Ronan in this, the last flick I saw her in was in ""Hanna"".

","Seven years since his last film, the lacklustre 'Master and Commander', Weir is back with 'The Way Back' and what a comeback it is. Granted that the actors accents feel awkward but once one moves passed all that, it becomes a harrowing tale of survival as the viewer follows these group of men's escape to freedom against all odds. Now there have been many films made on the similar theme of survival (even though not on this particular issue about the prisoners that Russia held captive during the war), but Weir's unique style of direction and the writing give it its own touch. I liked how clichés were avoided such that when you think so-and-so is going to happen, well, it doesn't. The build-up of tension and the relationship between the characters is well displayed. The landscape is beautifully captured and it juxtaposes well with the foreground reflecting how unsympathetic nature can sometimes be. The performances are first rate (once one gets over the accents). Jim Sturgess, Colin Farrell, Ed Harris, Dragos Bucur, Saoirse Ronan, Gustaf Skarsgård and Alexandru Potocean are all excellent. The film also scores high on the technical aspect, as Weir's films usually do. The cinematography, lighting, visuals and score work together effectively.<br/><br/>On the flip side, the final journey across the Himalayas is rushed especially considering how 'The Way Back' elaborates on the first two journeys. The Ed Harris character was also improperly developed.<br/><br/>It's good to see Weir back in form with 'The Way Back', a film that engages and involves and it actually kept me rooting for the characters and guessing as to what was going to happen next."

What the escapees endure during their 4,000-mile journey is vividly brought to life (the Gobi desert scenes are especially harrowing), but because Jim Sturgess's character is the only one with a back-story, there's a lack of involvement with who these people are, and this fatally diminishes your interest in their fate.<br/><br/>It's a far-fetched comparison, I know, but one of the best elements of THE PERFECT STORM was the way ALL the cast were fleshed-out characters, so that you really wanted each of them to somehow survive the great wave.

And then crossing the freaking Himalayas? Without oxygen cylinders or anything? Its the most funniest thing ever on the history of film. And from Tibet to Sikkim? Why would you go all the way around to Sikkim when there are kingdoms of Mustang which is the nearest from there and there is Nepal which was also in favor of the British. So historical inaccuracies was very frustrating for me. The only redeeming fact was that when they reached Sikkim, (inside Indian territory but they are Nepalese who speak Nepalese language) the film showed this fact that Nepalese was spoken there. Somehow I felt the whole crossing of the Himalayas was so funny i mean they could have stayed in Tibet long enough until they were fit and gone through to India (if that is what they wanted) through to the western side which I know is the easier and nearer than going to Sikkim.

","'THE WAY BACK': Three Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Peter Weir directs and co-writes (with Keith R. Clarke) this would be epic about about a group of prison escapees that flee a Siberian gulag camp and embark on a 4000 mile trek to India and freedom during World War II. It's based on the book 'The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom' by Slavomir Rawicz, an actual World War II Polish POW of the Soviet Gulag, and was claimed to be (by him) a fact based account of his escape and miraculous journey to freedom in India. The book has recently been proved false and it was discovered that Rawicz was in fact released from the prison by the USSR. Jim Sturgess stars in the film as Janusz, the character loosely based on Rawicz. The film co-stars Ed Harris, Colin Farrell and Saoirse Ronan (of 'THE LOVELY BONES' fame).<br/><br/>The film begins with Janusz being sentenced to 20 years in the gulag, in large part due to his wife being tortured and forced to testify against him. Janusz then makes it his mission to escape the prison and make it home to his wife so he can relieve her of her guilt. He makes friends with several other prisoners, including an American named Mr. Smith (Harris) and a Russian criminal named Valka (Farrell), and together they devise a plan of escape. They wait till one night when a storm is so bad it will cover their tracks and, as a group of seven, they make a run for it. They're later joined on their journey by a young teenage girl (Ronan) who claims to have escaped a collective farm after her parents were murdered. The journey becomes extremely treacherous and of course not everyone makes it through alive.<br/><br/>Peter Weir is a great director (he's directed such well loved films as 'WITNESS', 'THE MOSQUITO COAST', 'THE TRUMAN SHOW', 'DEAD POETS SOCIETY', 'GALLIPOLI' and 'MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD') but here he doesn't quite live up to his reputation. The film looks beautiful, the acting is effective, the music is fitting and the makeup is exceptional (which is nominated for an Oscar). It has all the ingredients of a classic epic war / drama film but it doesn't quite live up to it's potential. The movie is never as sweeping as it should be and the emotion and depth of the characters just isn't there. At first glance it looks like a great film but it never engages the viewer the way a great film like that should. The film is still mildly entertaining (although it drags in several places) and looks beautiful but it doesn't ever amount to very much.

","""The Way Back"" (2010) takes place circa 1940-42 and details a group's mad escape from a Siberian gulag through the cold, desolate Soviet wilderness into Mongolia, across the great Gobi desert, through mountainous Tibet and ultimately freedom in India. The film was inspired by Slavomir Rawicz' popular book ""The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom,"" but not based on it.<br/><br/>After records of Rawicz' release from the gulag by the USSR in 1942 were unearthed the veracity of the book was called into question; others suggest that, although the circumstances of the story may not have happened to author Rawicz, they're apparently based on real events with real individuals, like Polish soldier Witold Glinski.<br/><br/>Moreover, in light of the millions of prisoners carted away to Siberia during that time period, isn't it likely that a handful of them successfully escaped and had experiences similar to those shown in this movie (and the book) regardless of whether or not they made it all the way to India? In any event, director Peter Weir has plainly stated that the film is largely fictional and only inspired by the book, which may or may not be a true account.<br/><br/>The group's natural leader is Janusz (Jim Sturgess), not because he has any leadership charisma but simply because he spent half his life in the woods and KNOWS how to survive in such an environment. As Solomon said, ""A wise man has great power, and a man of knowledge increases strength.""<br/><br/>Also along for the haul is a cynical American called Mister Smith (Ed Harris), a Russian hooligan named Valka (Colin Farrell), a comic accountant, an artistic pastry chef, a priest, a Pole with night blindness and a teen-aged girl named Irena, played by Saoirse Ronan, who incidentally celebrated her 16th birthday on the set.<br/><br/>This a story of survival. The group faces freezing nights, lack of food & water, bugs, death, the never-ending Gobi desert and the Himalayas, not to mention the inevitable moral questions that arise from such a life or death situation. Some have complained that the film involves too much walking, but that's the whole point: the film's about a 4000-mile escape on foot to freedom.<br/><br/>It drives home some powerful messages that will be pondered well after viewing:<br/><br/><ul><li>The government in communistic or extreme socialistic states is a cold, uncaring, demonic machine that will immediately squelch dissidents through any measure possible, including torturous coercion, slander and execution.</li><li>Such godless governments are a vile social infection that spreads and must be escaped at all costs.</li><li>Is this socialistic disease now spreading to America? Of course it is and it's been obvious for quite some time (the Dems).</li><li>Better to die free than live in a gulag (aka labor camp or reeducation camp) or under dictatorial socialistic governments.</li><li>No matter how bad it is, at least you don't have to live in a gulag.</li><li>Mongolians and Tibetans are people of true honor.</li><li>Saoirse Ronan is a precious young lady.</li></ul><br/><br/>In addition, the film features a great score and spectacular locations, shot in Bulgaria, Morocco and India.<br/><br/>FINAL WORD: ""The Way Back"" is a must if you love survival stories like ""Flight of the Phoenix"" (especially the original version) or ""Sands of the Kalahari,"" as well as films like ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Black Robe"" and ""Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan.""

","At some point in this, our starved gulag escapees run off a pack of wolves from their prey only to assume their place. This is The Way Back in a nutshell for me, a stark film of easy contrasts, with the power to emotionally affect but not to really challenge. It goes down easy, maybe too easy.<br/><br/>This came and went without much fuss it seems like, which is surprising because it's a sentimental tale of redemption done in a sweeping canvas. This should be crowdpleasing in a number of ways. Criticisms of the movie write themselves I think, how the characters are set up to face predicable dilemmas, how the story told here is slight and the filmmaking often pedestrian. The part that takes place in the gulag is a particular offender in those regards, a choppy segment where details are hacked left and right to quickly establish a narrative.<br/><br/>The movie will pause all this for the characters to relate us with stories of how they were traumatized by the Soviet regime, they all have something to walk away from or towards and be redeemed for it and most of them do by the end. But out in the Mongolian desert the film becomes gruelling and silent. This is what I had anticipated, small figures of men smitten hard in vast, cruel landscapes.<br/><br/>In his book The Mystical Gaze, Richard Leonard explains about Peter Weir's films that they employ devices ""that enable the spectator to ask  fundamental questions about meaning, purpose, identity, existence and the relationship of this world to worlds beyond"", which is all perhaps true in theory of this film, but I experience these in very obvious ways as opposed to Weir's great films from the 70's that rewarded immersion by the introspection they required. His visual imagination now has petered out, whereas once it was flourishing with the uncanny and the mystical.<br/><br/>The finale is the most intriguing part of this for me. Tricly almost but it resonates with the sadness of these broken humans, how the woman has stood in place punishing herself for a lifetime for her betrayal, the man having to wait a lifetime to absolve her."

","As I have told my family and friends, wait for the DVD instead of hitting the theater. I mean, how much interest can there be in a movie that has mostly scenes of people walking? The reason I saw this movie, was that I had read the book called, ""The Long Walk"". It is a very good book and tells the story a lot better then the movie, which of course, is just my opinion. :-) The people in the movie did their best to try and make it into something but, (there is always a but), didn't have much to work with. At least they knew enough about survival skills to know the Shadow Stick Method to find their direction. I have had to use that method myself to find my way more then once. That, along with the time of day, along with where the sun is in the sky in relation to my watch."

","THE WAY BACK is a discovery: there are some themes of films such as the bleak one this title suggests that we too often avoid, think that there is only so much that can be expressed or processed in a long stretch of a prolonged escape. Nothing could be further from the truth in the case of this film. It begins in 1940 'when seven prisoners attempt the impossible: escape from a brutal Siberian gulag. Thus begins a treacherous 4,500-mile trek to freedom across the world's most merciless landscapes. They have little food and few supplies. They don't know or trust each other. But together, they must withstand nature at its most extreme. Their humanity is further tested when they meet a teenage runaway who begs to join them on their quest. A compelling testament to the human spirit, this gripping wilderness adventure is Peter Weir at his hypnotic best', as one critic from the Telluride Festival phrased it. <br/><br/>The screenplay by Peter Weir and Keith R. Clarke is based on the Slavomir Rawicz novel ""The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom"" and despite the controversy about the facts as portrayed in this film, this is a human versus nature drama that quietly explodes with an intensity that is at times nearly unbearable, while at other times extraordinary in the manner it shows how men survive the most impossible obstacles. From the beginning of the film in a Soviet Gulag the escapees include a Polish political prisoner Janusz (Jim Sturgess), a Russian criminal Valka (Colin Farrell), and American Mr. Smith (Ed Harris) who was caught working in Moscow when war broke out, and Zoran (Dragos Bucur), Tomasz (Alexandru Potocean), Kasik (Sebastian Urzendowsky) and Voss (Gustaf Skarsgård). During their 4500 mile across the Gulag, Siberia, the deserts of Mongolia, the Himalayas in China and into India they encounter a young girl Irena (Saorise Ronan, in an incredibly sophisticated performance), also escaping the Soviet Union, and she becomes part of the survival team. <br/><br/>The well-written script allows the human element in all its forms to rise out of the struggle with Nature and thanks to Peter Weir's astute direction and the incredible cinematography of Russell Boyd the epic is a deeply moving tale. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"colinrgeorge","7","2","6","8 February 2011"," Get Back
","In an age where the bankability of an adventure film is measured in gallons of oil exploded, Peter Weir's somber trek ""The Way Back"" is something of a revelation. Unlike his last film, the rousing but decidedly Hollywood nautical yarn ""Master and Commander,"" Weir dials back star power and technique until all that's left is an uncommonly naturalistic interpretation of the supposedly true events that led political prisoners encamped at a Siberian gulag to walk 4,000 miles to India and their freedom.<br/><br/>First, a complaint: I don't mean to come off as a dick, but the fact that Weir preemptively dedicates this film to those men irks me. Not only because so much doubt has been cast on the validity of the story itself, but also because conventional wisdom would be to place that placard on the last spool rather than the first. It strikes me as a little self-serving to presume respect from an audience upfront for a struggle they haven't even seen yet, or on a baser level, to disconnect them from the story before it's even begun. I realize I may be belaboring a very minor point, but as with the superfluous historical preface and dodgy title card, ""The Way Back"" and I got off on the wrong foot.<br/><br/>Thankfully, there's no arguing with Weir's visuals. From the moment he drops us into the oppressive wind-swept Siberian winter, the director creates unparalleled atmosphere. From the suffocating soot of a hellacious mineshaft to the steep sea of dunes that comprise the Mongolian desert, Weir absolutely captures the mercilessness of his environments. That characters freeze and bake to death, or are reduced to near madness by hunger, underscores the mortal gravity of their journey better than most filmmakers manage.<br/><br/>But what really sets ""The Way Back"" apart is its humanity. Where many would settle for stifling melodrama, Weir finds a way to eke out a joke. Our companions are a good-humored lot in spite of the ubiquitous peril their mission entails. It keeps them sane and keeps the movie watchable. Jim Sturgess takes the lead as an almost naively optimistic outdoorsman, followed in tow by a battle worn pragmatist (Ed Harris), and a lone wolf with a knife to match—Colin Farrell in a surprisingly funny and endearing performance. The characters are our only recourse from the barren landscape, and they provide much needed color.<br/><br/>In spite of their contributions, ""The Way Back"" is still a long film. Perhaps even purposefully overlong; the way Weir depicts the cruelly relentless terrain would lose its impact under more constrictive narrative pacing. My only gripe is that the tempo Weir employs isn't always consistent. By comparison to our stint in the Siberian wilderness, the hike over the Himalayas feels like a disappointingly anti-climactic cakewalk, especially given that it represents the final threshold into India. The looming 133-minute run time doesn't make for 100% great cinema, but what Weir attempts is admirable despite the occasional missteps.<br/><br/>""The Way Back"" represents an endangered species of storytelling, and it's no surprise that it went largely unseen in its sparse theatrical release. The film is definitely not your typical thrill-a-minute actioner, but it delivers on the ever-important human element. Weir continues to solidify his status as one of modern cinema's most unjustly unsung heroes, and his latest towers above many of its more popular contemporaries. It may not measure up in terms of barrels of oil exploded, but those sick of fireworks may actually want to see a show."
"PWNYCNY","9","2","6","26 January 2011"," Compelling though implausible story.
","Even though the story is far-fetched and indeed challenges the limits of plausibility, it's an engaging, interesting and at times dramatically powerful movie. The movie also teaches a very important lesson: Walking thousands of miles through dense forests, across deserts and over mountains, in nasty weather, can be hard on one's feet. This movie features some of the most stark close-ups of beat-up feet maybe in the history of cinema. Between Ed Harris and the young lady who plays the female escapee, there's enough foot damage to keep a team of podiatrists busy for years. Indeed, after watching this movie, one might think twice before deciding to take a walk across a desert - with no water or food - which brings up another point dramatized in this movie: Never take a 4,000-mile walk without bringing matches. At some point you'll have to make a fire, and it's not easy to make a fire in the middle of nowhere without matches. It can be done, but it takes a lot of work and you can save yourself a lot of hassle if you bring matches. Now, the soviet Gulags were deliberately placed in the middle of Siberia precisely to deter the kind of escape portrayed in this movie. Indeed, the authorities were practically inviting prisoners to try to escape and with good reasons: first, there was no place for the prisoners to flee to and second, the environment was far more punishing then the prison itself, meaning that there was probably more of an incentive for inmates to stay in the prison and try to make the best of a bad deal than to leave and be at the mercy of the forest, snow, cold and wild life. Nevertheless, the movie presents a compelling story about desperate people trying to escape to freedom, and that alone makes the movie worth watching."

","In 1941, seven assorted inmates of a Siberian prison camp escape, pick up a teenage girl on the way, and walk 4,000 miles to freedom in India (well, some of them).<br/><br/>This true life story is a straightforward piece of work, and stands primarily on the drama inherent in the journey and the hardships suffered by the escapees. As well as its strength this is also its weakness, because it never really draws all members of the fellowship as strongly as they deserve to be drawn.<br/><br/>One is left with memories of Ed Harris as the pessimistic American and Saoirse Ronan as orphan Irena as the dominant personalities. Colin Farrell is Colin Farrell, and Mark Strong makes a short appearance. As for the others - by the time you have sorted out who is who, and they have individually started to make impressions, the movie is over.<br/><br/>But it is a gripping movie where you are constantly amazed at how inhospitable this planet can be, and how resilient people can be in challenging the worst life can throw at them.<br/><br/>And this film, too, contains one of those magic moments to treasure - a masterclass in dialogue-free acting from Harris, lasting no more than a few seconds, after Ronan has washed his damaged foot."

","Overall I enjoyed this film yet there are a few issues I have with it...
1. Whether or not the story is factual plays a huge role in the likeability and emotional impactfulness delivered by this film. Apparently the guy who wrote the book in which this movie is based upon has had his accounting of events called into question. If what he wrote was indeed factual, then Wow! What an experience and triumph of the human will! Unfortunately, from what I can gather, there is probably a better than average chance that it is all made up. With that in mind, it takes away from the overall pop and desire to emotionally invest in the film.
2. I understand that this film tells the tale of an incredibly grueling and lengthy foot journey through Siberia, Mongolia, and Tibet. To document and detail every single event would be unrealistic. However, there are an abundant of tense filled moments that Wier intoduces to us along the way but them simply glosses over. For example, at the beginning the escapees are faced with tumultuous weather in the dead of a Siberian winter while facing the daunting task of finding Lake Baikal which will in turn lead them down to the trans Siberian railway and across the Mongolian border into safety and freedom. This in itself is a masterful set up that leaves the viewer hooked and excited to see how our traversers will fare in the face of such overwhelming adversity. Get the popcorn! Order a pizza and crack open a beer because this is going to be a wild ride, right?!?! Nope! The next scene conveniently skips ahead three months to Springtime and our friends are out of the cold. We are left with no payoff whatsoever. Weir does this throughout the film, the worst of which is the glossing over of the unbelievably difficult hike over the Himalayas in winter. Again, Weir sets this up beautifully! Our prisoners find themselves in Tibet in the home of a generous family who agrees to care for them, feed them and shelter them as walking to India in the chilling cold and life threatening blizzards is suicide. Driven by the will to face his wife, Janusz defies their sage advice and treks on! Wow! What a moment! Can Janusz and the other survive the almost suicidal mission of making over the Himalayas to British controlled India?!?! Once again, I can't friggin wait! Invite your friends over, get a comfortable spot on the coach, and get the microwaveable popcorn ready to go because this is gonna be a doozy, right?!?! Wrong! The very next scene shows the men we have been journeying with all along simply arriving in India. No payoff with a massive set up. The Way Out does way too much skimming over which fails to do it the justice this film deserves. I will say that Weir does a fine job with the desert part of the journey.<br/><br/>With that, it's a decent film. Not bad but not great."

","At the end of '1984', Winston Smith loves Big Brother. And in a documentary I saw about prison camps in Siberia, the grizzled veterans confessed that, when they learnt that Stalin had died, they cried. So my first quibble with Peter Weir's film (based on an extraordinary real life escape from such a camp) is that it conveys absolutely nothing of such psychology. The prisoners denounce Stalinism, and protest their lack of freedom, in a way that seems to better reflect modern sensitivities than the actual reality of life in the camps. Things don't get that much better once the escape is underway. To me, at least, the interesting thing about the story is logistics: how does anyone manage to live as a fugitive for months in the depths of Siberia? But I don't really get a sense of how they did it from the movie, which conveys that the men were short of food and water but presents these challenges almost in the abstract, rather than showing us the everyday discipline that allowed their ultimate survival. The film is not completely awful, yet somehow, it didn't come alive for me, unlike some books I have read about life in the camps which brought their particularities to vivid life. The story here seems more generic, and consequently, less interesting."

","Siberia. Mongolia. India. What these places have in common in ""The Way Back"" is the footsteps of a small group of people who have a matchless desire to go home. The latest film by Peter Weir, director of ""The Truman Show"", follows the extensive and exhausting journey of convicts who are imprisoned not just by guards and fences, but by lands that have been conquered by communism.<br/><br/>Escaping the Siberian gulag was the easy part; a 4,000-mile walk awaits them. During this journey, our eyes are treated with some magnificent imagery. The snowy mountains and scorching deserts are exhibited through great cinematography by Russell Boyd. It's weird how these paintings of nature are also what could drive our ""Walkers"" to death. ""The Way Back"" causes mixed emotions in its irony that the things that could bring so much pleasure to our eyes are the same things that torment the film's heroes.<br/><br/>At one point, with bodies thinner and teeth more rotten than the week before, the convicts run into a beautiful Polish girl.

"hans-235","6","1","2","25 February 2012"," Two hours of scenery would deserve more seconds of characters
","From director Peter Weir I have seen movies that spend rich but near silent moments on building characters and rapport with the protagonists, in a masterful way. With The Way Back, there is wonderful scenery and much dialog to drive the epic tale forward - but sadly not enough scenes focusing on the characters, the inherent struggle in the joint endeavour we are experiencing. Perhaps sticking to the original story made the path too linear, or editing simply became overwhelming considering the huge amount of vivid and colourful footage of this movie. I would have wanted more and longer quiet but conflict full scenes early in the movie - for example the route into Siberia could have been a 5 minute long silent tour de force to have us really understand the solitude and low temperatures. Nevertheless a beautiful and exquisite piece of film - but it could have become more engaging with different editing."

","1939- Poland is divided between Hitler's forces from the West and Stalin's red army from the East. A Polish soldier on the Russian front, Janusz (Jim Sturgess) is betrayed by his wife and sentenced to 20 years, having allegedly spied for foreign powers. Imprisoned in the Siberian Gulag or high security Soviet POW labor camp, Janusz first meets inmate Khabarov (Mark Strong) who has devised a plan to escape. Over the following two years, Janusz befriends a small group of inmates who would eventually aid in his and their escape from the Gulag. <br/><br/>1941- Seven inmates escape from the high security Gulag. The convicts include Janusz, an American engineer, Mr. Smith (Ed Harris), Valka (Colin Farrell) a hardened thug, and four others, an artist who can cook, a Pole with night blindness, a priest and an accountant with a sense of humor. Escaping from a POW camp surrounded by guns, dogs and barbed wire was the easy part. What lie ahead is the harshest elements of nature, starting with five million square kilometers of bitter cold Siberian landscape, an unforgiving desert and a second onslaught of frozen mountains through the Himalayas. Over and above, they endure this journey with dwindling supply of food and water, while avoiding contact or help from locales for fear of getting caught. Along the way they pick up a young woman on the run from her past, this despite the fact that she can slow down their escape to freedom. Of the seven escapees plus the young woman they take along (Saoirse Ronan as Irena), only three will arrive in India, 4000 miles from the Gulag, and all on foot. <br/><br/>Adapted from ""The Long Walk"", a book that sold half a million copies and written by Sławomir Rawicz, this is a powerful film that tells an epic story; a story that is inspired by actual events during Rawicz's alleged escape from the Gulag. Historically, the facts remain murky as others have claimed to have escaped from the Gulag, whereas Rawicz was supposedly released by the USSR. Having also co-written the screenplay, six Oscar nominated director Peter Weir claims that such an escape exists as archives in Polish museums in London, England and Stanford University in California. Aside from Rawicz's book, part of the script is also inspired from autobiographies of some of the fugitives, titled and verified in English as ""Shallow Graves in Siberia"". <br/><br/>Facts and debates aside, this is an exceptional film that captures the human spirit in surviving against all odds. Although seven men had their own ideas of freedom beyond escape, only three were noted to have made it to their destination. This is either testament of Darwin's theory of 'survival of the fittest' or of something far more profound— that humans as a species are capable of anything we set our hearts and minds on. From the filming perspective, I am satisfied with almost all aspects of the production. Acting is top notch from everyone including the European actors. While Sturgess and Harris are very convincing, Colin Farrell and Dragoş Bucur offer some comic relief in well punctuated spots. As Irena, Ronan is a welcome addition to the posse of fugitives while her acting says she has clearly progressed from a child actor and looks powerfully ready for bigger and central roles.<br/><br/>Co-produced by ImageNation Abu Dhabi, with filming on locations in Bulgaria, Morocco and India, the highlight of the film is the sweeping cinematography. No wonder then, because National Geographic has had a hand in the production as well. Photography is breathless and places the viewer right in the middle of the Siberian cold or dehydrating heat of the desert. While illustrating these terrible hardships for the characters, make-up is terrifying and realistic, resulting in an Oscar nomination. For the acting, directing, screenplay, cinematography and general production, Peter Weir should be credited as a tour-de-force for this phenomenal piece of work. Running over two hours, I do feel that Weir could have built more depth into some of the characters given that many scenes are dialogue heavy. But as a standalone production, this is ample proof that given the right focus and vision, Independent films have as big a scope in powerful film making as compared to films backed by major production and distribution studios."

Did he personally do it? Almost certainly, no. Did anyone do it? Probably not. Does it matter? For the purposes of this film which tells that story, no. It is a cracking tale and Australian director Peter Weir has chosen to refer to Rawicz's book as a novel.<br/><br/>Weir is a terrific movie-maker who has not directed a film for seven years (""Master And Commander"") and here he allies a great adventure with striking visuals and accomplished acting. The photography is by Russell Boyd and the shooting was done in Bulgaria, Morocco and India.

","It is pointless to review this film as if it were a typical adventure-drama. For Weir, essence is what matters.<br/><br/>In The Way Back, Weir very deliberately pulls back from his characters and the detail of their story. That's not a flaw - it's a tip-off. This is NOT a narrative about four men who endure hell to escape from the gulag. It's a meditation on Endurance itself.<br/><br/>Weir does confuse the issue a bit, with a surprisingly literal montage sequence at the end. Perhaps he felt a concrete pay-off was needed, a decades-later denouement. But those few closing images are not really a part of the journey - merely a suggestion that it does have an ending.<br/><br/>As long as you remain focused on the journey itself, it all makes perfect sense. And it's all hauntingly beautiful. There are no tragedies along the way - merely people who finish their own journey a little sooner, or who turn off in a different direction. There are moments of wry humor, and deep emotion. And a quietly growing bond between men who have nothing in common but the journey, and their individual capacity to endure it.<br/><br/>Could a group of men actually survive a trek such as the one suggested in this film? If you're still asking that question, you definitely saw the wrong movie."

It is far away from anything else and anyone trying to escape by foot would be expected to die at once point along the way.<br/><br/>Still a small band of prisoners refused to die in the Gulag and they escaped one blizzardy winter night. The blizzard was a benefit, it helped to cover their tracks. But it was brutal, they peeled off Birch bark to make masks to keep their faces from freezing.<br/><br/>The movie is very well filmed, and very well acted. I enjoyed it from that aspect. Plus it is a good story of the triumph of the human spirit, based on real events. But during the middle of the movie many scenes move very slowly as we watch them close to death, crossing vast areas without vegetation or water, trying to get water and food. Not all of them made it."

","The interrogation scenes at the beginning of the movie are crucial to the understanding of several of the escapees' mindset later on. If you miss the first few minutes, you will not be able to appreciate the full struggle of the main players. If you like the movie ""The Great Escape, keep in mind ""The Way Back"" is nothing at all like it. In Siberia, the guards and the army don't bother to run after the escapees, nature is expected to ensure their demise. <br/><br/>A terrific cast was entrusted with a script that has enough meat in it to satisfy the most difficult character actors. This was an ensemble performance by default. As the tagline says, the escape from the gulag was just the beginning. Tough terrain, harsh, very harsh weather, etc., etc., and when they reached the border, crossing out of Russia, they find they are faced with the same damn communist system in neighbouring countries, the system they ran away from back in the gulag. The actors don't curse but you will feel like cursing for them. As you can expect, the cinematography is an important part of the movie as it must convey the journey's difficulties. In other words, the more beautiful the scenery is, the tougher the challenge. The special effects that turn the escapees into living corpses were well done. <br/><br/>Conspicuously, nothing sexual happens to the character of Saoirse Ronan; when you consider the circumstances, it is a miracle or a matter the writer or director could not come to terms with. I suspect the latter. This movie was the surprise drama of the year so far for me. No popcorn and coke with this movie; this is a coffee movie, if you get my drift."

The scenery along the journey is terrific as is the prison camp set but the film is a shade too long and your attention may wonder. The introduction of the female escapee to the group was also unnecessary. On the plus side the acting from all those involved is top quality.

","Peter Weir is a filmmaker who renews his style in each new film. In The Way Back he summarizes the perils of a Cold War escape. From the violence of a prison camp to the sand deserts of Mongolia; from the Stalinist show trials to the mirages of thirst and hunger. The Way Back is at its best very entertaining. As for the ideology of the film, the tensions of the Cold War are presented as a mere reference. We don't hear any new thought on the matter. Communism was bad an oppressive, and all the rest of the world, including India, was prosperous, peaceful and free. Weir shuns the fact that all Soviet fugitives were useful to the West as propaganda."
"estebangonzalez10","8","1","4","14 August 2012"," A good long walk
","¨Kindness. That will kill you here¨<br/><br/>The Way Back is a fantastic movie directed by Peter Weir, who made one of my favorite films, The Dead Poets Society. I don't think any of his movies will live up to that one, but The Way Back is still a great and inspiring movie. The film is based on the novel ¨The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom¨ written by Slavomir Rawicz who claims the book is autobiographical although many skeptics have found flaws in his claims. I don't care if the events actually happened or not, I still think they made for a great and inspiring story. I've seen many films about survival and some are greatly exaggerated (The Grey for example), but this tale is as realistic as it gets. There are several long shots of beautiful scenery where nothing much happens other than long and exhausting walks. I guess that is what a survival film should have: endless walking. I even got tired of seeing these characters walk so much, but Peter Weir adapted the screenplay in such a way that he maintains us interested in the characters and their struggle for survival and their refusal to surrender under such harsh adversities. I also loved the performance from the cast, Jim Sturgess was strong as the lead role and he had a lot of help from the supporting cast including the always reliable Ed Harris (who gave one of the best performances of his career in another Peter Weir movie: The Truman Show), Colin Farrell who may have had a few misses but also has a lot of hits including this one thanks to his great Russian accent, and of course the young and talented Saoirse Ronan who we have seen in Atonement and Hannah. The Way Back is a solid movie with a lot of heart, beautiful scenery, and some strong performances.<br/><br/>The story is pretty simple, it takes place during the early 1940's in communist URSS during the Second World War. Janusz (Jim Sturgess) is a Polish accused of being a spy by his own wife (after having tortured her) and therefore sent to a Siberian gulag where he meets other innocent and no so innocent prisoners. Some of these prisoners include the reserved American Mr. Smith (Ed Harris), a Russian criminal Valka (Colin Farrell), and Khabarov (Mark Strong) the man who introduces him to the place and befriends him. Janusz knows how to survive in the wild and begins to engineer a plan to escape and walk across Russia to Mongolia. Along with Mr. Smith, Valka, and a few more men they decide to escape in the middle of a snow storm and take their chances in the wild. With little food and fierce weather conditions they begin their struggle for survival in the open. During their journey to Mongolia they face several obstacles but continue to pursue south. On their way they meet a teenage girl who is also trying to flee the country. Irena (Saoirse Ronan) begs the men allow her to accompany them and although they refused at first they begin befriending her and enjoying her company. Together they continue their struggle for survival in search of freedom although many more obstacles are ahead of them.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Colin Farrell's performance in this movie. I think he brought the comic relief that was needed in this type of movie and was perfect. His scenes were probably the most interesting ones. Jim Sturgess has a great future ahead of him and he does give a strong performance in this difficult film. Ed Harris is one of the best actors so it was no surprise he was so good in this movie. Saoirse Ronan gives the movie the heart it lacked at the beginning. The movie has an excellent cast; they give great performances and make us care for their characters which are essential in a survival movie like this. Every time the movie seems to be slowing down something exciting or interesting happens that hooks us again. There is also a lot of different and beautiful scenery in the film and the cinematography is great. The film also reminds us of the oppressive regime that the soviets ran and the injustice many had to face. It makes a pretty harsh statement towards this political movement, but in the end it is actually a movie about survival and never giving up.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"

","Peter Weir is one of my all-time favorite storytellers. 'The Truman Show' was a wonderful film. 'Witness' & 'Dead Poets Society' also were memorable fares. 'Fearless' offered some strong performances. 'Master And Commander' also had it's share of pluses.<br/><br/>However, Weir latest flick, 'The Way Back', which is a war drama, about a group of prisoners who escape from a Siberian Gulag camp during World War II, doesn't rank amongst his finest works.<br/><br/>'The Way Back' begins with a bang, and has a rock-solid first hour. The problem, I thought, began in the latter hour. The writing gets weak, and the pace dips for quite sometime. The writing needed to be sharper, especially in the latter hour.<br/><br/>Weir's direction, as always, is note-worthy. Cinematography is striking. Editng could've been sharper. Performance-Wise: Jim Sturgess rules the show, with a fantastic performance. Sturgess is an actor to watch out for! Ed Harris is good, as ever. Colin Farrell is superb, and gets his Russian accent correct. Saoirse Ronan is fair. Mark Strong, Gustaf Skarsgård & Dragoş Bucur are passable.<br/><br/>On the whole, A Good film, that had the potential to be a GREAT film, but due to it's loose-ends, it's expected impact seems to be missing."

","*spoiler* ""For both book and movie"" I wanted to like this movie allot more than I did, if you read the book, I can't really understand why they deviated from the original story so much and why they added some unnecessary characters.<br/><br/>Suffice to say that in the book the escape was much more structured, the harrowing trek to the Siberian camp not told in the movie and the interrogation scenes were watered down and told in a different way.<br/><br/>The unity of purpose and resilience of the group and the depth of these individuals were not really drawn upon neither were all of the people that assisted them in their journey. The extraordinary unselfish hospitality of the Tibetans or their communal culture was hardly depicted at all.<br/><br/>In the end the movie just ran out of steam and I would have appreciated an additional layer of realism, one that would have better exemplified the determination of the human condition on a level that I don't think was truly successful in the film. This movie should be more about the people and not just the visuals.<br/><br/>I attribute this to the lack of 'pace' in the movie 'forgive the pun' and a weak screenplay. I still liked the movie but it missed the mark to becoming a true 'classic'. I understand that a movie is not supposed to be the book but in this case even though the acting was superb, it missed the depth of the human element that the book exalted."

With its graphic depictions of the Gulags, deprivation and exodus The Long Walk was the first truly adult story I had read. The experience of the book led me to literature of political struggle and deeply influenced my approach to the rest of the world.

"andy-933-696608","7","1","4","26 January 2011"," The Way Back Review
","What makes a movie as interesting as the central plot, is the displayed characteristics of its actors in their performances. A Polish inmate, an American with a scarred past, a thief with violent tendencies, a teenage girl, an artist, a priest, and a supposed comedian all make their way from the Siberian imprisonment camp Gulag, across Lake Baikal, to the communist ruled Mongolia, and all their way to a communist free India. ""The Way Back"" emphasizes some of the political history of Joseph Stalin's reign of communism, which often included ethnic cleansing, suspicion of traitorous behavior, and more exclusion of potentially foreign threats. The Siberian work camp Gulag, was used to hold a variety of criminals. It goes from the rapists, to the killers, all the way to the political prisoners. Jim Sturgess plays the proclaimed leader of this band of escapees, a polish inmate, Janusz navigating through their whole journey, with little food, weakening strength, dying comrades, and an aspiring determination to return home to the very person who betrayed him. The film began with his wife giving in to the persuasive torture she was subjected to, signing a confession of her husband being a spy and opposing Stalin's communist views, thus sentencing him to twenty years of imprisonment. In his short time of unacceptable agony, Janusz meets the hard and noble Mr. Smith (Harris), the almost monstrously portrayed Valka (Farrell), and in the middle of their journey to freedom the sympathetic Irena (Ronan). Their Journey reveals more about themselves, than what they would've discovered in their incarceration. We all learn of Smith's guilt over his son's death being his life long burden at the cause of bringing him to Russia, Valka still seeing the tyrannical Stalin as a hero rather than a monster, and Janusz's reason for survival to reach freedom are for the purpose of forgiveness. Even after personally witnessing his wife's betrayal, he couldn't bring himself to hatred or contempt because he understood how she must've felt at that very shameful act, living with the heavy guilt of submission and betrayal. I'm not going to go out and say that this film is a classic, however, it displays very impressive performances from its cast, showing just how powerful they can make this story of survival, aside from the many brutal challenges they faced. Their encounters with sandstorms, dehydration, starvation, and temporary loss of hope at the hands of their failures, all of these factors contributed as major challenges to their character expression, pushing them to express more as they traveled together. The films conclusion ends in a brief montage of the rise of communism in Poland to its eventual fall in 1970. I just have to say that I really enjoyed this film, and how it can be really involve the viewer with the interaction of the characters, the hardships encountered, as well as the general tone of survival being used to show how hope can easily shrink, but how it can also push you beyond your limits. I was particularly amazed at the performance of Jim Sturgess, he displays his characters as a simple but very driven individual. He couldn't survive the ordeals of the camp, believing it would be easier to escape, when that journey pushed him and his remaining survivors to a severe test of survival motivated by an inspiration to simply stay alive. I also have to give credit to Ronan, and how as a young actress she is showing an intriguing development in her acting. I thought her performance in ""The Lovely Bones"" was well, despite the film's strange visuals. Director Peter Weir has brought audiences an interesting film of undying motivation to survive and carry on ones ambitions with a unique focus on it's characters, as much as the very torment they are subjected to. He focuses more on this sole point of interest, rather than the political issues that inspired this film and its characters."

","The Way Back: A story about a bunch of people falsely declared traitors by Stalin's regime taken as prisoners. Some of them decide to runaway and break free. There is a dialogue by Ed Harris to Jim Sturgess(Neil Nitin Mukesh's doppelganger) that he is ready to run from the prison because he can take advantage of one of his weakness and that is kindness. And Jim asks how. and he says that if at any point he falls he knows Jim won't leave him behind and he never does throughout the movie. This group was really a bunch of really decent people ,an artiste , a forgiving husband, a heartbroken father , a comedienne by nature and finally the young toughie-vulnerable-survivor girl who comes later and wins everyone over. The Journey itself is soo sooo tough that I can't believe that someone wouldn't just give up and rather die but that is the strength of our survival instincts. These people born in Russia dealing with the snowstorms dressed in layers of clothing travel through mountains & Lakes, sun stroked- sand stormed -mirage filled deserts in those snow boots with feet swollen to elephantic proportions and skin burned to red-flesh eating anything they could lay hands on and sucking water from drenched piece of clothing staring death in the face. That kind of determination is not only tough to portray but I am sure must have been tough to shoot as well. When the girl dies it really is one of the most horrible deaths I have seen on screen. Finally only 4 of them make it through and reach India where they are welcomed with open arms and hearts..no passports no papers notwithstanding. Thank God for a positive end to this real life story. The end where finally Jim goes back to Polanf to his wife when U.S.S.R was dissolved and meets his wife was icing on top of everything. Again a great triumphant story from history so kudos to the person who went back digging to bring it out on screen. Very fulfilling experience again."

","A rather entertaining film that follows a group's near impossible escape from the Soviet Gulag system. It's quite miserable throughout the film as the characters face very harsh conditions while sustaining on little to no food. I shed a tear or two when members of the group were slowly picked off by starvation and dehydration, but in all honestly I require very little characterization to become attached to characters, and this film had just enough to allow me to connect with the scraggly escapees. It's a very simple plot line, but I think the film peaked my interest most within the first 30 minutes where it showed the lethality of Gulag life. I found it especially interesting in the way it portrays the relationship between political and criminal detainees, and how the professional criminals had so much power over the lives of other campmates. I enjoyed watching, although I can't be certain how much I gained from the experience."

","This film, which tells the semi-accurate story of gulag escapees, is beautifully filmed and does a nice job of depicting the basics of ""gulag life,"" but the script, accents, and acting leave much to be desired. I found myself extremely bored - this film needed an editor. The plot is fairly basic - men escape the gulag and walk from Siberia to India. However, the script was dry and I did not find myself attached to any of the characters. Perhaps this is a personal opinion, but I do not understand why a director would cast a british actor and then ask them to speak in a Polish/Russian/Latvian/etc accent. If the viewer knows the character is from a specific country, why must we suffer through two hours of terrible accents. This is a frustrating element of the film. As for the acting, there is not much dialogue, but one can only make walking so interesting. The film's depiction of the gulag, a camp of little cinematic fame, is pretty accurate in terms of how people were interned, how long their sentences lasted, the psychological effects of the gulag, the social dynamics of the camp, and the terrible weather in Siberia. They only spend the first ten or fifteen minutes of the film in the actual camp, so I would not consider this a ""camp film."""
"ntaylor-28563","6","0","1","23 March 2018"," Fun, but ultimately limited
","The Way Back, directed by Peter Weir, tells the story of several Siberian gulag inmates and their escape to freedom. This film does a good job at what it was meant to do: entertain. Being able to follow the characters through their treacherous journey was exciting to watch, and sad to see so many likeable people die. In terms of an educational film on the horrors of the gulag, it did a very good job, though it was quite brief in comparison to the rest of the movie. 
The very first scene portrayed the feelings that many Russians felt upon being interned. The scene used a lot of minimalism, limiting the screen to 3 wide shots, one for each character. It felt almost disorienting for the audience. We have no perception of who these characters are, why this man is being accused, why his wife is seemingly betraying him, the sheer callousness of the guard as he refers to them as ""accused"" and ""witness"". This confusion was also felt by many inmates, as they were often interned for false, almost arbitrary reasons. The scenes within the camp were the highlight of the film as they were able to tell so much about life within these camps, with so little time spent there. Some noticeable sections that were displayed were the trade micro-economy that existed within these camps, demonstrated by the exchanges of cigarettes, meats, and clothing; the existence of a hierarchy ruled by the criminal class; and the presence of various prisoners forming groups based off of reason for internment, whether it was criminals or political internees. The cinematography was also especially strong within the camps. The extreme wide shots of the neighboring mountains truly portrayed the expanse and isolation of this camp. The fences were not the jail, the environment was. The shots demonstrated the impossibility of escape, and the hopelessness that the inmates felt. Inside of the mine was another highlight. The stage presence of smoke, falling rocks, and orange filters created a sense of exhaustion, claustrophobia, and disease, all of which were truly present in the mines. Working there was essentially a death sentence, and this concept was heavily felt. One noticeable flaw in the film was the lack of starvation within the inmates and those travelling. The makeup was well done and believable, but in terms of physicality, everyone looked pretty well fed. There was one scene where a man was begging for food, but that was the extent to which the hunger was shown. Overall though, this film was strongest in the beginning, but still fun to watch throughout."
"p-seed-889-188469","3","0","1","25 February 2018"," Gave up at Mongolia
","I saw this movie some years ago, or more accurately I saw half this movie some years ago. Maybe I was having a bad day but at the time I just couldn't summon the enthusiasm to see it through. So when I saw it advertised recently to appear on television I thought I would give it another shot. <br/><br/>This time round I made it as far as Mongolia, which I suppose is progress. That I got this far is probably because this time around I noticed that it was directed by Peter Weir and because I am a big fan of Gallipoli I gave it more leeway and time for development. Alas my patience and respect for Peter Weir were not rewarded on this occasion. <br/><br/>There is something very fundamentally wrong with this movie, or perhaps the story itself does not lend itself to audience engagement, at least on the big screen. Peter Weir's genius in Gallipoli was to make a ""war"" film (or actually an ""anti-war"" film) by showing practically nothing of war. 80% of that movie was about building up the characters and the relationship between them, and because we know them so well we actually care about what happens at the end. In ""The Way Back"" Peter Weir seems to have forgotten about the need for audience identification with characters. Perhaps I missed a few things with the bas russian accents and names that do not register after hearing them once but quite frankly I had no idea who those people traipsing around Siberia were and even less idea why I should care. I think (but I am not sure) that there is one key protagonist (the one we see being interrogated at the beginning) and a bunch of other guys, but that is hard to tell because they all look and sound the same. If that were not bad enough these strangers do stuff that anyone would do in that situation and they do it for a long time against a backdrop that looks basically the same. I had no idea where they were going and no idea of the distances involved or the absolute immensity of the landscape, be it Siberia or Mongolia. A map and some aerial shots would have helped enormously for as it is it looks like they are off for a weekend tramp. We have absolutely no concept of the magnitude of their feat, which I would have thought is the whole point of the film.<br/><br/>Our heroes, whoever they are, are so clueless that they have to batter a watch with some genius who tells them they must turn off the generator and cut the wires to escape. Bravo, that is certainly a plan and a half. How they disabled the generator, or cut the wires, we are not shown, nor are we shown how they escape dozens of guards and dogs in hot pursuit. And yes, we have a BLIND man thrown in for good measure, that's right, not just a BLIND man but one who indulges in syrupy flashbacks. And then, blow me down, if our intrepid team don't meet a pretty young girl partway along and for reasons best known to themselves they skip across some ice together. It is all very lazy, uninspired and unbelievable stuff.<br/><br/>Eventually our band of heroes gets to the Mongolian border and comes across a huge archway in the middle of nowhere...ah...what? They are surprised to learn that China is also a communist country, which in 1941 was not actually true.<br/><br/>Annoyingly, despite starting the movie with people speaking their actual languages and having English subtitles, as soon as we get to the Gulag everyone amazingly speaks heavily accented English. Perhaps this approach would have cut the mustard 30 years ago when all Hollywood Germans spoke like Colonel Klink, but in this day and age portraying foreign language by using badly accented English is just plain embarrassing to all involved. Quite apart from the embarrassment these rotten accents made it difficult to understand what anyone was saying, and because one actor's poor impression of a Russian speaking English sounds much like another's poor impression of a Russian speaking English, it only made trying to figure out who was who even worse.<br/><br/>OK, this is not the worst movie in the World and indeed I see that many people think this movie is the best thing since sliced bread. I'm glad others enjoyed it, but for me it was an emotionless and heartless experience, which ultimately I had to terminate because I found the boredom of real life more interesting."

Even her introduction does't serve to spice things up. There is little meaningful interaction amongst the cast. Dialogue is stilted and sparse. Being self-consciously accented doesn't make it more intelligible. Farrell, while excellent, is all too convincing as a Russian speaking garbled English. Couldn't get what he was saying.

However, the film gets intense at times especially in the latter stages.<br/><br/>Peter Weir's film tells the tale of a supposedly true story about a group of people who escaped from the Siberian gulag in 1940 and traveled 4500 miles through the Gobi Desert in Mongolia to their freedom across the Himalayas in India.<br/><br/>The acting is quite good. Jim Sturgess may turn out to be a good lead if he keeps up roles like this. Ed Harris does very well as Mr. Smith and should have garnered an Oscar nomination. Colin Farrell also stands out and I like his macho, pro-Stalin stance. Saorirse Ronan is very good and delivers a captivating performance.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very good film that tells about what it takes to survive against Mother Nature and her forces. The acting is very strong and the story is often compelling. There are a few intense, emotional scenes mixed in as well. I'm surprised people don't know much about this film because it's a dandy and is worth seeing. I rate this film 9/10."

","Throughout my life, I have constantly tested myself: martial arts; street fights; pledging Kappa Alpha Psi; earning my Eagle, Globe, and Anchor in the Marines; deploying to Iraq; Crossfit; Tough Mudder, Spartan Race, GoRuck Challengethe list goes on and onyet any time I even start thinking that I'm slightly a bad-ass, I am quickly humbled by something amazing that another human being has accomplished through sheer determination. This film's Plot Summary says it all.<br/><br/>Whenever any life event gets so tough that I want to quit, I tell myself to just take one more stepyou can always take one more stepno one and nothing can make you quit but yourself. I'd like to think that I could survive what the subjects of this film did, but I'm not 100% sure. I'd fight to the last breath, but sometimes it's the right combination of attributes, skills, and luck that allow you to survive something like this. I am truly in awe of what those people survived.<br/><br/>Hopefully, this film will inspire you, too. Hopefully, it will shame you out of using the words ""I can't"" when you're really saying ""I'm quitting because this is too uncomfortable."" Hopefully, you will convince at least one friend to watch this movie, so that he or she can be inspired, too.<br/><br/>This film also illustrates the power of community. All of your differences seem less important when you're put through the fire. You may still irritate each other and fight, but some of the strongest bonds are formed through the endurance of overwhelmingly-difficult situations together.<br/><br/>This movie should also raise your appreciation for the freedoms that we enjoy in the United States. It highlights the extent of the damage that the Axis did to so many people during World War II.<br/><br/>Finally, a bit about leadership: it is an inexact science, for which experience is invaluable. If you are an inexperienced leader, the best thing you can do to limit the mistakes that you will inevitably make is to learn from the mistakes of others. Read books by leaders you admire. There are some very important takeaways about leadership in this film. One of them is that sometimes you can be wrong, and your group may overrule you, but it doesn't mean that they don't trust you. Too often, leaders become too concerned with defending their decisions, rather than recognizing when they were wrong and learning from their own mistakes.<br/><br/>For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com"
"suite92","10","0","1","4 October 2013"," The film depicts a long, heroic trek to freedom across Siberia, Mongolia, Tibet, the Himalayas to India.
","In September 1939, Nazi Germany and Communist USSR partitioned Poland. Many who were in Soviet Poland were imprisoned in Siberia for being politically incorrect. That includes being foreign, being an actor, having advocated freedoms in the past, and other things.<br/><br/>A group escapes from a gulag during World War II, and journey on foot 4000 miles from Siberia across Tibet to freedom in India. The Soviets have offered bounties to any of the locals who capture prisoners.<br/><br/>A party of seven starts the journey and gets away. They face a lot of problems: blinding snow, the ever-present cold, lack of food, hallucinations, each other. They head for Lake Baikal. They soon lose a member who has night blindness, which was sad since he was 50 feet from the rest and their fire when he froze to death. Later, it becomes clear that they got lost on the way. Their best scout sets out to find the lake, and comes back in terrible shape. Fortunately, he did find it.<br/><br/>Irena joins them near the lake. When they encounter the first lake-side town, Valka goes looking for food, and finds some, and steals some vodka. As they move south, there are more people and more mosquitoes. A lucky encounter with locals tells them how to make mosquito repellent necklaces. Irena increases communications among the group.<br/><br/>Further south, near the Mongolian border, they start seeing Soviet military again. Valka decides to stay in Siberia. At the Mongolian border, they discover (how would they have known?) that Mongolia had fallen to the Communist imperialist expansion. So their hopes for freedom are dashed. The shots of the burned out Buddhist temple were heart-breaking. They decide to walk to Tibet, to the Himalayas, to India and British influence.<br/><br/>The desert areas are hard on them. Irena's health fails, and they leave her corpse behind; the party is now down to five. Kazik dies a few days later. The four survivors admire his sketches which he had kept from the gulag on. When they catch sight of the mountains, Smith decides not to go on, and they leave him behind. Later he revives and catches up with them.<br/><br/>They find plenty of water at the base of the Himalayas. Then they have to face the climb, the ice, the snow. They find the Tibetan border. A local points them to Lhasa. They recover for a while in a local village. Zoran, Janusz, and Voss continue to India. Smith continues to Lhasa, where he is sure he can find a way back to the States.<br/><br/>Janusz meets his wife again, years later in 1989, after the Communists are gone.<br/><br/>----Scores----<br/><br/>Cinematography: 10/10 Beautiful.<br/><br/>Sound: 10/10 Well done.<br/><br/>Acting: 10/10 Ed Harris was great, Colin Farrell did a good job, Jim Sturgess is fine as Janusz.<br/><br/>Screenplay: 9/10 The story moves forward well, and kept my attention. The last stage, getting to India from Tibet, might have been more detailed."

","There's some dispute as to the validity of the original account that this story was *loosely* based on, so that kind of killed it slightly for me. I find it hard to invest myself in it when I know it's all been buggered about with. I will never understand the need for it. They say ""it's unfilmable"", ""it wouldn't work"". I think that's rubbish though and would rather watch a true account any day than a half true account. But that's a separate issue to how good the film is so that notwithstanding .... This was a pretty decent tale of how a band of hitherto disparate prisoners escape a Siberian gulag and head south for India. What I liked about this is it avoided certain clichés like repetitive dramatic chases and narrow escapes. Very hard to find a film that doesn't follow that pattern. No instead, it accepts the likelihood that they wouldn't pursue them very far in that terrain, probably assuming that the endless cold barren wasteland would take care of them if they got away. Besides, the journey itself is enough without any added drama. So the whole film becomes about their struggle to carry on through difficult conditions. Again, you might expect them to follow the group-breaks-down-in-violent-confrontation cliché, but no they avoid this, even though one of the group has been shown to have psychotic form. The only unfortunate cliché they fell into was planting some female interest into the plot, although that was handled pretty well - no soppy romance. They even avoided the wolves versus men action fight that seemed inevitable at one point. Fair play to the cliché avoidance officer in this crew! I thought Jim Sturgess was powerful as the lead. Ed Harris awesome as always. Hell even ratboy Farrell put in a good turn. I found Saoirse whatsherface a little out of place here but perhaps that's just me - she'll probably be a huge star in a few years anyway. As they crossed freezing wastes, deserts, mountains, I did find myself struggling to believe if this journey would even be possible under those circumstances. Maybe this did happen and it would be mind-blowing if it did, but I just found it a little hard to believe. My only other criticism was I felt more time could've been spent on certain scenes, e.g. the break-out. Perhaps a victim of over-editing. Aside from these minor criticisms, I thought it was a really well-acted and entertaining watch. Not for action fans, not for kids. If you like made-up stories, and you enjoyed Defiance, The Pianist, Empire of the sun, or Castaway, maybe this is for you."

","Any film directed by Peter Weir would draw my immediate attention. Co-Writer, director and producer of ""The Way Back,"" Weir is responsible for other great films: ""Dead Poets Society,"" ""The Year of Living Dangerously,"" ""Gallipoli,"" and ""The Truman Show.""<br/><br/>A masterpiece, this film is a powerful testament to the power of human bonding, the drive to survive no matter what, and the power of love to overcome terror and hatred, which Hitler boasted would always overcome reason. This is a move about why Hitler's thesis did not work.<br/><br/>It is interesting to turn from my viewing of The History Channel's new series, ""The Bible,"" which like the Bible, like our world now, is extremely violent. The men who escape from a Siberian nightmare turn hatred inside out, creating their own ethos. Like a palimpsest, which can never fully be erased, allows these survivors to write over its surfade a new image, a new version, a new vision,the next chapter of their lives free from the tyranny that threatened to snuff out everything that mattered. As Martin Luther King, Jr., warned, ""Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.""<br/><br/>Ed Harris, who has always impressed me, whether he is portraying a haunted gunslinger or Senator John McCain, is at the very top of his form in this film. The furrows of his brow tell a tale, even the way he is dressed, the sapphire diamonds in his gaze, symbolize physical, mental and moral toughness. His repeated refrain, that ""Kindness can get you killed,"" continues to take on new and more gentle import as the story unfolds, almost like shifting waves of sand in the endless, scorching Gobi Desert.<br/><br/>Mark Strong who, in my opinion, along with James Gandalfini, saved ""Dark Night Thirty,"" from mediocrity, giving it the believability it lacked until they entered the story, is intense, laconic, commanding instant respect every time he speaks. That is a challenge to accomplish in this cast, in this story, where each man becomes a sort of resurrected piston in a rebuilt engine comprised of cast-offs, rejects, the detritus of the maniacal fury of Hitler and Stalin.<br/><br/>The story begins when Hitler and Stalin, like ravenous wolves, each tear their half out of Poland, and many who do not immediately perish, are cruelly thrust into a Gulag in Siberia. A small cluster of canny would-be-survivors escapes. That's the easy part. One of them knows how to survive in the wilds, using pine cones and other surprising tricks that work. Together, they find enough food and water, survive disease and infection, traverse one of the world's most formidable deserts, and scale several Himilayan mountains to reach freedom. <br/><br/>The government official in India who greets them asks for their passports. They smile. ""How did you get here?"" ""We walked,"" the men respond.<br/><br/>Our world has endured financial collapse, avaricious, high tech, democracy-wrecking criminals who did not go to jail, zealots who place fanaticism before the brotherhood of man, woman and child. This is a movie to reflect upon. We are alive. Now what?<br/><br/>Shakespeare's Edgar, a noble survivor in ""King Lear,"" mutters, ""This is not the worst as long as we can say, 'This is the worst.'"" We are alive. So what? The men and the woman in this story did not knuckle under to Hitler or Stalin. They did not die suffering unmitigated horrors in the Gulag. They blazed a new way, new lives.<br/><br/>A Russian thug, a comic accountant, a pastry chef who is an accomplished artist, a priest, a pole with night blindness, and another condemned pole who knows how to live in the wilds and leads them all.<br/><br/>Hitler killed 6,000,000 Jews. Stalin made 50,000,000 people ""disappear."" We must never forget. Demagogues beware: As John Steinbeck warned, ""Repression tends to knit the repressed."""
"severity1","8","0","1","19 July 2012"," Always a good plot
","There is something nostalgic and romantic about walking, especially if it is to get back to someone you love. (remember 'cold mountain'). It is always a good plot to build a film. In this case, however, the purpose of the great walk is pure and simple - Freedom. The characters talk about avenging their captors, but as the movie progresses , their energies are drained by the forces of nature and revenge is hardly on anyone's mind. Survival is the only thing that matters. Since the basic plot is minimal, a film of this nature needs some serious effort from the actors and the director to carry it through. Just when you feel that the film is dragging, just like the protagonists , in many scenes, it throws a visual gem at you which keeps you glued. Colin Farrel , plays a memorable character as the prisoner who loves 'Mother Russia' more than his freedom."
"hoplonite1","7","0","1","19 March 2012"," Impressive but no Weir masterpiece
","I awaited this movie with great expectations as I am a fan of Peter Weir and of mid 20th c. historical adventures. I also loved Seven Years in Tibet which had a similar setting. Having said all the above, I have to admit that this latest 'epic' by Peter Weir (based on the ""Long Walk"") has left me wanting. This has nothing to do with the actors, most of which are at least as good as the story. I found Ed Harris top-notch, as usual, Colin Farrell, Saoirse Ronan and the less known Dragos Bucur very good with the remainder of the cast believable to adequate. The visuals also left nothing to be desired with stunning vistas of the 'Asian' hinterland (although filmed elsewhere). Nor was I bothered by the limited and mostly pedestrian dialogue, especially after Farrell falls silent because, as one of the escapees puts it: Ghulag inmates refrained from chatting...So, what is it that failed to please? First of all, in the opening chapter in Siberia, I found the make-up of the actors and their overall appearance poorly done. After ""Shindler's List"" and a host of other movies about gulags, stalags and Jewish survival stories, the actors in this one never seemed convincing as gaunt, under-nourished, ex-bourgeoisie dying of exposure. Second, the trek. This was obviously linear, as was the authentic trek, but there was always something of a TV series about each segment/trial. David Lean managed to make a visual trek (always less empathetic than a written narrative) truly epic. Weir fails miserably to do the same and I don't know why. The trekkers reach almost the end of their tether at some point in the movie, but I never felt the extreme sun heat (David Lean's ""anvil"" in Arabia) and dehydration, just as I had not felt the debilitating icy gale in the Siberian woodland. Overall, not an inspiring movie despite the enormity of the main characters' undertaking. All the elements are there but there is no magic to dress the whole."

The first half drags in places and the characters aren't that deep (Hero, Joker, Religious, Criminal). But the last two minutes will leave you with a lump in your throat. Finally, here is a Hollywood film about the crimes of Communism, and it's a good one. Special praise must go to Colin Farrell as a conflicted zek (criminal), and to Saoirise Ronan as a mysterious girl whose etheral femininity serves to underline the harshness of survival in the wilderness and of escape. A well-made film, with stunning landscapes on a worthy subject."

","I was eager to see this movie when my friend told about it because i had read the book which has actually inspired this movie. The name of the book as most of you might know is The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom written by Slavomir Rowicz. The book was an incredible and touted as the real story of the prisoners who escape from the Siberian jail. The incredible journey that they make is very well depicted in the book. <br/><br/>The very effort that the director has taken to make the book into a movie is commendable. But i felt the book was more vivid and amazing than the movie. But still, it is a good watch, especially if you are a lover of adventure kind of movies."
"jon-broeke","Null","0","1","17 May 2011"," Saoirse Ronan is back on the big screen in a film about the endurance of the human spirit. The Way Back is a travel tour-de-force.
","Saoirse Ronan has got to be one of the busiest young actresses in Hollywood, and it's well deserved. Coming off her best supporting actress nomination a few years ago at the Oscars for Atonement, she's gone from strength to strength. She starred alongside Michelle Pfeiffer in I could never be your Woman, with Bill Murray and Tim Robbins in City of Ember, and an incredibly creepy Stanley Tucci in The Lovely Bones. This week she's starring alongside Ed Harris and Colin Farrell in the escape film The Way Back.<br/><br/>After being accused of espionage in Russia during the height of communism, Zoran (Dragos Balkur) finds himself wrongfully imprisoned in a gulag in the heart of Siberia, his only thoughts ones of escape. At the gulag he meets Valka (Farrell), a thug and gangster with a knife that Zoran needs to escape. He also enlists Mr. Smith (Ed Harris), the only American in the gulag, to help with the escape and together with a few others they manage to break free from the gulag, but that's only the start of the story. From there they need to travel, on foot, thousands of miles into India, the only communist free country anywhere near them. Ronan stars as Irena, a Russian girl the escapees pick up along the way.<br/><br/>This is a moving film, based on a true story, told beautifully by Peter Weir, the director. The locations are gorgeous. From the harsh snow covered trees of Siberia, a terrifying blizzard blowing through the trees, to the stark, barren landscape of the deserts between Russia and China as they travel over the sand. The viewer gets the full brunt of the harsh conditions these men needed to survive to get to safety. The performances are also great. From Balkur's performance as a man that needs to escape inescapable odds to right a wrong he didn't even admit, to Farrell's scary performance as a killer and psychopath that loves the people who put him in the prison he finds himself in. Ronan is great as a girl that gets help from men that shouldn't be able to give it. She has the right balance of vulnerability and strength to make her great to watch.<br/><br/>All in all, this is great inspirational movie that anyone that who enjoys a good prison escape film should watch, and keep a close eye out; Saoirse is in a second film hitting the big screen soon, Hanna, the action, thriller co-starring Cate Blanchett and Eric Bana comes out May 27th.<br/><br/><ul><li>www.celebrit-enow.com -</li></ul>"
