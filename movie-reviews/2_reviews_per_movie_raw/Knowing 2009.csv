","I love watching movies that leave you just thinking at the end. This movie really did that. Now I'm not really sure why it has such bad reviews but i really liked it and would definitely recommend watching it. <br/><br/>Its not another end of the world movie where your main characters saves their family and end up surviving at the end, which is something i liked because it shows how Nick cages's character has to cope with knowing that him and his family will die and theirs no stopping it.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the ending and how everything comes together at the end to show that this is Gods doing. You would never expect that from the way its played out, other than the foreshadowing from his son talking about not believing god at the beginning"
"Cujo108","Null","49","64","8 August 2010"," Proyas delivers his best yet
","In 1959, an elementary school buries a time capsule that holds drawings of what the kids think the world will be like in 50 years. When the capsule is dug up in present day, each child is given a drawing from the capsule. The drawing that Caleb Koestler gets isn't a drawing at all. Instead, it's a page full of random numbers. When Caleb takes the paper home, his astrophysicist father stumbles upon the discovery that the numbers seem to have predicted the dates of major disasters which occurred in the 50 years since. Not only the dates, but the number of victims from each incident as well. A fascinating discovery, but more important matters lie hidden in the numbers, as there are three dates and three major disasters to come... and they're coming soon.<br/><br/>""Knowing"" is more ambitious than a typical disaster movie. Not really a surprise coming from director Alex Proyas. The closest he's come to generic is ""I, Robot"", by far his weakest work. While certain plot points may be hard to swallow for some, I had no qualms with any of it. Of course, I fully expected the film to be bashed unmercifully by many just because Nicolas Cage is in it. I know people like to criticize Cage every chance they get, but his acting is just fine here. Some of the tender moments between he and his son were actually quite effective from an emotional standpoint. Reading through several of the reviews I've seen, it's clear that some people just have a hate-on for the guy. My girl Rose Byrne shows up halfway through the picture, and while her character is that of a tortured woman relegated to looking distraught and flipping out, she does both well. Her panic at the gas station brought a smile to my face, as I just love watching her work.<br/><br/>Proyas handles the suspense exceptionally, particularly the buildup to the various disasters. The screws turn slowly, but ever so tightly. As for the disasters themselves, the scene with the crashing airliner is wicked in it's execution. Shot in the pouring down rain and all in one take, we witness the crash followed by Cage sulking amidst explosions, burning rubble and burning passengers. The subway sequence isn't as effective. Not even close, really, but the build makes up for it. The final disaster, which I won't spoil here, is positively fantastic both in buildup and execution. One scene in relation to the final disaster involves a discovery on the bottom of a bed. I felt that this scene made for a very strong gut punch, just well-done all around in leading up to it, music, everything. Chaos aside, I also liked some of the human touches that Proyas threw in. Caleb watching a video of his mother singing him a lullaby is a really strong little character moment in the midst of everything else going on. I also thought Cage's reaction was well-played. <br/><br/>Now for some faults. The score could be overpowering at times. I also feel that the final scene was not needed. The line about starting over was enough to get the point across, I didn't need to see it. More subtlety would have been most welcome, and ending the film with the earth in cinders would make for a more potent final image. Aside from that, the worst I can say is that some of the acting from bit players was rather on the weak side.<br/><br/>Overall, I was very satisfied with the final product. It could have used some tweaking here and there, but most films are flawed in some way or another. The twists in the storyline won't work for everyone. It seems a lot of the time when a new film tries to shoe in aliens or any sort of spirituality aspect, it gets branded as some sort of new age crap. I don't subscribe to that thought process. I think it's a strong piece of filmmaking from a filmmaker who doesn't work as often as he should. The masses can have their popcorn films, but I like my popcorn with a few extra layers of butter on top."
"hardykh","6","314","458","21 March 2009"," Did Writers Know When It Jumped The Shark?
","This film started out with a real grabber. The whole time capsule thing was working as was the predictions and it had me riveted waiting to find out what was going to happen next.<br/><br/>Then everything went left and the movie bounded over the shark as Cage begins a wild chase to tell everyone about the end of the world.<br/><br/>I absolutely believe this screenplay wasn't written with the ending that was in the movie. I figure around one third of the way through someone said, ""hey this is way too M. Night Shymalan, better beef up the special effects!"" That's when the explosions started.<br/><br/>Then another Hollywood big-wig said, ""hey, we need to add some extraterrestrials or this will never hit"" and so enter the blond guys in the woods. These scenes look like they were re-shot after the fact.<br/><br/>Finally as Cage is on his knees waving to his son on the space ship, I expected the credits to roll, but no. I feel pretty sure a focus group was show the first cut and they said it was a downer, so...after a rewrite and lots of money on special effects. Voila! End of the world.<br/><br/>Ten, after another focus group, comes the two kids in Eden ending that looked completely out of place and I feel pretty sure was tacked on after audience reactions ranged from""but what about the kids?"" to ""that's a downer"".<br/><br/>All in all, the whole thing went way off the rails and squandered any viewer interest in favor of bad theology and worse writing.<br/><br/>If anyone can confirm my theories of rewrites and re-shoots, please let me know. Otherwise, I have to believe the producers just got lost somewhere along the way to what promised to be a good film."
"pugmahorn","7","467","707","26 March 2009"," The Good, The Bad and the Ugly
","The good: Strong start to the movie, the plot hooks you in, excellent sound, confronting disaster scenes, haunting images, Rose Byrne, at times quite freaky, The Bad: Special effects looked like they were from a video game, ripped off basically every science fiction movie ever made, poor acting from Nic Cage, very predictable.<br/><br/>The Ugly: Last third of movie was shamefully ridiculous.<br/><br/>Summary: If you are a science fiction fan, you will probably not be able to resist seeing this movie. Be warned, you will think you are seeing the sci-fi great that you have been waiting for but mid way the film gets lost. You may very well groan out loud at the ending. This had the makings of a great movie but unfortunately it couldn't come up with the goods."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","6","178","262","22 March 2009"," Am I bonkers? I thought it was kind of stupid
","Nicolas Cage, I feel like an addictive gambler when it comes to this man, because there are times where he has some really great movies(i.e. Face/Off) then he has moments where I wonder if he was drinking when he accepted other movies(i.e. Wicker Man). He has some really great acting moments, but it seems like his movies lately, he just looks tired and like he stayed up the whole night memorizing his lines not realizing he hasn't had any sleep for 6 weeks. I don't know, I'm not quite sure why this has a high rating right now, but we'll see in the next few weeks, because honestly I wasn't all that thrilled with Knowing. From the trailer this looked really exciting, but instead we got a movie that just took itself too seriously. I thought it was mainly just poor writing for the story and the characters.<br/><br/>In 1959, a competition is held amongst the students of a new elementary school to celebrate its opening. The winning plan, from student Lucinda Embry, is to bury a time capsule containing the students' drawings of the future to be opened 50 years later in 2009. She is prevented from finishing her image, which is actually a series of seemingly random numbers, and goes missing during the ceremony. Her teacher later finds her in a gym closet frantically scratching the remaining numbers on the door. Fifty years later, the time capsule is opened and the pictures are handed down to the new generation of students. Caleb, the son of MIT professor and astrophysicist John Koestler, receives Lucinda's envelope. While initially dismissing them as random numbers, John accidentally discovers that the numbers have accurately predicted the dates, death tolls, and locations of every major disaster in the last 50 years; three of the events have not yet occurred. Decoding and discovering that one of the three may lead to the end of the world.<br/><br/>Is this a movie that you have to see in the theater? There is one scene that only the big screen can do justice and that was the airplane crash scene, even though it was unrealistic it was great to watch. I just love how Nicolas Cage reacts to it, he goes to ""save"" the people who are burning and one person passes him screaming in flames and Nic just says ""hey!"", what exactly was he planning on saying to him? Like ""HEY! Just to let you know, you're on fire"". I thought the ending was weak and there wasn't enough character development. The story was too serious, while intense, the characters were not real and I felt like the effects got too cheesy at the end. I would say if you're going to see this in the theater, see the matinée, otherwise, just stick with the rental.<br/><br/>6/10"
"battlecrusadersgames","9","23","29","22 May 2018"," Under-rated
","Ok, so Nic Cage may not be the actor of the century but he does do poe faced well, lol. 
However this movie is highly under-rated. Chandler Canterbury is fantastic and the special Fx are some of the best ive ever seen. The storyline is also thought provoking and new. My only gripe is the ending, which wouldnt have been my choice."
"revival05","7","84","122","16 October 2009"," Anti-Armageddon, as far as Michael Bay goes
","I feel a strange shift of priorities within moviegoers today, when a movie like District 9 can use very familiar content and simply shake it around a little, and then be hailed as a masterwork of originality and become immensely popular - while a movie like Knowing will be heavily questioned and criticized beyond it's proportions despite, or perhaps due to, the fact that it actually takes an actual leap of originality. I wonder when the latest time it was I saw a Hollywood-movie end up where this one ends up. While not being perfect, Knowing still is a proper science-fiction film in the vein of 2001 - A Space Odyssey and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Certainly not as good, for various reasons, but at least clearly part of the genre.<br/><br/>The storyline of Knowing is kind of a reversed bottle neck, by the end the multitude of the story is as big as it gets but to begin with, we are in a kind of X Files territory where we get a spooky prologue with a mystery note being dug under the ground (I won't go into the details, because it's really not important for me to go over them) and post credits we pick it up 50 years later when the note ends up in the hands of MIT professor John Koestler (Nicholas Cage) who is one of those I-lost-my-wife-so-I-lost-my-faith kind of guys, believing that the universe as we know it is all random and coincidental. Easily cracked, the numbers on the note, written by a little girl and buried for five decades, declare the dates and places of all future disasters to come, including death tolls. Cage sees 9/11 predicted from this little girls hands in 1959, as well as the Katrina and several disasters that haven't taken place yet. Without saying too much, he doesn't like what he sees at the end of the list of numbers.<br/><br/>I have heard the movie be called predictable. Looking back, I must admit there's a lot of places where I could have seen a lot of things coming. Many quite blatant clues are placed right in the very first couple of scenes and if you know your plot and character mechanics, you would spot some obligatory scenes to come. However, I didn't. It seems I was in on the ride. The plot of the movie, I think, expands in such a methodical way that as long as you get sucked in to begin with, you don't ask any more questions. The mystery is intriguing enough to have you focus on the next shot, not the overall story. I was fairly annoyed by the story device that was seemingly on the side of the plot, dealing with Cage's kid being stalked by a couple of evil, albino trench-coat-guys looking like a bunch German electro-goths. I found that they distracted the viewer from the more interesting, down-to-earth kind of story going on with Cage. But come the ending of the movie, nothing is really earthbound and they seem kind of forgivable in retrospect. Just like in Close Encounters, Knowing is a movie that starts out cryptic but ends out in big scale cathartic satisfaction and harmony, as if it all (*all*) makes sense in the end.<br/><br/>As for the flaws, I didn't mind the story or any of the plot holes (which mostly are arguable anyway). What did bother me probably more than anything else about the movie, though, was it's unfortunate big-time flirt with the melodrama. Take the score for instance, by Marco Beltrami, not really king of the subtle, and it's unfortunate for a movie which deals with this unusual hypothesis to have such operatic and stereotypical acting. And why, WHY, do Hollywood-movies nowadays feel the need to use those HORRIBLE matte paintings? They look like a 50's parody! As for plot, Knowing certainly bites off a lot more than it can chew. I quickly noted in the credits, with fear, that while the story credit went to one person there were like three or four guys behind the actual script. That usually means what we also get in Knowing. Messy conflicts within the narrative and sudden ""moronic behavior as plot device"" from characters. Also, not every mystery thread thrown up on the floor ends up with a sensible conclusion. But despite a lot ends up as fairly arbitrary anyway, I think a lot of the questions are meant to be left unanswered. Knowing picks up a lot of ancient SF-ideas, that probably would seem tired if this genre had been over-represented in any way, and at the end of the day, you didn't ask the monkey in 2001 how he figured out how to use that piece of bone, right? In all fairness, the movie is partly a thriller so it needs certain plot devices in order for the it to have a good spook value which, I might add, it surely delivers. This is the kind of movie that creeps you out just by having a character flip a bed on to it's side. I'm not sure if these abandoned mysteries is a giant flaw or just one of those things you can roll with, but I know that it makes sure it doesn't reach the top. Knowing is a movie made I'd say for 80% entertainment, and I could say I was 80% entertained. The remaining 20% is sci-fi fodder and that made me happy too. No masterpiece then, but a good ride that I certainly will recommend.<br/><br/>Also. I get the feeling that a lot of people who dismissed Knowing this summer were the same guys who were angry at the Bay bashers of Transformers 2. I wonder, why on Earth are the flaws of Transformers 2 forgivable, whereas the strengths of Knowing dismissible?"

","I have read a lot of totally negative views about this film, and so I can only say that some people simply have no imagination.<br/><br/>""Knowing"" works at every level.

And the final is breathtaking.<br/><br/>I watched this film with my wife and we are not easily pleased movie watchers.<br/><br/>I find myself being critical of the negative reviews, because I am astounded at their lack of imagination.<br/><br/>Without imagination, we would never have had The Time Machine thanks to Herbert George Wells. This is just one example.<br/><br/>Another is Steven Spielberg's ""Close Encounters"".

"AngieeeBabayy","9","148","226","11 February 2010"," I don't understand the negativity behind this movie
","I thought this was arguably one of the best movies of our time. With that said, I've gotta admit I'm a scifi movie lover and these movies are my kinda thing.<br/><br/>This movie literally had everything I typically LOVE in a movie, a great beginning, a thriller climax, and a killer ending. There were no plot holes to this film, which initially made me love this movie in the first place. One thing I love about this movie has to be after I watch it a couple of times- I actually notice little hidden things in the climax that ultimately lead up to the ending, things you don't typically notice when you first watch this movie.<br/><br/>Those who love the indie film-type endings, or those who love horror or slasher films, or actually anyone who likes cliff-hanger endings- this might not be for you. But if you love apocalypse type movies, or are a thriller fanatic then you'll hopefully like this movie. This movie also supports the Christian/Catholic faith- so if you are against it in any way- this movie may not suit you. With that said, it's NOT a Jesus loving movie. The ending has a lot to do with the Christian faith and if that's not for you- don't watch it.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a pretty spectacular movie. The music was on cue with everything in the movie and the scenes were incredible. Each scene had you gripping onto your seat in anticipation. Although this is very under-appreciated, I hope you will give this movie a try."
"vserrol","8","25","33","29 November 2018"," Why all the hate?
","I know it's a bit late for a review but I feel compelled to reply to some of the criticism leveled at this movie. The reviews tend to be based on a few mistaken assumptions.<br/><br/>1) The movie is pro scientology propaganda<br/><br/>If there is any truth to this then the propaganda is very obscure, as a quick reference to scientology symbols does not include the 7 pointed star as per one detractor. To state that the movie uses a numerical based prophesy and that this is indicative of scientology is conspiratorial and nonsensical. Both the bible and koran are full of them. Maybe I am too ingenuous but at no time did I feel I was being led along a path of conscription to scientology.<br/><br/>2) plot holes due to slim chances of a text fortuitously falling into the hands of a person intelligent enough to decipher the meaning and be the father of one of the chosen survivors and have the descendants of the original prophecy play a part in the fruition of the plan.<br/><br/>fair enough, but nobody seems to question as to why the prophesy itself is possible. Surely if the universe was deterministic, as suggested by the very presence of a prophecy, then a sufficiently advanced civilization able to foresee the prophecy would also be able to foresee the path they have subscribed to the resolution they have decided on.<br/><br/>3) The movie doesn't make sense or jumps around too much.<br/><br/>Fortunately there are many straight forward shows and cartoons to watch instead ."

"treadwaywrites","7","297","493","19 March 2009"," Worth Seeing  Before the End!
","From the trailers of Knowing you'd be convinced that you're going to watch a cheesy, try to save the world picture with a wound tight Nicolas Cage at the center gritting his teeth and ducking his way to the perfect ending. Well, you'd be partially correct. Cage is definitely giving his wound tight hero routine that he's worked so hard to develop over the last half dozen films. As for the cheese factor, that's where you'll be surprised. Director Alex Proyas manages to deliver a rather decent sci-fi flick that has plenty of suspense and intelligence.<br/><br/>The plot turns around John Koestler (Nicolas Cage), an MIT astrophysics nerd turned Indiana Jones when a time capsule is discovered at his young son Caleb's (Chandler Canterbury) school. Inside are drawings from students in 1959 predicting what things would be like in 2009 some 50 years later. The drawing that Caleb comes home with isn't a drawing at all but a series of seemingly random numbers. Koestler becomes obsessed with the numbers and their meaning or what they seem to mean. The whole thing shakes him to his scientific core and a quest has begun.<br/><br/>The film is very lucky to have director Alex Proyas from films such as Dark City which is his true geek film and critical acclaim as well as I, Robot and Garage Days. The visual and special effects are outstanding. It was surprising how much suspense was in the script (Ryan Douglas Pearson and Juliet Snowden) which gave the film a real thriller atmosphere which continues to build in tone as the mystery is unraveled. <br/><br/>I admit I went into this film expecting a rehash of National Treasure on a more global scale. The sci-fi aspect of the premise is very well thought out and told. The acting by co-stars (Chandler Canterbury, Rose Byrne and Lara Robinson) are solid performances and stand in complementary contrast to that of the tightly wound Nicolas Cage. The geek factor of Knowing is rather high with lots of number configurations and what-if scenarios which is great for the sci-fi fans. At times your brain may have to turn on in order to follow the film, but that is what made Knowing such a pleasant surprise to me.*"
"xaltered_rissax","6","108","174","21 March 2009"," Judge this movie yourself, but I felt swindled.
","Now, I have nothing against religious films, but this movie came out a bit too loaded for my comfort. I felt like the commercials made you think that it was going to be a run of the mill disaster movie when in actuality it had a heavy religious undertone. The storyline doesn't live up to the amazing graphics (granted, I was horrified during the airplane scene) and the larger-than-life suggestions that the commercials entail. It's definitely worth seeing for the imagery; and, hell, the storyline is pretty interesting, but the last half is like a scurrying attempt to shove all the loose ends into one ridiculous ending: alien/angels and the saving of innocent Adam and Eve children because they ""believed."" No thanks, Hollywood."
"EricBosarge","1","205","343","29 March 2009"," OMG, what in the world
","Okay, this is a movie that I would classify as ""I lost two hours of my life for this?"" It was almost as if one person wrote the beginning, one person wrote the middle, and one person wrote the ending, and none of it meshes together at all. This movie has horror, religious, and sci-fi aspects that are all over the place. The first thirty minutes are okay, but it just plummets from there. There was not really any back story and it was kind of all over the place. The best part was when the lead female role was killed. Her whiny butt was getting on my nerves. The whole aliens are angels things was not put together very well at all, and the special effects were not that great. This would have been so much better if they had just concentrated on the story line and not have made it so goofy."
"RosenKratz","9","513","891","6 March 2009"," Kudos To Proyas For This Surprisingly Good Flick!
","It may seem improbable, but Knowing actually adds something fresh and inspiring to the disaster genre. <br/><br/>Certainly the action scenes are well staged  they are as grand and tense as the previews would have you expect. But Knowing really stands out from the likes of Next and various Roland Emmerich movies because of its heart (there is a profoundly human element amongst the chaos and destruction), and because of the surprising, riveting turns the story takes. In no way was it a generic ""save the world"" flick, like I feared going in. It is an original with a memorable ending that should not be spoiled, but it will almost definitely have people talking.<br/><br/>In my mind, director Alex Proyas deserves a lot of the credit for the fact that the film is brave, and does not try to replicate a typical Hollywood blueprint. In fact, he even has Nic Cage back on solid footing, an actor I used to love but have been quite weary of lately. But I think Proyas deserves the main kudos for turning this into something creative and special, and I'd go as far as to say this it is his best movie since Dark City.<br/><br/>There really isn't much to complain about regarding the film, but the one exception might be the middle, where the action sags a bit. Still, I think the captivating final third more than makes up for it.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend the film - you will be pleasantly surprised!"

What is the point of giving an astrophysicist a list of predictions and telling him when the world is going to end if there's nothing he can do about it? For the first two thirds of the film I was waiting for some clever twist or original storyline that would bring together all the disjointed pieces of the film but instead it ended in the most anti-climactic and least original way - aliens! The second worst cop out in history - the first being 'he woke up and it was all a dream'. It's not even poignant enough to be thought provoking or depressing; it's simply utterly pointless!"

","I don't expect a film about the apocalypse or premonitions to be the smartest movie ever ... hell, those 'disaster' movies where the hero charges around saving people are pretty much standard Hollywood fluff, and aren't too intelligent - but they are rarely this stupid. Its like they took all the annoying elements out of these movies and put them all in one (think Independence Day but without the bad jokes to forgive it for the stupidity) In parts I felt like I was watching a kids flick with gory disasters and spooky pedophile stalkers added in for effect. The kids were (as is often the case in these type of movies) annoying. But this time around the adults were so much worse. And the acting was just plain awful all round.<br/><br/>The most annoying thing though was the plot - it didn't make any sense. These advanced aliens can predict the future and feel the need to impart this to some kids to write it all down as a set of numbers in the hope some college professor figures out what they mean. But in the end, it doesn't matter what they mean, they're all going to die anyway. Lucky the aliens feel like saving the kiddies. Now I get the whole religion-aliens/angels take on the movie, but it doesn't feel any less dumb.<br/><br/>To sum it all up: Nicholas Cage's acting was awful, his 'son' was annoying, Rose Byrne's character was plain stupid, Cage's character was a total idiot, the aliens ending was ridiculous, and really, the only good thing was that they got what they deserved - toasted to death in a fiery inferno (too bad they kids escaped with their bloody rabbits)."

But that just certain kids were the only ones being saved and no adults at all was just ridiculous. <br/><br/>Have the producers, etc never read 'The Lord of the Flies'? Kids do not do well on their own. They also do not just happily accept being taken by aliens to a strange new world; they do not happily accept not only the deaths of their families and friends (assuming friends are not of the 'chosen') but also the death - apparently - of even their planet.<br/><br/>Why couldn't they have had the aliens stay with them as the 'adult' influence at the very least? Why were only certain children rescued, why no adults? Why were the children behaving like mini 'stepford wives' at the end, in spite of the trauma they had gone through? The film is fantastic up to the last fifteen minutes and then it all goes to hell in a handcart.<br/><br/>It was like the writer, and later the director, thought this was a good way to just end it as they were bored. Come up with some ridiculous reason to end the world - have the men in black (yes we all got that little 'wheeze') actually be the aliens, save the kiddies (punters like to see 'little timmy' survive) and there you have it; the perfect ending if you've got bored with your project.<br/><br/>Well, I can vouch for the fact it's NOT. Next time, if you're going to make a movie this good - make the ENDING as good too, or else we (the viewers) just feel cheated. If you get bored - walk away and let someone else finish it.<br/><br/>Out of 10 - I give it 4; and that's just because of the rubbish ending."
"Zulu42","9","127","216","25 April 2009"," Better, and different than expected
","First off, Nicolas Cage was pretty good as a science teacher who's initial skepticism over a batch of numbers (scribbled on a piece of paper found in a school's time capsule from the 1950s) is tested and eventually worn away by a quest to find out what they mean. Cage runs hot and cold when it comes to the characters he plays; he's awesome in films like ""Raising Arizona"", ""Con Air"", or ""National Treasure"", while not so believable in stuff like ""The Family Man"". He's maturing as an actor and getting better, it seems, with every role. Another standout is Rose Byrne, as the daughter of the odd little girl who wrote out the bizarre number sequences that Cage's character is analyzing. Byrne's always good at playing pensive women with something mysterious in their back stories. Yet as good as the actors were, the special effects and the twists in the storyline are what make this movie really entertaining. The writers didn't take the easy, obvious route with the story which was refreshing. The plot continues to surprise throughout taking some very different turns with the outcome of the story which made it even more unpredictable and better for it. I like movies that keep me guessing and this is one of those. See it if you like the unexpected."

This one, however, brings a new fresh feeling to this genre.<br/><br/>I think we've all seen the whole ""I see it coming"" type of movie where the main character has to prevent something from happening. This is one of those, and yet it isn't. It doesn't bore you, it doesn't make you feel like you've seen it before, and yet you have a comfortability with it that intrigues you throughout.<br/><br/>I found myself quite entertained and the movie didn't lose my attention or have me checking my watch. Good direction and acting. Nicholas Cage does a good job.<br/><br/>I believe anyone who sees this movie will enjoy it for what it is. Go see it, it's a fun flick!"

I felt embarrassed for the actors the whole movie. And the end, stupid beyond words... only the kids that can hear the creepy whispering people can go off in the spaceship... no parents allowed... and the kids don't really mind that their parents are either dead or about to die, because they each get to have a white fluffy bunny to hold... most of the audience was laughing, and those that weren't sat there with their mouth hanging open.

","I went to see this because Roger Ebert gave this a 4/4 stars. I completely agree. This is an amazing science fiction movie, with some fresh twists on the genre that makes it amazing.<br/><br/>An MIT science teacher (Nick Cage) disillusioned by his wife's death, now believes in randomness. One day, he is confronted by mysterious events. A document found by his son in a time capsule seems to predict the dates of catastrophes. In his struggle to interpret the meanings and magnitude of the events and warn society of them, he comes across a profound and terrifying insight into what may lie in the future. His effort to save his son and loved ones becomes his desperate objective. I won't give away the ending, but trust me, this is one well made, sophisticated picture.<br/><br/>This story is filled with suspense, great terror, and frighting scenes that have deep emotional impact. The sound effects are awesome. There are some crashes in here that rocked the theater, and filled every expectation I have of well filmed disasters. The visual effects are superb and emotionally powerful.<br/><br/>If you are a picky film goer like me, you'll be delighted with this. Not only worth your money, but worth your time. This moved along with speed and excitement, and I got lost in it. Everyone in the theater was gasping in exhilaration when the credits rolled. Amazing! Don't miss it!"

","SLIGHT SPOILERS NOTHING MAJOR I just saw Knowing and it was one of the worst movies i'd seen in a while. It started strong with a flashback to the page of numbers being made , then it went to Cage as a MIT professor and his son gets a mysterious page of numbers. He goes around trying to stop disasters, and never does anything. Then his kid is stalked by pale people that seem straight out of the Davinci code. They realize an impending doom.<br/><br/>It is incredibly violent at parts, but most of it is boring. He spends most of the movie looking at a sheet of paper and driving around looking worried.

","""Knowing"" is what you wouldn't expect from a Nicolas Cage-flick anymore: real good entertainment. Maybe it has to do with the fact that this movie was made by Alex Proyas, the man responsible for such dark and intriguing stories as ""The Crow"" and ""Dark City"". ""Knowing"" also has this certain darkness that elevates it from similarly themed apocalyptic movies.<br/><br/>The story plays more like a mystery thriller than your typical end-of-the-world-blockbuster... until the last moments, that is. Then the movie starts to fall apart a bit. The final solution reveals that the whole mystery about the prophetic list was more or less superfluous, which is a bit frustrating, but, hey, up until then it's a fun ride. Even the special effects don't ruin the movie. There is a really awkward moment where burning CGI-deer leave the woods. What could have been distracting and annoying doesn't really matter, because at that point the movie's got you hooked so much, the CGI won't bother you. And, of course, there are other moments where the special effects are eerily effective (the plane crash is one of the most terrifying things I have seen at the movies this year).<br/><br/>""Knowing"" is definitely not without its flaws: the not too logical story, some unintentionally funny moments of typical Cage-ness and the over-the-top-ending all prevent it from being anything else than popcorn-fodder for the masses. However, there is such a thing as a good blockbuster and ""Knowing"" is just that. In short: I really enjoyed watching this movie."
"CourageMonkey","2","69","124","25 March 2009"," Knowing when to walk away, knowing when to run...
","My goodness, where to begin. Lets just begin at the beginning. There are going to be some spoilers in this one as it is necessary to make a point.<br/><br/>A friend of mine told me this was one of the most mind-blowing movies he had ever seen. He was correct. That someone freed $50,000,000 of cold hard cash to make this cut and paste drivel definitely blew my friggin' mind.<br/><br/>I didn't have high expectations for this movie, hadn't even planned on seeing it, but I held out a little hope because I loved Dark City so much. Those meager hopes were dashed against the rocks.<br/><br/>Lets start with the first contrivance of a distant introverted young girl, Lucinda, in 1959 who hears voices. Its her idea (we learn through awkward exposition, exposition that sadly never learns to walk) that her elementary school drop a time capsule into the ground to be excavated 50 years into the future. The children are assigned to draw what they think the future will look like, the art to be placed within the capsule. Lucinda furiously scribbles a series of numbers on her paper. It is put into the capsule.<br/><br/>Fast forward 50 years.<br/><br/>October 2009. Heat wave. Indian summer. Nicholas Cage is showing his son some cosmic formation in his telescope. Without warning his son admonishes him for never listening, forgetting school events, and generally being a neglectful father. While this is done through more awkward exposition, what is more maddening is that Cage spends the entire movie being an almost overbearingly doting father, rushing to events, forgoing outings with friends and potential blind dates that would replace is dead wife. One would think that perhaps he is turning over a new leaf after 5 minutes, but his best friend informs us this is not the case.<br/><br/>Cage is an MIT professor, though we never learn what type we can only assume astrophysics. We only see him teach one class. And what would a professor, inhabiting an acclaimed technical college, in a classroom surrounded by equations on a chalkboard, images of celestial bodies, and a model of the solar system assign for his students at the end of the class? Write a paper on determinism vs randomness. Does life have meaning. In a physics class.<br/><br/>Naturally, his son is singing at the event to open the time capsule. Naturally, he receives Lucinda's paper filled with indecipherable numbers. Naturally, he brings it home when he's not supposed to. Naturally, Cage sees it. He sends his son to bed and in a inexplicable drunken rage deciphers most of the numbers, starting with the first number, picked at random: 911012889. In two seconds he discovers that it means 9/11/01 and the number who perished. Baffled and enraged he spends all night finding the dates and casualties of major human tragedies and googling them for confirmation. We won't mention that casualty estimates often very by source and more so for natural disasters and large numbers. He verifies every major tragedy for 50 years on this paper, including the event where his wife died. Except there are 3 events that have yet to occur.<br/><br/>What does an astrophysicist do with this info? Takes it to his friend who predictable tells him in copy and pasted dialogue how crazy this all sounds and he's taking his wife's death too hard. And what do the rest of the numbers mean? After half a glass of whisky he found the first date from the first set of numbers he looked at, after a whole bottle and a sleepless night he found the rest, but it took his trucks GPS product placement ad to find out the rest of the numbers are latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates. Naturally, he is at the location of the next accident just as he discovers this, a hideous plane crash complete with passengers running around covered in jet fuel and fire. This is where the audience laughter begins. It never stopped.<br/><br/>The dialogue is maddeningly formulaic, awkward, and uninspired. The acting ranges from sub par to excruciating. The story is as predictable as Wednesday's meatloaf. When Cage's son, who can hear the voices, starts writing down more numbers, even after the final revelation, Cage dismisses it as his son's impetuousness. The whole event is a contrived plot device.<br/><br/>One wonders why he is estranged from his father, a pastor, and family. One wonders why he doesn't take his discovery to the other MIT scientists. One wonders why he feels the pressing need to run headlong towards the disasters he knows will happen, only to be saved by dumb luck. One wonders whether anyone involved in the making of this film has ever been to MIT for longer than the time it takes to create B roll or has ever stood on a New York City subway platform.<br/><br/>I won't even mention the sci-fi allusions to the Christian concept of rapture.<br/><br/>In the end this movie is a spectacular disappointment. It is a fun concept amateurishly executed on every conceivable level."

","Timing is everything.<br/><br/>I saw this in a stressed state, looking for escape. I saw it in a grand old theater with large, excellently tuned equipment. I saw it not knowing anything at all about it.<br/><br/>And I loved it.<br/><br/>Yes, I know people do not like Nic Cage. And I know many were put off by the genre- synthesizing approach. But I found it engaging, narratively and visually. Spooky as getout in places. When punctuation was least expected (in three places) and from three unexpected sources, the crashes were extraordinary. <br/><br/>The first one -- a plane crash -- was more terrifying to me than the recurring nightmare from ""Fearless."" It isn't as cinematically impressive as the best complex long shots, but it was as amazing as it gets in a big budget production. The fact that there are no cuts makes the thing absolutely real.<br/><br/>There is a spaceship. Yes, it is an ET/Third Kind Encounter sort of ending, framed enough differently to matter and goof on Spielberg. But the stunning thing was the design of the thing. Its marvelous, absolutely new and deserving of wonder. <br/><br/>The end is a combination of ""The Fountain,"" ""The Fall,"" ""The Holy Mountain"" and a Chinese film about a princess whose name I forget. I am sure a reader will supply it. I thought it risky in the context but successful. The game here is one of moving not from one plot point to another, but one established location in genres to another. It takes us out of the movie world to skip among such well rooted movie types so seamlessly. They have to be familiar to work.<br/><br/>Its not hackneyed at all, using and escaping the ordinary.<br/><br/>I recommend this, but only if you can see it loud and big, and only if you have a couple decades of being profoundly influenced by the films this references.<br/><br/>The title is apt.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"MaxBorg89","6","47","82","11 July 2009"," And in the end...
","What has happened to Alex Proyas? Back in the '90s, he directed dark, edgy pieces of sci-fi/horror, like The Crow and Dark City, that didn't necessarily pander to studio or audience expectations. Nowadays, he's gone in exactly the opposite direction, first with the fun but uneven Will Smith vehicle I, Robot (which doesn't have much in common with Asimov, despite the title) and now with the Nicolas Cage-starring Knowing. Entirely bad it ain't, but boy, does it struggle from time to time.<br/><br/>Cage plays a physics professor at MIT, named John Koestler, who teaches students about the notion of determinism, i.e. the theory that everything is part of a precise, already established plan. The irony is that he doesn't believe any of that stuff since his wife died in a tragic accident, leaving him alone with his young son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury). One day, something special occurs at Caleb's school: a time capsule, which was buried fifty years earlier, is unearthed so that the new generation can see what kids thought the future would look like back then. Instead of a drawing, Caleb ends up with a page containing a bizarre sequence of numbers. John takes a look at the sequence, and quickly (?) realizes that the numbers represent the dates and body count of every major disaster of the last five decades, including 9/11, Katrina and - big surprise - the death of the missus. Three of the predictions, however, have yet to come true, so John must find a way to prevent them from happening. Additionally, he has to deal with a group of weird-looking people who are interested in Caleb.<br/><br/>If it all sounds a bit familiar, that's because it is: while the story develops on its own terms, the premise alone, coupled with the creepy atmosphere, could come from an episode of The X-Files. In case the similarities weren't clear enough, the writers have even replicated the Mulder-Scully dynamic in the shape of John and his reluctant partner Diana (Rose Byrne) and added the inevitable religious subtext, which is hinted at from the very beginning (John's dad is a preacher). Also, the Strangers look kind of... In short, it's the sense of déjà vu that brings down most of Knowing: the third act is very easy to guess, the father/son relationship is sketchy, yada yada yada.<br/><br/>And yet Proyas manages to get some things admirably right: the tension is actually pretty consistent, with a few professionally delivered jump-scares along the way, and the visual effects are state-of-the-art, most notably in the impressive central set-piece which - a true stroke of genius, this one - is depicted in a single, continuous shot. Additionally, Cage's performance is one of his most convincing in quite some time. Okay, so it's not that difficult given his recent body of work includes the likes of The Wicker Man, Ghost Rider and Next, but his portrayal of a man who questions his beliefs (there we go again) adds some emotional weight to the picture. And that's without mentioning the refreshingly merciless conclusion...<br/><br/>Knowing is nothing new, meaning that the few unexpected elements it contains are rapidly sidelined by textbook scripting. Still, even on an off-day Proyas manages to pull off a collection of oddly compelling images (Cage's hair not included). Not quite enough, but we already sort of knew that, right?"
"DrLex","6","56","100","27 June 2009"," Pretty good if you stop watching at 01:40:00
","There's little new I can tell you in this review, as my criticism is exactly the same as what has been repeated countless times. What I can tell you is how to watch this movie in a way that won't let itself ruin your experience.<br/><br/>It starts out really well, with a good build-up of suspense and some impressive disaster scenes. But at a certain point it suddenly gets completely ridiculous, as if the director got an aneurysm and his kids had to finish it. Because this movie is all about numbers, here are some of my own. That disastrous point is at 01:40:00 on the DVD if you're watching the NTSC version (at PAL frame-rate it should be about 01:35:54). Just hit the stop button and assume Cage crashes his car into a tree at lethal speed and the credits start rolling. That's a silly ending but believe me, perfectly acceptable compared to the real thing. The actual ending reeks of propaganda for a certain 'religion', although the director nor any of the main actors seem to have any connections to it, so it probably wasn't intentional. It may just have been a case of ""hey, we've created an awesome build-up but we forgot to come up with a good finale, so let's summon a Deus Ex Machina and lots of CGI.""<br/><br/>Well, now you're probably too curious to skip the ending anyway, so go ahead and let yourself be disappointed. Don't tell me I didn't warn you."

","** SPOILERS ** The earth will end. Some weird aliens want to take away a few children and rabbits to repopulate a planet with strange white trees and lots of pollen. Let's hope they brought their asthma-puffers.<br/><br/>And that's it. What does this have to do with the strange sequence of numbers, a plane-crash, and a New York subway train derailment that you have seen in the trailers? Well, actually, nothing at all. There is no connection whatsoever between the prophecies of disasters and the alien abduction plot that is revealed at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Who came up with this plot? And moreover, was there really not one person among the hundred or so individuals who worked on this movie who was able to stop think for a moment and say, ""hang on, the first 1 hour and 45 mins of this film have no real bearing whatsoever on the overall premise""? Because, let's face it, those aliens directly intervene and take the kids to their spaceship, by abducting them at a petrol station. This really didn't require the parents of either child to believe in, or even care in the slightest way about, the so-called prophecies. And it didn't require the audience to sit through all of those drawn out scenes, either.<br/><br/>In fact, the only practical purpose of these prophecies seems to have been to satisfy a sadistic streak in the aliens, to drive a child in the 60s mad by whispering to her until she takes her own life! <br/><br/>Aside from the incompetent storytelling (the whole ""aliens will save a few humans just before the world ends"" storyline has been done over and over), this also film excels at over-acting (Cage), over-screaming (Byrne), and over-CGI-ing (while the effects were generally quite good, was it really necessary to show a tortured burning CGI moose running through a forest?).<br/><br/>Please, directors and script writers, don't torture the audience with nonsensical drivel!"
"moviewizguy","9","87","164","20 March 2009"," Knowing is Everything...
","It's hard to give a synopsis without giving too much way, so I'll try my best: John Koestler's son has just gotten the most chilling drawing from a time capsule. It contains numbers that predict deadly events that have occurred and that will occur.<br/><br/>Brief, yes, but the less you know, the better. This is probably why the marketing of the film consists of short, mysterious scenes filled with jaw-dropping special effects yet very little on the actual plot. However, the critical reaction may make one think the mystery shrouding this film may not be good. I'll tell you now: Go watch the film if you're interested/intrigued.<br/><br/>I'm afraid the critics are wrong on this one, and painfully so. The plot is far-fetched and probably (or hopefully) not realistic but this is why movies are made, isn't it? Escapism, one says. You sit down for two hours to escape from the real world to watch something fascinating, suspenseful, and, sometimes, disturbing, yet you know it can't be true but you go along with it anyway. This is ""Knowing,"" a film that holds one's attention until the very end, bringing him or her into a world filled with some jaw dropping action scenes, with some very disturbing scenes with it.<br/><br/>""Knowing"" is different from your mindless popcorn thrillers because it isn't mindless. It's sometimes thought provoking and triggers a variety of emotions from the viewer. The film is funny when it needs to be, after having watch a very disturbing scene. The action scenes are amazing, some cringe-worthy, in a good way, actually, because it's not just ""Wow. Cool special effects,"" although there really are some top notch effects, but because they are very hard to watch. The film really pushes the PG-13 rating and sometimes pushes it so far and shot so well that I was left speechless.<br/><br/>The film also has a lot of fantastic performances, one from Nicolas Cage, an iffy actor, if you ask me but he manages to pull it off here. Chandler Canterbury, the kid actor one hopes to act well alongside Cage, also does a decent job. Rose Byrne finishes off the main cast with an equally well played role. And the movie isn't just about the action either. In some very human scenes, it may strike an emotional cord from some viewers.<br/><br/>This is not your usual apocalyptic flick. No it isn't. It has something more, something I cannot reveal without spoiling the movie, including an out-of-the-world ending that will leave some viewers talking. Alex Proyas, again, does not disappoint. There are some fantastic performances and some ingenious action scenes, especially in the way they are shot, along with a very intriguing plot. This, I'm proud to say, is the best film this year, so far, and one of the most surprising films I've ever seen. If you're very interested in the film, give it a watch or you'll regret ""knowing"" nothing about it."

","For the life of me, I can't figure out what everyone is on about with this movie. ""Knowing"" is completely unoriginal, horribly predictable, and poorly acted.<br/><br/>For starters, is it just me, or is this movie an awful lot like ""Signs""? I couldn't stop thinking about ""Signs"" the whole time I was watching this stinker. I found myself wishing that I was watching ""Signs"" instead.<br/><br/>******SPOILERS***** <br/><br/>For example: Nick Cage's character is a widower who has lost his faith in life. He believes there is no ""grand design"" behind things that happen.  ""Signs"". He has a sister that, much like Joaquin Phoenix in ""Signs"", hangs around and tries to help out. Cage's wife was killed in a terrible accident  ""Signs"". Guess what, by the end of the movie Nick Cage has found his faith again. Just in time for the credits. Can you say ""Signs"" <br/><br/>******END SPOILERS***** <br/><br/>I could go on, but I don't want to spoil the movie too much. ""Knowing"" does a good enough job of spoiling itself. If you pay semi-close attention if you are awake  if you are even in that ""not quite awake, not quite asleep state"", but your eyes are mostly open you should have this movie figured out fairly quickly. If you are one of these people whose ""jaw hit the floor"" turn your cell phone off next time. Not only does it distract you, but it is annoying to others as well. To say this movie is clichéd, would be clichéd, but honestly, I had this one figured out within 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Lasty, Nick Cage... Whenever I go to a movie that is starring Nick Cage, I try to temper my expectations. Since I see him as probably the most overrated actor of our time, it helps me to not be too disappointed. Cage really out did himself this time, however. Despite the fact that there is not ONE memorable moment delivered by anyone in this entire movie, Cage still manages to be out shone by everyone. In fact, in scenes were he is alone the props seem to have more life.<br/><br/>The one good thing about this movie is the title. It is very appropriate. ""Knowing"" means knowing exactly what is going to happen at any given time in the movie. It also means knowing that Nick Cage is going to lay an egg and paying nine bucks to watch it happen anyway. And of course it means knowing that you aren't going to get your money back even before you ask.<br/><br/>Save your money, this is one to miss in the theater. Some day when you are in the mood for a really wooden, lifeless, and uninspired performance, the kind only Cage can deliver, watch it on Netflix.<br/><br/>*******OKAY TWO MORE SPOILERS ****** <br/><br/>How is it that TWO MIT professors couldn't figure out that the numbers in between the other numbers were locations? Seriously, MIT? I thought those guys were smart?<br/><br/>And for all those posting that this movie was religious/Christian propaganda. You are half right. It is certainly religious propaganda, but the religion in question in my opinion is Scientology. Christians don't believe that aliens will show up just before the end of the world to take some precious few to ""start over"". That's Scientology. There are a few references to Christianity, sure. However it appears to me that they were thrown in to lend credulity to the otherwise ridiculous plot. After all, it wouldn't do for there to be a L. Ron Hubbard paperback lying on the nightstand during the ""climactic"" mobile home scene. So throw the Holy Bible down there instead. Please don't blame the Christians for this bomb. We are talking about Hollywood after all, not the Vatican."

The ambition here is pretty staggering by the end.<br/><br/>Having just seen this, I predict viewers of it will fall into two camps: unabashed love or extreme dislike save for a few scenes (the plane and subway scenes come to mind). How you accept the final third will determine which camp you are placed in. I was confused by Ebert giving it four stars and then hearing others whose opinions I also often agree with eviscerate it, but after seeing it this makes total sense.<br/><br/>I fall into the unabashed love category, and absolutely did not expect to going in.

"Karlamon","9","13","20","5 January 2011"," Suspenseful and unpredictable
","Knowing is a unique and gripping end-of-the-world science fiction experience that creates suspense in an engrossing way. It's compelling storytelling and slow but tense pace made it a very enjoyable movie for me.<br/><br/>The film starts with an interesting premise about MIT professor John Koestler (played by Nicolas Cage) who receives a strange ""drawing"" from a time capsule dug out at his sons school. This time capsule contains drawings done in 1959 from students predicting what they might see in 50 years time. The ""drawing"" he receives apparently contains numbers which somehow is linked to disasters in the past and it predicts those in the future (and possibly the end of the world).<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie as much as I did with other disaster/sci-fi films such as War of the Worlds and 2012. However, there are some qualities I found rather interesting and better than other movies. Many of those other films have non-stop action and destruction and are pretty predictable but Knowing tries to be different from them. This film gave me suspense because of its slower pace and unpredictable sequences. It made me wonder was going to be the fate of humanity and this (along with a strange alien plot twist) kept the story interesting.<br/><br/>Knowing's presentation was another reason why I found it suspenseful. The score creates a dark and creepy atmosphere and there are only a few (but exhilarating) action sequences that will surely give you tension. Also, I found the acting to be less over-dramatic than in other disaster films. Nicolas Cage does a good performance for his character and shows to be more calm and relaxed compared to other protagonists in the genre.<br/><br/>If your looking for suspenseful flick with and a good blend of disaster and science fiction, then I highly recommend this movie. It's sure to leave you shaken. ""A-"""

","I wish I had a way to give this movie a rating that would show how awful I think this movie was. I ended up seeing it yesterday after a friend and I went to see ""Taken"" and it was sold out. I haven't gone to a theater to see a Nicolas Cage movie for a long time and now remember why. I truly detest his on-screen movie presence. The beginning of the movie, with the time-capsule premise, was intriguing--I've always liked the idea of time capsules and what gets found in them. This movie was a bad mix of awful acting, sloppy story-telling, mixed metaphors, really bad acting, pseudo-Christian propaganda, 2nd-rate CGI, and really awful acting--yes, I know I mentioned the acting several times but it was just that bad. Nicolas Cage gets increasingly difficult to watch the older he gets, using his stern face to express emotion and his ""puppy dog"" eyes to show his sadness. How an alcoholic atheist(cue the laughs) is converted to believing in something more than randomness and then willingly gives up his son just made me groan with disbelief. When I saw the house that this morose professor lived in, with it's peeling paint and wallpaper, I knew it was supposed to represent something but never did figure that part out. This is a bad mix of the ""Left Behind"" movies and every other bad science fiction movie in the last decade. Please, Nic, you've certainly made enough money in the last decade making bad movies...don't make any more."
"the-movie-guy","7","29","52","17 March 2009"," Knowing the future and changing the future is not easy
","(Synopsis) In 1959, Lucinda Embry (Lara Robinson) is a student at a newly opened elementary school. Lucinda's suggestion of inserting a time capsule into the ground at the school's dedication ceremony to be opened in 50 years was the winning suggestion. All the children in Lucinda's class drew pictures of what they believed would occur in the future except for Lucinda, who wrote rows of random numbers on the entire page. In 2009, the time capsule is opened and the new generation of students is given the envelopes with the pictures inside. Lucinda's envelope ends up in the hands of Caleb Koestler (Chandler Canterbury). Caleb's father, MIT Professor Astrophysicist John Koestler (Nicolas Cage), looks at the numbers and doesn't think anything about it. Then he accidentally stumbles on what the numbers mean. The encoded message predicts with exact accuracy the dates, death tolls, and locations of every major disaster during the last 50 years, and three events that have not yet occurred, with the last one being destruction on a global scale. John Koestler believes that his family somehow plays a role in these events, because his wife died in one of those events, and his son was chosen to get Lucinda's prophecies so he could learn the truth. John believes that by knowing the future, that he can intervene and prevent more destruction from happening, and therefore, change the disastrous results.<br/><br/>(My Comment) The movie starts off with the mysterious little girl hearing voices and writing numbers on a sheet of paper, then eventually hiding in a broom closet scratching the door with her bloody fingers. This gets you ready for the extraordinary movie that you are about to see. Unfortunately, it takes a little time before the story gets back to the mystifying beginning. Nicolas Cage's character is depressed and still mourning his wife who was killed in a hotel fire. This builds the human interest part of the movie and the protection and love he has for his son. Once he unravels Lucinda's secrets, the story is off and running. The action scenes were well done, and the stunning special effects of the three disaster events are fantastic, especially, the subway crash that was over the top. It is an original movie that is surprising with lots of twist and turns and an unforgettable ending that you will not expect. (Summit Entertainment, Run Time 2:02, Rated PG-13)(7/10)"

Normally, a Hollywood blockbuster would have the hero knowing all the answers and riding in to save the day. Can Nic Cage do it, and how? The lack of predictability is its major strength. His understated performances were made for this film.<br/><br/>If you're in the right mood, you must see this. I've seen this film 8 or 9 times, and it's only been out 9 years, so it must be doing something right. Even when I know every line of the film it still drags you in each time it pops up on tv.<br/><br/>Yes, there are some cheesy moments, with some obvious CGI, and the middle third loses track somewhat, but the relentlessly downbeat tone shows what can be done with the right budget.

","This movie goes from good to absolutely horrible faster than any movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Tho the conclusions that the movie leads to should have probably been easily guessed early on in the movie based on a lecture Cage makes for his college class containing various inaccuracies and a setup for the conclusion that the movie will try to lead you to.<br/><br/>The lecture is regarding determinism and ""random chance"". He states that the world is either one way or the other and then goes on to attempt to define each.<br/><br/>1). He states that determinism means there is purpose, but this is incorrect because as far as we know only humans can ascribe purpose to things(like how we ascribe purpose to a glass for holding fluid). Just because there is a causal relationship between one thing and another does not mean that cause has a purpose. If you trip and fall, sure the thing you tripped on is part of the cause of your fall, but there was no purpose ascribed to what you tripped over. If you were to look at it beforehand, it had no reason for being there. It is in hindsight that we desire to find a reason, and attempt to understand by ascribing a purpose. The movie assumes an originally ascribed purpose, which is the primary flaw in the entire line of reasoning of the movie, and it is of course not addressed in the movie considering it is a religious movie in disguise.<br/><br/>2). He states that the alternative to determinism is random chance, and he even mentions ""random mutations"" as if to put evolution by natural selection as part of the opposing side of his previously declared dichotomy. This is again absolutely incorrect because evolution is deterministic, there is a causal relationship between the change in allele frequencies. If you accept determinism it is absolutely absurd to state that mutations in an organisms are actually random.<br/><br/>Keeping this incorrect idea of determinism in mind, the movie continue to conclude/assume an original purpose ascribing being(God) and goes through various religious symbolism(Sin, Angels, Heaven, Noah's Ark, Adam and Eve). And in the end concludes that they are fine with dieing because they are going to a better place(Heaven).<br/><br/>I really wish movies like this would not hide that they are religious until the end like this one.

","SPOILERS HERE - In very many ways this is a rewrite of ""Childhood's End."" If you're familiar with the novel, the aliens in the movie are the Overlords, who, as caretakers of a dying Earth, await the final moments of the planet's existence to take the world's children to another place. It is not Eden (definitely not Clarke's intent). And, similar to ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" also based on Clarke's writings, the children are prepared to master a new home, one they will be able to understand and prosper in. The film can be interpreted in many ways--one of its great strengths--and though wings can be imagined by the wispiness of the aura surrounding the aliens, these individuals are but representatives of a culture intent on, if you will, protecting life and intelligences. That the children are willing to go--and Dad senses the deeper meanings of all of it--points to a pervasive, yet silent communication to humans (or many of them) by the Overlords. Remember, too, that people in many parts of the world were, in one way or another, preparing for the space ships; many of them left Earth at the same time. The non-Eden place featured alien plants, and a tree with nary an apple. The bunnies gave comfort to the children, and, symbolically, pointed to a rapid and gentle population soon to appear.

","CONTAINS MASSIVE SPOILERS...PLEASE DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.<br/><br/>Best film of the year so far.<br/><br/>To say this film is an emotional shot to the gut is an understatement. I sat frozen, literally, with chills (literally) running up and down my spine at least 5 times in this film. The disasters are real, they are devastating and they are scary. What this film has to say is scary. I think there was more to the screenplay but for time constraints, they had to leave some out. I'm not sure if this film affected me because I have a lot of the same problems that John (Nic Cage) does in the film, or if because I don't think that we are all just random particles, but here with a deadline to life, a finite one, or if the movie just affected me because it was harrowing and the finality of it just blew me away, sorry for the pun.<br/><br/>What separates this film from many or all other disaster films, is that in others of this ilk, there is a solution. Drill a hole in a giant meteor and we are all saved. Kill one of two meteors and we are mostly saved. Walk from Philadelphia to New York in three hours during a blizzard and we are saved. Armageddon this is not. The ideas in this film are different and they are ballsy. People get engulfed in flames. Mothers die while their kids are kidnapped. The Earth is scorched and incinerated. Kids are taken from their parents. Animals are shown burning up, people crash in an aircraft and they burn in front of your eyes. There are so many against the Hollywood protocol scenes in this film that I am shocked that the studio talking heads allowed some of the plot to take place.<br/><br/>Nic Cage is a fantastic actor when he has the right role and this is a perfect role for him. He has the unbelievable task of trying to figure out what he can do to save himself and his child and possibly the rest of the world. And this takes wide eyes, looks of disbelief and reaction of pure and unabashed terror and horror. He accomplishes this beautifully. The shot in the trailer with the plane coming down, and his reaction, is what got me into the theater. What you don't see is his reaction after the plane crash. He is on the precipice of insanity, hopelessness and bewilderment. He is a scientist, so how can a list of numbers from 50 years ago predict the future. It kind of goes against everything he is taught and now teaches. This is perhaps his best performance since Leaving Las Vegas.<br/><br/>Knowing might not be for everyone, but for me, this is the best film of the year so far. Alex Proyas has blown me away with his touch and the script writers have made an uncompromising and unflinching film about The Apocalypse. There are those who will say that the ending ruins it for them. But if you look at the ending as one possible Adam and Eve type scenario, then the ending is the most thought provoking part of the film. For those who don't like it or get it (I know how pretentious this looks when someone writes this, but for once, it is actually true) you should see it again. There are all kinds of questions raised when watching the film and there are even more to think about once you begin the drive home. This is not a simple film or one that will leave you quickly and quietly. And for those who complain about the ending, try to look at it without a jaded eye. The ending is perhaps the most intriguing part of the film. Adam and Eve. Genesis. The beginning of life all over again.<br/><br/>Knowing is the best film of this short year so far and it will make my top 10 for the year.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

Figuring out how these kids know these things and what the numbers mean is really what the entire movie is about. The performances are pretty good from the two leads. Byrne and Cage both turn in believable performances. I think that the script was average, the writers did their job, it's nothing spectacular but it suffices. The idea of the movie was very interesting and it's executed well for the most part. There are some parts of the movie that do feel kind of lackluster but they pale in comparison to the ending and how interesting it turns out to be.

"Screen_Blitz","7","4","5","27 July 2017"," Alex Proyas's doomsday piece boasts a chock full of interesting concepts and sleek special effects to make up its fundamentally flawed climax
","This science-fiction thrill piece starring Nicolas Cage in the protagonist role is a film blooming with brainy concepts on science and religion, while hanging over apocalyptic themes that pay reminiscence of other end-of-the-world flicks like 'Left Behind'. After all, the key figure in the story is revolves around what appears be a biblical prophecy, although the spiritial theme only serves as a small undertone here rather than driving the storyline. Director Alex Proyas, the father of projects such as 'Dark City' and 'I, Robot', exhibits his grandeur of visual stimulating style that manages to triumph over its compelling, if somewhat flawed plot. Proyas is successful at making the thought-provoking ideas work, even if they are occasionally little rocky. The only major flaw is lies in the final act that borders on the line of preposterous. It is not a groundbreaking piece of work for the genre, but it is just enough to warrant for a sweet recommendation. This film opens up in 1959, at an elementary school where children are given the assignment to draw pictures of what society will like fifty years from that time. One girl, Lucinda Embrey (played by Lara Robinson), draws a long series of seemingly random numbers and places the paper in the school's time capsule. Flash forward to fifty years later, a nine-year old Caleb Koestler (played by Chandler Canterbury) and his class open up the time capsule, and Lucinda's paper is found in his hands. When he shows the paper to his widowed father John (played by Nicolas Cage), an astrophysics professor at Massachutes Institute of Technology, John believes the numbers are enigmatic codes to disasters occurring around the globe. Enlisting the help of Lucinda's daughter Diana (played by Rose Byrne) and granddaughter Abby (also played by Lara Robinson), John must encrypt the message of what seems to be a sign of a global catastrophic event. <br/><br/>Some may question whether Alex Proyas is trying to deliver a cautionary tale about an apocalyptic prophecy or is pinning viewers with complex ideas of science and religious theology. Both are more than likely doubtful, especially when the plot shows little respect for the laws of science to begin with. Nonetheless, it keeps things deeply eerie and grim in terms of storytelling and tone, almost bordering the line of a psychological horror thriller. Caleb and Abby are children who are haunted by mysterious entities, resembling the alien creatures from 'Dark City', who introduce them to terrifying visions of the world facing mass destruction, an eerie, yet shocking concept that is placed with sweet visual spark in one scene where the former looks out his window and sees the forest engulfed in flames. The main protagonist in the story however, is John Koestler who is infused with a performance by Nicolas Cage that can only be described as acceptable, but not bad. When Koestler learns of the terrifying secrets behind Lucinda's prophetic message, that is when the story kicks into gear, allowing Proyas to experiment with his engaging concepts. His attempts at breathing life into his ideas are mostly successful and set room for some visually electrifying sequences such as devastating plane crash that leaves several victims flailing in flames and a subway crash that racks up an enormous death toll. However, the third act, which is predictable and sets up with heavy emotional sigma, is a little absurd; especially if how unrealistic the characters behave to such an unnerving situation that is on the horizon. Shouldn't they be more terrified? On the bright side, the audience is blessed with a riveting score by Marco Beltrami to settle the tone.<br/><br/>Knowing is a compelling doomsday-themed piece with a chock of interesting ideas of science and religion put into play, and a surprisingly enthralling execution by Alex Proyas who brings his powerful visual grandeur to the game. It is a flawed picture with an execution may have a few scars, but not enough to make it a sore to sit through. Don't expect it to be anything revolutionary."

","I mean True Terror in a good sense. Some scenes in this movie are actually horrifying both psychologically, and visually. Two scenes that stand out the most are the plane crash scene and the subway crash scene. The plane crash scene starts off normally with there being a small car collision that is blocking a highway, and nick cage goes to investigate. The police officer assures cage that there is nothing to worry about, and then suddenly, the police officer's face fills with terror and runs away yelling at everyone to get down. When cage turns around, he is shocked to see a commercial aircraft banking down on a descent and hit a power line on the way down. Everyone ducks for cover as one of the wings of the airplane drags across the highway flipping cars with debris flying everywhere. Then finally the plane lands and explodes into a large fireball. Cage runs to the crash site to try to help people, during which he sees people who are on fire, people who are screaming, and more explosions. The way this scene is filmed is especially what makes it so terrifying. There seems to be a darkened filter over the footage along with some rain. Also, the camera angles add to the darkness effect since the scene is shot like a terrified bystander is holding a 500$ camcorder that keeps zooming in and out and shaking the camera as he or she walks."

","I like these types of films and enjoyed this one as well. Its not the best film of this type I have seen but its still worth watching. <br/><br/>Basically The main character who is played by Nicolas Cage has a son and one day he brings home a sheet of paper with a load of numbers on it. He got the sheet of paper from a time capsule that was buried 50 odd years previously by students who went to the same school. Cage is fascinated by this and discovers the numbers point to previous disasters that have happened throughout the world. He then realises some of the numbers point towards possible future disasters. I wont say any more as its best to watch the film. <br/><br/>The plot itself is relativity strong but does have a few minor flaws. There is a fair amount of mystery and action in the film as well. <br/><br/>I would recommend this film especially for people who like films such as 2012 or the day after tomorrow."

Let me say that I did enjoy the movie and the special effects are great but throughout the movie, and especially the ending, it is a propaganda poster for Scientology. The tenants of Scientology are there including auditing numbers, the end of the world, aliens, motherships and the tree of life.<br/><br/>The boy and girl who ""hear the message"" are permitted to join the aliens on their mothership and are taken away from the earth before the earth is destroyed (as in revelations) to the main alien word.

","You're talking to a guy that owns 2 35mm Movie cameras and a sound rig whose best reason for not making a film is not having a worthwhile script. Perhaps we could say conversely that a good reason for not writing a script is not having a worthwhile film to make of it?<br/><br/>The story premise here was great - young prophetic girl makes cryptic predictions encoded numerically and they get buried in a time capsule in 1959, to be unearthed 50 years later... oh, the possibilities!...which get unearthed and perused by a guy who teaches astrophysics at MIT, no stranger to numbers, he. Once this is accomplished, you can forget about this monstrosity of a film. Guessable? I pretty much guessed the ending about ten minutes into the film and if you saw ""Deep Impact"" so will you. Apocalyptic predictions? Telescope? Astrophysics? Duuuuh. What first promises to be a suspenseful film quickly becomes formulaic and sophomoric.<br/><br/>I gave it two more stars for special effects, and these are wonderful, if you can painfully endure the film. Cage looks like he stopped in the wrong studio that day, that's how miscast he is. The young actor who plays Caleb is wooden and unconvincing. The Abby/Lucinda girl was one of the best performers and had few lines. Some of the bit actors turned in better performances than the stars. I pity those young people who got cast in this film hoping for a break and ended up in this groaner of a movie.<br/><br/>The whole premise of the ""Strangers"" who pop in and out was ridiculous. Unfortunately these four (as in Horsemen? Double DUH) 'characters' are needed for the ending, which was welcome but entirely laughable. Once the predictions are unearthed, it seems the movie just borrows every cheap device they can, from ""DaVinci Code"" to ""National Treasure"" to ""The Matrix"" with a bit of ""Deep Impact"" and a dose of disaster movie mayhem. Even the special effects scenes get old, the train scene is way too long and obviously is extended to burn screen time. And like the train in the scene, this movie derails, jumps the tracks, and destructively skids out of control .<br/><br/>The continuity is a mess, so many things are left hanging for too long, so long that by the time they're tied together you just don't care. There's a sudden quick cut (when cage takes the blackboard and puts it on the wall, towards the beginning) that I thought was going to be part of one of those ""jump cut"" scenes but its not followed by any others and ends up looking like an editing mistake. Terrible!<br/><br/>The cinematography is really good, what a shame! Some of these scenes were hard to shoot and came off well but were edited poorly.<br/><br/>All in all, I left wondering if those last numbers Lucinda scratched in the wall were the Release date of this film and the number of casualties...which miraculously coincided with the number of cast. A real waste of time."

","Not only does this movie get points for being brave,but it also gets kudos for shedding light on a modern version of the rapture.

I still don't know how the writers meant or wanted to tie the numbers/logic into the plot other than an opportunity to give science a place in the Bible. But the ambiguity in the ending satisfied my query.<br/><br/>I honestly feel that the movie equally satisfied myself, a believer, as well as my date, a non-believer. I left the theater understanding the film to be one of the best depictions of the book of Revelations. While, my date left the theater with the understanding that there may be other planets waiting to be inhabited and cultivated. They even linked the Egyptian/Pyramid phenomenon in a interestingly, somewhat logical, way to the rebirth.<br/><br/>...I digress, it's a great movie.

","Despite what a few less informed critics will say, this film is very well done. The film requires the ability to think outside of the box. An understanding of certain standardly held scientific ideas and a little understanding of theology will increase a viewer's appreciation of the film.<br/><br/>The plot twists were frequent, and so well handled that the film managed to surprise me at the end, which is no easy feat for film makers. It is not a typical disaster film, it is not a typical sci-film, but there are elements of both in the film. Elements that play against one another, producing a final product that will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>The music score was well done, and while the music was nothing like John William's work, I sat there thinking that William's would have appreciated it.<br/><br/>Special effects in at least three scenes were handled so well that I, and the viewers around me, gasped and jumped. Something cinema has not been able to make me do in years. On the negative, there were a few scenes that seemed to fall between the cracks in terms of special affects, but they were short and quickly dismissed from your mind as you moved forward.<br/><br/>I suspect the ending is what caused the negative comments. As a person who knows the theological history connected to the film, I thought this added to the film. Those who don't understand the theology will, most likely, hate the film."

","First off let me say that although I'm a little biased when it comes to Nicholas Cage movies (absolutely loved ""Con Air""), he hasn't been coming out with the same types of movies that once blew your mind. That said I must say that after watching this movie in theaters, I walked out and literally said to my friend ""That was probably the greatest movie I've ever watched in my life"". I understand not everybody is gonna feel the way I feel but I almost didn't watch this movie because I read the review on Yahoo directory. Let me be the first to say those guys don't know the first thing about a good science fiction flick.<br/><br/>The movie itself: The pacing was just right, like a thundering locomotion it started slowly and built itself into an unstoppable juggernaut towards the denouement.I thought the casting of the movie was great. One of the many faults of the movie according to online reviews were that Nicholas Cage only displayed about 2 facial expressions and emotion during the movie. While this is not true, would you really care about how big of an array of emotions you are displaying to your audience if the world was coming to an end? The cinematography and special effects were good albeit not spectacular, it gets the job done, and done with style. The plot twists and turns along with a stellar music score and sound effects makes the movie frighteningly heart-gripping.<br/><br/>I thoroughly, thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I have never written a movie review before but this movie prompted me to spread the word and share with you a sci-fi classic for the the generation. Don't let online reviews deny you from watching this masterpiece. The ending is a real treat, trust me."

"Samiam3","7","19","36","13 July 2009"," Shocking
","When I first heard about this, I dismissed it as another special effects oriented piece of Hollywood junk, but when I heard that it came from Alex Proyas, the skilled Sci-fi director behind The Crow and Dark City I gave it a shot. Well It's certainly not junk. Up until the ending, Knowing is a well paced, fairly emotional and very startling picture.<br/><br/>The premise is based around one of the greatest scientific controversies, whether the universe is random, or if things happen for a reason. Nicholas Cage is John Koestler, an astrophysicist, a widower and a highly depressed man. On the day of his son's graduation, the school digs up a time capsule buried fifty years ago. Inside are dozens of envelopes containing student's illustrations of what the future would look like. John's son brings home one of the envelopes, but instead of a drawing inside, there is a page full of random numbers. That night John discovers a sequence in the numbers, which reveals a deadly fact. Something with the potential to the whole planet.<br/><br/>From the look of things, It feels like Alex Proyas is desperate to make the biggest natural disaster film of all time. It is certainly one of the most complex. The elaborate plot does not harm the flow of the film too much until the concluding twenty minutes which are visually stunning but ridiculous and quite irrelevant to everything that proceeded it. <br/><br/>The film is absurd yes, but it's darkness was strangely compelling; almost in a Twilight Zone kind of way, Knowing is a film I would recommend if you seek a sci-fi film that is more mystery than action driven."

There were no plot holes to this film, which initially made me love this movie in the first place. One thing I love about this movie has to be after I watch it a couple of times- I actually notice little hidden things in the climax that ultimately lead up to the ending, things you don't typically notice when you first watch this movie.<br/><br/>Those who love the indie film-type endings, or those who love horror or slasher films, or actually anyone who likes cliff-hanger endings- this might not be for you. But if you love apocalypse type movies, or are a thriller fanatic then you'll hopefully like this movie. This movie also supports the Christian/Catholic faith- so if you are against it in any way- this movie may not suit you. With that said, it's NOT a Jesus loving movie. The ending has a lot to do with the Christian faith and if that's not for you- don't watch it.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a pretty spectacular movie.

However, the outcast girl Lucinda (Lara Robinson) writes a series of numbers instead. Fifty years later, the capsule is open and the boy Caleb Koestler (Chandler Canterbury) receives her letter. When his widower father and professor of MIT John Koestler (Nicolas Cage) glances to the piece of paper with numbers, he recognizes dates and coordinates of the major global disasters in the last fifty years. Further he identifies that the numbers are the key to everything and together with the last date, it is written ""EE"" – meaning Everyone Else.<br/><br/>The refreshing ""Knowing"" is one of the best (if not the best) movie about apocalypse that I have seen. I am a fan of Nicolas Cage, and the intriguing and human story is very well constructed and disclosed in an adequate pace and supported by good performances. The unexpected conclusion is both pessimist and optimistic, depending on the point of view of the viewer. In the end, we all will die, won't we?

","John Koestler (Nicolas Cage), a professor at MIT, knows which side of the debate he falls on when he teaches his students about choices. Are they random or determined? Stuff just happens, he tells his class. He tries to live his life accordingly. When he's not teaching in class or taking care of his partially deaf son, Caleb (Chandler Canterbury), he drinks away his sorrows. He's unhappy that his wife passed away in an accident and has taken a passive seat on the life bus. Although like everyone, he wants desperately to know that life isn't a waste, his highest goal has become keeping his son ""safe."" If stuff just happens, he won't let anything happen to Caleb by keeping him home.<br/><br/>One day, something happens which challenges his beliefs to the core. His son's school is opening the time capsule a class buried in 1959, 50 year ago. Each student gets to open a letter from a student describing the future. Out of all the letters possible, Caleb gets the most disturbing one, a letter covered with seemingly random numbers. During one of his typical drunken stupors, John studies the numbers carefully and decides the same thing that Richard Dreyfuss did in Close Encounters: ""This means something."" Of course his confidantes all think he has lost his marbles, so John must seek out the truth in an alternate way. He finds a fitting colleague in the somewhat creepy, somewhat attractive Diana (Rose Byrne), who has a connection with the original creator of the letter Caleb opened from the time capsule.<br/><br/>This is a suspenseful story, part science fiction, part thriller, which will challenge viewers to decide what they believe in the aforementioned debate. And unlike the sensation we find in some suspense stories, viewers won't have to suspend much belief to go along for the ride. John's journey happens step be step, each event happening in perfectly logical order. Is John creating his own story or is he just following the steps laid out for him long ago? Much of the story is laid out in cold, muted tones. We see how cold John's life is through the lens of the director's camera. When the tone finally changes to warm and bright on the screen, and it is oh so glorious to behold, we understand that John finally knows what he needs to do and is able to do it with 100% of his heart."

","Knowing is one of the greatest and most surprising films of the year! Nicholas Cage's performance is surprisingly good; he fits the role as a teacher, he's believable as a father, and he soon sends out emotion and anger as the film progresses. On top of that, the plot is very interesting and well-executed; every other scene, there's a twist that comes about, I never see it coming, and it all builds up to an absolutely beautiful ending! The disaster scenes were thrilling; just knowing how much Cage's character has to go through is something I can connect to. The film overall is intelligent, dramatic, and surprisingly thrilling.

If you're someone who stays glued to the TV screen watching the usual sort of mindless dribble that is dished out to the mainstream TV audience, this film is probably not for you.<br/><br/>The one clue I will offer is that this is sort of what ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" could have been, although I did like that film as well, and Keanu Reeves was the perfect choice for the part in that film, in its modern remake version.<br/><br/>But ""Knowing"" truly is unique.<br/><br/>People who are scared of thinking outside the box, and like to stay safely ensconced in the world they were trained to believe in, in many cases will not ""get this"" - that's to be expected.<br/><br/>But for a very large and growing percentage of the population who are beginning to take a serious look at what our history on this planet might have been, and what many are now trying to understand in this context, this film does walk the viewer down a path that leads to areas of thought that are quite timely.<br/><br/>This was a well crafted example of the art-form - two thumbs up!"
"Simon_Says_Movies","8","16","31","25 March 2009"," Take it for what it isn't
","When a film could have succeeded on tension alone, you know you have a solid film. And when a director can infuse a possibly exasperating or awkward premise with such atmosphere and a sense of impending dread, you know he is the right person for the job. What you will never expect however is the though-provoking and uncompromising direction this Sci-Fi mystery will take you.<br/><br/>Director Alex Proyas, like an Edward Zwick, is a master of the intelligent action film; a movie that ripples with philosophical undertones, morals and begs to have deeper questions answered. Like his previous works, I, Robot, The Crow and Dark City, Proyas is able to harness and combine his directorial skills with his own intelligence and knack for chilling atmosphere to make his films much more rewarding then straight up actioniers like Wanted.<br/><br/>When I say uncompromising, I do not mean such in every vein of Knowing, perhaps I mean unrelenting or unflinching, as Proyas' vision truly stretches the boundaries of the PG-13 rating, and I had actually take a double take on the marquis on my way out. This leads me to the following statement which is quite bold, but is not an iota less true. There is a scene in Knowing, you have seen it on the TV ads, that is the single tensest, most disturbing and unyielding segment I have ever witnessed it cinema. The special effects, certainly for the modest budget, are stunning and to those who say otherwise are either needlessly comparing it to Transformers or are just looking for a way to slander the film. Three effect heavy sequences perforate the film and they are all awesome, not it the surfer lingo way, but awe-inspiring, mouth agape, drool drippingly spectacular. <br/><br/>For the first time in a review I am going to forgo the plot description as you have seen what needs to be seen on the ads, and anything further I say would tarnish the unexpected revelations that conclude this film. As such I will remark upon the acting. Nicolas Cage is finally back doing something I can be proud of following some bland stints in the National Treasure sequel, Next and Bangkok Dangerous and is believable as the everyman and his wound-up trademark acting style is perfect for the scenario. The child actors, Chandler Canterbury and Laura Robertson are very good as well, and it continues to come as a surprise as to the number of skilled child stars working today. Rose Byrne as Cage's ally in his quest is remarkably effective and franticly alarming at times, concluded perfectly with her characters arc.<br/><br/>Knowing embodies the stark opposite of the advice you normally hear about movies these days; to ""take it for what it is"". Take Knowing for everything it isn't, for everything it doesn't spell out, for everything question it asks, for every seemingly bizarre revelation that breaks forth. I urge you to mull over Knowing after returning from the theatre, as this film asks important questions and you will be sure come away with far more than you could imagine; knowing isn't everything but trying to figure it out, is.<br/><br/>Read all my reviews at: www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"

","This movie appeared promising. Alex Proyas is a great director. ""The Crow"" and ""Dark City"" are nothing short of masterpieces, and even ""I,Robot"" was decent for a Will Smith action flick. Proyas has been known to mix genres well too (see ""Dark City""). ""Knowing"" looked like a good mix of sci-fi, horror and disaster-movie action, but it ultimately came off as forced, stale and ham-handed. The plot was utterly pointless (the numbers never really served a purpose because there was no way for Cage's character to save anyone with the information he was given). By the time men in black were coming for the children, and Cage and Byrne find the Biblical imagery in the trailer, the ending became very predictable. There were many unintentionally hilarious moments when it was supposed to be serious. The acting was mediocre. Unless the presence of other spaceships suggested that the aliens had chosen children from different parts of the world as well, the fact that two Caucasian children were the only ones chosen restart the human race was mildly disturbing. I give this film a 4 because it did have an intriguing beginning and kept the audience on edge until around the middle of the film. The music and the effects were all right too (though the usage of the main theme from the Allegretto of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 was overdoing it a bit)."

The story was not terribly unique, but moved along at an appropriate pace, and I found myself peeking around for clues and allusions. The story loosely follows some sort of Biblical story, and although I studied Bible in college, I was uncertain as to what some these allusions referred to (particularly the very last scene).

The latest disaster flick, ""(Insert better title)"", is a run-of-the-mill, shallow, yet paradoxically serious attempt to show us how ""everything"" happens for a reason. However, out of ""everything"" it had to be *reported* disasters within the U.S. Since the U.S. is the only country in the world, all disasters must happen in the U.S. for this plot of a movie to be cohesive.<br/><br/>The premise is mildly enticing compared to what else is at the box office, but the execution is poorly done. Proyas can deliver eeriness, but he can't evoke emotion in his movies. Armageddon had 50 times more emotion tugging than this shallow attempt. It would seem logical for a disaster movie to be emotional when centered on a family. All it is a few of Dark City ""strangers"" making cameos and Nicolas Cage running around as a dimwit father trying to save the world.<br/><br/>The movie is outlandish, poorly paced, poorly written, adequately directed.

What made me think about the movie really was that how stupid can a guy with catastrophe prophecys in his hand be, to directly head straight to the hitting point (aeroplane crashes, Metro going crazy!). Yeah. The guy really wanted to be down there, and not just once. <br/><br/>I could poor my heart out on this one but I'm drunk and can't cope with the English so sum up: There's millions of hungry people out every where and it's an insult to throw money away to such garbage as this one is.. The director and the leading act must have been high to adabt to such a hollow acting within a script that is not only an entire lack of logic but with imagination too. the scenes are set manipulatively for you to think otherwise. <br/><br/>And for all you miserable teens! Unhappy endings won't necessary make art films!"

","Attending a Saturday night screening for Knowing in its second weekend of release I noticed that the theater was fully packed. My first thought was that since it is a Nicolas Cage movie and from the commercials and previews looks to be pretty blockbuster-action style stuff happening that it might make for a good weekend night viewing. But as the movie went into its last couple of reels I had to wonder: did these folks really know what they were getting into here? Did they realize beforehand, and approve, of how much Knowing takes its BIG plot points and some of its themes from Revelations and Genesis? Or that for most of the running time what's going on takes such a giant leap from science-fiction into conspiracy-nut territory? It's hard not to talk about what happens in the ending, but I may have to by the end of this review. First a summary: a widowed MIT professor (Nicolas Cage, a usually good actor looking faker every movie with his cropped plant hair and plastic surgery) looks at a page that his son got from an ""unearthing"" of a Time Capsule that an elementary school left underground for 50 years to be discovered in present day. The page is just numbers, but there's a pattern. It's freaky: the numbers signal catastrophes (i.e. 9/11 with 2996 people dead), and it leads to other possibilities, such as what the other numbers that seem to not pose any kind of meaning at all mean - and it leads, eventually, to Cage discovering what it all leads to...<br/><br/>Yup, you guessed it, end of the world. Not just Earth but all planets in the our solar system. The frustrating thing though in Knowing is that for at least a short while there is some promise in the material. Sure, it's kooky to see Cage going through all those numbers like a nut - it makes the Number 23 look almost reasonable in comparison - but Alex Proyas, the director, makes things tense and strange and possibly leading to something complex. In fact the first half contains a relatively awesome sequence: Cage is stuck in traffic and an airplane crashes right across the highway, and he runs through the wreckage with people burning and flailing about and it's all in one shot. Some may not notice that it is all in one shot, which makes it all the more remarkable a feat of direction (the visual FX are compelling too); it's practically Children of Men amazement in terms of a single visual demonstration of a nightmare on film.<br/><br/>But then as more of the plot unfolds - it would appear as if the grown-up kids from Twilight are after Cage's son, not a good actor at all I should add, for some reason and even give him a vision of hell that is half nifty and half bat-s*** crazy, and it also involves a small black stone - it becomes silly in some part (it doesn't help that Cage has moments of total calamity as an actor like when he's swinging the bat wildly or is totally bland in quieter scenes), and in large part just... I don't know what. It's leading to something that should be either a wild revelation or so preposterous that it makes the last four or five of Cage's movies (i.e. Wicker Man, Ghost Rider, Bangkok Dangerous) look sane and easy in comparison. Turns out, you'll either be in awe- and you know who you are (i.e. Christian wackos, Rogert Ebert)- or scratching your head.<br/><br/>I was in the latter, but there's some sliver of me that wishes I wasn't just nearly losing it, laughing in my seat while everyone else was calm and accepting what was going on in front of them. There is some potential here to become a camp hit, something that would give the Mystery Science Theater guys a run for their money with the commentary. But it takes itself so seriously, and also has some scenes and sequences of actual good, intelligent direction from Proyas and his FX crew, that it turns into what it is: another Nic Cage movie mess that ends on such a note to make both Danny Boyle and Darren Aronofsky raise up their pitchforks and scream ENOUGH! LEAVE THE SUN AND THE TREE OF LIFE ALONE! If you're looking for it to be something totally wild and unhinged at least for the last quarter you'll get your money's worth. If you're looking for another masterpiece from the director of the Crow and Dark City (or for that matter Cage's big-budget comeback), look elsewhere."

","Watched this on TV yesterday, not expecting (or hoping for) more than a couple of hours of straightforward scifi/action. After only a few minutes in I started to become ""suspicious"". The main character having named his son Caleb and having trouble with his relationship with his father (A priest), I suspected the usual dribble over religion/faith etc. The first 1/3 of the movie was kind of boring and the middle had some entertaining/exiting scenes, but in the last third the religious allusions get heavier and heavier before the ""climax"" at the end with out of this world angels and the garden of eden and all the trimmings. This might work for some people but definitely did not do it for me. In addition to the above the movie doesn't really go anywhere, so that combined with an abundance of religious luggage and possibly the worst and most ridiculous ending in the history of endings make this a movie I would stay well clear of."

Were they the Guardians of All Things Ecologically Good On Earth? Or just Alien Busybodies who had to stick their noses in?

I'm so sick of writers using the death of a parent or spouse as a reason to excuse the odd behavior of the main characters. I couldn't relate to or sympathize with Nic Cage's character or his son. Not to mention that his son was one of the stupidest child characters I have seen yet in a movie.<br/><br/>What's one word I would use to describe this movie: Forgettable. The concept of world tragedies being predicted is great. The story could have gone in many directions but don't let such information fall into the hands of an alcoholic Nic Cage.

It's a movie that demands you wear a dunce cap.<br/><br/>And you must continue to wear that dunce cap all the way through this movie 'cause that's the only way you'll ever have any hope of getting anything worthwhile or of any value out of Knowing's 50 million dollar, intelligence-insulting story.<br/><br/>And, would I dare contradict myself and say that Knowing's story was actually something of a thought-provoking experience? Well, yes, in a sense I would say that it was ""thought-provoking"" in that if you really start to actually think about the sheer idiocy of the events taking place throughout its overlong story you'll be absolutely astounded if you're able to make any coherent sense out of it all.<br/><br/>Yeah. That's how Knowing provokes thought.<br/><br/>And, with that, I'd definitely say that Knowing has got to be one of the deadest ""dead-end"" Bible/Noah's Ark/Adam & Eve stories ever made. This film's story goes from potentially hopeful to utterly and pathetically hopeless faster than any other movie that I've seen in a might long-long time.<br/><br/>Even before the time-capsule of 50-years-prior had been ceremoniously opened and Lucinda Embry's puzzling page of orderly number-sequences was brought to the attention of Prof. (ha!) John Koestler (M.I.T.'s finest? Ha!), Knowing had already fallen flat on its frickin' face.<br/><br/>And, speaking about Prof. (ha!) John Koestler - Like, was this stupid jerk really for real!? I mean, it was bad enough Koestler offering his eager students at M.I.T. his ""s-h-i-t happens"" explanations when it came to his clueless theories on evolution, or whatever - But, he was also a terrible role model as a single parent.<br/><br/>I mean, let's face it, this big suck was obviously an alcoholic (for good reason, of course) and his dysfunctional relationship with his 8-year-old son was clearly on the rocks in more ways than one.<br/><br/>And, speaking about actor Nicolas Cage - I'd say that a good part of Knowing was completely ruined by his grate-on-your-nerves presence. This twit's a total doofus of the highest order.<br/><br/>I had always considered Ryan Gosling to be the ultimate asswipe, Hollywood actor, but, after witnessing the atrociously bad performance by Cage in Knowing, I now proclaim him as the new reigning King of Asininity, bar none.<br/><br/>Anyways - I could certainly go on and on here trashing Knowing and its ""black rocks"" nonsense, and its laughable ""animals-on-fire-running-out-of-the-forest"" effects, and its truly anti-climatic Earth destruction scene, and its putridly stupid alien angle (did you happen to notice that there were no ""female"" aliens?).....<br/><br/>But, all I'll say in closing (just to get this review over with because Knowing's disappointment-factor has really p-i-s-s-e-d me off), is to say that director Alex Proyas really deserves a good, swift kick in the ass for foisting this absurd, inane and preposterous piece of ""prophecy"" garbage on us as the unsuspecting movie-audience.

","This film takes an interesting premise (an old hidden document foretelling the future) and destroys every bit of its potential with ludicrous plotting, laughable dialogue and poor direction. How can a $50 million movie go so far astray? ""Knowing"" ought to be used as a teaching tool in film school. It's a sobering reminder that spending money guarantees nothing. There was literally no point at which I wasn't aware that I was watching a very bad movie. <br/><br/>Cage has never been less effective, although I'm not sure how he could have overcome these obstacles. The little kid was too precocious by a factor of ten. I'd rather watch some old Shirley Temple movies than watch kids THIS clever, verbal and adorable. Maybe we should blame all of this on The Sixth Sense. The performances are generally overwrought, and the plot itself... I was laughing out loud at the Noah's Ark stuff. The adorable albino rabbits were the perfect closing touch. This film was made for morons who probably find Hallmark cards too cerebral.<br/><br/>The one star in my rating is for the F/X. The scene of the airplane crash and aftermath were very well done. Indeed, there are some very disturbing images in the film. I'd say this is one to keep the young'uns away from. But even F/X can't bale out this junk. I'd rather have seen that $50 mil budget turned over to 100 deserving young filmmakers.

","Watching the teaser trailer will pretty much sum up the entire plot for you, as is expected with all Nicolas Cage movies. Man find page with numbers. Numbers mean something. Man tries to find out what the problem is. Man is thought to be crazy. Man is correct - ha! to the doubters. Just swap ""page with numbers"" to ""map"" and you have the exact same synopsis for two of Cage's other blockbusters <br/><br/>Knowing starts off with the most boring credit sequence in the history of film. Just names over a weird overly ominous score. We then get a bit of back-story as to the origins of the numbers. Turns out some creepy kid wrote them for a time capsule which will be dug up in fifty years. The children, whether they lived fifty years ago or in the present day were far to excited about the time capsule. If this was the movies version of reality then I knew I was in for a tough evening. Once the back-story finishes we were then treated to another boring credit sequence. This time we got the ominous score and the names going over what looked like someone messing about on Google Earth with a dodgy internet connection.<br/><br/>We are introduced to Cages character John and his son Caleb. Cage apparently lectures at MIT but he, his class and the audience have no clue what he is rambling on about. The only thing that is clear is that EveRy SinGle SyllABle Must BE ProNounced when he teaches. At home he and his son are dealing with the upsetting loss of their wife and mother who has be deceased for almost a year - long enough for wallpaper to peal of the walls, the garden to become overgrown and the house to decay at a rapid pace. Its clear who took care of the upkeep and maintenance of Casa De Cage.<br/><br/>The film maker doesn't drag out the time capsule story for too long and this I honestly thank him for. Caleb gets the page with the numbers and John finds the page and within seconds sees that the numbers are predicting all major disasters from the last fifty years. If you think it appears ridiculous reading that you should see the scene where John has to explain it to his MIT colleague<br/><br/>The plot as awful moves on and we meet Diane and her daughter Abbie, who like Caleb is beginning to hear whispers. They serve no purpose plot wise whatsoever although Rose Byrne does get praise for the most hysterical performance of the year so far - she was one frantic cry away from ""wont somebody please think of the children"". <br/><br/>Whilst all the number excitement is going on there are four weird guys, who can only be described as the Pet Shop Boys and Spike from Buffy's strange love children, are stalking John and his son. They are creepy for the first few times we see them but then their constant staring and seriousness becomes unintentionally funny.<br/><br/>They finally kidnap the two kids and we are all grateful as we realise we are heading towards the end. We follow John as he chases after them into an overgrown wood, he calls frantically for the return of the his son, who appears out of nowhere holding a big white bunny. . Turns out the four ""Spike Shop Boys"" gave him the bunny as a gift and they are all going with them to be safe. I forgot to mention that the sun is going to flare out and kill us all. That is the last thing that the numbers predicted. <br/><br/>Anyway it turns out John cant go as he cant hear the whispers. Then all of a sudden a big spaceship appears, the four guys literally melt into green aliens and as Nicolas Cage drops to his knees in an over dramatic fashion in disbelief the audience nearly starts to cry along with him. The four aliens, who have very obvious Angel Wing type shadows, two kids and two bunnies all go off into space as the earth dies, taking poor John along with it.<br/><br/>We do get a ""nice after earth is destroyed"" scene with the two kids in white clothes running through a CGI corn field towards a big CGI tree which I am assuming is supposed to represent the tree in the Garden of Eden. Or something. By that stage I think I slipped into shock at the sudden, and unexpected introduction of aliens.<br/><br/>The movie was awful. The entire cast was awful. The acting was awful. The script was awful. I want to meet the person who wrote the alien ending, shake him by the neck and as ""Why?"" I will admit though that the two set pieces - the plane crash and the subway crash, both of which used the ever-present threat or terrorism to cheaply were actually quite good. We were also treated to some fantastic Cage overacting during the crashes and him trying to emote afterwards which almost makes it worth it.<br/><br/>I would give the movie 3/10. It gets the points for the two set pieces. It loses the rest of the points for everything else being so awful. It has topped the box office and that is due to the appearance of Nicolas Cage - an actor who has been living on borrowed time, phoning in the same old performance for years now. Even playing the always fun game of watching his wig, his weird elbow powered run or his genuine inability to act isn't fun any more and that is the saddest thing about the whole movie.<br/><br/>One thing that will keep me awake at night is the bunnies! What is the significance of the bunnies?!"

But even if you bypass this scientology product placement the story is still full of holes, like can somebody explain me why Lucinda had this premonitions, to then let them be sealed away for 50 years. Or why has caleb the urge to again write down this numbers at the end, can somebody just tell me why they were written at all if at the end the aliens still have to kidnap the kids to bring them to the location (oh yeah forgot already scientology)? And i liked the fact that major traumas in kids like loosing your parents can be easily fixed by just giving them a fluffy white bunny. The same with Cage, your kid just left you with some Alien/Angels + the world is about to end but hey lets have a little nap on the ground. Why the stones whats there story? Nice was also that apparently caleb was able to switch off the voices in his head by turning of his hearing aid. Do people in America always leave there keys in the engine at gas stations? And our brilliant profesor is able from a random list to extract dates and number of victims (remarcable at least) but then fails to see the rest are coordinates. And so on and on.

","What a truly disgusting film.<br/><br/>I did realize that this film was going to go down a conspiracy style path. The silly numeric message from the time capsule buried in the 50s by the protagonist's son confirmed that. OK its stupid but I can dig stupid if it fuels a fun film. And for the next 45 minutes or so the plot trundles along in a suspense filled manner. The initially odd incursions by emo men in black was offset by a decent scene with a plane crash.<br/><br/>Nothing special up to that point but also nothing that offensive. I did start to suspect that I was watching a stealth M. Night Shyamalan film. Now that did worry me as his films always irritate me having that same decent suspense build leading to a stultifyingly childish ending. If only.<br/><br/>No, Alex Proyas has gone one further. Obviously not satisfied with a typical Shyamalan ending he takes it to the next level. Now I am not certain exactly what religious extreme he is pushing towards here. Be it scientology or some other generic rapture/ufo nonsense. But in brief within say the last 10 minutes of the film the strange visitors turn out to be aliens/angels and take the ""chosen"" children off to start again.<br/><br/>Now I am of no religious denomination personally but I don't think that has that much of a bearing on how much this film irritated me. There is no resolution of any of the plot devices used to build suspense. It seems the sheer fact that aliens/angels are involved is a de-facto resolution of any questions you are left with. And further the overt religious ending is at odds with the bulk of the film that honey traps you into a sucker punch propaganda ending.<br/><br/>Now I have watched plenty of films with heavy aliens/god themes and while I may not personally believe these things if the film is enjoyable I have zero problem with them. But the experience of this film irked me on two levels-<br/><br/>1. The ending is deeply flawed and lazy which renders THE WHOLE FILM an un-satisfying mess. I disagree whole heartedly with comments such as ""good film, bad ending"". Bad ending=bad film.<br/><br/>2. Not only is the film dreadful on an artistic level but by the closing credits I felt like I had been subjected to a 2-hour indoctrination into some scientology/rapture/ufo cult/religion/whatever.<br/><br/>At least Mel Gibson's religious vanity vehicle was clearly flagged as such."

","I went to see the Knowing expecting a cross between the X-Files and Ghost Rider. I left feeling drained. The movie starts off with a satellite photo slowly zooming in on the house where John Koestler, a depressed teacher at MIT is cooking hot dogs for his son. Even from the beginning, the movie grips you and doesn't let go. Even though the film was shot in Australia, it captures the tension and excitement of major cities like Boston and New York perfectly. Nic Cage gives one of the best performances of his career as we watch him slowly degenerate after he discovers a code that eventually leads him to believe he knows that the world is about to end in several days. My only complaint is the ridiculous albino aliens and that entire subplot that was almost completely unnecessary to the story. They ceased to be interesting as soon as they are shown to be supernatural. I've read several reviews that criticize the end scene. Personally, I thought this was the best part of the movie. As soon as it's revealed that the world really is going to be destroyed in the solar flare, I knew that all of the characters, at least the adults, were going to die but it didn't spoil the movie for me. The part when they're frantically packing and heading out of town was extremely suspenseful and including the Emergency Broadcast added to the realism of the movie. I thought the end was nicely tied together with Nic Cage returning home to his parents and sister amid violence and rioting and embracing them as the flares hit. The final scene where the cameras pull back to show a burning earth from outer space tied the beginning with the end very nicely. This movie isn't for everyone, but I enjoyed it, mostly because it raises important questions about our own mortality.,"

The characters increasingly are called upon to do the dumbest, craziest thing you can think of, while the actors go at every line with a heavy-handed seriousness, which would work if the movie made an ounce of sense. Instead, Cage and Byrne just look like they're trying too hard. The worst is the ending, which jumps the shark into flat-out parody of itself. How anyone thought this ending was the best they could have done is a mystery to me. During the screening I had the idea that this movie could have had the intense paranoia of ""Arlington Road"". Instead it does the laziest and most senseless thing every time."

","Atheists be aware: yet another bible-preaching supernatural thriller in the disguise of Science Fiction. The Bush era has certainly left its mark on Hollywood productions like The Sign, I am Legend, and now this. <br/><br/>First half of the movie is enjoyable, with thrilling suspense and spectacular special effects. The disaster scenes are quite amazing. I would have loved the film if it stayed within the boundary of god and ghosts and witches and fate... Unfortunately, it decides to venture into science, namely, aliens and spaceships. <br/><br/>Take the art from Matrix, The Abyss, throw in a bit of Bible description, now we have the look of aliens. ""But we don't know what to do with them, boss?"" says the writer. So let them stand and stare. Let the spaceship rotate endlessly with its hypnotizing CGI charm. So, with Apocalypse looming, Nicholas Cage seems to have a world of time saying goodbye to his kid. Call me cruel, but I completely missed out on the touchiness of it because I was laughing hysterically at the fact that: according to the aliens, our genius MIT professor - supposedly a valuable human specimen, is inferior than 2 bunnies.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this movie to creationists, especially families with young kids who tend to skip Sunday school. The implication of Noah, angels, and prophets, etc, are hard to miss. At the last sequence I fully expected to see a snake and an apple... Then the joke would be complete."
"Michael-70","10","14","30","2 July 2009"," Thoughtful, Intense and Intelligent, But Still Emotionally Satisfying.
","The biggest surprise about Knowing is the fact I liked it a lot. Because a film containing prognostications of major disasters, coupled with science fiction and horror elements and leavened with unsubtle religious allegory is generally the kind of film I would avoid like a dose of the clap.<br/><br/>Except for the major disaster part, this does not sound like my kind of movie. Especially since the main character, a grieving MIT professor is played by the ever-eccentric Nicholas Cage.<br/><br/>Yet I believed he was smart enough to teach at MIT and that he was devastated by the recent death of his wife in a hotel fire and that he is now struggling with the challenges of raising his young son as a widower. <br/><br/>Knowing begins in 1959 at an elementary school about to bury a time capsule slated to be opened fifty years hence. All the kids are asked to draw a picture of what the year 2009 will look like and among the various drawings of space ships, jet packs and rocket cars, one creepy little girl named Lucinda (Lara Robinson) writes out a list of numbers, filling an entire page.<br/><br/>Fifty years later, in 2009, the time capsule is opened and John Koestler's son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) finds himself in possession of the paper with the numbers on it whose meaning is a puzzlement to all.<br/><br/>Later that night, as a drunken Koestler looks at the numbers a little closer, he makes tenuous sense out of this grouping – 911012996 – which, if you put in the right dividing punctuation, looks like 9/11/01–2,996 or, September 11, 2001 with the 2,996 being the official death toll for that horrible day.<br/><br/>With this key in mind, the meaning of the ""random"" numbers now pops out like a revealed text. These numbers correspond to the dates of major disasters since 1959 including everything from Chernobyl to Lockerbie.<br/><br/>Even more frightening, at the end of the page, there are numbers for future dates; and I mean dates only a few days away. John is stuck with a dilemma, he believes he has foreknowledge about the date, location and death toll for some future disaster.<br/><br/>Naturally, his family and MIT colleagues discount his theories. It seems John Koestler has truly become a male Cassandra; cursed with an ability to see into the future, but with a complete inability to get anyone to believe him.<br/><br/>We get a taste of what this means when John is speaking with a highway patrolman while stuck in traffic, when suddenly, an airliner in trouble comes whizzing in low and crashes in the field next to the Interstate.<br/><br/>Later, another disaster is seemingly confirmed by this paper when John is witness to a particularly horrible subway crash that he was equally helpless to prevent. Yet, while all of this is happening, there is another subplot showing some strange humanoid figures that always seem to be in the background behind John and Caleb.<br/><br/>Caleb also has haunting visions of the Earth in flames and this coincides with an unusual amount of solar flare activity and Knowing seems to be implying that we are quickly approaching the end of the world as we know it.<br/><br/>I recognize that this becomes a tough pill to swallow for many people who have been enjoying the thrill ride that Knowing is giving them. It means you now have to shift your narrative perspective to include a larger and more all-encompassing ontological philosophy. I would normally be troubled by this shift in a film's point of view, yet Knowing adroitly manages to show us the more fantastic narrative elements at the same time as the Nicholas Cage character John Koestler experiences them.<br/><br/>So, as John Koestler began to grasp the larger dimensions of what was happening to him and to realize that it didn't comport to his current notions of reality, Koestler had to make a philosophical shift and I made the intellectual leap along with him.<br/><br/>Like John Koestler, I didn't fully understand exactly how the bizarre things that were happening were actually happening, but I could not deny the reality of them happening.<br/><br/>So, when it came time for John to say his final goodbye to Caleb, I was wracked with tears because I knew young Caleb had to leave with these aliens who, while scary at the start of Knowing, have since become the benevolent saviors of humankind.<br/><br/>If my last few paragraphs seem like I am talking about a different movie than Knowing, I understand your confusion. All I can say is that Knowing tries one of the most risky and difficult gambits for any movie, it undergoes a complete shift in tone and story, but it works here.<br/><br/>I have no doubt there will be people offended by the plot convolutions and semi-religious imagery that mark the denouement of Knowing. But in my lifetime of movie going, I have frequently found that some of the most memorable films to me personally are the ones I can't easily categorize.<br/><br/>Knowing crosses several film genres and will probably displease the die-hard fans in each of them. Sci-Fi lovers will find it too much like a thriller. Thriller lovers will find it too much like a horror film. Horror lovers will find it too scientific. Scientifically minded people will find it too religious and religious people will hate it because it doesn't exclusively promote whatever religion it is they believe in and to top it off, the whole thing reeks of crappy New Age ideology.<br/><br/>Still, I found Knowing to be a compelling, visually stunning, dramatically interesting and narratively challenging film and I was totally taken to a different world created by film-making professionals who clearly knew what they were doing.<br/><br/>And that is an all too rare experience at the movies today."

The movie took a turn at the ending that I wasn't expecting at all, and I love whenever a movie can trick me. If it can trick me, it's a great movie, because usually I can predict everything about a movie.<br/><br/>I went to see the movie in the first place because I love Nicholas Cage and I loved National Treasure. Of course, I thought the movie would be similar. It was National Treasure-meets Final Destination--meets Noah's ark. It was very eery at times, and it creeped me out, but again, that's a good thing. I have never felt such an emotion at a movie before. Maybe a little for I Am Legend, but not that intense."

","A very strange and disturbed girl has the idea for a time capsule to be placed on school grounds to be opened by the children of 2009 to see what the kids of the Eisenhower era in 1959 thought their future would be. When it comes time to put her contribution in however, young Lara Robinson just comes up with a page and a series of meaningless numbers.<br/><br/>Meaningless to everyone except physicist Nicholas Cage who is one of the parents present in 2009 when the time capsule is opened. They prophesy a series of disasters including what Cage horrifyingly realizes could be the end of the world itself. <br/><br/>At the same time some mysterious strangers seem very interested in both Cage's son, Chandler Cantlebury and Lara Robinson playing her own granddaughter. What their interest is not even a renowned scientist like Cage can figure out.<br/><br/>The ironic thing is that what would bring about the end of the world has nothing whatsoever to do with our behavior environmentally or with any mad terrorist act. It's the arbitrary whim of nature itself and the frightening thing is that also Knowing isn't going to help mankind one single bit.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage does a fine job covering the ground between concerned scientist and concerned single parent. There's also a bit of spiritual journey for him when he reconciles at the very end with his minister father. <br/><br/>As for the mysterious strangers, they've got quite an answer to things which there's no way I'm going to reveal.<br/><br/>Knowing has a mixed message between rational thought and spiritual searching that can be interpreted in a lot of different ways. It's a film people will be debating for years about."

I feel like this movie had cutting edge cgi for 2009. The last ten minutes dropped this from what could have possibly been a 7 if I was feeling generous. No one will ever read this. I am a lonely person. Ahahahahaha, a hahahaha, aaaahahahaha!!!"
"gregeichelberger","4","12","25","21 March 2009"," Could have been so much better ...
","I had very high hopes for this film, after viewing the several trailers that were produced, but once again I walked away quite disappointed in this ""Signs"" meets ""Close Encounters"" meets ""The Number 23 "" meets ""National Treasure"" hybrid mixed in with a generous helping of Prozac.<br/><br/>But when the premise of a film is the possible end of the world, there are few laughs and very little wiggle room with the conclusion, and that is the main problem here.<br/><br/>Academy Award-winning actor Nicolas Cage plays John Koestler, a professor at MIT who has previously lost his wife - and his faith. Now his class lectures are filled with boozy instructions on the randomness of existence. To John, there is no order, no natural laws, no God and no reason for anything. <br/><br/>He also drinks - a lot.<br/><br/>His 9-year-old son, Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) has inherited his father's disposition (but not his alcohol problem - yet), although to be fair, the tragic loss of a mother would do that sort of thing.<br/><br/>The film opens in 1959 as a local elementary school is burying a time capsule to be unearthed in 2009. The children in Miss Taylor's class eagerly render drawings of what the world would look like 50 years from their time. All the kids created robots, spaceships, jet packs and other quaint examples of science fiction from the era.<br/><br/>All except the creepy Lucinda (Laura Robinson), who appears totally spaced-out (like Dakota Fanning in ""Hide and Seek"") and, to prove it, writes a series of numbers instead of a drawing.<br/><br/>Fifty years later, Caleb is now a student at the school. When the time capsule is brought up, the present-day students are all given a cartoon created by the original class. Of course, Caleb gets the list of numerals.<br/><br/>He then begins having nightmares and hears whispering voices. This makes him even more depressing than he already is. Meanwhile, John notices something about the pageful of random numbers. Soon, like Cage's character in ""National Treasure,"" he is able to decipher that they are lists of the world's major disasters over the past five decades (although it includes the fire that supposedly killed John's wife, along with 47 others; this hardly qualifies as a ""major"" disaster compared to tragedies which wiped out hundreds or thousands of people).<br/><br/>John tries to tell a colleague about the list, but naturally the guy pooh-poohs him. But, after an airplane crash right over his head, John is convinced that something is amiss. Reading the numbers, he comes to the conclusion that there will be a terrible accident in New York City and - viola! - there is.<br/><br/>Now there is something even more threatening on the horizon, so John hooks up with Lucinda's daughter, Diana Wayland (Rose Byrd, ""The Dead Girl,"" ""28 Weeks Later"") and her laconic daughter, Abby (who happens to the same actress that played Lucinda - a cheap, unnecessary device).<br/><br/>After this, a series of plot complications come together so fast that few people can keep up without a scorecard. Caleb and Abby team up to become the world's youngest and most lethargic tag team; scientists discover that another sun may collide with our Sun; there are a group of German post-modern models following the kids all around; Rose takes the children from John and tries to hide them is a cave; her car is stolen; and John tries to patch up things with his pop, a minister of some kind.<br/><br/>When these plot lines come together, however, there are things flying around and severe eye damage and head trauma may occur. Needless to say, the conclusion of this movie is one of the cheesiest and goofiest I have ever witnessed. What the director, Alex Proyas (""I, Robot""), calls ""hope,"" I call ""schlock.""<br/><br/>It was a film that could have been so much better. The idea is very intriguing. The concept of a person from the past conjuring up numbers that are links to disasters and events taking place in the future and effecting an individual should have made a better movie.<br/><br/>One of the main problems is the pacing, which has been slowed down from 45 to 33 1/3 RPMs. No one is happy and John's character drags everyone down with him. Yes, I know his wife died (presumably about five years before), but all he can do is drink and occasionally cook hot dogs for his equally sad-sack of a kid.<br/><br/>While Cage phones this one in, the acting of the two children is just plain atrocious. I know they are young, but there is precedents of child actors doing a fine job - but not these two. Rose Byrne's performance is nothing to write home about, either. <br/><br/>Several subplots then go nowhere, making us wonder why they were even brought up in the first place. The most glaring of these is when John calls Caleb's school to find out (for SOME reason) who the two custodians were who dug up the capsule. The voice on the other end of the phone explains that this is ""classified information"" (what?!) and the subject is never brought up again.<br/><br/>There are some decent qualities about ""Knowing,"" just to be fair. The plot is interesting - before it flops all over the place; the CGI work is decent; and the jet crash is one of the most realistic and horrific ever put on the screen. It actually gave me chills because I've been in several rough flying situations.<br/><br/>Overall, however, without one gleam of light or hope and no one really to root for or relate to in this picture, it's an exercise in gloom best left for viewing in one's own home, after a really disastrous day or to cheer someone up after a funeral or two."
"grdeer-1","3","12","25","20 March 2009"," What a waste
","Lots of us have participated in the burial of time capsules (my high school graduating class, the Y2K celebrations). It certainly is an interesting hook. It is a nice start to a plot that flounders and becomes unredeemable in The biblical references to Ezekiel, Pentecostal and Baptist doctrine,two by two into the ark and the Rapture weaken the movie overall. Most of the viewers won't get the references anyway. I found this resolution to an interesting premise weak. Introducing the mother and daughter more than half way through the action does not help the plot. More development and information about the Lindsay character would have helped, as well as more attention to John's estrangment with his dad would have done more to support the biblical references. The subway accident was well done. But over all a waste of time and celluloid."

Knowing was and is a mess, anything Nicholas Cage touches, it turns to dirt. <br/><br/>The buildup for the movie gave hope in how a end of the world movie would be, but it's not the beginning or middle, it's the ending that had me confused and baffled. The movie basically was saying that the world is ending and how more or less children are our ""salvation."" But what really was happening was a mess and confusion. They combined elements from different movie aspects and made it appalling. I do not recommend this film to anyone or anything."
"GethinVanH","Null","4","6","4 July 2009"," Redundant
","Roger Ebert called it ""the best science fiction movie ever made"". It just happens to be made by the director and writer of Dark City, Alex Proyas, who is a friend of Ebert's. Roger Ebert did an audio commentary track for Proyas for the movie Dark City.<br/><br/>Ebert is off his cancer meds if he thinks this movie is good. It's another unhealthy dose of religious propaganda from Hollywood. I was sickened by I Am Legend which turned the great original Matheson story into a religious propaganda piece.<br/><br/>This movie is an original screenplay so it's less annoying but still a religious propaganda piece. It's hard to give reasons why without completely giving away the plot.<br/><br/>I don't mind that the religious folks make movies like this but they should be honest about it. Everyone knew that the sci-fi film Battlefield Earth was written by the father of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard. The writers of this film should have promoted it as a Christian science fiction movie. Then I could stay away and all the Christians could go to it in droves with their church. Even so, there's no science in this movie. Maybe science fiction wouldn't be the best term to use, maybe it's simply Christian propaganda.<br/><br/>The acting was also very poor in this movie. I chuckled several times when Nicolas Cage got all serious. He's a widow with a child, a scenario all too familiar for these movies. Mel Gibson was a widowed single parent in the very similarly themed ""Signs"". The movie also reminded me of the struggling single mother in ""The Sixth Sense"". Both movies have elements of psychic children. We know Cage is a troubled man who has lost his faith (Hey, just like Mel Gibson in Signs!) because there are several scenes of him chugging liquor from a bottle.<br/><br/>This movie is redundant religious crap. Don't waste your time."

","I went into this movie with low expectations based on Mr. Cage's most recent movies and wasn't surprised at all.<br/><br/>I figured with a somewhat interesting plot maybe I would be entertained... sadly I was wrong.<br/><br/>First off the acting was emotionless and atrocious. There was not one character who I felt anything for, including the children. Secondly, the plot was rushed at you in the beginning, ridiculous situations occurring immediately only to draw out slowly and uneventfully for he last hour and a half. Then a story that went from interesting to preposterous to leaving me scratching my head wondering what the hell the purpose of everything was to an ending that made me smirk, and laugh out loud.<br/><br/>And many questions unanswered. Like what was the relevance of the aliens warning the earth of events that couldn't be changed. Also, why did they only warn of events before 1959? Why did the little girl think of putting warnings in a time capsule letting 50 years of tragedies go by instead of preventing them? I thought she was a chosen one. How could Nicholas Cage change what was already predicted? I could go on for hours...<br/><br/>Then lastly the movie attempted to distract the audiences intelligence with unnecessarily over the top special effects, a drawn out UFO scene, over acting by Nicholas Cage, underacting by his young co stars, an emotionless CGI Armageddon scene and another wasted two hours of my life.

"shoolaroon","10","7","13","11 March 2013"," Great & Profound Sci-Fi
","This is such an excellent movie that I cannot help but wonder if these negative reviews are part of a deliberate campaign to bury this movie. Or the public has become so incredibly stupid that they cannot understand a truly profound film.<br/><br/>There are spoilers ahead: <br/><br/>""Knowing"" is a mystery thriller that results in the literal end of the world, in a way that might actually happen some day . A strange, morbid little girl deposits a slip of paper with dozens of lines of numbers on it, into her school's time capsule. When the capsule is opened 50 years later, Cage's son gets her envelope and Cage, an MIT scientist who has recently lost his wife, becomes fascinated by this series of numbers. He has revealed up to this point that he believes life is random, without meaning or purpose. As most people would however, he instinctively tries to find a pattern or purpose to the numbers -what did this girl mean? His attention is drawn to a series of figures that he realizes represents 9/11. He then comes to understand that part of the number string represents significant dates with mass deaths. This leads to his eventual discovery that some people CAN indeed foretell the future, horrifyingly so, but that even such knowledge, doesn't mean we can prevent it! The point of the movie ultimately is that there is both purpose and meaning in life but much of life is pre-determined. That is a philosophical issue that Cage assigns his class to ponder in their term paper - determinism vs randomness, which reflects the despair in his own mind after losing his wife.<br/><br/>Many of the ""plot holes"" really aren't. Viewers didn't understand or missed, parts of the movie. For example: <br/><br/>1. Picking only these ""white"" children. This is not true at all. Cage's boy at the end says that the aliens can only take those ""who have heard the call"". This could be children...or adults (as the original girl Lucinda continued to hear the call as an adult but killed herself in despair instead of waiting). We just don't see who else might have been saved as the story focuses on Cage and these two children. We DO see that there are MANY ships leaving Earth that could have BOTH children and adults who have ""heard the call"".<br/><br/>These could be of ALL racial and ethnic backgrounds as they are leaving different places on Earth, and there could also be adults to raise the children on the new Earth (or the aliens might have done this).<br/><br/>2. The aliens not being able to communicate or looking like Billy Idol clones. They had to adopt a relatively ""acceptable"" human disguise and they came up with the 80's punk look. No matter what they picked it would have been dated at some point and the filmmakers had to pick something that would make them stand out from ""normal"" people.<br/><br/>The aliens DO communicate...to those who can HEAR them, which probably is some kind of evolutionary leap. That is why they are only interested in THOSE people. Maybe the others are just part of why the world is so screwed up and the ones who can ""hear"" have a chance to create a different world.<br/><br/>3. Why give the future to a little girl to have it coded into streams of numbers and not tell people directly? Because the aliens DIDN'T give the information to Lucinda or people like her.....they were able to hear or intuit it in some manner and that is what distinguishes them as potential survivors for a new human race. Lucinda probably wasn't the ONLY one, but the movie had to have a focal point for the plot to revolve upon. Lucinda created this mystery as she picked up on these dates and numbers and put them into some kind of order out of chaos...which is what humans do. <br/><br/>4. Why didn't the aliens warn the world in general? Why didn't they STOP the end of the world? Because they could only take those who could ""hear the call"". Despite their advanced technology, they could not stop the solar flare as it's too big an event, nor could they take the entire human race, so some selection criteria was necessary. They picked those they thought would survive in a new world.<br/><br/>Even if they DID warn the world in general....there was nothing that could be done to change the situation or save everyone, and it would only have caused more panic.<br/><br/>Some ascribe cruelty to separating children from their parents, but this is a ""salvage"" operation, where only a few can be taken. The visions imparted to the children help them understand the gravity of the situation so they can prepare themselves psychologically.<br/><br/>5. Another criticism is that the behavior of Cage's character throughout this crisis is ""implausible"". This is ridiculous. How on earth does one behave during a plane crash....or the END OF THE WORLD????? No one knows. There could be a vast array of potential responses but the primary response that Cage shows repeatedly is the desire to save others and to prevent their pain and death. That is perhaps, the best, and most noble human impulse. Cage's actions may actually have saved lives and be part of the calculation of the death total for that event. At the end, when Cage goes to his father's house, he has become reconciled....to his father, to the end of life, to fate. For each of us, our death IS the End of the World and we must learn to accept it.<br/><br/>THIS IS A GREAT AND PROFOUND MOVIE that makes you think. It shows the end of the world, but it is a movie about faith. Those who have none and can conceive of none will probably hate it. But ""everyone else"" should give it a chance."

","M. Night Shyamalan's Signs purported that it would illustrate that everything in life happens for a reason. Knowing starring Nicholas Cage and directed by Alex Proyas, comes closer to making this argument.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage is John Koestler, an astrophysicist who is mourning the loss his wife while raising his son, Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) as best he can. In one of his classes John broaches the subject of Randomness versus Determinism, is life a series of random events that man seeks to find meaning in, or do events happen for a reason? Is Earth the right distance from the Sun for life to flourish just by chance or did some force place it there? As part of a school project a time capsule is opened at Caleb's school where 50 years earlier the students put in the capsule their visions of the future. Caleb gets Lucinda's, a strange young girl who wrote a series of random looking numbers on a page. Is Caleb receiving Lucinda's paper a random act? Or was it meant to be? Almost immediately Caleb starts hearing garbled messages from what he calls the whisper people. John discovers the page in Caleb's backpack and looking it over starts to notice the numbers correspond to dates of tragedy's and the number of people killed. He is shocked to see the date of his wife's death on the page, and that there's three more sets of numbers that haven't occurred yet. John sets out to find the meaning behind the numbers and avert the coming tragedy's.<br/><br/>John enlists the help of Diane Wayland (Rose Byrne) and Abby who are the daughter and granddaughter of Lucinda, to see if they can help decipher the meaning of the numbers. Lara Robinson plays both Lucinda and Abby and she ably evokes the strangeness of Lucinda, and the innocence of Abby so well, I almost thought they were two different actresses. As John and Diana struggle to make sense of the numbers the whisper people seem to have an inordinate amount of interest in the children and their numbers seem to be growing, but their presence isn't what it seems to be and leads to a conclusion that is at once unexpected and emotionally moving.<br/><br/>Without giving away too much of the ending, a lot of reviewers have said how they thought the ending relied to heavily or resorted to a Biblical ending. I didn't see it that way, I see it more as a case of, if aliens came to Earth thousands of years ago our ancestors would see these beings and their characteristics as being those of gods or angels, and not necessarily Gods or angels.<br/><br/>I thought Cage's performance in Knowing was moving, and at times he related the characters pain so well it was almost palpable. It seems he's returned the power to his acting. The rest of the cast was equally engaging, I've already mentioned Lara Robinson in her dual role. Chandler Canterbury is engaging as Caleb.<br/><br/>The bonus features. The making of documentary is interesting with some insight behind the production of the movie, especially in it's earliest stages. There's also a documentary the Visions of the Apocalypse which features scholars talking about the ramifications of the end of the world but it drags on a little too long. The directors commentary I found flat and uninspired as if Alex Proyas was uninterested in doing it or just didn't know what to say about his movie."

Unfortunately, we don't discover the true intention of this flick until the 3rd Act. <br/><br/>For the first three acts, I was fully engaged in the action-packed and character-driven plot line. Nicholas Cage was fat his zany best as astrophysicist John Koestler. The direction by Alex Proyas and pulse-pounding music score by Marco Beltrami provided just the right amount of dramatic build, and the special effects kept me riveted to my seat. However, at this point it seemed as though the entire production switched hands. Cage the scientist discarded his logic and reasoning, gave up his fight to save the world, and suddenly accepted the fate of mankind because he'd remembered a scripture quote from his evangelist father. Gone was the driving music, replaced by bombastic classical selections. We were suddenly inundated with biblical prophecy and symbolism, medieval religious renderings, and an in-your-face message; only those who listen to whisperings of the alien/angels will be saved and that only males can be role models."

","If you're looking to see a kick-ass movie, then I do suggest not seeing Knowing. It was probably one of the most pointless movies I have ever seen, sitting for two and some hours to see lots of death. It was more or less background music to the nap I took through most of it. Also, the biggest buzz-kill of my life, ever. <br/><br/>The movie is filled with pointless, and pathetic, foreshadowing and symbolism, which any idiot can pick up on. It was filled with some jumpy parts, some strange parts, some awkward parts, and parts where you just sit there and ask yourself ""what the F just happened?"" The ending was just horrible... I feel that the writer could have at least made it a little more exciting. But nope, still pretty ridiculous. <br/><br/>Nicholas Cage should just still to his Disney National Treasure BS because that role fits him a little better, more than an alcoholic crazed professor. <br/><br/>Then again, I am not giving much credit to the special effects that were used in the movie. Some of the scenes were pretty awesome with the graphics of the disasters. And the boy actor was adorable. So there. <br/><br/>I'll leave it up to you. Have a good time at the movies!"

","I too was affected by this movie. I saw it 4 times! I don't see movies more than once unless they really move me. There was a personal message for every person who sees it. Each time I saw it, I saw different elements that made the movie that much more meaningful. I thought it was done very well. We may rub shoulders with people that have the same gifting as the young girl and not even know it and we just think they are strange. Or we may have that type of gifting and people consider us strange. There is a purpose we are shown things that will happen in the future, so we can warn others.

","I, like many people, saw the trailers and read the blogs about the concept and story behind this movie. In a nutshell, I can sum up the writer's intent: the universe is cruel and doesn't give a rat's posterior about you.<br/><br/>Moving onward, Cage was no the best guy to play the main character and the backstories could have been fleshed out a bit more. Too much focus is placed on the ""numbers"" and Cage's character should be MUCH more skeptical of the numbers since he's this brilliant scientist professor.<br/><br/>But I must admit that although the story kept me interested enough to see it through the whole way, the last 15 minutes of the film...did the director walk off the job and they put some shlub in there to finish up the rest? I did not like the ending but I am glad that some directors out there don't always end their movies on a happy note.

I also think they could have been a little bit more clear cut in their symbolism. What with the aliens that had radiating particles coming from their backs that look strangely similar to angel wings. Are they alien or angels we're dealing with because I would buy the aliens, but angels? As critical as I am I did enjoy it for the most part. Great action, suspenseful, and Nick Cage is always good for a laugh with his poor and overly exaggerated acting. I liked him better before he was on antidepressants. At least they used a realistic example of how the earth could someday be obliterated. Also I liked the early Dialogue between Nick Cage and his son, in the film, about how many possible life bearing solar systems there are in our solar system."

","Based on my reading and observation/deep thinking, it seems like DNA/RNA were deliberately designed and then programmed into the first proto-cells billions of years ago, and then these cells were let loose on Earth, pitted against the elements and changing environs, thus leading to natural selection and adaptation. Darwin's theory of natural selection offers a very limited view of how species evolved, and any amount of thinking will clearly display that the varied forms of life on the planet could not have just arisen by natural selection from a common ancestor. THERE HAS TO BE A FORCE AT WORK TO ENGINEER THE FIRST NUCLEIC ACIDS AND THEN CAUSING DRAMATIC SPECIATION AT VARIOUS POINTS IN TIME! Please note I used the word "" Force"", since I do not believe any of the world's organized religions or their God/gods/goddesses or scriptures stand up to common, rational sense or very rudimentary science They were all made up by men/people to fill in the gaps and make sense of the world as they saw it thousands of years ago, to offer an explanation, an incredulous one, at that. For me, it is way more likely that an advanced race of beings/ entities created the "" Life Experiment"" on Earth billions of years ago, and then let the cells loose to see how this game of survival proceeds, and populations evolve. The panspermia theory alludes to this possible fact as well. I could never have fathomed that I would actually seriously consider this idea, but after much study and deliberation, it stands out as a very strong possibility to me. Kudos to the movie's concept makers for a genuinely original, possible, and maybe the true answer to the greatest mystery of life!."

"maian_magus","5","6","11","21 March 2009"," Wow. (HUGE SPOILERS AHEAD... also, potentially offensive)
","This movie surprised me. How? Well, first, it was an EXCELLENT movie. Well... for the first hour or so, maybe 80 minutes. Then horrible, horrible things happened.<br/><br/>First, the good. The effects in this movie were AMAZING- save for one scene involving a moose, which was very obviously CGI'd. Of course such a scene HAS to be, but technology exists to not make it so obvious. The scene with the plane seen in all the trailers was by far the most amazing disaster sequence I've ever seen- the power of it, the effects, the people running around on fire- it was amazing. The movie, for the first half at least, was by far the best thriller I've seen in a long, long time.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, before too long, the religious subtext set in (note: it's not a subtext at all. it's bright flashy neon sign). At first, you may find them passable- oh, he's a physicist who has grown cynical, a pastor's son- all seemingly irrelevant. Then, as the story goes on, it grows. There are mysterious men following them throughout the entire movie, for one. At first, it just seems a bit The Ring-esquire, but then, when Nick finally catches one, the guy opens his mouth and attacks him with... light. Oh no. Where could this possibly be going? Yes, indeed, to my horror, what I suspected turned out to be true. This movie, which so deceivingly lured me in and put me at awe with its awesome effects and edge-of-the-seat thrillerness, just raped me in the brain. The movie can be summed up in one word: rapture. And, with that, this movie becomes lumped with every other unoriginal movie that tries to lure people in, just to poke them in the face with the well-disguised crotch of Jesus. All of the suspense and everything builds up to a boring, meaningless, and offensive ending (which I won't actually spoil, unless 'rapture' already did that). It was an excellent movie with an unoriginal and uninspiring ending. I am, to say the least, horrified, and utterly disappointed.<br/><br/>I give the first half of this movie a 10/10, and the second half a 0/10. So, obviously, the average is an overall undeserving 5/10."
"soxpack","5","8","16","10 July 2009"," Not a science fiction movie
","Another warning, spoilers below.<br/><br/>My comment here is not so much to argue the good or bad of this movie, although my vote does give away I think there's more of the latter than former.<br/><br/>My point is that it seems odd that the major theme of the movie seems consistently misunderstood or overlooked. Now there are about a gazillion comments here so I imagine someone has brought this up, but I've run past comment after comment that either praises or lambastes the role of the ""extraterrestrials"" in the movie.<br/><br/>Because those weren't aliens, they were angels. The overarching ""hopeful"" (other than the end of the world that is) message is the existence of God. If you think about it, so much of the dialog and plot is given to pounding you over the head with it - I can't believe so many people miss it. In case you need a road map to the clues:<br/><br/>-John's father: is a pastor -John: Has no faith in God (I think sh*t happens) because of his wife's death, which is no doubt the source of his estrangement with his father. -John's wife's death is in the numbers: I think it's there to comfort John that there was nothing he could have done to stop his wife's death. Oddly (to me) he doesn't seem to get that message. -Prophecy: Biblical term especially in regards to the end of times, mentioned over and over. -The Numbers themselves: How would aliens KNOW the future? They wouldn't. God would. One of the more maddening comments was ""...how would the aliens know when the time capsule would be dug up and land in Caleb's hands?"" Well number one you're right, aliens wouldn't, only God would. But more importantly if you think about it, the angels didn't seem to be paying any mind to what adults were doing. Their job was clearly to chauffeur the kids to a new world before somebody turned on the broiler, and they came to collect the children as soon as it was time. It didn't seem to matter to them whether John or any other adult knew anything. -The drawings done by Lucinda & Abby of God also depict religious symbols, including what appears to be depictions of certain types of angels. -John gets his faith back at the bitter end when he says ""I know"" to his father's last words that this ""...isn't the end."" It wasn't aliens that gave him back his faith. -The ""spaceships"": Come on...you didn't find them just a tad ""ethereal""?<br/><br/>Anyway, this is not meant to argue the merits of the movie, only to point out what I thought was the most important message in the movie, whether it's poignant..or lame, well that's up to you.<br/><br/>But I'll end by pointing out what I think is a huge plot hole: OK, so one possibility is either God, the angels or the aliens knew Lucinda was going to bury the paper, that it would be dug up, and wind up with John 50 years later. Except for it being a plot to a movie - towards what end was this done - solely to give John his faith back? Because in the end, that is the only thing that changes. Nobody (other than the main characters) else on earth knows what John does at the time of the end, and nothing changes because he knows. <br/><br/>The other possibility is that John got the numbers by chance - which I think would be a clever and ironic twist to a movie that is going out of it's way to disprove the chaos theory. That would make sense, since I said earlier the angels did not seem at all interested in what adults were doing - they started coming for the children long before John figured out what was going on. Only one problem with that scenario. Why would the angels speak to Lucinda? It was clear that at the end only children could hear the angels, as they were to be saved. But Lucinda was not going to be saved, and obviously she was not meant to warn people about impending disasters or the end of the world, or somebody would have listened to her before she died. And remember this, although those numbers were buried, Lucinda carried them in her head the rest of her life. She could have recreated that list a thousand times, why didn't she? Well I think it's because the movie was quite pointed in asserting that nobody could change God's will. So if that's the case, there is no real meaning to what John is doing at all...it's just crazy chance that he figures it out before the world's last heat wave. But again, why would the angels tell Lucinda at all then? If John wasn't ""meant"" to get the numbers? <br/><br/>So to sum up that leaves us with two scenarios as to why all this went down the way it did:<br/><br/>God decided to make Lucinda's life intolerable so that someday one person (John), the other billions of folks notwithstanding, would get his faith back a few hours before he gets toasted. Who knows, maybe John's life was God's own personal Truman Show.<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>In a whimsical moment, either God or an angel decided to drop the bombshell on poor Lucinda 50 years early - just for the yuck factor of watching her take a long drive down insanity highway. Let the hilarity ensue. <br/><br/>I guess the producers can explain it away as that wacky and zany will of God."

Nicolas Cage is his usual, awful and boring self. There may be a scene or two with cool special effects, but that is as positive as this movie gets. The directing, the writing, the acting & production values all are beyond horrible. I watched this film with a group of people and all of us agreed.

","Wow, I read what others wrote about Nicolas Cage's performance in 'Knowing' and I have to agree. He was laughably awful in this movie. He had multiple ""Keanu Reeves"" outbursts that cracked me up. I don't agree with what a lot of critics are saying that he didn't deserve his Oscar for 'Leaving Las Vegas'  oh, he sure as heck did. Unfortunately, he's picked a tremendous amount of stinkers since then. Including 'Knowing.' Though, not a terrible movie, but it's nearly two hours (and you'll feel every bit of them) and I saw many scenes that could've been easily cut. I kept trying to calculate between 30-45 minutes that should've vanished and have a better movie to show for it. The movie is about extreme coincidences, such as a paper of numbers that indicate upcoming (well, from 1959, that is) catastrophic events that just happens to fall into Cage's son's hands. If it isn't enough that there are roughly 168 proved events on the page, they leave us with 3 ""final"" ones for the movie to unravel. The so-called plot attempts to intertwine religious and alien concepts together, but unfortunately anyone who's familiar with the Bible ""knows"" that it's heavier on the alien side and has absolutely nothing to do with scripture. It was extremely unfortunate that every time the (2009) 'Day the Earth Stood Still' aliens showed up, I had to laugh out loud. Not to give away the ending, but it was a long 2-hours when it ended on such an easy note for what the aliens wanted. And not a huge fan of Cage's 'National Treasure' series, they were a much better viewing of putting pieces together than this lazy effort of numbers."

We'll pass quietly over Keanu Reeves. Brendan Fraser has made a career, if not exactly a name, in the genre. And now we need to acknowledge that Nicolas Cage is lending his considerable screen cred to our favorite kind of flix. The question going into this TEOTWAWKI epic is whether it would be a splendid effort like Next (2007, 8) or a disappointment like Ghost Rider (2007, 5). Alas, it's a fuddled testimonial to Calvinism's doctrine of predestination.<br/><br/>50 years ago, kids in suburban Massachusetts did a bunch of drawings intended for their new elementary school's time capsule  except for 1 odd little girl, who just filled her paper with endless digits. Cut to 2009, where that paper winds up in the hands of little Caleb Koestler, son of widowed and cynical MIT professor John Koestler (Cage). Among the plethora of digits is the string ""911012996"". Now, you might think that it was the ""911"" that captured Koestler's attention, but no; he writes the string on a whiteboard and then spends some time mulling where to put the slash marks. The ""2996"" is, of course, the death toll on that fateful day, and Koestler soon discovers the dates and fatality counts of many other disasters in the previous half century  plus 3 that are slotted for the next couple of days. Every such entry is also trailed by a string of other digits, and the genii at MIT are unable to figure out at 1st what they mean. (Of my 1st 2 instantaneous hypotheses  location and junk DNA  the more obvious proved correct.) But it's asinine for a fellow prof to liken the predictions to numerology (as in The Number 23) or suggest that maybe Koestler is following in the delusional footsteps of John Nash (brilliantly depicted in A Beautiful Mind) when the numbers are so clearly related to real, and supposedly unpredictable, events.<br/><br/>Koestler tries to prevent the predicted disasters, but to no avail. Evidently it's all been written down in the Big Book in the Sky eons ago, and mere mortals are powerless before destiny. It goes on like this, getting progressively gloomier, until we arrive at an improbable ending that makes The Day the Earth Stood Still look like Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.<br/><br/>The acting and effects are quite convincing while you're in the theater, the kids are cute, and the dialog (under the circumstances) is realistic, so the flik isn't an absolute dog."

The story jumped around so much, almost like they made it up as they went.<br/><br/>It was an overall bad movie with a horrible ending that made no sense, it had no greater value, spoon-fed you the entire movie (definitely not a thinking movie), and had random parts that jumped around so much but weren't complicated enough to ever make you think, despite its intention to be an adventure and mystery movie.<br/><br/>In the end, this movie definitely is not up to par with Nicholas Cage's other adventure movies such as National Treasure or even Next."

How would he have been able to recognize dates from an uninterrupted sequence of digits? (extremely unobvious) - Yet not realize that the other numbers were locations? (extremely obvious). How did he know exactly where to find the door that the little girl had scraped with her fingernails 50 years ago - and exactly where to scrape the paint?

","Australian director Alex Proyas is best known for minor science fiction gems like ""Dark City"" and ""The Crow"" but worse known for cretinous big-budget baloney like ""I, Robot."" Proyas' predictable new Nicolas Cage science-fiction horror chiller ""Knowing,"" is a lukewarm end of days prophecy potboiler that is appropriately enough scripted by the numbers. Truly, Cage needs to make a good movie. The Oscar winning Best Actor for ""Leaving Las Vegas"" hasn't made a memorable movie since the first ""National Treasure"" back in 2005, and ""National Treasure"" was no trove. Does anybody want to remember Cage's recent labors, ""Lord of War,"" ""The Weather Man,"" ""World Trade Center,"" ""The Wicker Man,"" ""Ghost Rider,"" ""Next"" (nor entirely egregious), ""National Treasure 2"" and the wholly abominable ""Bangkok Dangerous?"" Cage's bit part as Fu Manchu in the faux trailer ""Werewolf Women of the SS"" in the Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino retro-misfire ""Grindhouse"" (2007) is about as good as it gets for the nephew of Francis Ford Coppola. Clearly, Cage either needs to hire a new agent or start looking before he leaps into some more half-baked hokum. ""Knowing"" qualifies as a poor man's ""Close Encounters of a Third Kind"" with a gloomy ending. Moreover, ""Knowing"" looks like Proyas put shrink-wrap on the camera lens. He lensed it with a video camera and the murky imagery detracts from the atmosphere instead of evokes it. Furthermore, the special effects look rather ersatz, especially the jetliner that crashes near the traffic jam while our hero is standing in awe.<br/><br/>In 1959, a Boston-area elementary school girl, Lucinda Embry (newcomer Lara Robinson), comes up with the bright idea of planting a time capsule with drawings in it that nobody will see for five decades. Little Lucinda is rather weird herself. She doesn't draw a picture. Instead, she scribbles down numbers ad nauseaum. Five decades elapse like yesterday and the school unearths the capsule and every student gets a drawing. One student, Caleb Koestler (Chandler Canterbury of ""Powder Blue""), the son of MIT astrophysicist professor John Koestler (Nicolas Cage), is handed a page filled with nothing but numbers. Dear old egg-headed dad gets soused one night and eyeballs the numerals and discovers to his surprise that the number groupings are the days when disasters occurred or may occur. Suddenly, stealthy, white-haired guys in long dark coats start showing up and giving Caleb little black rocks. By the way, Caleb has a hearing problem and his hearing device acts up. One night, a 'whisper person' materializes in Caleb's upstairs bedroom and gives him a Dantesque vision of a forest ablaze with wildlife futilely trying to escape the conflagration. Meanwhile, we learn that John's wife died in a motel fire out west while he was blowing leaves off his front yard. Now, John believes that life constitutes little more than a meaningless series of random acts, until he scrutinizes those numbers and embarks on a crusade to save the country.<br/><br/>This thinly-plotted science fiction hokum boasts zero suspense until John's younger sister Gracie (newcomer Natalie Townsend) sneaks up behind him while he is pondering the numbers and jostles his chair. This qualifies as the most frightening moment in this 122-minute movie. Meanwhile, John's skeptical MIT colleague, Phil Beckman (Ben Mendelsohn of ""The New World""), is worried about John's obsession with these figures. John explains to an incredulous Phil that the numbers correspond to the dates, sites and death tolls of every disaster in that period. Finally, Phil takes John seriously after our hero witnesses a jetliner crash when he is trapped in traffic gridlock. John realizes now that the extra numbers that he couldn't explain were GPS tracking statistics. Eventually, John tracks down Lucinda's daughter, Diana Wayland (Rose Byrne of Fox TV's ""Damages""), and they become friends. Diana takes John to a ramshackle house in the woods where her mother Lucinda spent her last days, and John uncovers a revelation under her bed that staggers his mind and turns Diana as pale as a cadaver. They realize that the coming events make the book of Revelation look like a weenie roast.<br/><br/>Sadly, the special effects are substandard. The scene where the jetliner crashes looks as bogus as is the New York City subway accident where hundreds of people die when a train derails and collides with another train. The downtime between John's discoveries will have you yawning and looking at your watch. Cage does a good job of going berserk along with everybody else around him, but the story is downright preposterous. Moreover, from the gas prices posted at the service stations, ""Knowing"" was made before the plunge in gas prices so the studio must have been shuffling this mishmash from one focus group to another to figure out an appropriate ending. Proyas doesn't generate the kind of ominous dread that the ""Final Destination"" movies furnish and the finale is depressing. Call it Crappy Encounters of a Close Kind and save your money!"

","Thank you Alex Proyas for not making Rose Byrne into Nicolas Cage's love interest for your newest film Knowing. I'll admit, from the trailers, I thought that was exactly what would happen—pretty young woman somehow falling for the crazy-haired one. It is Hollywood, so it wasn't too far-fetched to believe. But that wasn't the only surprise in this sci-fi thriller. No, the biggest one has to be the fact that it was pretty good. For some reason, despite the pretty great early track record for Proyas, I keep getting worried with each new film before being won over by the final result. Sure, this and I, Robot aren't great films, but for genre fare, such as they are, you can do a lot worse.<br/><br/>I remember seeing the trailer and thinking Knowing would be your run-of-the-mill prophecy-based plot, proving disaster after disaster until our hero can save the day. Then the second teaser came out showing some creepy, dark-clothed men in the woods—perhaps foreshadowing an intriguing alien aspect to it all. But it is with the poster that truly sets the stage for what is about to happen. Yes, the future predicting is there as the whole basis of the story is upon a two-sided piece of paper with dates, deaths, and coordinates, written by a young girl in 1959 and sealed in a time capsule for fifty years; and yes, don't be surprised to witness a spaceship or alien or two either. However, it is the seemingly misplaced image of the Earth at the center of the one-sheet, appearing to be starting on fire at the bottom that alludes to the apocalyptic theme running rampant throughout. There are just too many mentions of the sun or burning to just push them to the side as coincidence. Especially with a script so heavy in Determinism  Professor John Koestler would be so proud.<br/><br/>Speaking of Koestler, at the center of it all is Nic Cage's performance as this MIT astrophysicist. Recently widowed, he is now raising his son alone, allowing his scientific predilections take over his strong religious background. With a pastor as a father and a devote mother and sister, it is Koestler's wife's death that shows him how random and meaningless life is. There is no grand plan; everything is just a sequence of chance chemical reactions, leading more to chaos than any methodical progression. That all changes with the discovery of young Lucinda's cryptic message in the capsule, the lone page devoid of an image of what the future will hold like the rest of the class drew. Her artifact ends up being a literal translation of the future, showing the exact dates and death counts for major disasters around the world. It cannot be a coincidence then that the page found its way into the hands of his son, who subsequently begins to hear whispers like those heard fifty years previous. What is first thought to be a malfunction of his hearing aid, you will soon begin to wonder if those whispers—the jumbled sounds reaching his mind—are the reason he has the aid to begin with.<br/><br/>By no means is this thing a masterpiece. Besides the usual hammy performance we have learned to embrace from Cage, (and he was so good in Leaving Las Vegas, I guess they all become caricatures of themselves at some point), we have the very convenient story progressions needed to allow the tale to play out in a reasonable amount of time. The fact that a piece of paper has dates for five decades, yet the final three all happen within a week is a massive coincidence. But, rather than dismiss it as lazy writing, you could chalk it up to one more example of how everything happening is doing so for a reason. Everything, all the good, (marriage, a son), and the bad, (wife's death, a pretty impressive plane crash sequence), put Cage's Koestler on a collision course with his destiny, or at least onto a path in which he can help lead his boy to his. I actually enjoyed his role, for the most part, and for every cringe-worthy instance, there was a genuine showing of emotion. Chandler Canterbury does well as his son, expressing the rebellious nature of a boy his age, questioning his father's motivations and parenting skills, while also lending a mechanical aspect to instill some creepiness. If you want real oddity, though, look no further than Lara Robinson's blank stares as the young Lucinda and later on as her granddaughter Abby. Why have two actresses when you can have one play both in order to keep the familial resemblance in tact? Heck Rose Byrne does the same as Diana, the woman who believes Cage and helps him discover the true meaning of the numbers, as well as Lucinda's adult form in photos.<br/><br/>Knowing is a fun ride that ends in a very effective manner: giving me the sad ending that I wanted and hoped the filmmakers didn't copout from doing as well as the happy one giving a sense of hope for the future. As a result, the story itself becomes quite strong with it's lecturing on the subject of fate as well as the allusions to God and creation itself. With some pretty good effects—besides the plane crash carnage, also enjoy the subway derailment, something about people being crushed against high-speed moving glass worked for me—you shouldn't be disappointed if you set out to be entertained by a decent action thriller. If, instead, you wanted an intelligent script that would blow you away in its originality  well, you've come to the wrong movie. Sit back, allow your brain to be stimulated ever so slightly, and just have a good time. I just hope those kids don't eat any apples, because we all know how that ended up the first time."
"Critomaton","6","8","17","21 March 2009"," How can a movie seemingly so stupid be so thought-provoking?
","On the surface, Knowing seems like a cross between many familiar movies. There are significant parallels with Signs, Next, Deep Impact, War of the Worlds, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, The Day the Earth Stood Still, and even Die Hard with a Vengeance.<br/><br/>But clearly, the filmmaker was trying to convey a much deeper message than most (any?) of those other movies - or at least was trying to raise a few questions. How much control do you have over your own fate? How far would you go to resist the inevitable? How would your beliefs change when faced with your imminent demise? <br/><br/>While the TV series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles seems to be collapsing under the weight of trying to deal with these questions week after week, Knowing does a reasonably admirable job of holding up for 2 hours (though it does appear very shaky in a few spots).<br/><br/>This is definitely *not* the feel-good movie of the year, unless you count the very last minute and somehow forget the preceding 119.<br/><br/>This is a review for people who have already seen the movie. Stop now and go see it if you want to be provoked - I don't really recommend it for entertainment purposes.<br/><br/>Knowing is the story of an agnostic astrophysicist single father, Jon Kessler, who becomes involved, along with his son, in the unraveling of a numerological prophecy that identifies major disasters - three of them upcoming.<br/><br/>Jon starts off trying to fully understand the list, then tries to find out who is behind the list, then attempts to prevent the disasters.<br/><br/>While watching the movie, I was a little disappointed that it seemed to focus too much on Jon's attempt to stop the disasters at the expense of providing a coherent (at least for sci-fi) explanation for everything that was happening.<br/><br/>After a little reflection, I thought maybe that was the point - maybe the questions about how you'd react to these situations are more important than questions about how they come about. And the more I thought about this, the more I liked it. I also came up with a reasonable (to me) explanation for why things unfolded the way they did.<br/><br/>Knowing is as close to a positive portrayal of Christian eschatology as I would ever expect to see from a major Hollywood studio. This clearly has enraged the secular anti-theists, judging from some of the ""Hated it"" comments (atheism is passe - it seems these days it's insufficient to just be an unbeliever, you have to be against somebody who believes something). Their faux outrage is laughable considering that (a) the questions raised are universal, (b) the answer given in the film is still pretty watered-down and non-denominational,and (c) the opposite worldview is well represented in the other 99.9% of major motion pictures released.<br/><br/>Before getting to my explanation of the movie, I will now just mention a few irrelevant things I didn't like about it (here be spoilers arising incidentally):<br/><br/>Why do the angeliens (alien/angel hybrids) think that they can best relate to humans by looking Aryan/Nordic and acting like total a-holes? <br/><br/>Why do the angeliens need to drive a Ford Granada (or whatever it was) that hasn't been seen on an American road for 20 years? And to a lesser extent the same goes for the truck that hit Diana, but in these lean economic times I don't expect Hollywood to smash a brand new big rig. <br/><br/>Do subway trains in NYC really go that fast and have enough momentum to plow through cement/brick columns like they were sticks of butter? Even the ridiculous, bomb-powered train car in Die Hard 3 didn't go that far. <br/><br/>With all the deep philosophical and religious overtones of the movie, was it necessary to show me (a) every optional feature of the new Ford F-150 numerous times and (b) an electronic ad for Chevrolet being wiped out in a hail of fire and brimstone? Talk about your superliminal advertising! <br/><br/>Again, considering the subtext of the movie, some of the disaster scenes seemed oddly desensitizing to the value of human life (especially the subway scene, where people just kind of disappeared like so many bowling pins - the airliner crash was more horrific but seemed intentionally designed to evoke images of hellfire). <br/><br/>What's with all of the pet rocks?<br/><br/>Finally, why did the angeliens go to all that trouble with the list and everything when they could have just snatched any kids they wanted? <br/><br/>And here is my answer, which when I realized it, made me appreciate the movie in retrospect: It was a test of faith - the angeliens wanted Jon to give up his son willingly and the only way he would do that is if they convinced him they had powers beyond his understanding. This also reconciled him to his father and (presumably) saved his eternal soul.<br/><br/>This is not a new story, of course, but it is obviously new to many people, and offensive, and provocative. Which makes Knowing a more significant film than it would seem on the surface."
"fluffymarshmallowsandtof","4","9","20","27 March 2009"," A strong premise... which epically fails.
","I never really planned on seeing this movie. I'm not a huge fan of nicholas cage and his limited range of squinty facial expressions. However, after hearing some friends report on how 'awesome' it was, I decided to give it a shot.<br/><br/>The film begins beautifully, with Melbourne providing quite a good an admirable job at passing for Boston- my only clue was seeing Doug Peterson from Summer Heights High- and both visual effects and a plot which set up a dark mood, full of intrigue and possibility.<br/><br/>The film takes this on for a while, and for this time my only complaint was the badly photo-shopped image of rose byrne that appeared a couple of times, and a few awkward script moments that left many audience members laughing. Apart from a few unnecessary moments of foreshadowing, all looked well in the world of ""Knowing."" How, how wrong I was. Like in so many other films, it reached a point where I realised ""This movie is going to have a really, really stupid ending."" And I was right. It's almost as if the writer of the original story gave up on trying to create a quality ending, instead focusing on ridiculous and unsatisfying ways of bringing so many odd moments in the film together, combined with huge, but not always the greatest quality, special effects. This ending's stupidity is only compounded by rabbits, a ridiculous goodbye and an awkward and ultimately incomplete moment of family reconnection. Once it ended, the cinema was full of giggles and a few comments along the lines of ""its about time it ended!"" wait for the DVD, if you must watch it at all."

","Summary:<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie, the special effects were phenomenal, I really liked the entire movie until 30 minutes from the end or so... but at least it was original, not a standard text book ending.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>There are some parts of the movie that really, don't make sense at all... and some things that don't even play into the plot, just take up time in an already 2 hour long movie. In my opinion, It could have been much better then it was. There was also a section in the movie, towards the middle area. Where the story just seemed to linger and die and get boring.<br/><br/>Pros: Great acting, very good acting by Nicholas Cage. Great screenplay and a very well made movie. The CGI was above average. I can't wait to buy the DVD version so I can watch ""The Making of"" to really see how much money and resources were poured into this movie. I also have to comment the sound and music were very well made. Some of the music reminded me more of a horror movie before the goblin pops out then a Sci-Fi movie. <br/><br/>Overall, it was well made and a good amount of money was used to make it realistic. I just wish the plot was as good as the screenplay."
"jbmarcy","4","6","12","5 April 2009"," Not KNOWING What It Wanted To Be
","As most of my criticisms of this movie have to do with its details and plot points, writing a review devoid of spoilers was tricky, but I did my best.<br/><br/>Nic Cage's film choices, and acting style, and general appearance over the last five years are all good for our amusement, but it's been what, 15 years since he won an Oscar and about 10 since he was nominated. I saw ""Knowing"" because a friend paid for it.<br/><br/>Having said that, I was very into the movie right from the beginning. The scenes set in the 1950's were alright, the cinematography and score reminded me of a more traditional sci-fi movie, taking some chances with the narrative style and trying to unsettle the viewer. I was ready to dismiss the movie as a serious one and mock it, but it didn't let me. It was a good movie.<br/><br/>Nic Cage works as a Professor at M.I.T. in Astrophysics (or something), and this is where the film starts getting lazy. He explains Determinism vs. Random Chance as though this class full of MIT students are 4th graders. This is linked not-so-subtly with his state of mind at this point in his life, having lost someone very close to him. Without getting into too much detail, his son receives the sheet of paper with numbers, numbers of great significance, written by a little girl in 1959. What follows is a standard investigative story, complete with cover-ups, suspicious deaths, abandoned homes, children bearing the burden of their parents' abnormalities, and mute albinos in trench-coats.<br/><br/>What doesn't work for me, chiefly, is that I don't understand what I'm meant to get out of this movie. The special effects are quite good, and the scenes in which they're used are shocking and effective (pardon the pun), but I think the movie missed a few chances to deviate from a predictable, ultimately lazy, somewhat nonsensical path. Nic Cage knows about upcoming disasters, and he kind of limps through the motions of trying to influence their occurring, but not really. He makes a couple anonymous phone calls, hits a tree with a baseball bat, gets a revolver, and falls to his knees. Rose Byrne, in yet another thankless end-of-the-world supporting role, spends most of the movie looking distraught, haunted and helpless, and at one point literally yells, ""We Have To Save The Children!"" I was not the only one in the theater who laughed.<br/><br/>For most of the film, the main investigation is concerned with details so finite and exact, that the ""startling revelation"" and its aftermath, the intentions of the mysterious beings and their identities, the ""solution"" to it all, feels very carelessly or vaguely put together. It's a surprisingly sentimental conclusion, but instead of finding the meaning in all of the events, I left with the opposite feeling. I felt as though the characters didn't influence anything with their knowledge, which is ironic considering the title.<br/><br/>This reminded me a lot of I Am Legend: both start out good, drawing me in with quality effects, cinematography, score, and mood. Ultimately, however, both cash in on the intriguing premise and setup with a conclusion so (overly) simple, that rather than appreciate the symbolism and beauty of it, I'm left to wonder what the point was, and if there weren't too many ""chefs in the kitchen"" as far as the message of the film is concerned.<br/><br/>The only thing I know we're meant to understand is that Nic Cage is the ""Cynic Who Rediscovers His Faith Amidst Disaster,"" and I've just seen that before in Independence Day, Signs, I Am Legend, etc. Hard to say I was disappointed because I didn't have much hope for this movie, but it was surprisingly entertaining until its frustrating end."

","All five stars go to the special effects crew. Everything else? Well...<br/><br/>POSSIBLE MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage plays an M.I.T. astrophysics professor. Initially, we see him giving a lecture on the difference between determinism and randomness ... with him confessing to his students he believes in the latter theory. I was enjoying the film up until the last part where Cage all but admits to his father (a pastor) that he's now a determinist - a couched reference to him ""finding God."" The problem? Well, there are several. But I'll just stick to the biggest bugaboos. Assuming one believes the alien premise laid out in the film, we see neither the determinist nor the randomizer position proved. Rather, we see the situation described by Tom Hanks in the film, Forrest Gump - that they're really both happening at the same time.<br/><br/>People who believe in the theory that life on our planet was ""transplanted"" by superior aliens will love this film. But the aliens, by their very actions, appear less godlike and more like high-tech experimenters. And the test subjects of these experimenters (namely, all plant and animal life on Earth) are nothing more than guinea pigs - to be sacrificed ALTOGETHER (with certain pre-selected exceptions) at the end of the film for the dubious purpose of ""starting over again"" on another Earth-like planet. Had I been Cage's character during the spacecraft departure scene, I'd have asked my son to mentally convey two important questions to his alien saviors. I'd have asked, ""If your grand experiment on Earth failed, what assurances can you give me that your next experiment involving my son will succeed?"" And... ""Do you REALLY respect life or are you just content to shoot craps with it until such time that you perceive yourselves *winners*?""<br/><br/>That final scene with Cage reuniting with his pastor dad - blubbering in religio-euphoric ""I know this _really_ isn't the end..."" psychobabble? Had I been Cage, that scene would never have happened. Rather, I'd have just burned to death in the solar firestorm, knowing (ugh, that word) that I was merely a guinea pig in a cosmic experiment that failed - and I'd not have been a happy camper at all.<br/><br/>So, overall, there are great special effects for this otherwise depressing movie - championing the idea that the entire history of the human race ""didn't matter"" (outside of procreating guinea pigs for future experimentation)."

","Alex Proyas' Dark City is one of my favorites, so I came to this film with great expectations. It started out very promising for the first half.<br/><br/>MIT mathematician Nicholas Cage catches on to the fact that numerical sequences scribbled by tortured schoolchildren have a deeper meaning: they seem to mark casualty numbers and dates of major and minor cataclysmic events from wars to airline crashes. As he investigates, there are many exciting set pieces: a plane crash really close up, burning deer wailing in a burning forest, mysterious government people - or aliens? The last of the numbers on the list is scary: the whole Earth's population. And the date is not too far in the future.<br/><br/>At this point I was very impressed, thinking Proyas has done it again.<br/><br/>Once expectations are built up high, the whole house of cards falls apart: the Earth will be destroyed by a gigantic solar flare, a cathartic cleansing for the evils of humanity, and aliens who see the big one coming, as they do all disasters, are going to save a handful of children, so they can live on a fresh zoo planet with grass that looks like a landscape made of wool. Why make these poor children go through such pain? Why write down the numbers? Why save so few when you can save so many? Why wait 'til the last second when you have decades to execute your plan? And didn't anyone ever tell you about the butterfly effect, which makes it impossible to make such predictions for open dynamical systems? The loose ends range from silly to unnecessary, and leave the moviegoer with a very dissatisfied taste in their mouth.<br/><br/>It's a 4/10 for good production values and a great first half, but unlike your typical mediocre 5/10 action flick, such as the Neeson vehicle ""Non-Stop,"" this movie is a real let-down at the end, and that's another star off.

","This film should have been much better than it is. In fact, the premise is quite intriguing: A time capsule is opened and found to contain a page of seemingly meaningless numbers written by a strangely spooky girl 50 years ago. By chance, a professor discovers that the numbers are the dates, locations and the number of the dead of disasters around the world since the time that the capsule was buried. And there are some major disasters just around the corner, including (as we find out about two-thirds of the way through the film) the end of the world.<br/><br/>By the time your bum is well and truly sore (this film drags on for two hours), you eventually discover that the spooky girl was receiving the numbers from some Swedish-looking alien dudes, who know all about the end of the world. In fact, they've come back to earth to save the professor's son and his girlfriend from global Armageddon. Nice.<br/><br/>Not only do the angelic aliens take the kids, but also two fluffy white bunny rabbits. (Seriously!) We eventually find that these two kids are apparently not the only ones being saved, since as the spaceship takes off, we see lots more Noah's Ark spaceships taking off from all over the planet. Presumably on those ships other kids are carrying pairs of elephants, giraffes and wildebeest.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the whole planet is engulfed in flame. But not to worry because the blond aliens drop the two kids off on an idyllic looking planet. It's a regular Garden of Eden, in fact, complete with its own Tree of Knowledge -- presumably an ever so biting and cynical suggestion that we humans will again fall from grace in this new world. With no groundwork established in the film to suggest that we ever did fall from grace in the first place, this ""meaningful"" bit at the end comes across as utter pretentiousness.<br/><br/>""Knowing"" is essentially an extremely boring and silly film. The premise could have been developed intelligently. And things do go quite well until about the time that the second disaster foretold by the numbers comes to pass.

OK, we can live with movies about asteroids threatening the earth (possible scenario), volcanoes erupting where they never have before (quite unlikely but possible), even movies about instant ice age (pure fiction) - but this one went a bit too far. The thing is, I didn't even see it come: the first half of the movie was some kind of a mystery thriller although it required quite a suspension of disbelief - and then it started deteriorating gradually, ending like a cheap B-movie, in a wacky mixture of religious kitsch and science fiction... um, did I say ""science""? This may not be the proper word - anti-science or pseudoscience would be a better choice to describe the absurd idea of a solar eruption being so strong that it wipes out life on earth. It also turns out that our main protagonist is the only one who had the ""intelligence"" to figure out what's coming - obviously he must have gone unnoticed by the Nobel committee for years... What's highly entertaining is the gratuitous use of scientific terms i.e. when Cage's character reveals the fate of the Earth to his colleague, he talks about a ""deadly"" radiation of 100 µT (micro-Tesla) - which is preposterous as the normal magnetic induction of the Earth is close to that value:)) surely very impressive to those who never heard of microTeslas before!! The final scene showing some kind of rays which for a strange reason seem to advance like a bush fire is just as absurd - everything, and I sh1t you not, really everything goes up in thick black clouds of smoke instantly, be it concrete, steel, glass or even water (!?!?) The buildings start burning from all sides although the sun rays can come only from one direction - a phenomenon which exists only on CGI... and that's not all, those rays are not only capable of setting everything on fire, they are also able to penetrate miles deep into the earth and kill those hiding in caves... wow:)) I guess, nuclear shelters were omitted as a possible hideout as it would distract from the storyline and make it even less plausible i.e. everyone dies except for the chosen ones...<br/><br/>Despite the script which was often kind of moronic, Nicolas Cage pulled off a decent performance. Maybe he was not quite convincing as a MIT professor but I liked him playing the single father except for those schmaltzy parts with the sign language. The kid who played his son (Caleb) needed more support through the director - most of the time he looked like an alien himself, same applies to Lucinda... As for all those religious references - it was sickening, I felt as if they borrowed some ideas from those Watchtower leaflets. Hope to see Nickolas Cage in a better movie soon..."
"tjacobs1945","3","4","7","31 March 2009"," I had a difficult time deciding if this movie should get 2 or 8 stars
","Evaluating this movie is, for me, rather difficult. If a movie is to be judged only on what transpires from the opening to closing credits, I would be willing to have given ""Knowing"" perhaps six or seven stars. The seven stars would come from a great beginning, a nifty sort of mystery that unfolded at a reasonable pace--and then an ending that was horrible not so much because of the calamity factor but because it completely nullified the entire point of the preceding part of the movie.<br/><br/>I am beginning to become convinced that for a movie to rate more than five stars it has to give the viewer something more than two hours of diversion. Such a movie should give the viewers something to think about or relate to their own life or ponder ""What would I do in this situation"", and so on.<br/><br/>THE REST OF THIS REVIEW IS RIFE WITH ***SPOILERS*** How to deal with the death of a spouse, maintaining a healthy, single-parent relationship with a son, or even ""What would I do if my child brought home a cryptic 50-year-old message"" can draw an audience in and, in fact, this part of the movie was well done. But the ending nullified all of this and, in fact, gave the first 9/10 of the movie all the meaning of a mouse running in one of those circular treadmills. All his (Nicholas Cage's) running around, getting involved in two disasters--even his rescuing of a few people from a plane crash was, by the end of the movie-and-world, completely pointless. Even his dramatic reading of the fingernail-scratched door was important only after one takes a ""suspend belief pill"" that will allow the viewer to accept the fact that only way a super-powerful alien race can rescue two children is to assume that the kids will be at a certain place at a certain time--as described in old scratchings on a door.<br/><br/>The other thing that bothered me was the lack of logic. Here are some examples: The ""aliens"" seem to know our future--including the ""end of the world"" calamity. They knew 50 YEARS (at least) in advance that a solar flare was going to scour all life from the earth. They had tremendous powers. Did they use that power to build (or have us Terrans build) some sort of solar flare shield? Did they decide to evacuate as many people as they could during that 50 years? No. They decided to rescue two (or, perhaps, a few more) children that had not even been born yet.<br/><br/>Why did they ""call"" (i.e., rescue) only children? And only a few of them, at that.<br/><br/>The whole movie was based on the message from 1959. But it ultimately had no point whatsoever. By suspending lots of belief, it could have been for the purpose of getting two children to the space craft pickup point. But even there it was not relevant--the aliens DROVE the children to the proper place.<br/><br/>Why did they say ""no"" to the father of one of the children? For that matter, why did they say ""OK"" to a pair of rabbits? (After five years, the rabbits probably outnumbered people on the new world about ten million to one.) Why the drama about the pebbles around the pickup point? They (but not dirt, etc.) seemed to be affected by the space craft's propulsion but they otherwise did nothing.<br/><br/>The movie had a great premise and (until near the end) continuing interest. My feeling while walking out of the theater--and now, a few days later--was like I watched an exciting football game. Then all the players were shot."

","Here's the bottom line. Though the same people who made this reactionary garbage would deny the rest of the world their own beliefs, we do still live in a country where everyone is entitled to their opinions. So they do have a right to spew this projectile vomit from the screen. However, sometimes I think there needs to be at least a warning label when scum movie making like this is jammed down our throats. At least if you go to see something as insidious as the ""Left Behind"" movies, you know what you're in for. They are made by fanatics who believe in the rapture, and actually can't wait for the end of the world, where only those who ""believe"" will get on their little spaceship and be transported to a world where Glen Beck and Bill O'Riley and reruns of Lawrence Welk play 24/7. But this propaganda of a movie purports to be a thriller. Maybe a little ""Di Vinci Code"", perhaps a dab of ""The Omen"" whatever what you don't expect is that this is yet another attempt to make people stop thinking, stop living, stop trying to ""improve"" the world with such ""socialist"" ideas as education, heath care, a clean environment, alternative fuels you know, things that will improve our life. In their minds, it's all going to end anyway, so just give all your money away to the con-men evangelicals, live in fear and wait for ET to phone home and take you away.<br/><br/>Oh, and if you don't believe in their fairy tale, then you will have to stay behind and burn. God (pun intended) forbid you believe in the satiety of living things, the glory of thought, the magnificence of science, and the freedom of forming your own ideas.<br/><br/>Why Nick Cage is in this is anyone's guess. Money, I assume. But you can see he's not happy. Throughout he has the pain expression of someone getting a colostomy without any medication. The movie is ugly to look at. It permeates with that smell you get in the summer, when some field rat has died under your bedroom window. It's dirty. Cluttered. Suffocating. Joyless. One has to wonder who said okay to this? Why would anyone want to pay money to see this? Seriously, I've had more enjoyment hosing out my garbage can after I found a decaying raccoon in it. <br/><br/>No one else of any note is in this embarrassment. The film tanked at the box office. And now, let's all hope that those that made it, will indeed be transported by some CGI spaceship and away from the rest of us. Can you imagine if this is true, and all these freaks really are taken away? And we were rid of them once and for all? As good 'ol Louie said: ""What a wonderful world it would be""."

It seems like Nicolas Cage (portraying M.I.T. astrophysicist John Koestler here) has done about eight similar I-try-to-save-the-world flicks in the past five years, and he's surprised everyone by being even lamer at this than Kevin Costner used to be. The only reason Bierce would want to see this is for the special effects rendering of the Prophet Ezekiel's wheels-within-wheels UFO. But will someone who has been in the deep freeze for 136 years really want to sit through two hours of absolutely meaningless melodrama (c'mon, wouldn't the benevolent aliens have something better to do for 50 years than to whisper into the ears of doomed people and make them scribble endless strings of numbers, from which NO GOOD COULD COME, even with John Koestler's totally implausible deciphering trick?) for five minutes of Armageddon? I'm sure Ambrose will lose NOTHING by simply tivoing to the good part, if tivo and KNOWING are around in 40 years.

","350 votes and a 7.4? Did I watch a different movie? I was embarrassed for having brought my friend and even worst I felt like I spent a lot of money to sit through a very bad two hour commercial. Like the previous post, I wanted to leave 30-60 min into the movie but so desperately hoped that it would get better. Instead, the movie actually managed to get worst, MUCH worst.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT....<br/><br/>It's hard to clarify my point without providing some details so I will give an overview of why this movie bothered me. It starts out promising, with a mysterious girl and some strange ability to generate a seemingly random list of numbers (as the previews depicted). The movie then starts to become somewhat creepy with the girl disappearing into a closet and found with bloody hands. So, now I'm hoping that this movie doesn't become a horror movie (flashes of Gothika came to mind) as I was not in the mood to see a horror movie and started to feel misled. However, before I had a chance to worry about the creepiness of the movie out comes this alien, a pasty skinned humanoid that shoots light from his mouth, so at least I surmised this thing to be an alien since I have yet to witness such talents from any people I have met (and have lived and traveled in many different countries). The finale of course was the spaceship parting the night sky like a regular event to save the select few for a new start to tie the movie together. Meanwhile, the atheist becomes a believer, his father who is a pastor has the final say and the world is demolished through an apocalyptic event. Oh, and it's not the end of the world it's the beginning and the protagonist can now spend forever with his recently departed wife. Really??? Where in the world was this movie going? Aha, perhaps it's because it's not of this world... It was all-over the place without any one portion of it well written/presented."

","MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS -- nothing specific This may not be the greatest science fiction movie since ""2001,"" but it is good nonetheless.

My suggestion is, go plow $100M into a movie that is a complete downer, and see if you have profits from it to do another one. Audiences (and especially American ones) are not willing to pay $10 to see a movie and come out of the theater feeling they need to go see a shrink in the morning. That's just a simple, hard economic realty.<br/><br/>Nick Cage is far from being my favorite actor but he has been in a number of good movies with interesting stories. This is one. I thought he did a workmanlike job of playing the grieving widower, and the nightly drinking to ease his pain was especially believable, without it (thankfully) being a major plot-point. The young, troubled, and ultimately hysterical young female lead was also very believable.<br/><br/>The disaster scenes were grisly and disturbing.

"howard.schumann","8","11","27","22 March 2009"," A work of excitement and imagination
","According to the Mayas and the Aztecs, there have been four previous worlds and we are now in the Fifth World. Each of the prior worlds was destroyed in a cataclysm, but as one world is destroyed, another is reborn. Alex Proyas' metaphysical thriller Knowing speculates about such weighty subjects and about whether the universe unfolds randomly according to chance or deterministically according to a preconceived plan. It is an entertaining and ambitious film providing much food for thought, though perhaps it is more audacious than successful.<br/><br/>The film opens fifty years ago at Lexington, Massachusetts' William Dawes Elementary School. Miss Taylor (Danielle Carter) asks her students to draw a picture about what the world will look like in their imagination in fifty years, the pictures to be stored in a time capsule to be opened in 2009. One student, Lucinda Embry (Lara Robinson), a pale girl with a haunted look on her face fills her paper with seemingly random rows of numbers, much to the dismay of Miss Taylor. When the time capsule is opened fifty years later, Lucinda's paper is given to nine-year-old Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) whose father is Professor Koestler (Nicholas Cage), a hard-drinking widower whose wife died in a hotel fire only a few years ago.<br/><br/>Shockingly, Professor Koestler discovers that the numbers on Lucinda's paper are predictive of the dates, number of people killed, and the latitude and longitude of every major disaster occurring in the last fifty years with a harbinger of similar events to come, the final one suggesting the possibility of massive global destruction. As Physics professor, Koestler believes in the randomness of the universe, that ""stuff"" happens, but the unfolding events that seem to involve his son cause him to question the role fate plays in our lives, especially when Caleb is approached by other worldly creatures he calls ""the whisperers"" who communicate telepathically. Whether the creatures are aliens or angels is left to the viewer to decide but their main function in the film seems to be mainly to scare the bejabbers out of the audience.<br/><br/>Koestler enlists the help of Diana Wayland (Rose Byrne), daughter of the girl who wrote the prophecies fifty years before and her young daughter Abby (Lara Robinson) who also talks to the ""whisperers"" to attempt to prevent the predicted events from happening but the most he can do is stand around, pick up bodies, or shout furiously. While more thoughtful than most disaster movies, Knowing has its share of explosions, chase sequences, and assorted vehicle accidents, including a state-of-the art plane crash in an open field near Logan Airport, and an off track subway train hurtling through a tunnel at breakneck speed, but, by the end, the film moves from over-the-top frenzy to a more subtler level that brings in apocalyptic and religious themes.<br/><br/>Proyas must be commended for tackling important questions and he has produced a work of excitement, imagination, and some chills even though it is marred by a one-dimensional performance from Cage whose emotions range from worried concern to frantic hysteria. Credit should also be given to the studio for giving the green light to a project which will inevitably divide people because of its subject matter and because it dares to introduce an element of faith and hope into typical doomsday scenarios. Some critics have attempted to scare off viewers by waving the dreaded ""New Age"" flag but hopefully today's viewers are more sophisticated. After all, this is a new age, whether or not some people have gotten the message and any film that challenges us to explore ideas about life and its future on Planet Earth while providing music from Beethoven's Seventh Symphony has a lot to offer."

","My Take: While the plot isn't great literature, There are some intriguing twists and some occasionally spooky moments.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie that M. Night Shymalan might have made if he hadn't done the disappointing LADY IN THE WATER, and the movie Nicolas Cage should have made instead of abominations such as GHOST RIDER and THE WICKER MAN; A supernatural thriller dipped in science fiction and sprinkled with a little religiosity, KNOWING has in it to make it more than just a thriller in namesake. This time they did it right, even if there are some moments that ""jump the shark"" as far as plot twists are concerned.<br/><br/>The film opens in 1959, where students of William Dawes Elementary School were asked to sketch their own view of the future, which will then be stored inside a time capsule. While other students busily draw their own versions of futuristic automobiles and rocket ships, mentally disturbed Lucinda Embry (Lara Robinson) disturbingly writes a series of numbers which might be a numerical sequence of sorts. Forward 5 decades later, the time capsule is unearth during an annual school ceremony, where the drawings stored inside are distributed each to a new generation of students. Astrophysicist John Koestler (Cage) and his son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) end up with Lucinda's work. what seems to be simply a set of randomly written numerals turns out to be a cryptic numerical list of every major disaster in the last decades, along with the number of casualties, in perfect sequence. See where we're getting here? Soon, Cage runs around in desperate attempt to warn everyone of the upcoming doom predicted in the code. But just when twists are starting to wear out, the script dishes out the usual ""big twist"" that abandons the restrains of reality.<br/><br/>Not that it matters. Under the hands of DARK CITY director Alex Proyas, any plot implausibilities and reality lapses are handled with some seriousness and poignancy that makes it sound less ridiculous than it really is. KNOWING may be a silly thriller if given in the hands of another somewhat lesser director, but Proyas does an adequate job that proves his up for the challenge. Cage is still less the actor he was in his better years, an aftertaste some of his previous efforts have left, but gives a rather adequate performance that goes way over the top in several laughable sequences, but does carry most of the film. Co-star Rose Byrne, who plays the disturbed Lucinda's daughter, is a good actress put to a lesser use in the movie (not even a love interest),. It may just be a case that the material is better than the people who act it out. The intriguing, sometimes screwy, plot is filled with interesting twists that, silly as they might get, come at you with some surprise that it still often startles somehow. There are a share of laughable moments that I'm perfectly aware of are supposed to be dead serious, but getting passed them, there are moments successfully pulled-off by Proyas. The special effects are terrific, sometimes frightening, but thankfully doesn't upstage the plot. <br/><br/>Nic Cage fans (as in former Nic Cage fans) will be surprised and delighted. Basically, KNOWING is better in every aspect some of his earlier movies have miserably failed. Let's face it, KNOWING could have been (and may still be) another paycheck role for the once great Cage, but this time, in KNOWING, even we to get our money's worth. <br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."
"kemallory340","9","5","10","15 April 2009"," Unexpectedly Great
","This is one of those films that comes around every so often that truly is an original piece of work (to me, at least). The story of this movie was superb, even with the disappointing ending it had me on the edge of my seat wanting to see more but not wanting it to end. I'd give it a 10 if it weren't for the holes in the story at the end.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage did excellent as one of the lead roles, he continues his excellent acting and I think this was a great film for him to do. Rose Byrne does a decent job portraying her character, though it's hard to tell because she isn't really a dynamic character but I didn't have any complaints about her. The kids do pretty well too, I think Lara does a great job portraying Lucinda as a kid and then as Abby. Chandler as Caleb does decent as well, but again, he's more of a static character.<br/><br/>This isn't like any of Cage's recent films, but I think this is a likable film for anyone who appreciates a good story. It's got some action mixed with clues and a lot of stuff in between."
"advocat3","7","5","10","4 April 2009"," surprisingly good movie for its genre...but the visual effects...wow!
","When is the last time to when to a cinema theatre to watch a sci-fi or a disaster movie and went back home with the enjoyment that you saw a descent movie and your dollars was well spent. To be honest I don't remember my last time... until yesterday. When I sat on that cinema chair yesterday, waiting to see ""Knowing"" I thought to my self ""Ok..Hollywood.. lets see what bs you have for me today"". I mean..come on... i saw the trailer...the movie was going to deal with disasters and future telling and Nick Cage running to save people... while being cool in the process...once again...The only thing I could expect from this movie is a bit action, some cool visual and audio effect and a lot of bs. But the movie was surprisingly good! Its wasn't the best movie ever... of course it wasn't...but for the genre..its was a descent film. Fist of all...the visual effect...wow! Its like nothing I saw before. Who ever created that sgi scenes must get an award or something. Its was unbelievably realistic and perfect in every way! Seriously I was stunned... like every other people in the theater. Its like, you must see it to realize how good its was. From the visual effect point of view this movie gets from me a 10 out of 10... with an! Now concerning the rest of the movie you cant say a lot of things...The storyline had its flaws - the whole number and future telling story at the beginning was kinda captivating but nothing very special - there was some adrenalin rising scenes and some scaring the sh... out of you scenes that were pretty cool - and of course a controversial ending. Most people didn't like the ending. I am not saying that it was the best ending of cinema history... but to be honest a lot of other endings could be worst. Anyway, the ending didn't spoil the movie for me. The movie was also well directed. I liked the way the director deliver this movie to the audience. It was a descent job from his part.<br/><br/>In conclusion this is a movie you gotta see, especially if you like this genre. Its has the most brilliant visual effect ever and in general its a good movie (for its genre). It was definitely neither a waste of money nor time for me."
"martijn-56","8","5","10","3 April 2009"," Not totally original, but good entertainment
","First of all: yes, I would recommend to watch this movie, since the plot and action is gripping enough to watch it from beginning to end. Nicolas Cage is solid, and so are the other actors, especially the little boy and girl. The graphics are not bad, although in 2009 they could have been a lot better. But they were not the most important in the movie, and the plot makes up for a lot. So there is hope after the horrible remake of The Day The Earth Stood Still.<br/><br/>Of course I won't dwell on the plot here, since we can all find that on wikipedia. I did read if before watching, and regretted it. It is better not to know, even in this Knowing movie!<br/><br/>Main theme is that the End of the World is coming, and some 'angels' will come to earth to save some kids to start all over again. For anyone who knows quantum mechanics, or Heisenberg, this is where the credibility of the movie ends. Determinism does not exist, and even if things could only happen in one way, there is no way any 'identity', or God, could know this. Since of course then, that God would have to include his own influence on the environment he tries to predict. And how could Aliens know what the sun will do in 2009? What is for sure, everything in the universe is connected, and therefore nothing can be known for sure. It is like trying to get a truthful wildlife picture standing in the middle of a wild park in South Africa: of course we would get a lot of lions and zebra's there, but they would have been behaving different if our smell did not disturb them. This disturbance, the uncertainty principle, underlies the fallacy of this movie. Even more: uncertainty, or chance, means we have a choice, and out of that choice comes purpose and meaning. If all was fixed, THAT would be meaningless. So the whole point of the time capsule and events that helped Nicolas Cage to get his son saved were not necessary: if determinism existed, it would happen anyway. The Aliens could just have picked up his son, no matter what Cage tried to get at the right location in time. But it gave a gripping plot. So enough about determinism vs. uncertainty now. Movies are to escape, and I could let go my disbelief. <br/><br/>Lovers of the genre will see this one is a blend of movies we have seen before; scenes from the Day the Earth Stood Still, as well as fire blast scenes from Independence Day, and apocalyptic atmosphere as seen in all of these, especially Deep Impact. And, to end the criticism, since I liked the movie anyway: why always a character that is put in disbelief, since of course the death of his wife impairs his judgement? It would be enough to have a totally happy man stumble on incredible data. That would also raise eyebrows all the same among his friends. We have seen that 'troubled and not taken seriously' type of main character too much now.<br/><br/>What was new in this one, is that the world only knew in the last moment, so there was not as much emphasis on the people left behind as was in Deep Impact. New was also the bittersweet end, that was a happy one for only a very few.<br/><br/>So all in all, a solid good action sci-fi, but not one with horrifying resonance as the Bodysnatchers had, or Aliens. Those movies won't be forgotten, this one will in time. <br/><br/>So what can we expect for When Worlds Collide to stand the test of time? It would have to add something we have not seen before. Probably more focus on what it means to live the end of the world, and dazzling graphics for 2 hours non stop. Not only for 2 minutes, as in most movies of this genre. ID-4 was the big exception, and that's probably why it grossed so much. Something to think about for the producers!"
"freddyhead","8","5","10","31 March 2009"," Pre-consived notions that this is a disaster flick
","When I began to watch this film I figured it would be like any other disaster flick out there but I fell that this is more of a drama about life and religion than anything else I only wish that the rest of the film was as beautifully shot and written as the ending. I know I will get some trash talking' from this but the ending would of brought a tear to kurbick's eye if you look at it the right way and not for the explosions of SPFX which by the way where amazing and the story is fresh and original it just left a lot to be desired by the meat of the story.

"inkblot11","7","5","10","30 March 2009"," Knowing that others, like me, adore Proyas and Cage, DO see this one but there are some flaws, definitely
","John (Nicolas Cage) is an astro-physics professor at MIT. He is also a new widower, with a pre-teen son named Caleb. The two of them live in a lovely old home, in the Boston area, with a wooded area in back. One day, John goes to Caleb's school for a visit, for it is an important occasion in the establishment's history. Fifty years ago the students drew pictures of their predictions for future life and buried them in a time capsule on the school's grounds. Today is the day to dig up the object and view the contents. As each student is given a sealed envelope containing the picture of a former student, Caleb is shocked to discover that his package has no picture, only a bizarre string of numbers. After showing the sheet to his father, John is baffled, too, until he begins deciphering the codes. It seems that within the lines of digits, there are the dates of many natural disasters on earth, with an exact number of victims, including one for 911. As there are three strings of numbers which have not ""occured"" yet but which may be happening very soon, will John be able to prevent the next disaster? And, what about the girl who wrote this strange information on paper? Was she herself clairvoyant or was someone or something giving her the information? First, let me state that Proyas' Dark City is a monumentally great film, one for the ages, and that his The Crow and I, Robot are great films, too. However, this movie is not on their level, despite having a thought-provoking and complex plot and an art direction that is first-rate. Why is this so? Its hard to put it into words. First, the cast is fine, but is definitely not the reason to see the film. Cage starts off well, for he is a great actor, but there are times when his performance seems ""forced"". This fact alone hurts, as Cage is one of the finest actors of our time and my personal favorite. Rose Byrne and the lesser cast members do not enhance the film's value but don't detract from it either. The one bright cast member is the young boy playing Caleb, for he has an eerie, ""otherworld"" look that is spooky but he also is quite touching as the confused soul in a changing world. In his favor, Proyas has fashioned a beautiful looking film, with amazing sets, costumes, art direction and special effects. Scenes of a plane crash and of a subway derailment are spectacularly effective and the atmosphere of the film is downright scary, at times, due to Proyas carefully constructed camera angles and heart-thumping music choices. So, ultimately, the true problem of the film is not necessarily Proyas, but the story and script. It just doesn't ""hang together"", being one part mystery, one part science fiction, and one part family drama. Sad. Yet, for all of the criticism that the film will receive, it is still worth the viewing, for the ideas expressed are tantalizing and will make tongues wag for hours after a show. Therefore, if you love Proyas and Cage, like me, or science fiction in general, DON'T skip it. It may be flawed but its still an eye-popping film with plenty of stimulation for the mind and the heart."
"theojhyman","8","5","10","25 March 2009"," A seriously under-rated, shocking and scary movie
","The less said about the plot the better, but I will say that Nicolas Cage puts in his best performance in years and in what starts off looking like it's going to be another typical Nic Cage adventure movie quickly turns into a dark and scary sci-fi disaster movie with essences of The X-Files, Armageddon and the best M. Night Shyamalan thrillers.<br/><br/>The score is also worthy of mention, as it borrows much from John Williams' Jaws, but also reminds you of E.T. and Close Encounters, i.e. a powerful score that becomes part of the movie, rather than just playing softly in the background.<br/><br/>This film will surprise you and it will scare you, if not in its intense and graphic disaster sequences, then in its many spine-chilling scenes of terror when our lead characters are in the woods, in a car or in their own bedroom! This is not a family-friendly disaster movie that has any comic moments like Armageddon or Independence Day, but a more modern disaster movie for our time that you will either love or hate. Some of the audience will laugh at its ridiculousness, but others will find its impact stay with them long after they've left the cinema. To entertain, this film relies on your suspension of disbelief. For a deeper impact, it depends on what you really believe in. At its core, this film is a debate on coincidence versus fate.<br/><br/>The movie plays well on a big screen with big sound, but will not have such an impact on the small screen. This movie may go on to become a highly under-rated, under-watched cult classic or it may spawn a new wave of far more family-friendly disaster movies but with the same theme... it will probably do both! Go and see it... twice."

Knowing is a really good look at a may come to pass reality for us humans. It really had such a twist at the end that you just don't see coming. As I watched it, several times I thought, ""I got this figured out"" but was really surprised at how wrong I was at the close of the story. Knowing is a really great addition to the scifi gender and may well become a classic as time goes by. Kudos to the whole cast! Cage is at his best, as are all, even the brief appearance of Cage's father at the end just adds to and makes the story complete! Its seems a minor scene of him with his family at the end but it just seems to me to add a little something to the story."
"Leofwine_draca","9","6","13","10 December 2011"," Nic Cage's best film
","I love KNOWING. I loved everything about it from the moment it began to the time it finished. I loved it enough to watch it again a week later, to see whether I'd been overenthusiastic in my praise, and I discovered it was just as good – if not better – a second time around. Director Alex Proyas delivers a tour-de-force disaster movie that takes Hollywood convention and tears it up until little pieces until nothing is left.<br/><br/>It starts out deceptively simple, slow and understated, the kind of slightly-odd mystery yarn that THE X-FILES used to do so well in its heyday. Then it hits you with a pivotal scene involving a plane which is one of the most breathtaking I've ever seen up on screen. Truly a phenomenal moment, the kind of scene that I had go to and watch on Youtube a couple of times because it was so great. The tracking shot in ATONEMENT was superb, and this equals it. From that point in, I was hooked, and the film kept me hooked until the ending.<br/><br/>Said ending has proved a little hard to swallow for some viewers, but I was more than happy with the outcome: it plays a difficult hand and avoids ever becoming twee, so kudos to Proyas for not inserting some sub Spielbergian nonsense. Nicolas Cage can do this kind of haunted, jittery character in his sleep by now, but even so he gives a strong performance, the kind that leads me to forgive him for some of the tosh he's appeared in during his career (not least THE WICKER MAN). The SFX work is, it has to be said, outstanding, perfectly complementing the storyline for once, leading me declare this one of the top films of 2009 and in such hallowed company as DISTRICT 9 and INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS."
"bmrao1980","2","6","13","13 November 2009"," Wow!...but not in a good way!
","The start is slow and steady, and gripping, and sets the mood for what i expected to be a gradual increase in the intensity of events, and the characters' reaction to it....and all i did was wait and wait and then the credits rolled. Wow! Watching this movie unfold (oh-so-slowly), and watching the plot(-holes) twist and turn, it just feels like a Film-Making 101 class was given a rare opportunity based on a promising premise...they were to make a disaster movie that incorporated science, religion, maths and paranormal activity, and they had to make sure there is no sequel possible (thankfully).<br/><br/>The beginning reminded me of the 'X-files', the end reminded me of M.Night Shymalan, and the music towards the end is taken from, and used to the same effect as, 'Irreversible'. The movie skips genres like they were lotus leafs in a pond, and in doing so leaves plot-holes the size of oceans. This one falls flat - road-kill flat. And i thought 'Next' was bad! I have always considered Nic Cage as a good actor but with the kinda roles he has been doing lately, he is wearing thin on me."
"J_Trex","8","6","13","15 April 2009"," First Rate Apocalyptic Thriller!
","I'd been meaning to go see this movie but just got around to last night and I was glad I did, because this movie rocks! It started off slow but once the central premise of the story became clear, it was actually very fast paced and spellbinding. It's axiomatic in show business to finish strong, and this movie does that in a very big way.<br/><br/>The strength of the movie is in the storyline, plot, and climax. The acting was good, but the dialog was at times amateurish and could have been improved with some minor editing. But that's mere quibbling with what was overall a very good thriller with a spectacular ending.<br/><br/>The central premise of the movie is in 1959, a troubled young girl writes a cryptic page of seemingly random numbers, to be buried in a time capsule (as part of an elementary school project) and re-opened in 2009. Flash forward to 2009 and the time capsule is unsealed and the letters randomly distributed to the current generation of students, with the letter written by the young girl given to Nick Cage's son. Cage, a college professor, decodes the letter's meaning, and finds it to be a prophecy of major disasters, including the apocalypse. <br/><br/>An excellent movie, well worth checking out."
"lopcar1993","9","6","13","14 April 2009"," Knowing is everything, and this film knows!!
","What do we really know about the end of the world? Is there a pattern to predicting the future? These are the question's that this Alex Proyas directed Sci-Fi disaster film asks, it asks whether or not we believe in destiny or fate( which ever you believe in.) is real or not, weather it is just fiction or something more. Personally I believe in both, and this film explores both of those strange and bizarre occurrences . Nicholas Cage stars as professor Johnathan "" John"" Koestler a man who's son amazingly stumbles upon a strange list of number's listing all the global disaster's for the last fifty years.<br/><br/>Now he set's out to try and stop these last few event's from happening, but can one man really out run his fate? or the end of the world for that matter. Knowing presses a question that we all know, how will the world end? Well knowing takes it one step further and try to map out how will happen in it's own terms. This film puts a not so arch typical hero against the force of nature and puts our most frequently asked and most pondered question on the silver screen. Knowing how the world end is something we could never understand, this film brings it full center and opens us up to a world we've never know or seen before. Knowing is a definitely going to the Oscar's for visual effects and it's music and is surely going to please and shock audience's for all time."

Nicolas Cage looked awful in the role of an alcoholic single dad. The plot was clearly influenced by humanist/vonDaniken scifi theology and even cultic beliefs (i.e. Heaven's Gate cult), and it's ""explanations"" for famous Bible stories (i.e. Adam and Eve, Noah's Ark, angels, rapture) were offensive.

The truth is this movie, while it does not do a fantastic job of delivering the actual background to where it's plot ideas come from, is a VERY important movie. The fact is there have been many, many old religions that had been based on similar plots. Indeed Christianity's book of Genesis is no exception.<br/><br/>Perhaps if they had elaborated more on the background, in addition to the ""number paper"" it would have been a stellar 10/10.<br/><br/>Whatever the case, the reason I think this movie is important is because it might be a good foundation for further study on the subject.

It uses real science to explain its science fiction. Many movies that don't have evidence to back up its fiction should be called 'fictional science.'

The many layered plot is beautifully executed. Don't believe the critics. There is no biblical, or green or moral message being flogged. It does however highlight the fragility of what we have in the world and in our personal lives. It shocks us with explicit scenes of devastating carnage. My emotional buttons were hammered to the extent that I had tears. I found the people and animals being burnt to death, and smashed to smithereens agonisingly disturbing and extremely realistic. The crying and screaming mixed in with the mangling of flesh, metal and stone chilled me to the bone. I found the intervention by visitors scary and a sumptuous spectacle.

So much so, that you could see everybody in their seats squirming, trying to overlook the predictable and lame lines from the actors, only to re-discover the goofy ending to the film.

","The first half of 'Knowing' is a relatively intriguing and effective little conspiracy thriller, complete with a rare understated performance from the typically hammy Nicolas Cage. I was completely invested in it and couldn't wait to see what happened next. But then it seemed to paint itself into a corner, and instead of coming up with something clever, it down-spiraled into an increasingly absurd collision of other genres and better movies until it didn't resemble the movie it seemed to be at the start.<br/><br/>I really don't know what this movie's message is, but whatever it was trying to say, it got buried under the rubble of its total collapse."

","This movie made no sense. One of the major plot points was for the aliens to find children (in the present time) that could ""hear"" them and take them to another world before the cataclysmic end of our planet. So why did they need to appear 50 years ago and leave a cryptic message with dates of varying catastrophes? Just so Cage's character can figure it out and let his kid go? How about all the other ships with other kids? They get their own puzzles? How come the girl who was able to hear them 50 years ago was not part of the expeditionary force but instead was left to suffer for all her life? In other words, everything leading up to the end of the movie was not a necessary element for the ending. No logic here at all and a real downer of a movie. A couple of stars given for special effects (which for the most part had nothing to do with the premise of the movie). Shame, because I almost always like what Nicholas Cage does."

"cazzygirl24","4","3","5","20 April 2009"," Disappointing Film
","After seeing the previews for Knowing on television I was very eager for it to come to theaters, but the film most definitely did not live up to the high expectations it gives movie fans. I was very disappointed with the movie and left the theater thinking, ""Seriously? Did they really just do that?""<br/><br/>The film starts off 50 years ago with an elementary school project where the students are asked to draw a picture to put in a time capsule that will be opened half a century later on the school's 50th anniversary. One student, Lucinda Embry fills both sides of her paper with a series of seemingly random numbers instead of a picture.<br/><br/>Jump ahead 50 years. John Koestler is a single father raising his son, Caleb, after his wife was killed in a tragic fire that claimed the lives of several dozen others. At the ceremony celebrating the school's 50th anniversary the time capsule is opened and Caleb unluckily is given an envelope that contains Lucinda's cryptic code instead of a picture like his fellow classmates. Later that evening something jumps out at John from the paper – a clump of numbers: 0911012996. It doesn't take long for him to figure out that these numbers really translate to 9/11/01 and 2996, the date and death toll of the September 11th terrorist attacks. John immediately jumps to work picking apart the numbers and finds that all huge disasters in the last 50 years have been accurately documented before they even occurred, but there are three upcoming catastrophe's the Lucinda's paper predicts. And sure enough, they happen when they say they are going to happen killing the number of people that Lucinda recorded.<br/><br/>John tries to seek out Lucinda to see if there is anything she can do to help, but discovers that she committed suicide a few years back and the only person he can reach is Lucinda's daughter Diana and Diana's daughter.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br/><br/>This is about the time where the plot line goes from interesting to flat out confusing. Many questions that would seem crucial to the plot are left unanswered, not to mention that the ending of the angels/aliens taking the ""chosen"" children away to ""safety"" (another planet that is meant to be a juxtaposition of the Garden of Eden) has a similar feeling to reading the last sentence of a book that says ""And then I woke up and realized the whole thing was just a dream."" I remember saying to my friends. ""Aliens? Seriously, aliens?"" The plot, while seemingly interesting, was poorly carried out and what was developed tapered away without being solved. Strong performances were given by Nicholas Cage, Rose Byrne,and the two child leads, Chandler Canterbury and Lara Robinson. Unfortunately, the poorly developed script cast a shadow over the performances. The movie is a real edge-of-your-seat attention holder until the last half hour of it.<br/><br/>I left the theater with a crowd that mumbled their disappointment in the film and complained of having wasted $8. Clearly ""Knowing"" did not live up to the high standards people held, and even those who had no expectations of the film were clearly disappointed. If you are really eager to see this movie I would recommend waiting until it comes out on DVD and then renting it. You'll have a greater peace of mind knowing that you wasted $2 to rent it than $8 for each person to see it theaters. And if you really are determined to see it on the big screen, leave 30 minutes early so that you won't be disappointed with the ending."

I mean aliens with angel wings? White rabbits? Giant spaceships? What the heck!? The whole movie was shattered in the last 15 minutes!

"benjiman33","4","3","5","29 March 2009"," Better off not Knowing
","Since the plot/storyline has been told and retold I'll not repeat that aspect of the movie but I will say that I don't think this movie knows what it wants to be about. Is it science fiction or drama? Is it a horror film or a comedy (unintended)? Is it spiritual or agnostic, or hopeful or hopeless? Who knows? As many as correctly said, this movie goes off in many directions and ends up nowhere. It attempts to tackle deep issues and by not focusing on any, ends up shallow and pointless. To the movie's credit, there are some good effects but many others are incredibly unrealistic. I disagree with those who see the movie as some kind of Christian message vehicle. Rather, I think the movie uses Christian themes in an attempt at depth but what results is a confused storyline and an unsatisfying movie-going experience.<br/><br/>Among the many unanswered questions: Why expose the prophecy to a child 50 years before the climactic event, yet the child chosen to receive the prophecy is not chosen ultimately? What's the point of knowing what's coming if there is no chance to use that knowledge and therefore no hope? What's the point of the stones and the whispering if the extraterrestrials will just end up driving the chosen to the landing zone? These and many other unanswered questions leave me wondering if the filmmakers knew what point they were trying to make. Maybe we're better off not knowing."
"bearfaceproductions","10","7","17","28 April 2009"," Fascinating, truly amazing
","Nicolas Cage has done another great job in this movie. Knowing, is that kind of movie that keeps you tense from start to finish. Some people spoiled the ending for me (I'm not gonna do that), but even though it was spoiled for me the movie was still great. The effects and disaster sequences were well made. The kid's (and adult's) acting was great. The movie was well directed and well written. The movie was suspenseful but it was also scary (and I liked that). If you ever want to see a suspenseful movie with a great plot go see this movie I highly recommend it. The movie has some biblical references, but it is also mixes it with atheist's beliefs, so the no matter what you believe in, you can still enjoy the movie by having your own theories."

","My oh my! What a dark movie this turns out to be! Yet one which you definitely need to sit out 'til the very end, simply because of the fact that Nicolas Cage is in it and he ROCKS! And because of the fact it tells a story of the demise of mankind in a Biblical, epic way! Did the director actually assimilate the Bible literally word by word? Or did he have it for dinner tasting its every word? It sure seems that way. Because what is at hand is literally of Biblical proportions... <br/><br/>This movie actually makes you think about life, about the relationships you have with others in this life, who you are, where you come from and where you'll be going! <br/><br/>Is life an accident, or a premeditated program being run, which actually serves a higher purpose? This is the key question in this movie. ""Why did I get this prediction while there's nothing I can do about it? How am I supposed to stop the end of the world?""<br/><br/>The happenings in this movie make you think that you hold your life in your own hands, being responsible and accountable for every decision or move you make. Yet a twist in the story says otherwise...<br/><br/>I don't know what they combined in this story but to me it seems a combo of the oncoming 2012 cosmic ""Desastrous"" events and the book of Revelations. The end of the world is nigh, very nigh! <br/><br/>Mr. Cage should be awarded with an Oscar and the FX team too! Frightningly realistic effects are hurled towards the viewer,leaving him helpless in his seat while people die, aching to assist Cage on his quest to save people and unravel the harsh truth which isn't exactly a happy one.<br/><br/>This movie is a definite MUST SEE and a MUST HAVE when out on DVD/ Blu ray!"
"DoctorWhy","8","4","8","25 March 2010"," Knowing.
","I'm not really sure why this movie has gotten such poor reviews. I found this movie to be, on the whole, solid and a bit of fun - certainly not stellar, but certainly not awful either.<br/><br/>It had an interesting, albeit unrealistic, premise which is what initially drew me in. A creepy little girl writes down a bunch of numbers which correspond to disasters over the next 50 years. Nicolas Cage comes by and finds it, notices the pattern, and starts running around like a madman just like anyone would do. Eventually, the world gets roasted by the sun and everyone dies except for some kids. With a little help from the willing suspension of disbelief, sure, I'll buy it. So what was it about this movie that caused so much hatred to emanate from the people on this site? Let's see if I can work it out.<br/><br/>Starting with the negative: I will be the first to say that the ending was horrendous. It made little sense, didn't tie anything together, and was kind of a Deus Ex Machina to make people think ""Well, at least the kids were saved."" Awful. (Also, what was the deal with the rabbits?)<br/><br/>Continuing with the biggest positive: the airplane crash was tremendous. It was gripping and by far the best scene in the movie; strangely understated owing to the fact that there was no background music, save for screams and explosions. The continuous camera shot was a nice touch as well. Continuing in that line of thought: I couldn't help but notice a couple of comments floating around that said the airplane crash was terrible, and that people wouldn't get up and try to run away. Wait, what? People wouldn't try and run away from a freaking airplane crash? Why the hell not? There are explosions and debris flying through the air, and you expect the people to just give up hope, sit down where they are and wait to be taken? No, I'm sorry, but people would get up and try to save themselves. I really don't see why they wouldn't.<br/><br/>Finally, the rest of the movie was a bit of fun. I had a good time watching it, and it made a valiant effort to make some sense out of everything. It failed a few times, but at least it tried.<br/><br/>In all, Knowing earns a 7.8 out of 10."
"bob the moo","Null","4","8","20 August 2009"," So-so creepy thriller that has a good atmosphere that covers up its many other weaknesses
","When a time capsule is ceremonially dug up after 50 years in the ground, all schoolboy Caleb Koestler gets is a page with a list of number on it. He takes it home and by coincidence his grieving astrophysicist father Jon spots a pattern. He spends all night going through the numbers finding, among the meaningless numbers, dates and numbers that relate perfectly to events and how many people died in them. Almost unable to believe it himself, he is scorned by his friends until the next ""event"" happens just as the list of numbers predicted. John tries to prevent the next event from happening while his son appears to be somehow connected to the predictions.<br/><br/>Knowing got a fairly average critical response when it came out and it was sufficient to make me wait for the DVD to come out rather than shell out for a couple of people to see it on separate tickets. Perhaps this is why I was pleasantly surprised by the majority of the film. I'm not suggesting that the film is inherently a good one but it did do a good job of holding my attention for the most part. It managed this by producing a creepy air and tension throughout the telling that made me ignore the massive jumps the plot makes along the way. The effects help it because they are too ""harsh"" to be ""fun"" – blockbusters often show destruction but do it in a popcorn type way – here I winched while watching people burn to death screaming – not fun but it helps with the air of tension and drama. It cannot do enough though because the writing still is hard to swallow, with lots of convenience about the writing, from the obvious bigger picture stuff right down to niggles about why John appears to not read the remaining events until they become the next one to happen! The film tries to have this dumbness lead into a sort of religious conclusion that is religious but also not religious at the same time. It is a real love it or hate it ending and for me it was more towards the ""hate it"" end of the spectrum. Not because it was religious but more because it just seemed so easy and a bit daft. Also it put me off that it couldn't decide to be religious or not, preferring to try and cover all bases by suggesting god, aliens, other planets, heaven etc without making a decision – this is why I didn't really like the ending. Normally I would not have bothered with this because of Nic Cage but he is OK. He is overly earnest for the most part but the film needs him to do that, helping the viewer get into the tension of it all. Canterbury is not much cop but fills the role without being a sickly sweet kid, which I guess is a victory or sorts. Donnellan does reasonably well while Maloney's still ""stranger"" is effective in adding to the chill of it all.<br/><br/>Overall though it is still a daft supernatural film that relies heavily on the creepy air and urgency to cover up how weak the plot is. The ending will please as many as it annoys I guess and ultimately the film is only an OK one – not a good one."

I literally waited for an hour for this movie to end, and laughed openly at how bad the acting was at some points.

With characters I haven't seen since Dark City. And that's why I especially liked this Proyas work. The good known dark shadows are here again... Nicolas Cage is believable, and it's a big happening for me, because I like him very much! Yes, this kind of acting made him for an Academy Award winner. I really don't know where he was in the last 3 years...? OK, we all know Alex Proyas. And I really hoped that this movie will be a shocker too. The first half of the movie is a little bit usual, but than begins changeling. The mystic grows, and we see something like never before. The end is the biggest surprise. Everything is different like in other movies, and that's why I think this is a phenomenal work! Congratulation!

The effects are incredible and realistic, although containing much of fantasy elements at the end.<br/><br/>I'm not going to discuss the film in respect of giving away the plot, but as depressing as the elements of the film are in how they are conveyed, it does end on a upbeat note by piquing one's sense of religiosity (ie, one's sense of feeling spiritual).<br/><br/>Whatever your mindset or ideology, creed or philosophy, the film is thought-provoking and engaging, and can be enjoyed if you allow for what Coleridge coined in his notes on poetry...""the suspension of one's disbelief""...and undertake the analysis sometime later.

","Despite an inexplicably low rating from the critics, 'Know1ng' doesn't just transcend a genre's trappings, it gives them a shotgun blast to the metaphorical face. The strength of the film is not in its special effects, its plot, its performances, even though each of those elements are represented very well. The strength is that it takes a philosophically intriguing concept- determinism -and shows the personal effects of it. God is implied, but not overtly attributed with control of the universe, because this isn't a disaster movie about the why or the how, it is a profoundly intimate portrayal of the end of the world. The audience gets a sense that it is coming, and they just have to deal with it. Very disturbing, unsettling material, superbly shot and scored. I will be revisiting this film again and again."

Nick expresses a particular anxiety and depth of emotion that is stunning. Bravo Nic! The kids were quite good also. Alex Proyas got a believable nuanced performance from the children. This is an important element in getting the movie across. ""The Rapture"" (1991) is another ""stick with you"" movie unfortunately marred by the actress playing Mimi Rodgers daughter. I would suggest not seeing Knowing if you're just looking for a special effects laden sci-fi thriller. It's so much more than that. As good and surprising as the CGI was it wasn't what was important about the film. See Knowing for the after effect; how it stays with you.

"giomanombre","10","6","14","4 April 2009"," Movie sounds like the Dresden code doomsday prediction.
","The theme of the movie appears haunting analogous to the Dresden codex from the Mayan civilization. This code made between 1200 to 1250 BC appears to have various astrological predictions of various eclipses and other events that will be occurring. One notable even was a solar eclipse in July 1991 that was predicted accurately.<br/><br/>However, there was one weird aspect of this prediction. It was stated that a ""meeting of the brethren"" would be occurring on that date. On Mexico, where this eclipse occurred there was a number of UFO sitings recorded on video and observed by many eye witnesses.<br/><br/>This same codex has an end date of December 12, 2012. Mausumi Dikpaki, of the National Centre of Atmospheric Research (can be googled) suggests that a solar storm will occur on that year that's stronger than any other solar storms in history. Sun activity is now actually lower than usual, which she calls the eye of the storm. She predicts a 30-50% stronger solar storm than ever before. This means there is a possibility that a strong solar storm could really occur around that time as predicted by that codex.<br/><br/>If you were to take analogy with the movie's motif, such as the numbers on the paper in a time-capsule predicting events of the future and compare it to this codex, you add the UFO alien element, as with the 1991 solar eclipse seen over Mexico as validating the authority of predictions of this codex. Then the movie takes on a more haunting and scary tone.<br/><br/>The aliens in the movie are actually ""Nordics"". They are tall, blondish human looking people that are commonly seen in Europe. If you take all these sort of elements and make a creative work of fiction -- then you have something like this movie ""Knowing"".<br/><br/>I actually appreciated the theme of the movie and it's inspiration for me to do this private research from a tip I got watching ""Mexico Roswell"" from UFO files last year and looking more deeply into the Dresden codex leading into a deeply rich intellectual experience.<br/><br/>After doing the research, this is a brilliant fictional story, taking mythological beliefs and stories and making some sort of compilation. If you are well versed in this sort of stuff, this movie will freak you out, guaranteed. Not because of the cheesy acting through, but more what it represents."

While that's not always a bad thing, sometimes the alternate path turns out to be ruinous. Such is the case with ""Know1ng"".<br/><br/>First off, the way in which Cage's character first comes to realize the list is more than just a list of random numbers requires an ENORMOUS amount of forgiveness on the part of the viewer (Cage *just happens* to pick THAT particular sequence of numbers and JUST HAPPENS to break them up in a way that looks like dates without ACTUALLY breaking the numbers up into dates (clue: there is no ""91st"" minute, hour, day or month, so why did he separate it that way??? No logic behind it.) He's an MIT professor, so I guess we're not supposed to be smart enough to understand his thought pattern? Then Cage's character makes some intuitive leaps based upon mere coincidence. One or the other would already require a suspension of disbelief, but PLEASE don't compound them. Believing one coincidence is bad enough.<br/><br/>The final disastrous straw is when the movie moves headlong... and entirely unnecessarily... into Religious innuendo. I won't spoil it for you if that's the kind of thing that might attract you to this movie, but ""Know1ng"" turns out to be a vehicle simply for pushing ""Chri-Fi"" (religious science fiction).<br/><br/>All-in-all, an enormous disappointment.

Cage sees his wife dead, spends 5 seconds with her says ""I'm sorry"" and quickly leaves like nothing important just happened! This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Truly awful! It is for sure Cage's worst movie."
"tartaglia0","1","5","11","8 September 2009"," An insult to human mind...
","I would like to warn people that this is no more science fiction than a sermon at a church. Unless the only book you ever read was the bible (or even if you have never read a book), this movie will make you moan throughout the 121 minutes for the lack of imagination the writers so daringly display.<br/><br/>The movie serves as a possible (and quite shallow) justification for the bible. The movie ends with aliens (with angelic forms of course) saving little adams and eves from the world, which is about to be burnt by the sun, and taking them to a planet which is able to sustain human life (not to mention that this planet also harbors a tree of knowledge (moan!!)). Very cleverly it has already been noted early in the film that there should be around 4 million planets that are almost identical to our planet earth, so that the new adams and eves can create their next generation of human kind on one (or many). Not to mention they will inevitably have their own biblical stories (again identical to our own, cheers!). Hence this is probably how our world came to be!! (as is suggested in the movie for the poor souls who can't make this connection)<br/><br/>Now, unless the previous paragraph puts you on the edge of your seat with your hands in a prayer, you will be highly disappointed by this movie.<br/><br/>However it is true that there are amazing shots and quite suspenseful events throughout the movie. In fact there was one continuous shot which consisted of a plane crash, the burning and dying survivors, Nicholas Cage running to the crash site and doing nothing but observing. It was an impressive shot, like many others similar to it. But they almost always end (or begin) with a disappointment, in the form of a gaping hole in the scenario, which shatters the illusion. <br/><br/>Oh I began writing the parts where the astounding stupidity of the characters (or writers) pushes you away from the story and I realized I could have replicated the whole movie here. I will give a few examples in my own words (it is painful to choose one among so many qualified candidates)<br/><br/>-------------------<br/><br/>John(Cage): If we hide in a cave we might just survive. But let me check something... Diana: Though we have a day to live (as predicted) I will not wait ten minutes for you. (Diana kidnaps John's son to save him, and drives to the caves)<br/><br/>Later in the story... John (through a phone): The caves will not save us, the sun will burn a mile in to the crust of the earth. Diana: I don't believe you!! I will keep driving to the caves, though you were the one to suggest them as well.<br/><br/>Later in the story... Diana (as she is driving through a loud storm, she screams to her kidnapped daughter who is in another car which is out of sight): Abby!!!!<br/><br/>-------------------<br/><br/>The whole movie was just pathetic. One star for actually destroying the world and killing the human kind, a daring move for a Hollywood movie."
"slcagnina","4","5","11","25 July 2009"," Clichéd and more clichéd
","Knowing is a film that starts out well, and then in the middle when it begins to head downhill, its prior clichés get highlighted and you think: oh no, it's gonna get worse because I can't excuse all its clichés hereon out. <br/><br/>Nicholas Cage plays a physicist whose son goes to an elementary school about to celebrate its 50th anniversary. This means they're about to open a time capsule stored when the school opened, which contains a very weird note written by a little girl containing seemingly random numbers which Cage finds out predict disasters. I'm gonna leave out the rest, because it never amounts to much. Cage's character lost his wife and you know the script will have him wrestling with ideas of determinism versus chaos, given this plot; he's not a character who has lost a loved one -- he's a name on a script with a convenient back story.<br/><br/>But the real problems with this film are rooted in the script. The setup is good, but as it unfolded, some of the acting got weak because of the bad writing, and the situations got too stuffed with special effects because of bad writing. Often bad special effects, too. And in the end, I was left wondering: How did these aliens predict the future? I must have missed the answer somehow, but I know I didn't miss the preposterous-ness that aliens would send a message to a kid, which gets put into a time capsule, but also, because the kid wigs out, gets finished on a door -- she carves in the numbers, and that door is never replaced in the ensuing 50 years, and conveniently found by Nicolas Cage and buffed down to find the a-ha clue, so Cage's kid could be at his rendezvous point for the aliens. But wait: after all this, the kid still gets a choice to go or not -- free will is alive! I was thinking: Why didn't they just take the kid -- Cage would have voted yes and the kid ain't old enough to vote? Or bring a backup if he opted out? And why would alien beings bother with all this nonsense -- how bout helping us with some technology to avoid being burned alive? <br/><br/>And why -- why write it this way? The movie was interesting for its first 3 reels, it didn't need Armageddon and aliens to keep it interesting. And Proyas' style here is really average; he's not a hack, but the movie is edited and shot in a standard Hollywood fashion, right down to that clichéd score. It was annoying -- orchestral bombast during emotional scenes or tense-note when something was supposed to be scary -- the same pulsing da da - da! you hear in every thriller. Sad. <br/><br/>Also, one last note: Cage's actions in the final scene with his son are very screwy. He finds his son and we understand he's concerned for him; but he never asks where the little girl with him is. This is strange and oft putting. And when she appears, he doesn't embrace her. And when he thinks he's gonna get on the spaceship with the kids, he takes his son's hand, but not the little girl Abby's. In fact, he seems like he's ignoring this poor child about to be whisked away from all that she knows. <br/><br/>He seems oblivious to this child, who the script decided, btw, should not be freaked out even though she's about to get on a spaceship without her mother, who is dead, or as the aliens tell her, OK now. These aliens don't win points for helping out humanity or for honesty -- and why couldn't Cage get on the spaceship, anyway? Wait: Script calls for poignant ending. That explains it."
"Robert_duder","8","5","11","19 May 2009"," An intelligent first rate surprise! End of the world movie raises the bar
","I had some certain expectations of Knowing. But they weren't incredibly high. Although star Nicholas Cage has had his fair share of great movies, I was never particularly a fan of his. The action scenes looked solid and the plot seemed like it was decent as well. So I suppose I went with mediocre expectations. So it's never a bad thing when my expectations are exceeded. Knowing turns in a very intelligent sci-fi end of the world story with some truly spectacular scenes and some of the best special effects I've seen this year. On top of that the performances are better than expected and the plot of the film turns out to be smarter than you might expect from this type of movie. The film does go into a unexpected twist that I'm still not sure is a welcome twist but they do make it fit and it does prevent the film from falling into a pattern of predictably that many other ""end of the world"" spectacles fall into especially with their endings. The entire mystery that unfolds is even more interesting than I expected and it just makes the entire film far more worthwhile than I thought it would be. It went from being mediocre fun movie to actually being a worthwhile memorable film.<br/><br/>My biggest issue with Nicholas Cage is that his ego always seems to win out in his performances. He's one of those ""look at me I'm Nicholas Cage pretending to be..."" type of actors. So I expected nothing more or less from him in this film and low and behold...the guy puts down his ego for this movie. He actually gives a meaningful, emotional performance as father and scientist John Koestler. This might not be the best Nicholas Cage movie but I think honestly this is one of his best performances. Young newcomer Chandler Canterbury does a great job as Cage's son. He gets some really great scenes and nails the emotion and the character to a T. Rose Byrne is good as concerned mother Diana and pseudo-potential love interest for Cage although he is still reeling from the death of his wife. Byrne doesn't quite reach the potential in her character that Cage does but she does well and has okay chemistry with Cage. In the same vote is young actor Lara Robinson who plays Byrne's daughter. She does well but pales in comparison to the performance of Canterbury.<br/><br/>The real interesting part of this film is the mystery involving the numbers delivered to Cage's son and then to Cage himself. As Cage unravels the mystery of these numbers and where these disasters will occur it really drives the story and keeps you riveted to the entire film. On top of that the three major disasters in the film are mind blowingly portraying and brilliant special effects. The plane crash in particular is brilliant and literally had my jaw dropping. I would watch that scene again and again. I might also mention that director Alex Proyas has really done some brilliant mainstream films including I, Robot, and and Dark City, two brilliant sci-fi action flicks. With his style and flare this movie really impresses. Maybe it overly impressed me because of my mediocre expectations but either way you should definitely check this out because despite what critics had to say this movie will undoubtedly entertain, and surprise. Check it out!! 8.5/10"
"caste78","8","5","11","19 April 2009"," Is this a movie or a real knowing?
","I don't know, if we talk about the film as a piece of sci-fi production, we could say: good visual effects, nice plot, boring, ridiculous...any way, but, crossing this point, I think, the film wanted to give us a real message, ""the humankind is living in a led land"". This small planet is, until now, our only home, a simple solar explosion could finish with life around the world, although this fact is very improbable, but, my friends we are doing this future Armageddon. There are just two words that abstract this fact, CLIMATE CHANGE, this real fact in comparison with the sci-fi film is: ""probably spaceships won't come to save human species for a new beginning."""

","This film would be FANTASTIC... if they managed to cut out all the whisper people, change the ending, and for god's sake FIX SOME OF THE Plot holes!<br/><br/>SPOILERS!!! SPOILERS!! !SPOILERS!!! SPOILERS!! !SPOILERS!! !SPOILERS!! !SPOILERS!! !SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>The movie was fine for the first half, if you ignore the whisper people/aliens/angels. Good special effects, the acting was fine and it posed a lot of nice questions, such as where did the numbers come from? What happens when they run out? What the hell does Cage's character have to do with them?<br/><br/>It was fine at that point. Then they dropped that script and had the kids become freaky and hear the whisper people, and they drove around a lot. It was still fine, if a bit boring, and it promised to pick up again.<br/><br/>And THEN!!!! They dropped that script and threw in some aliens!! I was anticipating a nice ending to the movie, and then i saw the freaking SPACESHIP!!! The movie should have ended there, with them leaving. I guess the apocalypse scene wasn't too bad, aside from some terrible emotionless acting. But then they had to bring the kids back on some ridiculous planet, where they run off happily hand in hand towards some stupid TREE!! I mean, you wouldn't think they'd survive for much longer anyway, seeing as the aliens (with wings) just dropped them off there. Maybe they can eat the rabbits.<br/><br/>Plot holes... undeveloped ideas... there were a few. Let's list some.<br/><br/>The stupid black pebbles turned out to be nothing. The boy was writing another list of numbers. What was that all about??? How do the aliens/angels know whats going to happen? Why didn't the aliens take more people? such as a significant portion of the human race? It's not like they wouldn't have fit on the gazillions of spaceships you saw leaving earth. What were the numbers even for? Cage couldn't change the events at all, even save more people than what was listed. It's like he was just along for the ride, and as an excuse to add some cool special effects. I could rant on for another few paragraphs about it, but i'll just leave it.<br/><br/>This movie had potential. They should take the overall concept (numbers predicting events) and make a whole new movie, which will PLEASE steer away from sci-fi!<br/><br/>Good concept, terribly executed."

","the movie is about the how world ends what is going to happen to the world what is going to happen to the people, the graphics used in the picture is pretty awesome. the main idea of the movie is to show that all the major disaster and incidents are happening in the world is taking us towards the end of the world. in the end of the movie the angels took the chosen one out of the world and put them into the new world, so the life doesn't end. it reminds me of the history that nova made the ship and puts every pair of animals and human beings on the ship because the flood was going to kill everybody, but the one on the boat are alive and the liefs goes on. the movie is good if you understand the movie carefully it is kind of reality."
"Ramascreen","9","5","11","21 March 2009"," Alex Proyas' Close encounters of the third kind
","KNOWING is director Alex Proyas' Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Proyas doesn't make many movies and often takes long breaks in between but when he makes one, it's bound to leave an impression (The Crow, Dark City, I Robot) and KNOWING is an instant cult hit. KNOWING is a... sci-fi thriller drama that grabs your attention and never lets go. It's suspenseful, haunting, and mysterious with excellent journey into the human paranoia and our desperate need to know the future no matter how grim it might look. You don't have to be a geek to enjoy this, just keep your mind open to the possibilities and let Proyas excite your senses.<br/><br/>KNOWING finally redeems Nicolas Cage who's been attached to some pretty lame movies in recent years. In this one, he still has that The Wicker Man character that at first concerns me but as the movie progresses, I can tell that he's very convincing and heartfelt as a dad whose loss of his wife has made him faithless and his son is the only thing that keeps him going. There's something about characters like this that makes it easy for us to relate to, which is a big part of why Will Smith's performance in I Am Legend was a success.<br/><br/>Director Alex Proyas has a special place in the hearts of geeks everywhere because he caters to this target audience and he does it well. His direction of KNOWING combines the usual over-dramatic clichés like dropping the glass on the floor or Nic Cage spinning his car abruptly as he parks at the gas station with the elements of heartpounding moments before intense surprises that will keep you begging for more.<br/><br/>The movie has breathtaking visual effects. The plane crash and the train collision and end of the world disaster are unlike anything that anything you've ever seen. It's not your typical attempts ala Roland Emmerich (Day after Tomorrow, Independence Day) Rose Byrne who plays a single mother, might not have an extensive movie resume yet but it's plain to see that she's very comfortable under the direction of Proyas, to just let herself loose in the panic and fear that a mother would experience when danger is about to threaten her daughter.<br/><br/>Great screenplay by the team of writers including Ryne Douglas Pearson who came up with this engaging story. The dialogue might not be the most clever things you've heard out there but it's not overdone either, what I appreciate is that despite how far-fetched the concept maybe, the conversations could seem like they would somehow make sense. The character development is there and well-executed, the scenes for it are appropriately placed and we understand exactly the motivation behind the actions that the characters choose to take.<br/><br/>I wanna give props to composer Marco Beltrami, who was Oscar nominated for 3:10 To Yuma. His original score for KNOWING is one that give you a little bit of sixth-sense and some majestic awe during the end scene.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, I was a bit worried when the last scene starts to reveal itself, I thought 'o no here's another Indiana Jones 4 fiasco' but nope, I like how Proyas and his people architect the whole thing so that it would not look cheesy and it would still have that grand effect that will stick with you after you leave the theaters.<br/><br/>--Rama's SCREEN--"

Near the end Cage has a brainwave and goes to the elementary school to get the original numbers she didn't finish (perfectly sane) then Byrne's character starts shouting WE GIT TO GET TO THE CAVE WHAT ARE YOU DOING? over and over then leaves without Cage (how dumb is that?) Cage manages to contact her to say to go to her mom's old house as that's the co-ordinates. So what does she do? Ignore him FFS.

What works about ""Knowing"" is that it leaves you thrilled and delivers shocks and twists at every turn. Cage actual delivers a decent performance, but his acting isn't why we seek out films such as this.

","An amazing film that will catch the eye of generations. I don't know what I meant by saying that, I apologize. I'm pretty aggravated with having to think of descriptions of good movies. It has been a while since I've seen a bad movie, and with the way it's going, I'm not going to see one anytime soon. This movie was excellent. There, I said it. Nicolas Cage has got to be one of my favorite actors, although he looks a bit like of my math teacher, which is quite disturbing. I enjoy watching him in these puzzle movies. I'm surprised he wasn't in the Da Vinci code, unless he was. I enjoyed his style on this story, and his serious tone, and that's what makes him a great actor for this movie.<br/><br/>There was a lot of action in this movie. Not too much like you would find in the Dark Knight, which I shouldn't compare this movie with, but here I did. If you dislike the lack of action, then you shouldn't watch. But, I say there was enough for me. In this movie, everything builds up. John takes the paper Caleb finds, starts doing the number stuff, shows his colleagues, is seemed to be crazy but in a nice way because they believe him a little bit.. well, he, he does research, finds out where an attack is going, and then the action starts. It's very interesting and exciting if you enjoy the suspense and action that starts around 30 minutes or an hour in.<br/><br/>What this movie is pretty much about is that long ago, Caleb, who is John's son, his old school or current one I guess, 50 years ago put a time capsule into the ground. A little girl wrote a bunch of numbers down and was interrupted by her teacher so she wouldn't be able to finish. But, once Caleb finds the paper and doesn't give it back once the school opens the time capsule, he gives it to John, his father. He doesn't pay much notice until later that night or so. He starts working on it and makes a big discovery that could have answered the question to where and when the Earth would end or what would happen? This movie was excellent. I highly recommend it. Especially since there's no sexual nudity and it's PG-13, you can take your children there."

","Cage is my favorite actor and will most likely retain that title until I die. He shares my birthday and I was raised watching his movies. He has done his fair share of poor movies and his share of great movies.<br/><br/>I want to say this Movie was refreshing. Cage was an amazing ingredient to this movie and the movie itself was chilling and sometimes stunning. The visuals were stellar and the creepiness that is naturally injected by the scenes does just what it needs to do.<br/><br/>This movie is a roller coaster of emotion. The daunting scene of a plane crash or the very dark number sketching will keep your attention completely attuned to the movie. You will feel sad, laugh, be scared, and read into this movie the entire time. Your brain will pick each scene apart as you follow the storyline. <br/><br/>I can usually tell if I've *really* enjoyed a movie depending on how much I discuss it with my girlfriend after-wards. We discussed this movie all night and even when we woke up! This movie even forced me to create an account so I could comment on it. It was really a shocker compared to the mediocre films available recently. <br/><br/>The Religious themes are heavy and I wished they tried to avoid them, but so is the way Hollywood works. They aren't pressing for non- christians like myself and I still whole-heartedly enjoyed this movie."

","This nonsensical film is an amalgam of story elements stolen from such films as ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" ""Close Encounters,"" ""The Sixth Sense,"" Signs,"" and ""AI."" Even worse it blatantly rips off an Arthur C. Clarke science fiction novel. <br/><br/>The film ham handedly tries to get a jump start on the 2012 ""end of world"" paranoia (from the Mayan calendar). And, piggybacking on the popularity of ""The Da Vinci Code,"" can't resist flirting with Biblical allusions.<br/><br/>The story about a little girl's prognostication over future disasters will keep you riveted through much of the film. But in the last 20 minutes the film takes a hard left turn and goes off a cliff. The mystery that develops through most of the movie is left unsolved and will leave you going ""WTF?!""<br/><br/>Instead, all we are let with is a horribly unsatisfying ""alien ex machina"" closing that makes you feel you've totally wasted 2 hrs of your life. My family (sci-fi buffs BTW) was so mad that they wanted to throw rotten tomatoes at the screen. <br/><br/>I've enjoyed all of Nicholas Cages's movies, and he does his best with this totally screwball doomsday yarn that, needless to say, is scientifically impossible. <br/><br/>The closing scenes are taken straight out of the Arthur C. Clake novel ""Childhood's End,"" and his family should sue for plagiarism."

","Most of what needs to be said about this movie has already been said but I will add that it's obvious the writers at Hollywood have their marching orders. The first part gets you hooked and it's downhill all the way after. So what do we get? We get United Nations Agenda 21 and a whole lot of New Age 'sustainable development'. In a nutshell: Old people are crap and won't be saved in the coming New World Order and get left behind and will get wiped out. The 'old world' must die and will be similarly wiped out. Only the 'kids' can 'get it' and are fit to be taken through into the new world breaking up the family in the process. Christianity sucks too, apparently. The kids are the only wise ones but frankly if I got spoken to by a little brat like that I'd whip his little ass. To the lack of continuity I'd just add that how can that dumb bitch get a stone prised out of her hand after she's just been driving with both hands on the wheel? This film is not only a waste of time but just plain irritating all the way through and only worth it if you like big arse spaceships with the same old Close Encounters tired white light beaming down done sometime in the 70's by Spielberg with the obligatory angelic aliens. Dreadful!"

","The premise of Knowing is simple, yet intriguing: A man links numbers with disasters and finds several have not happened yet. I wasn't sure what to expect. But what I got was some decent effects; that's it. Knowing provides many ridiculous, laugh-worthy scenes using these effects. Like many movies now a days that have loose ends in the script, the writers tie them together with the simplest way- a twist. Knowing's is so ridiculous and stupid, but is still completely boring. Another problem is the acting. Recently, Nicolas Cage has become infamous for overacting in titles like Ghost Rider and the terrible Wicker Man remake. Knowing is no exception. Cage is frequent to random acts of violence, like ripping things off of walls, throwing things, and attacking trees (yes, really). No one else is a particular good actor or actress either. The bottom line is Knowing is entertaining, but for its effects (in certain scenes, not all) and unintentionally hilarious moments."
"lee-b","1","5","12","4 April 2009"," worst movie ever
","Given the big budget and big names, I feel entirely justified in calling this the worst movie ever, relatively speaking.<br/><br/>Where can I start? Well, the beginning of the movie is slow and childish. It literally felt like watching a kids' show. And not even the usual kind of kids show where there's enough adult stuff layered in there to make it watchable for the whole family. It felt like a KID's movie, in terms of pace, depth, storytelling, emotions, characterisations, action... terrible.<br/><br/>The college philosophy lecture stuff was also really basic, like he was talking to 10 year-olds about the basic idea, and expecting them to come back in a year or two with more grown up questions about it all. Except that then he broke down as if these basic concepts were enough to make a grown college professor's world shatter.<br/><br/>Fast forward (if only I could have) through a whole lot more of this crap, and eventually you get to a few shockers. The one thing I liked about the whole movie was the way that the plane crash was really loud, fast-paced, and shocking compared to the rest of the movie to that point. It's a much more realistic portrayal of a crisis than the usual ""action hero running through, taking it all in his stride"" sort of stuff. I also liked the 3d graphics work, but it's far from enough to carry the movie.<br/><br/>Next big thing was the dark trenchcoat guys scaring the kids. These guys were supposed to be ominous I suppose, but mostly just grungy looking, like something out of an 80s music video, or a 70s porn shop customer. Could have been interesting, if they'd played on the idea that aliens can't communicate with humans except in scary images, but they didn't explore that at all. In fact, the kids get literally traumatised, ripped away from their parents, dropped on another planet, only to happily skip through the meadow there as if their lives had been idyllic.<br/><br/>Added to that, the direction and editing just suck.<br/><br/>A lot of people are saying this is TOO religious for them, and have even claimed indoctrination or ""Christian propaganda"". This is laughable, and tells me more about the emotional issues of those writers than about the movie. This movie barely touches on even the most basic concepts of philosophy and spirituality -- barely even addresses stuff we all think about, such as life and death -- much less going into a specific religion in any great detail. Yes, there's an Adam and eve, tree of life moment there at the end, but those are as much (if not more) culturally meaningful imagery of birth and innocence for westerners, as specific religious ideas. Yes, there are angelic figures, but given that they've been closer to demons for most of the movie, and are represented as aliens at the end, I'd hardly consider them very angelic in a Christian sense. NOTE: I'm not a Christian, or in any way superstitious. NOTE2: I still would have preferred the movie to explore those concepts MORE, rather than spew such basic, bland, meaningless overtones.<br/><br/>This is really a shockingly bad movie, all 'round. Do NOT see it. It's really not even worth finding out how bad it is."
"duckman_c","1","5","12","31 March 2009"," Blend of formulas creates horrible creepy mess
","A tragedy of 21st century lack of creativity. Knowing is about five different films cut and paste together awkwardly with a story-line so far-fetched that the only way to tie it together is to have weird alien things come down and sort everything out. There is the horror element: token small dark-haired pale girl predicting 'things', scratching warnings into walls in blood (The ring, Gothika, Silent Hill etc.). There is Nicholas Cage being a miserable git (nearly every Nicholas Cage film) with token single-fatherhood, wife dying young in freak accident (I am for one, glad that Nicholas Cage isn't my dad. Even if his broodiness is hard to take seriously). The only thing that sets this film apart from others is the absolutely unnecessarily horrific accident scenes: including a camera in the perspective of a train-driver, mid crash, with bodies spluttering against the windscreen and another scene with several people burning to death. The film is so grimy that these scenes seem nothing short of hilarious as it gives you the impression that director Alex Proyas is making a film that is depressing as hell for no real reason and that this is all a bit over the top. I would, however, advise that these scenes may a bit too much for children or stupid people. On that note, I classify this film unsuitable for anyone. For the few comedy moments there were, I still left feeling unhappy enough to write this."
"karlstehelin","10","5","12","30 March 2009"," Daring and brilliant!
","While Alex made his best to combine author movie and blockbuster with I, Robot, he truly shows his talent in Knowing! <br/><br/>It is rare to see such a daring film in the movies! You very soon realize the film is not what you thought it would be. That the film is strange. That the film's true aim is far from blockbustering! Yes the film is daring. With this ending, Alex transformed an average SF Thriller into a long lasting piece of allegorical art. It really is the best example of ""love-it/hate-it"" films. Either you accept the end and you love the film, or you just don't. <br/><br/>The very fact that some critics like Puig destroyed this film is a very good reason to go and watch it. It is rare to see so much difference in critic's speeches. While some describe the film as a big piece of nonsense, or even the year's worst film, other say it is one of the best SF movie they have ever seen! Of course, if your waiting for a believable SF thriller, you'll be disappointed. But if you come and stay open minded, you'll be able to understand the message and acknowledge the talent. <br/><br/>**Spoiler alert** People spent so much time criticizing the end, that they never talked of sth else. The two first catastrophe scenes are just brilliant. Brutal and realistic, especially the first one, with the plane, which is shot in one single sequence. Amazing! The little Chandler is very good. When you understand the position he finds himself in at the end, you know he will have to cry, and you're scared he will spoil the end. The result is just about the opposite. He's even better than Cage! No I say that, but Nic was far better then in his last awful films, especially through his father/son relationship throughout the film. You just feel he's a father! Cage who, by the way, has the best reaction ever shot at the first encounter of the alien spacecraft! <br/><br/>The end now can be hard to buy, but must have been even harder to sell to a studio! And yet, Alex and his producers dared to go through with it, and I say Bravo! Of course, they knew they would be destroyed by a lot of critics, but they didn't care, and believed the film was worth it, and it definitely was. So what is in the other spacecrafts you may think? To my mind, each of them has another young human couple and another animal couple as well. So after the ""Angels"" save a couple of all species from the ""Fire Flood"", they reinstall them on another planet, to let them ""rise from their ashes"", but with probably more then just one ""Adam"" and one ""Eva"" (would've been gross right?!) Last but not least, the choice of Beethoven's mourning 7th Symphony's allegretto during the last scenes of chaos is simply perfect! <br/><br/>This film brushes genie at a lot of spot, and represents very well the risk of cinema choices for the movies today. You may love it, you may hate it but you will not be indifferent! It will move your soul, it really is art. Don't miss it!"

","One of the worst films I've ever seen. Makes Plan 9 from Outer Space look like genius. It starts out fine setting a nice mystery. But Nicolas Cage's first appearance brings the film to almost a complete stop. I kept hoping the film would pick up the pace -- alas, when it did towards the climax the plot totally fell apart. There is no character development, no plot development and no reason to go see this film unless you're really dying for some movie popcorn. Perhaps, if you think that the movie industry needs a bailout, you might be willing to pay for this stinker. Oh, and the supporting actors stink, too. The kids are forgettable, the supporting actors, especially Rose Byrne, are atrocious. IMDb does not allow a zero stars rating -- shame, this film deserves one."

What about other people who don't believe in Jesus? Why they deserved to die as well? They even don't know why they are going to die. The movie even directly shot one scene that somehow a Japanese city being destroyed by the sun...sheesh..I was scared of this because people lived there might not be satisfied with this scene..They would rather say OK according to the Buddhism there is no end of the world, especially in such a harsh way...Watching this movie is like being taught a lesson that we non-Christians are all wrong.<br/><br/>This is purely a good-for-Christian movie, for those who are Christians and think end of the world is nigh and also cool...perhaps a way cooler when related to the science ...and Cage."

"Jay_Exiomo","5","5","12","25 March 2009"," Cage saves the day, barely
","Nicolas Cage's strong on screen charisma and genuineness makes the actor an archetypal lead for any film that requires saving the world from an impending apocalypse, and it's further evidenced in the otherwise disappointing ""Knowing."" Like an inelegant amalgam of an M. Night Shyamalan movie and a Fundamentalist direct-to-video, Alex Proyas' end-of-the-world sci-fi intriguingly pitches the idea of determinism-versus-randomness at the outset only to devolve into a cacophonous pile of genre clichés.<br/><br/>MIT astrophysics professor and preacher's kid John Koestler (Cage) has long abandoned his faith since his wife died a year earlier, finding solace in his firmly held belief that everything is an arbitrary result of complex chemical and physical reactions. However, on the 50th anniversary of his son's (Chandler Canterbury) school, each student is given a piece of paper that was buried in the ground by a group of schoolchildren in 1959, wherein drawn are the future as they envision it. John's son receives Lucinda Embry's (Lara Robinson) paper scribbled with seemingly random numbers, but as John closely inspects it, he realizes that these numbers are the dates of the major tragedies to have happened in the last five decades, and three more are about to take place.<br/><br/>As he has demonstrated most recently in ""I, Robot"" Proyas is a proficient director of mood and visual exhibition, yet just as with the the Will Smith-starrer, ""Knowing""'s promising ideas never translates into a lucid unit, tripping into a second act filled with heavy-handed religious undertones and a grab-bag of copiously borrowed scenes from its predecessors, culminating in an oh-so hackneyed Creationist tableau. ""Knowing""'s overt portentousness dilutes whatever arresting display it has, though it's all made at least mildly tolerable by the charismatic Cage who finds himself the quintessential guardian of the world that how apt, then, he almost becomes the savior of a possibly absolute schlock."

","I'm a big Nicholas Cage fan. His performance in this movie is up to his usual very high standards. The special effects are impeccable. Character development is very good. The BIG negative which keeps this flick from being an 8 or higher is the script for the last quarter. Too similar to Close Encounters of the Third Kind for me and others I've talked to. And NO ONE feels good where the hero, the heroine, and the Earth are all completely destroyed in the end. One feels the remorse of totally useless loss of the players and the planet. Most folks can't fault a flick if the hero or heroine dies for a glorious cause, such as Bruce Willis in Armageddon.

Proyas did something really amazing here. Knowing is keeping you on the edge of your seat for two hours and really delivers in the end. Something only very few movies really do. I love the suspense in the movie and all the religious hints and questions it is presenting... but mainly the movie works as an awesome standalone Sci-Fi/Horror movie. It can be compared to a movie like ""Signs"" which also is a great movie if you can use your imagination to fit some minor gaps and without thinking about each little detail too much. Highly recommended!"
"songjiang2000","10","4","9","6 July 2014"," Tightly Woven and Philosophically Interesting
","I'm not a big fan of Nicholas Cage, and from some of the other reviews I wasn't holding out a lot of hope for this one, but it works--really well.<br/><br/>For those who say the plot if full of holes, you need to watch it again. Roger Ebert was correct that everything little thing in this movie fits together perfectly. That is rare in thrillers.<br/><br/>Those who say the ending doesn't work, are probably biased one way or the other. If you are averse to religious themes, you won't like the implications of angels. If you are religious, you'll think the alien implications are cheesy. For me, I was waiting until the end of the movie--when you know it must be one or the other--ready to hate the choice Proyas made. Instead, I loved it because he doesn't tell you what it is. He lets it be both. If you are a literalist, you will probably hate this and think it's a cop-out. I took it as a simple metaphor of hope for meaning in a pretty hopeless world.<br/><br/>This is a thinking person's movie. And one question it grapples with is: what are the limits of scientific knowledge? We can trace the origins of everything back to the Big Bang, but what happened before that, and why is there anything instead of nothing? The movie doesn't tackle this directly, but it does indirectly. I'm not religious and don't believe in spirits or souls, but I loved this movie for how well it is crafted and how it got me thinking. <br/><br/>There is one significant flaw. The scene where Cage's character is in the classroom at MIT defining ""determinism"" and ""randomness"" is grossly inaccurate. He says that if everything is determined beforehand, then (there is a designer involved and therefore) there is meaning. This is simply not true. Determinism implies only inexorable cause-and-effect, not a designer. He is thinking of ""fatalism,"" and that is what this movie is about (and is something scientists don't study). Obviously, not everything is determined if the strangers (as Proyas calls them in the commentary) can decide things. They are creating the fates of the people on earth, while also leaving room for free choices. These ideas run deep in Western culture, and it is interesting to see them explored here, which is why this one flaw is excusable.<br/><br/>While watching the movie, pay close attention to the motivations of each of the characters. To me, they played out beautifully.<br/><br/>I take this movie to be an excellent sci-fi fable on the themes of fate and free will. Where do we come from? Is there any meaning in life? My own personal beliefs don't align with the director's, but he does a great job of illustrating what probably the majority of people in Western cultures do believe and have believed for thousands of years (I'm speaking of transcendent meaning in life, not of aliens).<br/><br/>Worth watching--and more than once."

Of course there is no in between because he is so sad he lost his wife.<br/><br/>They dig the time capsule and the astrophysics professor completely loses it thinking that the girl predicted the future and wrote it down in a numerical code. That reminded me of the documentation about the believer who thought he can predict catastrophes with the Tora's text when reading the letters like a cross-word riddle and the professor showed him that given enough words you can find anything in Tom Sawyer if you search hard (with computers).<br/><br/>But it gets worse. Everything comes true which are just some events left on the list that fit conveniently into ~50 minutes of Hollywood catastrophe movie. It seems like the ""plot"" was just an excuse for the SpecialFX department to get to work. The effects are impressive, but the events are completely random. It then goes X-Files style with mysterious black men which later become aliens that pick some animals including chosen humans onto a new planet with many explicit allusions to the Christian bible.<br/><br/>The movie ends with some people looting in an apocalyptic setting, father/son reuniting and the sun burning everything down. So what? Aliens mind-controlled the bible writers and keep order in the universe including the fate of every human being?

The whole premise for the film is that Cage works out the hidden meaning in the numbers written in a mad dash by a youngster. Not, incidentally, that that seems to have anything significant to do with the plot. But hang on, towards the end of the film, his son is writing unstoppably, surely this must have some meaning?!<br/><br/>No, he screws the paper up and throws it away. That's it.

","An extremely unintellectual plagiarism of Arthur C. Clarke's ""Childhood's End"", stripped of any depth to make room for three rather unspectacular special effects sequences that contributed nothing to the story. M. Night Shyamalan was able to depict the full weight and horror of a train wreck without showing one second of the train wreck. That is the difference between a writer/director and this train wreck of a film. The technological holes would put a sieve to shame. Why bother contacting children who would be old before the event? Was there eugenics going on or were they just watching if the sensitives would beget more sensitives who would be of the right age at the end? If the whispering was telepathic, why was the boy receiving it in his hearing aid? Were he sensitive, would he not hear it regardless? Why did the aliens work in secret when their aim to save the children would have been welcome to the public? Surely such beings who can leap between the stars would not end up racing around at the last minute as if they had no control over the situation. What were the stones for? Nothing, apparently, except as base material for a landing zone for ships that never actually set down. If the aliens cared about the children, and were so advanced, would they not be aware that they had driven at least one little girl into a psychotic episode, and still do nothing about it? And the picture of two white kids at the end with two white rabbits on a very beige planet with white trees, rescued by white guys with white hair who turned out to be glowing white featureless beings, bore some undertones that left me uncomfortable. The planet at the end was pretty, though, like one of those 1960s apocryphal posters. That's about the only redeeming factor. It would make a nice background image on one's computer.

","A truly stupid movie. The initial plot device of being privy to forewarning of impending disasters, which gives the movie it's title, turns out to have no actual impact on the events that subsequently transpire. No explanation as to why only the children are ""taken"", no explanation as to the significance of the black rocks and aliens who travel light years to get here but make their escape in a car. Maybe the best comedy for some time. Nicholas Cage always provides some giggles. Avoid at all costs if you are seeking good Sci-Fi. By all means see it if you are after a ""so bad it's funny"" experience.Unmitigated drivel."

","MIT Professor Jonathan Koestler (Nicholas Cage) discovers a list of numbers. Realizing that they are the dates of past, present, and future disasters, Professor Koestler sets out to stop them (only the ones closest to home) all by himself.<br/><br/>I always wonder when stories like this one are written why the screenwriter doesn't have the main character sound the alarm, get professionals to help, call in the cavalry, ring Batman on the bat phone? Anyone else? <br/><br/>When Koestler realizes that aliens are behind the prophetic writing, and influencing his young son, the confused professor must make the decision of all decisions.<br/><br/>The point of this story is to let everyone know that aliens are populating planets by kidnapping young children. So the next time a child goes missing, and you read that certain animals are on the endangered species list, just remember that the children and the docile little creatures are all in a better place populating other planets. Smacks of Scientology, if you ask me. Port Authority Bus Terminal. Mid 70s. Scientologists shoving L. Ron Hubbard's book in my hands. Then asking for $2.00.

","Considering the average of the movie evaluation was 6.5/10 at IMDb when I had watched knowing, I was highly disappointed eventually. I cannot believe how Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times could give this movie an ""A"" and call it one of the best SF he has seen"". However, according to him ""The plot involves the most fundamental of all philosophical debates: Is the universe deterministic or random"". I admit, this is interesting. However, did I get something wrong? This is just a very small part of the movie and in case it should be the main aspect,it has been handled very badly. Better listen to the 90% of critics who gave ""knowing"" a ""C"" or ""D"".<br/><br/>The main problem of the movie concerns the numerous holes in the plot!!! The longer I watched the movie, the more questions came to my mind. For example, the list of numbers show the worldwide disasters, but the next two big ones are only in New York?????? Why was Calen (Koestler's son) still writing ""numbers"" after the big crash was forecasted? And in the end, I was just loving. I am sorry, but the whole ""alien warned you, but needs ages to contact you directly"" part is ridiculous. All the hassle with the 50years old list, no better way of communication? Sorry, I no way I can buy this."
"the-real-zeus","1","4","9","9 September 2009"," Science fiction is more serious than it looks
","Some user comments on IMDb start with ""I registered in just to give zero stars to this movie but unfortunately one star is the minimum I am allowed to give."" I remember wondering what kind of a movie would make you say that.<br/><br/>Well, I was asking for it! Knowing, not only made me to register 'to give zero stars' but also made me realize that science fiction is a very serious genre.<br/><br/>What does it take to make science fiction? First of all you must know some basic science. Then you must know how culture and religion interact and in particular you must know that there are many different religions and cultures on this planet. You must also know history, and yes there are different nations with different histories. Besides you should know how philosophical arguments throughout the history have shaped human life. And needles to say, you must have read a lot of books.<br/><br/>If you have the above minimum requirements then to start science fiction you must be equipped with a genuine curiosity and willingness to learn.<br/><br/>Once you are in the game, whether you will be successful or not will be determined by the level of the imagination and talent you have.<br/><br/>Let us start to apply these criteria to the team of Knowing.<br/><br/>Do they know some basic science? My impression is that the closest they came to science is when they visited a nearby university campus to eye young women! The rest of the list need not be checked since it will require on my part a tremendous amount of care to write a criticism which will not be mistaken as an insult. And I don't want to go through all that trouble.<br/><br/>After all my only intention was to give zero stars to a masquerade of a movie.<br/><br/>Here are some fun points from the movie.<br/><br/>There is a lecture in an MIT class. The professor throws a ball, representing the Sun, to a student and asks about its temperature. The student quickly recites and throws the ball back. My daughter says this is exactly what they did in their elementary school. Well, what did I say about the team's background in science? <br/><br/>Nicholas Cage, as usual, walks around the movie with the same face expression and tone of voice he is using in all of his movies (not a criticism, just an observation.) The only change this time, to make you think that he is a university teacher, is that he has shaved some of his front hair. Talk about imagination! <br/><br/>Aliens whisper into Lucinda's mind the prophecy of future disasters and she writes them down. But this is put into a time capsule so that nobody can access this information until after they are realized. Are aliens stupid? <br/><br/>When the end of the world finally arrives (here you cheer a little bit because may be it also promises that the end of the movie is near) the aliens take some young Adams and Eves to other habitable planets. Why did they wait until the very end? The young Adams and Eves are around ten years old each and they are allowed to take a pair of rabbits with them. What a way to ensure that the humans will multiply. Are aliens stupid? <br/><br/>John (I am finished with Nicholas Cage) holds a gun to an alien and the alien opens his mouth from where a devastating light emerges together with a tremendous sound which knocks off John and renders him helpless. No, I am not entering into the technical details about where such energy comes from. Remember what I said about the team's background in science? But on their second encounter, John again holds a gun to the same alien and yells at him. Is John, an MIT professor, stupid? <br/><br/>When John says that they will be safe in a cave, Diana believes him without questioning. After all he is a professor at MIT, right? But later when the same John says that his most recent calculations reveal that they will not be safe even in a cave, Diana says that she does not believe him. Why, is she stupid? <br/><br/>I can go on and on but I realize that a serious criticism of the movie will be much longer than the script, if there ever was one.<br/><br/>Art, even a Hollywood movie, is received well when it reflects life through the prism of the artist. And life is many faceted with each of us walking along a different road. This movie fails miserably in creating an image of life through an artistic interpretation.<br/><br/>Instead, the team of the movie gives the impression that they know all. Unfortunately, what they know is such a small fraction of what there is to know."

","The Movie That Was Advertised: Fifty years ago, a bunch of schoolchildren are given an assignment to draw a picture about what the world will be like fifty years in the future. They all draw their pictures, throw them into a time capsule and it's sealed up. Fifty years later (present day) the capsule is opened and one of the ""pictures"" is a page full of digits -- who put it there or what they mean is a mystery. Nick Cage get a hold of the page of digits and after pouring over it and much research discovers that it's a list of the dates and number of people killed in every major disaster in the past fifty years, plus there are a few disasters yet-to-come that he has to try and stop. Who could have put this in the time capsule? How was this possible? Why?<br/><br/>Sounds like a pretty cool premise for a movie, right? I thought so as well. Unfortunately, that's not the movie we got to see. What we saw was this:<br/><br/>Fifty years ago a really freaky and disturbed girl who hears voices suggests to her school that they create a time capsule. The other kids all put drawings in, but she puts in the aforementioned list of numbers, and then proceeds to go hide in the basement. Fifty years go by, the capsule is opened, Nick Cage gets the sheet of numbers and after about ten seconds realizes what it is. He finds the freaky girl's daughter and granddaughter (the freaky girl herself is long dead) and realizes that while the freaky girl was hiding in the basement, she scrawled GPS coordinates of where to go when the apocalypse comes on the basement door (no really). They go to these coordinates where aliens take the granddaughter, Nick Cage's son and a pair of rabbits to a new planet so they can re-populate (really, I'm not making this up). Then the apocalypse comes and everybody else dies.<br/><br/>Too bad. The movie advertised in the trailer looked intriguing. Perhaps somebody will actually make it someday."

","There is a depressingly regular cycle that the American film industry goes through which every now and then throws up a bunch of movies about how the world is going to be destroyed. <br/><br/>What promises to be an initially interesting premise turns stupid towards the end, ruining what might have been rather a good film.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage is a university astrophysics lecturer who's wife was killed in a hotel fire a year previously leaving him with a semi-deaf son and a fairly severe drinking problem. The opening of a time capsule at his son's school unearths a sheet of paper filled with apparently random numbers. It quickly becomes apparent that the numbers reveal the dates and numbers of dead in every major disaster since the paper was put in the time capsule in 1959. There are only three sets of numbers left unaccounted for and these appear to predict disasters on the next three following days.<br/><br/>It is in the nature of the film that it is almost impossible to discuss it without writing a spoiler. For those not interested in reading a spoiler I would say this film is average. It has some decent acting and a couple of fantastic set pieces but is let down by a weak ending. It is moderately enjoyable but I probably wouldn't bother unless you are a big Nic Cage fan.<br/><br/>Spoiltastic<br/><br/>Things I liked about this movie: <br/><br/>1. When Nic Cage takes the numbers round to his mate and says ""look, all these numbers sequentially refer to the date and number of deaths in every major international disaster for the last 50 years"" his friend says ""Nah, this is just a coincidence"". <br/><br/>2. The mysterious people chasing Nic and his son around all look like cut-rate Billy Idol impersonators (or Spike from Buffy impersonators if you are from the younger generation). <br/><br/>3. Apparently the Billy Idol impersonators meant the page of numbers to be a warning – which were immediately sealed for 50 years in a time capsule which gets opened about three days before the predictions run out. So not that useful a warning, really. <br/><br/>4. The earth gets destroyed by a solar flare so massive that it ignites the atmosphere and cooks everything. Even a 10 mile high placard saying ""You're going to get roasted by a solar flare"" wouldn't have been that much use so providing any warning at all was a bit pointless. <br/><br/>5. Nic says ""the radiation from the solar flare will penetrate a thousand miles into the Earth's crust"". I'm no expert but I don't think any form of radiation penetrates further than 50 feet or so into solid rock. <br/><br/>6. When the children are taken away we see perhaps 20 other spaceships leaving the earth. Any biologist will tell you that you need several hundred if not several thousand individuals to provide a stable genetic base for a population. <br/><br/>7. The children are taken by the aliens to an idyllic planet but are given two gigantic white rabbits to bring with them. It is unclear whether this is a snack or whether the aliens intend the planet to be a rabbit infested desert in about 20 years. <br/><br/>8. The children are dumped on the eden-planet with only the clothes they stand up in and no understanding of basic farming, fishing or anything useful. I predict that they'll last about a week, maybe two.<br/><br/>End Spoilerationism<br/><br/>Like most recent movies about an apocalypse this film tries to have it cake and eat it by showing the destruction of the planet but also having a hopeful message. In the end this was better than The Day the Earth Stood Bored – which isn't much of a recommendation."

","I'm a director fan more than an actor fan. Nicholas Cage I enjoy occasionally, though he seems to be in as many bad movies as he is good. Alex Proyas cemented my attention with The Crow and Dark City, and then earned my disdain with I, Robot. I hoped Knowing would be another winner --- after all, Roger Ebert liked it -- but it was not to be.<br/><br/>The kiddie cast was largely pleasing, Lara Robinson (Abby / Lucinda) more so than Chandler Canterbury (Caleb Koestler). Our heroine, Rose Byrne (Diana) reminded me of a younger Jennifer Connelly. I meant that as a compliment.<br/><br/>If you liked M. Night Shyamalan's Signs, then you have already seen Knowing, except Knowing wasn't as good, and I consider Signs to be one of the worst pictures I have seen in the last ten years. Only Transformers 2 scores lower on my suck-o-meter.<br/><br/>It started out well, with an intriguing premise tautly directed. Then the whole thing devolved into the sort of twaddle that made What Dreams May Come such a bad picture. If you liked What Dreams May Come, then you might consider this review an endorsement.<br/><br/>They dumbed down the concept of determinism to the point that it was egregiously wrong, but that's perhaps a minor quibble only interesting to philosophy majors.<br/><br/>Profoundly disappointing."

","Wow. I'm definitely in the ""give-me-back-my-two-hours"" camp on this one. Based on the trailer I already had pretty low expectations for this movie (Cage's recent filmography did't help here either), expecting something on a similar level as ""Next"". In other words, I expected a movie based on an interesting concept that would be butchered into something gaudy but which I would ultimately accept because I have an active imagination. ""Knowing"" delivered exactly that for the majority of the film but the ending is what robbed me of enjoying it on even this level.<br/><br/>It becomes clear at the end that this movie is basically a trick. It lures you in with the promise of being a somewhat amusing film to watch on a rainy day, when nothing else is on. But as it turns out, this is all meant to grab your undivided attention so that it can preach to you.<br/><br/>The ending seems to be someone's notion of the reconciliation of science and religion but from a Christian angle. I would be fine with this if that were the subject of the entire film or if some thought provoking ideas were presented. Instead the movie just slaps you in the face with it at the end and says ""here you go, this is what you should believe"" and then draws the curtains. End of argument. No opportunity to really think about or debate the possibilities, the movie is simply over. The last idea fed into your head (right after attempting to emotionally disarm you with derived sob scenes) is that these alien-angel hybrids--who somehow possess knowledge of the future--are our gods and believing in them will deliver you into salvation.<br/><br/>Ugh... this is like when someone innocently befriends you, asks you to come out to a ""get together"" one evening which turns out to be a Bible study or sermon.

I have a poster of this saying on my wall as I am typing this. I bought the poster two years after my grandpa's passing. The point here my friends is, this movie was original.

","Knowing. Knowing how to write a better movie would be better. I saw the movie, and it wasn't worth knowing. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie. It was pretty mediocre. There were a lot of WTF moments in the movie. A couple of plot holes that I'm still trying to figure out. This movie had potential, but there were some issues. The idea of having numbers that predicted terrible events happening could've been interesting, but the fact that people die in large numbers every day would mean a larger paper. Excuse me, movie, but in the whole frame of the death charts. Any number from 100 to 5000 is too much, compare to the number of large deaths of 5000 or more that would fit the paper more. The movie starts out when a time capsule is opened, and a boy find and read a paper with numbers. His widowed father Jonathan Koestler (Nicolas Cage), a professor of astrophysics at MIT, notices the numbers have a specific set of sequences referring to the times and locations of fatal disasters over the last 50 years, including 911012996 (the date and death toll of the 9/11 attacks) and the last three sets of digits are dated in the immediate future. Once again, in the world map, 2996 is pretty small amount of death compare to the world population that die on Sept. 11, 2001 outside of the event. On average day, 6,744 die in the US only, in the world 155,000 or more. Anyways, Jonathan seeks to try to prevention another tragedy. The movie has some of the best special and visual effects. The train and airplane scene alone is chilling and looks decently realistic in terms of effects. Still, having tested the supposition under controlled laboratory condition and double-checked the findings, I can confirm that yes it is indeed easy to laugh at a burning moose in one scene in the film. The acting is OK. Nicolas Cage's character is just Nicolas Cage. What is happening with Nicolas Cage's hair? You will realize his hair is growing in one seriously odd pattern starting about halfway back on his skull. Most of the movie, Cage will spent staring at things. The characters are just cookie cutter Sci-Fi channel composites. Director Alex Proyas did a good job at sticking true the film's Twilight Zone-ism premise without copping out. Another thing, if you are not very very religious, you might have another problem watching this movie. There is a lot of Biblical references that will have to get used to. I kinda dislike the psychological manipulation and propaganda by using sci-fi and suspense techniques to dishonestly deliver an ultimate message of one-sided religious salvation. Knowing can also means Scientology according to their beliefs, since Nicholas Cage is a confirmed Scientologist. The movie is up to interpretation of what it is trying to say. The twist of Knowing, well, without spoiling it, I would hardly even call it a twist. It's just the movie dumps out everything it did in the beginning and starts anew with this new situation, which has nothing to do with the numbers. Makes me wonder what happens if you were pregnant in this movie toward the end. What happens to you? The ending with Nicolas Cage and his father probably will make fathers cry and hold their children. When the movie concludes, I was like you got to be kidding me, and come on. Still, 'Knowing' is a good enough movie to enjoy. If only I could have seen the future I wouldn't have buy it, just rent it."

Wordlessly, he reaches down. There is a faint zipping sound, a pause. Then the unmistakable sound of urine landing parabolically upon carpet.<br/><br/>The audience neither shrinks, nor exclaims, and nobody makes any attempt to stop the man. Rather, after a moment there is a faint chorus of ""Hmmm, hmmmm...."" and various sounds of agreement. ""Yes, yes. I see where he is coming from. Hmmm..."" says a learned voice in the darkness.<br/><br/>There is a slow flurry of activity. It builds to a crescendo. In mere minutes the entire audience, from babes in arms to the elderly and infirm, are dropping their restraining inner garments and voiding their bodily fluids over the cinema and its furniture.<br/><br/>The manager runs in, and attempts to calm the situation. But he only makes it worse. He implores the audience not to take out their wrath on the cinema itself, but the audience shakes its collective head. You took our money, a lot of our money. Now, it is you who will pay.<br/><br/>Finally, the managers phone rings. Yes, he manages to convey, yes, he will give everyone their money back. The rioting hordes subside, and with a slightly sulfurous dignity they file out.<br/><br/>Wearily the cleaners trudge in with their heavy equipment. This is the fifth screening of 'Knowing', and they wonder when this madness will stop.<br/><br/>When you watch an Ed Wood film, your senses inform you very quickly that this is a product of tremendous enthusiasm, but of no talent whatsoever at all. And knowing that, one can enjoy the glorious train wreck. 'Knowing' that - fore armed with the knowledge that this is a turkey, and it is to be served as turkey.<br/><br/>'Knowing' does not do this. 'Knowing' is the worst kind of film. For the first half it will promise deep intrigue, and even hint that they might be about to do some edutainment. Perhaps some obscure maths principle is going to be the decider here. Promises of 'Pi', and 'Primer' (almost). And it keeps the hooks in, till just after half way.<br/><br/>After that.... really, its probably best NOT discussed. There would be those still traumatised out there from being hit in the face by a supersonic wall of shyte. Shyte.

","If you isolate the extremely vague phrase of ""sh** just happens"" without any context, yeah, maybe you can figure a way into making it relate to astrophysics. In order to do that, you'd have to do some research in order to understand astrophysics enough to find a connection. If you haven't done that, then this a question that comes out of a lack of knowledge of the subject. That means that you've reached a conclusion without understanding.<br/><br/>This is exactly the major problem with this movie, and the context that this comment probably comes from when Cage's Astrophysicist character utters it. The writer has absolutely no knowledge of science, the scientific method, what scientists and professors actually do or anything remotely related to the subject. Unfortunately, he then decided to sit down and write a movie that incorporated and depended on key characters that were supposed to represent, not only the scientific community, but scientists who were educated in a very specific subject. Oops.<br/><br/>It's obvious that this writer wrote this movie doing absolutely no research into the subject that he tries to use in the movie and makes major assumptions about it. This says three major problems with this writer.<br/><br/>First, he's extremely lazy and sloppy, as he will just make up anything off the top of his head to get the story to reach the conclusion that he wants. He doesn't care if any of the characters or ideas are properly represented or consistent - just as long as he gets to his ridiculous ending.<br/><br/>Secondly, he assumes that his audience his equally lazy and stupid, otherwise he would have realized that anyone that studied science, even minutely, would find the premise and the characters to be completely ridiculous.<br/><br/>Now this last flaw leads to this writers third problem - he's dirt stupid. He is so incredibly stupid that he doesn't even understand that he doesn't understand certain subjects - to the point that he completes and releases a story and characters based on information that he doesn't understand at all. He just assumes that he knows enough to write about the subject, and that he doesn't see the monumental issues in his own screenplay. These problems would've been caught in a junior college writing class. There's no way that he even bothered to have anyone look at it before releasing it to a studio. He's just dumb.<br/><br/>So yeah, in the context of story, ""sh** just happens"" is a monumentally stupid thing to say, by a character that is poorly written in a sloppy movie that doesn't realize it's own stupidity."
"Dodger-9","1","3","6","10 April 2010"," Knowing (it sucks) and warning you to avoid
","***This review contains spoilers *** Oh dear, where to start? Okay, for a movie obsessed with numbers, here's three you need to know: 1.12 - or rather 1hr 12 mins - the time at which this promising movie goes off the rails with an annoying twist straight out of The Forgotten and countless other poor sci-fi flicks. For a man who works at MIT, it's obvious our moping hero doesn't recognise a plot device that was used in Close Encounters back in the late seventies. Hmm, a series of random numbers. Ooh, they're all dates when disasters happen and the number of casualties. Ooh, but what are these unaccounted for numbers? Could they be co-ordinates? How about yes Nicolas Cage? Yes, they are and yes i saw the same plot device used when i was 10 years old in Close Encounters. Knowing isn't a bad film for that first 72 minutes. The plot unfolds nicely and the premise is good. Cage is okay, not great and it ticks over nicely. But as that shark looks into view at the 72min mark i found myself getting angry as the inevitable twist loomed its large, ugly head - then the movie jumped said shark. And from that point on it just got worse. Remember that annoyed feeling you may have felt at the end of Contact when Jodie Foster lands on an alien planet and it looks like something from a holiday advert (aka a complete sell out?) That's mild compared to the hideous mess of a resolution at the end of Knowing. And that last half hour of AI, with the rubbish aliens? Also as bad here, complete with a spaceship that still looks like CGI artwork pitched to the producers, complete with stupid floaty contraptions that are utterly pointless (even a fantasy film has to have some logic). As for the protracted ending in which Cage emotes to his son for what seems like days, well that's 10 minutes of my life i'll never get back. I've seen some bad films in my time but Knowing ranks up there with Rancid Aluminium as one of the worst. Three words: avoid, avoid, avoid."

We look at the struggle of the people we don't believe. And consequently give no it about their pain and fears. 3) religion references are very dangerous thing to play with due to the fact that people rarely agree on something, concerning their faith. so i disliked that part of the film a lot. 4) the pace of the film is so slow and the plot turns so randomly and illogical, that you laugh instead of care about what is happening with the characters. 5) the aliens-slash-angels are looking like Nazi pedophiles and the way they gave bunnies to kids made me feel like a witness of a child molesting. 6) at least the way the earth was destroyed made me feel satisfied. i would really like not to have such a stupid people, starting new humanity... oh and by the way - don't get me wrong - but wasn't that boy partially deaf? it can be genetic, so those aliens had epic fail choosing their... um.. chosen..."

","First off- Nicolas Cage... He is, in my opinion, a dry, horrible actor so I wasn't expecting much. The main kid, Caleb, as well as several extras were awful read-with-a-script-in-their-hands actors as well. The plot is next to nil. An appropriate metaphor would be if X-Files and Star Trek (two of my most favorite shows) had a mentally retarded bastard child. Seriously. And I would have to throw a Sunday morning sermon in there, too. It's like Sci-fi meets drama. The main character discovers information of the utmost importance, but yet still has the time to dwell upon his bad relationship with his father, his religion, yada yada. The actors keep making the same predictable mistakes over and over. I had the whole movie figured out in about 20 minutes. Don't waste your time! Unless you liked and sat through the awfulness that is The Day the Earth Stood Still. Go watch I Am Legend instead. Mostly different genres, but still- watch it!"
"melbadeo","1","3","6","24 June 2009"," How I ruined a Monday evening ...
","This is maybe the worst movie I've seen so far in this century. It's not that I really put much expectation into this. After watching some of Cage's last mystery slowpokes as Next"" or The Wicker Man"" I should know what to expect from Oscar prize winner and former Independent movie star Nicolas Cage. But anyway I hoped to be someway entertained on a Monday evening after a day of work in a multimillion Dollar Hollywood way, but I wasn't.<br/><br/>The main problem of the movie is the story. A colleague asked me at lunchtime about yesterday evening, so I told him about the movie and put together the plot in a few words but accidentally started to laugh, at: the world ended and everybody died but his little son and his little girlfriend, who were saved by angel like aliens and set out on an other planet were they run over cheesy fields ahead a very old tree."" This Happy Ending"" is quite grotesque. The whole story is silly and totally implausible. An unhappy, alcoholic Astronomy Professor founds accidentally a list of numbers indicating date, location and number of victims of every major catastrophe the western world suffered during the last 50 years. Some catastrophes the oriental and third world suffered are mentioned too, but as we learned from western media people there are not as important as we are. Since some of them are not happened yet he asks himself questions about randomness and destiny before he realizes world's ending tomorrow. Later the world ended and everybody died but  I really do not know what to say about this. It's just so stupid. Maybe the writers thought a story about randomness and destiny would allow the book to develop in such way so ridiculous casualties can happen totally unexplained.<br/><br/>The acting is widely tolerable and Nicolas Cage shows another time he handles getting egg on his face better then anyone else. His trademark since ""Raising Arizona"". Nevertheless it does not fit well in his role, just because ""Knowing"" is not in a bit ironic. A necessary ingredient for a good Cage, even in such a tragic movie as ""Leaving Las Vegas"" was.<br/><br/>One scene should be mentioned. The only highlight of the movie is the crashing of the plane ""accidentally"" next to the place were Nicolas Cage is caught up in a traffic jam. Impressive is Cage's walk through the crash side right after the plane came down. Out of the debris rise burning survivors shouting for help while parts of the wreckage are still exploding. The camera is shadowing Cage like in a documentary, which makes the scene not as dramatic at it could be but drastically realistic. After all I do not know how realistic burning survivors shouting for help are after such a plane crash but it felt incredibly intense and real. <br/><br/>It's the kind of Hollywood production you wouldn't easy notice how bad it is if you turn down the volume. It was just to expensive. But after all it's still trash. Maybe I should reconsider my vote on this movie just because of one interesting scene. Maybe two stars instead of one? Better not – someway this movie ruined my Monday evening."

","The new thriller, Knowing is going to be useful for one thing in the future. That thing is to show film students the kind of movie you should never make. Nicolas Cage stars as Professor John Koelster, who upon teaching his students everything happens for a reason, picks up a paper his son took, and realizes the numbers on it show all of the major death crashes since the year the paper was made. The unrealistic part of this is that John would never actually recognize that the numbers of dates of death crashes. Rose Byrne comes in as Diana Wayland, a woman helping John. They have no chemistry at all. But what do you need good chemistry for when this movie is already this bad? The movie is admittedly creepy, it has some good crashes, and a creepy beginning, but the movie itself was so terrible it didn't matter. The movie's problem is it knows how to be creepy, but not how to be good. Towards the end, the movie becomes predictable. You know, but cannot believe what is about to happen.

However If you have had a stressful week and are looking for some light entertainment, this film is probably not for you. I considered walking out, it was one of the worst films I have seen in awhile<br/><br/>The film starts in 1959 with a strange little girl is able to predict catastrophic events where lots of people die. She deposits a page of numbers into a time capsule which is re-opened in 2009. She forecasts the end of the world and becomes a very odd woman who dies living alone. Nick Cage analyzes patterns in the numbers and bizarre things start to happen.<br/><br/>Nick Cage's character is not very appealing. He plays an alcoholic, MIT professor who grieves for his dead wife. Cage's character is unhappy, estranged from his family and won't let his young son do normal things like play soccer or stay with friends. The movie features creepy aliens who turn up periodically and just watch, we don't find out their role until the end. <br/><br/>Biblical prophesy is mentioned and there is some discussion about predestination but you feel it's just been included to appease any Christians who might be watching. You never discover how the aliens, the Bible and the little girl's predictions all fit together. The aliens could be working with God but it's all rather confusing and hard to understand. At the end of the day I didn't care, because it all seemed very silly. <br/><br/>There are several catastrophic events which look spectacular on screen, but the acting is overwrought and the film gloomy.

I wanted to find out why the movie took this kind of a turn....the answer was revealed when I referred to the Holy Bible. This story has been actually done based on the prophecies of Ezekiel. If you read this section from the scriptures, one would be amazed about the most fairy-tale like parts of the movie, even of the four strangers. They are angles as per the scriptures. When you understand this part, the meaning of the movie becomes different.

If you watch the ""The legend of Atlantis"", if you read a few words about pleiadians, the movie will make more sense to you. It will really make you think about your existence. No movie, no book, nothing that happens to you is without reason. To see the reasons behind things, you have to open your heart, and you have to open your mind. If you have a strict belief system, if you're stubborn, there is no way for you to understand anything. This is why if Jesus dared to come back to earth we would kill him again.

You do have to accept that the film has a bit of a hokey ending. (And if you do that, it won't bother you.) But it's a great thrill ride start to finish. It may not be perfect, but no film is and I definitely can't find much, if anything, to complain about.<br/><br/>The characters are well acted and intriguing. Nic Cage is very good in this, even if he'll never be good enough for some. The writing is very good too. It keeps the audience involved and makes them care about the characters. The film also has a good level of suspense. The ""whisper people"" add a nice chill to the movie.<br/><br/>It also provokes thought.

It may take a bit of suspension of belief to accept, but if that happens, it's not as bad as some make it sound. And compared to other endings I saw, it's great.<br/><br/>All in all, it was an enjoyable thrill ride I won't soon forget and plan to get when it comes to DVD.

","The intent of this film is underscored until the final minutes when it strictly lays out its purpose. You can see from the trailer KNOWING is about the end of the world, but it doesn't quite let you in on the thought-provoking illustration it brings from the Book of Revelations. Expect to see something partly in the style of The Reaping (2007), but with deeper emotions and a much more authentic goal. KNOWING creates several dramatic disasters that in no way feel exaggerated, hokey or unbelievable. They are awe-inspiring and make us look closer at the signs that tell us not much time is left on this earth.<br/><br/>As a true to life drama and with a better cast, I believe KNOWING would've worked more effectively. What comes out 3/20 somewhat muddies its spiritual intent by serving up most of the film as a science-fiction tale of numbers and spooky extra-terrestrials. And its closing interpretation of how exactly Revelations will be fulfilled is both truth and fiction."

","Saw a special viewing tonight before the general release. My overall impression of the film was good, and I would recommend seeing it. <br/><br/>Let me start by saying Cage is far from my favorite actor, and his performance here is about what I expected. There are three scenes that qualify as special effects, a plane crash, a train crash, and the ending. I'm not sure if the effects are good enough to stand up to repeated viewing. They are good the first time because they catch you by surprise. An aluminum subway car cuts thru or destroys multiple reinforced concrete support columns and shreds another train headed in the opposite direction good action, but the physics aren't plausible. You have to ""read a lot between the lines"" in this movie to understand what drives the character personalities. We don't really know why Cage drinks and we are left to wonder why he goes into a blank stare at the end of his lecture. I would have liked to know more about the relationship between Cage and his father and ""Lucinda"" and her daughter. There is a fair amount of religious undertone in this movie including strange alien like figures that seem to turn into glowing angels complete with wings. There could have been a lot more Sci in this Sci-Fi flick especially considering Cage's character is an MIT professor. The drama felt hollow and emotionless. I wanted to feel for the crying mother and infant on the subway, but felt nothing. Same when Cage cries as he gives up his son  I didn't feel anything. Some movies make you feel angry or sad etc  really working your emotions. This movie left me numb, empty, nothing. Cage goes thru two major disasters in just a few days and after each we just get a blank stare from him and the line ""don't let Caleb watch the news"". I feel like the story could have been told in more detail. The Sci-Fi buff in me wanted a lot more science. The drama lover in me wanted some real heart rendering emo. Sadly, this movie does neither very well."

","the movie Knowing... well the trailer pretty much sums up all the parts that make sense and the rest of the movie lets just say didn't flow well (for me) I left wondering if maybe Nic Cage's character would have been better played by Dennis Quaid... or ANYBODY else for that matter. Nic Cage's acting talent is extremely wooden and limited... see Ghost Rider for a detailed look at his stiff acting abilities.<br/><br/>It's not that knowing the numbers equal various dates and death tolls of worldwide tragedies was that hard to figure out, no, apparently you can figure it out over the course of one long 6 hour sleepless night. What makes less sense is that Nic Cage's kid Caleb keeps being visited by ""the blonde people who whisper"" and apparently these people leave little black stones (the adults all think the stones are scary) It was here that I lost it because the blonde people are actually an alien race (of alien angels?) coming to abduct the children in their spaceship... uh Kay. These alien/angels allow the children to come with them but without their parents (in one scene they ATTACK the father with light and a shriek emitting out of their mouth...but they get to bring along little white rabbits instead? The girl that originally wrote down all these end of days numbers is Lucinda, and she's nuts. She stares off into the stars wondering WTF is going on (although the real movie hasn't started yet so what is she wondering about???) later on in the movie, Nic Cage's son Caleb also begins to write down numbers in the EXACT same nutty psychotic manner that Lucinda did (now remember when she did it in the 1950's, it was important and drove the plot forward) when Caleb does the exact same thing, the father realizes that Lucinda's final longitude/Latitude numbers were written on the back of a gym door back in the '50's and completely ignores all the numbers that Caleb was writing... uh Kay. (oh OK so the world is about to end and they are panicking left and right but still...) in the end the world is destroyed by a sun flare but not before the blonde whispering people forcefully kidnap the two children and herd them into their spaceship to ""reseed"" another greener peaceful planet, anyway... the earth burned up good and Nic Cage burns with it... why even give him the numbers at all if there's nothing he can do to stop it from happening? Apparently the whole point was for Nic Cage to deliver his child to the aliens to be whisked away to a far off planet with a tree (is this the Biblical Garden of Eden?)and rabbits, while he burns to a flaming crisp with EE (EE =Everyone Else according to Lucinda).<br/><br/>Some people in our theater started to clap.. until they realized nobody else was clapping.. the boy's father and the girl's mother were both dead along with the entire planet Earth and the children were abducted by space aliens to reseed another alien planet...with bunnies.<br/><br/>The End."

History is immutable. The so-called hero, after he goes through all this trouble to unravel the code...is powerless to save his own son. And apparently even angels (excuse me, aliens) who are capable of either time travel or extremely specific precognition...are uninterested in doing anything beyond saving thirty or forty kids. <br/><br/>Like ""The Forgotten"" (SPOILER!) about a mother whose child vanishes not only physically, but from all human record or memory except hers, this story resorts to advanced extraterrestrials to explain its mystery. <br/><br/>But the aliens here are a pretty useless bunch. They can predict the moment of a deadly solar flare 50 years in advance (not to mention many other much smaller disasters). So what do they do? Contact authorities, awe them with their predictions, get them building giant space arks to save a big chunk of the world's population (and, by the way, the culture that makes them human, as opposed to primate specimens)? Do these angels care about the incredible biodiversity of the doomed Earth? Nope. They'll whisk away a few dozen kids and some housepets (and to hell with everyone and everything else) then maroon them on an alien planet. No older members of their species, no technology to help them when, I dunno, it rains or snows...or someday a meteor comes along. <br/><br/>In six months, we'd be watching ""The Lord of the Flies.""<br/><br/>Apparently, all that these incredibly wise, angelic aliens care to preserve is our genetic stock (psi-power sub-variety). Socrates? Aquinas? Da Vinci, Shakespeare, Mozart, Jefferson, Emily Dickinson, Buster Keaton, Louis Armstrong, Tina Fey? Naah. Who needs that crap?

"AliasHaneke","3","21","87","10 March 2009"," The only disaster not predicted here... was the movie itself.
","Considering Nicolas Cage's recent filmography, expectations for Knowing are already pretty low, but there was hope in that Alex Proyas, a director who seems to have mastered a fascinating Gothic/sci-fi hybrid in previous cult classics such as Dark City and The Crow, could produce the goods. However, despite being well shot and often being unsettlingly atmospheric, the film could never hope to overcome such a messy and cliché screenplay.<br/><br/>When Caleb, well acted by young Chandler Canterbury, receives a list of numbers from a school time capsule, his father John (Nicolas Cage) who is conveniently an astrophysicist doesn't take long to figure out that the numbers correctly predicted every major disaster for the last fifty years. The plot thickens when John becomes obsessed with stopping three predictions yet to occur.<br/><br/>What was a moderately intriguing premise is heavily handled, using every possible cliché with soap opera dialogue to accompany it. Cage doesn't do much with the material either, basically just looking miserable to be there, but can you blame him? Australia's Rose Byrne is a cast highlight, but once again in undone by an overwrought script principally requiring her to shriek and sob for the children.<br/><br/>The disaster scenes themselves are conversely spectacular with dazzling special effects. These scenes are well orchestrated and become the highlight of a dull film, communicating the horror of the disasters effectively. There are also other little moments of genuine suspense that intrigue, but are ultimately bogged down by surrounding tripe capped with a conclusion that had audience's chuckling and eye rolling."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","3","3","7","14 January 2014"," Catchy premise,....terrible execution
","There are people who believe that things happen for a reason and then there are people who believe things happen out of randomness. As if there is no order to how the universe works - it just happens by chance. But what if there was an actual systematic method to knowing (ergo the title) when such major tragic events would occur? This is what happens when John Koestler (Nicolas Cage) gets his hands on a note that was put into a time capsule fifty years in the past. The note contains a map of numbers that specifically says when the next tragic disaster will be. That's some premise.<br/><br/>In some ways, it mixes the ideas of The Number 23 (2007), 2012 (2009) and Final Destination (2000) all into one big question. What is the purpose of this list of numbers? Why was it written and who knew of such dates? It really is an interesting premise. The idea digs into the psyche of the human mind and makes viewers wonder if things do happen just randomly or calculated already or brought on by belief. But that is one of the far few things that make this movie any good. In fact the only other commendable components about this movie are its special effects and realistic images. The acting isn't bad but that's a must anyway because that's what a movie should have, decent acting.<br/><br/>Back to writing. First is the idea of making this a supernatural genre film. It wasn't needed nor was it a smart move. By doing this, it takes away the whole mystery of where the paper with all the numbers came from. Why ruin that? The script also contains little to no explanation about anything besides what is currently happening . It's not even funny. For example, there is a character that doesn't speak in this film and it is never explained to why this is. Another moment is when the same character gives out these black smooth rocks to one of the main characters. Even by the end, it is never explained to what the significance of these rocks were for. It's just baffling to why these kinds of things aren't explained.<br/><br/>Glad to know the guy behind this story, Ryne Douglas Pearson isn't doing any future projects yet. His writing needs more work. Amazing as this is though, the film was directed by Alex Proyas. The man behind The Crow (1994), Dark City (1998) and I, Robot (2004). Why couldn't Mr. Proyas see the flaws in the script? Lastly, of all things to look forward to, not even composer Marco Beltrami's score to the film truly helped. It did contain the creepy feel and even some emotional tunes but there were some scenes even then that didn't match the mood. There was no theme either making it stuck just to the background.<br/><br/>Some scenes were helped by CGI in the film though. That at least was a positive although audiences may be surprised by the realistic nature of the film. In fact, it may be too graphic for the MPAA to call it PG-13. Some of the disaster scenes were very intense. There's no guts but there is blood. I was shocked to see how one scene was treated though. It was a scene where some person was hit and the audience will here a WILHELM SCREAM. It's even stated in the trivia! Was that supposed to be taken seriously or comically? But who would want to take that kind of situation comical? I don't understand. It's not worth the time to try and figure out.<br/><br/>The special effects are decent as well as the mysterious plot but they can't overcome the bad story telling along with unexplained subplots. A very frustrating sit."

Don't get me wrong, its a really good idea for a suspenseful and engaging story and is just that for most of its 1hr 40mns running time. Nick cage is also slipping quite comfortably into the role of the haggard and tired middle-aged hero who has unsolicited knowledge / ancient artifact / surprise lotto win thrust upon him. <br/><br/>In this movie he uncovers the hidden code written by school girl some 50 years previous, which predicts the dates and number of fatalities of major disasters. This information, coupled with his sons new found ability to hear mysterious 'whispers', send our Nic into his now traditional spiral of confusion fueled anxiety. A more wrinkled forehead you will go a long way to find.<br/><br/>This movie does however contain two of the most visceral and heart-pounding crash scenes you will have seen with both a savagely real looking plane crash and claustrophobic subway train pile-up. These action sequences are handled expertly with top-drawer CGI. The former containing many horrific and realistic shots of 'survivors' staggering around whilst still on fire!<br/><br/>Which leads us to the movie's rather unsatisfying conclusion. We learn that the last part of the code signals the apocalyptic end of the world, slightly given away by the movies cover-art. The 'whispers' reveal themselves as aliens who have come to earth to save certain chosen children, in their intergalactic lifeboats. The children can then be whisked away to another similar but unpopulated planet, somewhere else in the universe, seemingly to 'start again'. This 'aliens did it' conclusion is not so much placed before you but rather smashed into your face.<br/><br/>Several questions still remain though. Did these celestial visitors cause the disasters or mearly observed them in the future? Why didn't they try to save the original girl whom they gave the code too? What was the point of giving anyone a coded warning if they had already pre-selected their chosen few and where protecting them? And then, why wait until the eve of the apocalypse to rescue them and risk them choosing not to go?<br/><br/>There have been far worse movies i spent my time and cash on and i did get caught up in the suspenseful story, for the most part. The final act did leave me thinking that with a few more weeks spent at the storyboard stage, a more satisfying ending could have been devised. I was going to score this movie a 6 but the extra point is for the superb crash scenes and the bravery shown in destroying the planet and not having a hero save the day. Bravo!"

A cosmologist/astronomer/professor/father attends his son's school ceremony where he receives a mysterious note from a time capsule. Cage, in all of his craziness, starts to uncover what this string of numbers represents. Predictions for global disasters. Attempting to prevent these, he soon starts travelling to the recorded coordinates...only for him to simply witness the havoc. Look, I like the concept of determinism and theories of fate, but this does nothing with them. Taking intelligent philosophies and turning it into a heavy-handed blockbuster that lacks both emotional conviction and engaging storytelling. There are enough conveniences here to produce a solar flare and incinerate a planet. Such a coincidence that the one note predicting disasters is given to Cage's son, whose father teaches determinism as a career, where he places a dirty mug on the paper which circles a select sequence of numbers that highlights the 9/11 attack, leading to Cage to actually Google ""9/11/2001"". Such a coincidence that the first disaster he encounters is by accident as he impatiently sits in traffic staring at the coordinates, meaning he was in the right place at the right...by mistake. Such a coincidence that ""EE"" means ""Everyone Else"" instead of writing the actual figure of the world's population. Seriously, take some time to dissect the film and you'll realise how absurd the plot is. Credit to Cage and Byrne who do give some credible performances, but the script disabled all emotional responses. The inevitable demise of Earth makes for a broody serious tone, and it works. However the thematic allegory of family can't quite breach the dark narrative. I'm still not convinced by the ending, doesn't sit right with me. Good premise, bad film."

The numbers were transcribed by a psychic young girl and placed in a letter in a time capsule. Cage somehow inexplicably discovers the numbers predict disasters, and immediately one realizes, ""He's got too much time on his hands."" But then individuals who may or may not be from the government take an interest in his deaf son who is now ""hearing"" the voices that the young girl in the Fifties heard.

It's not that I don't like movies that feature Aliens, I just think this movie could have gone a different way. Perhaps just Lucinda's family having the ability instead of it coming from Aliens.
Also, I wouldn't just accept that the Aliens are taking my children away with them and leaving me here to die. I would fight harder to go with them."

So, the film is preaching to the converted - and by the way, why do the aliens? angels? have practically white hair? That was uncomfortably reminiscent of Aryan gospel. There are just strange notes in this movie that made me very uncomfortable, as, *if* I am correct about the angle of this movie, I am definitely *not* their target audience. Apart from that, it had great explosions, and the music sucked. It's like it was put together by a religious organization, who had no idea of how to put together a sci-fi movie, so hired people who might be able to put together a sci-fi movie, with a religious slant... I don't know. It's like the parable of the blind men and the elephant. The movie is put together of a bunch of different parts, creating this particular monstrosity.

","22 March 2009. This movie is above average because it appears to deliberately avoid the most obvious movie clichés but just can't completely ignore the screaming, emotionally wrought female scenes nor the male drinking phenomenon of stereotypical movies. The movie also panders to the audience's sensibilities of movie disaster special effects which are designed to make the audience go ooh and awe and almost succeed, though ""The Aviator"" (2004) has a much more potent, in your seat and pants accident scene. For some people, this movie is likely to be somewhat predictable like later Director Shyamalan movies such as ""The Village"" (2004). This movie is also supposedly a ""bittersweet"" family drama with a twist (that supposedly must not be revealed) that is supposed to make this movie more European, breaking the American style, for which it can be given a few bonus points. The connection between the eerie prediction sequences and the ending are alas not really tied up and seem more manipulative. Overall, this is a decent, but not really original nor qualitatively expressive movie of deep meaning, even though the script would have you believe otherwise. 7/10."

It simultaneously feels both slow and rushed at the same time. The subplot involving Cage's dad is totally unnecessary.

","Knowing is a mystery sci-fi film Starring Nicolas Cage as an astrophysicist who believes a 50-year-old time capsule, dug up at his son's school, contains a child's note that is a doomsday prophecy. Knowing has been compared to earlier films of M. Night Shyamalan (Signs, The Happening). It also boasts spectacular special effects that are well woven into the film that immediately boosts the film above average. Knowing does remind of other earlier film such as Signs, The Happening, and the Final Destination series.<br/><br/>Nic Cage does a great job as the leading role as he is convincing playing these characters. It's never a stretch for him to play an obsessive madman, yet Cage brings a haunted quality to this character, whose wife's recent death left him feeling sure there is no meaning or order in the world. In another actor's hands, it might seem ridiculous that a brilliant MIT scientist instantly buys into random predictions, but Cage convinces us his intense, grieving character is desperate for something to believe in, even if it's the scribblings of a Mary Jane-wearing, fifth-grade Nostradamus. The film's first half is great and gripping, unfortunately the film drives off into strange territory into the final 20 minutes. It becomes quite over the top and loses several interests. Although it is unpredictable, the complete ending could have been better.
===
As a rewatch 03/28/18' Knowing remains an interesting and entertaining watch, although there are its faults, which are within the last part of the film. As if the writers tried coming up with something completely different which swayed away from what original was happening. The film takes itself somewhat too serious but overall it remains a good and engaging watch."
"FMeekins","7","0","0","5 May 2016"," Do Viewers Know About ""Knowing""?
","May Include Spoilers Viewers wanting to see ""Knowing"" staring Nicholas Cage might expect a film not all that different from his ""National Treasure"" series or even perhaps ""The Da Vinci Code"" as from advertisements the story appears to center around an aged parchment with a series of numbers scribbled across it that seemingly predicts a series of disasters. However, by the film's conclusion, the apocalyptic symbolism alluded to is much more complex and potentially confusing than one might initially suspect.<br/><br/>After a series of catastrophes Cage's astrophysicist character witnesses as a result of deciphering the cryptic document, one begins to get the impression that the transcendent presence guiding events is more of a tangible one rather than a force in the background. Hints of this are introduced when mysterious figures reminiscent of less than normal looking versions of Men In Black begin to stalk Cage's son as well as the granddaughter of the character who wrote down the prophetic string of numbers in a flashback set fifty years in the past.<br/><br/>In most films one usually gets a distinct impression as to the forces overseeing mankind's eschatological destiny. Usually they are traditionally supernatural or more in the vein of what moviegoers would consider extraterrestrial or interplanetary. Seldom do I remember a film where the distinctions were blurred or melded to such a degree as in ""Knowing"".<br/><br/>For example, viewers were first given a hint of this as Cage and one of the adolescent come across an illustration depicting Ezekiel's wheel within a wheel. The overt supernatural overtones continued to increase with interactions with the Men In Black, especially when a blinding lights emanates from one of their mouths when confronted by Cage and as Cage's partially deaf son picks up a message over his hearing aide from the ""whispering people"".<br/><br/>By the time of the movie's climactic act, Ezekiel's wheel within a wheel has descended to the rendezvous point where it has arrived to whisk the children under Cage's care to safety away from the earth endangered by a gigantic solar flare. Not even at this point did screenwriters clarify where they came down theologically. For example, as Cage proceeded to board the craft, he was informed that only the chosen could enter.<br/><br/>Did this mean only those professing belief in God (about the best you can hope for from Hollywood as a positive ascent to the need for a relationship with Christ would be out of the question) since earlier in the film Cage's character hinted at lacking faith in a conscious divine power. Or more likely, were these tots suppose to be Indigo Children, a new classification of adolescent hypothesized to be the next step in human evolution as a way to explain a myriad of phenomena from such as why these children have IQ's higher than their parents to bratty teen behavior.<br/><br/>The distinction between garden variety extraterrestrial and angel is further blurred when these entities drop their humanoid facades to reveal themselves to be energy beings reminiscent of the Taelons from the early seasons of ""Gene Roddenberry's Earth: Final Conflict"". The obfuscation continues until the end of the film.<br/><br/>As the craft carrying the two children away from the earth lifts into space, the viewer realizes that these two youngsters were not the only two saved as they join a convoy of similar vehicles. Once more, while the average viewer might be sitting their dumbfounded as to what is being depicted, the viewer peripherally in the know will wonder if they have just seen a space age interpretation of the Rapture where it is believed that the saved will be whisked away by God to safety before destruction comes upon the world or rather, as non-dispensationalists have hypothesized, or how the masses will be duped into a pseudo-rapture orchestrated by so-called ""flying saucers"".<br/><br/>Even after all of this, ""Knowing"" at its end dumps even deeper metaphysical symbolism upon the viewer to wade through. For after the earth is destroyed with the elements burning up with a fervent heat as foretold in I Peter 3:12, we see the children running through a field towards a very distinct looking tree that could very well be the Tree of Life. But as with other moments in this film, we are not given any definitive answer as to whether the children are in Heaven or merely on another planet.<br/><br/>Those that go into ""Knowing"" expecting a supernatural thriller will not be disappointed. However, what they may not know about is the symbolic dialogue regarding some of the most profound spiritual issues facing the world today.<br/><br/>by Frederick Meekins"

","It isn't difficult to connect the details to know how the movie ends, but it is a little hard to specifically understand the ending. At no point was there any reasoning about why these children were chosen, what the aliens wanted, why these tragedies were listed along with the end of the world, and why the trailer was listed in the coordinates. With that being said, it overall was an enjoyable movie to watch. It was very intense, and difficult to watch scenes where Nicolas Cage's character would attempt to help the disaster victims, only for him to fail. It was both depressing and refreshing to watch his character simply accept his fate at the end, since most of the movie was watching him frantically try to understand what was going on and if there was a way to stop it."

","Knowing is directed by Alex Proyas and collectively written by Ryne Douglas Pearson, Juliet Snowden and Stiles White.

Music is by Marco Beltrami and cinematography by Simon Duggan. <br/><br/>1959, and young schoolgirl Lucinda Embry (Robinson) keeps hearing voices. When asked to submit a drawing for the school time capsule– that's to be opened in 50 years time,– she writes a series of random numbers that don't appear to make sense. Forward to 50 years and the grand opening of the capsule, where Professor Jonathan Koestler (Cage) and his young son come by way of Lucinda's numbers. Just what do they mean? If anything?... <br/><br/>Ah yes, the good old disaster movie, a genre of film that continues unabated through the decades, this in spite of critical indifference. But the paying public still keep turning up in droves, even in this new technological age. Where once was models being destroyed, and paintings forming elegant backdrops, now is whizz bangery that costs a fortune. Still great fun, though, which is why something like Knowing exists and has many fans. <br/><br/>It's a splendid piece of sci-fi hokum pulsing with supernatural overtones, a gentle creeper unravelling the mystery in layers until the final countdown begins. The science is obviously dubious (it's a movie folks) and the air of pessimism that hovers consistently over proceedings (not only is the world in trouble, but all the protags have miserable issues as well), may be too much for some. However, Cage is as committed as ever, Proyas yet again proves himself a beautiful visualist, while the scenes of carnage are truly harrowing and unforgettable. <br/><br/>A popcorner with moments of wonder and awe, and yes of course, some cheese as well. Ignore the Cage haters, if you like sci-fi infused disaster movies and haven't had fun with this one yet, then do so, it's a blast. And did I say it's gorgeous to look at as well? It is! 7/10"
"TxMike","Null","0","0","29 July 2009"," Novel and interesting approach to determinism vs randomness and chance.
","Nicolas Cage is Astrophysicist John Koestler, and in an early present-day scene we see him in lecture to his college class. He is posing the question, is it determinism or randomness that leads to everything in the world as we know it? Did the Earth just happen, for example, to end up at just the right distance from our Sun to support life and evolution, or was there some grand plan that resulted in it? Having lost his wife just a year earlier in a fire, his current attitude is just that $$it happens. <br/><br/>But in this movie the story starts 50 years earlier, when during part of the dedication of a new school all the students draw on a piece of paper ""what they think the future world will look like"" and each is placed in an envelope with the student's name, and all is placed in a Time Capsule in the ground in front of the school building, to be opened in 2009. So here we are!<br/><br/>One of the present-day students is Chandler Canterbury as John's son, Caleb Koestler. As fate (or determinism??) would have it, Caleb ends up with the envelope of young Lucinda's, and we saw in 1959 that her ""picture"" consisted in a long and seemingly random list of numbers with no apparent pattern.<br/><br/>This two-page list of numbers ends up at home and gets John's attention. Was the young girl just emotionally disturbed, or is there a message in the numbers? The movie is about John's search to unravel the mystery, and to come to terms with his own issues in life. <br/><br/>Good movie. I saw it twice, about 2 weeks apart, and enjoyed it both times. It contains a few scary concepts.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW: Lucinda was not crazy, she was being spoken to by what might be considered angels, or maybe merely highly evolved aliens, it doesn't really matter. Her ""picture of what the world will look like"" was actually coded to describe terrible events which resulted in many dead. The first one John decoded was the sequence '0911012996' which represented the 2996 that were killed in the 09-11-2001 Trade Center airliner attacks. John spent a whole night checking each coded date and the number that died with 100% correspondence. One included the date of the fire his wife died in. But there were other numbers which took a bit more time to recognize as coordinates for the locations. But all this meant nothing without the big kicker, the impending giant solar flare which was to burn up the Earth and kill everyone. But right before that happened John was able to get his son and a female child to a pre-selected spot where alien ships were to remove the chosen few to a far-away planet in another galaxy so that they could be the seed to continue life."

","Before watching Knowing I thought it would be just another forgettable action-adventure. It turned out to be very intriguing though; a film with a mystery that I eagerly wanted to see solved. I'm not going to explain the mystery, but I will mention that it has both fantasy and science-fiction elements. Nicolas Cage plays the protagonist Professor Jonathan ""John"" Koestler. He's a depressed single parent who it seems lives from day to day, and mostly for his son. When he confronts the mystery he realizes that it goes against what he has come to believe. So he is determined to find out what is going on. Some of what follows may seem absurd but it's certainly entertaining. Simon Duggan's cinematography captures some beautiful scenery, especially Koestler's house and the woods surrounding it. The special effects aren't many but they look fine. Knowing is a science-fiction disaster film by director Alex Proyas. Proyas directed the impressive comic book adaptation The Crow in 1994. He also directed one of the best films of the 1990s: the 1998 science-fiction Dark City. Knowing, however, isn't a great film. What happens at the end may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's still one of the most entertaining and absorbing films I've seen lately. I recommend it."

","I had very low hopes for this movie . It stars Nicolas Cage and while some actors give the impression they swallowed a bottle of Scotch and turned up hoping for the best Cage gives the impression he's smoked a splif the size of a telegraph pole and wandered in from the set of his previous movie . He has struck the same single one note performance for over 25 years . It's time like this I regret criticising Paterson Joseph because using the cruel cliché of "" He has the range of a water pistol "" is ready made for Cage . On top of that I was also under the impression KNOWING would achieve all its spectacle via some very lazy and unconvincing CGI <br/><br/>Guess what ? To a very large degree this is how KNOWING plays out . Throw in some new age mystical nonsense about numerical codes and you wonder if conspiracy theorist David Icke might be making an appearance at some point . Saying all that KNOWING works far , far better than it has any right to . Indeed I found myself constantly surprised as to how compelling and involving the storyline was . It's a preposterous premise, one of being able to predict disasters via numerical codes but like so many fictional premises that are seemingly stupid if you're able to make things convincing then you're well on the way of spinning a great yarn <br/><br/>Director Alex Proyas helps the premise by directing in an understated and gloomy manner and letting the human elements of the story come through . He does have a slight problem with the spectacular disaster elements as in the aforementioned CGI looks far too much like CGI and one wonders if the film might have worked much better in curtailing the on screen carnage to a large extent . That said they still have an impact even if they're not as well realised as they might been . Perhaps it's because of the drama involved . After all how often do we see a movie hero save the day by averting a disaster . Here the future is written and no matter what he does Cage's protagonist can not change the course of destiny . Films with am impotent hero are few and far between so it's good to see an ineffectual protagonist for a change <br/><br/>The fate of humanity is at stake here and I was left biting my badly bitten finger nails as to how Nicky boy was going to save the world from an extinction event since he'd not been able to change fate at all . The build up to the last ten minutes of the movie is tense and suspenseful then proceeds to blow everything with a leftfield deux ex machina that has to be seen to be believed and must feature as one of the biggest cop outs I've ever seen in a movie . It wouldn't have been so bad if it was a very mediocre TVM production made for the Syfy Channel and after seeing too many cheat plot turns in 21st Century DOCTOR WHO I thought I'd experienced every unlikely plot turn ever made but here the rug is pulled out from under the audience and they fall so heavily it hurts . It's a great pity because the production team have gone out of their way to make a grim and great supernatural sci-fi thriller that would have bordered on great if they'd thought up a better ending"

A lot of people seemed to not like certain parts of it.<br/><br/>I, for one, really enjoyed the artist's depictions of the ending of the story along with some of the tragedies. Yes it could be a lot of Scientology reference, but it still got me thinking a little bit about if it did actually happen. I thought the music score and artwork fit very well and looked really neat.<br/><br/>Though there are parts that were not very interesting and forwarded through some of them. Some of the acting was okay, but others (Cage) could have done better. I also noticed the part where he said ""hey"" to a burning guy, and another time when he stood in the doorway, looking like he was waiting for the director to say 'action'.<br/><br/>But overall I liked the artwork, build up to the ending, and the sense of mystery in portions through the movie."

'Knowing' was an interesting film, the story wasn't the most original but it managed to keep me awake at 3am, however the ending was probably one of the worst endings I have ever seen and trust me i've seen 'Funny Games'. If the movie ended 20 minutes before and then they made a 'Knowing 2' where they show how they save the Earth, without having any relation whatsoever with Aliens or any biblical suggestion to the Adam & Eve theory with two kids that were chosen to see the future, that would have been MUCH better than the terrible ending of this movie.<br/><br/>I mean seriously, you don't need to see the future to know that the ending of that film just ruined everything, luckily you can't blame Cage for that."

Thankfully this movie is one where in my opinion he has a good role. One problem I had with him though is that although he tries to convey emotion, he doesn't do a very good job in this film. Another problem I had was the ""natural disasters"". They came out of nowhere and didn't develop themselves early on to give the audience any real emotional ties to them. Therefore when they happened the audience (and by audience I mean myself) didn't really care. I guess though that it can be overlooked. My main problem was (you guessed it) then ending. I mean come on. From the very first moment I saw the Blondie guy I thought, ""Oh god he had better not turn out to be an alien"". Guess what? He did.

","In 1958, as part of the dedication ceremony for a new elementary school, a group of students is asked to draw pictures to be stored in a time capsule. But one mysterious girl fills her sheet of paper with rows of apparently random numbers instead.<br/><br/>Fifty years later, a new generation of students examines the capsule's contents and the girl's cryptic message ends up in the hands of young Caleb Koestler (Chandler Canterbury). But it is Caleb's father, professor John Koestler (Nicolas Cage), who makes the startling discovery that the encoded message predicts with pinpoint accuracy the dates, death tolls and coordinates of every major disaster of the past 50 years.<br/><br/>As Ted further unravels the document's chilling secrets, he realizes the document foretells three additional events—the last of which hints at destruction on a global scale and seems to somehow involve Ted and his son. When Ted's attempts to alert the authorities fall on deaf ears, he takes it upon himself to try to prevent more destruction from taking place.<br/><br/>With the reluctant help of Diana Wayland (Rose Byrne) and Abby Wayland, the daughter and granddaughter of the now-deceased author of the prophecies, Ted's increasingly desperate efforts take him on a heart-pounding race against time until he finds himself facing the ultimate disaster—and the ultimate sacrifice.

","This was an appalling, messy, ill-thought out film which seemed like two different scripts spliced together. I am fairly sure that halfway through the execs decided it needed a little something to spice it up, and BOOM! Let's shove in some aliens. Bonuses all round. Yes, it's well shot. Yes, the CGI is impressive. But all in all the plot is so ill conceived and random that it destroys any of the visual plus points. So why is it worth seeing? My bro and I laughed for 10 minutes solid during and after the final scene as it was so very appalling - I literally had tears streaming down my face. So, it unintentionally has become the feel good movie of 2009 - if you're feeling blue, go and see this film."
"RichardKleiner","3","3","8","8 April 2009"," 6.9? Yeah, right.
","I'm not sure that Alex Proyas had directed something else besides Dark City and the underrated I, Robot, but I was quite fond of his style of film-making. I had some high hopes on the concept of this film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, what could have been an interesting premise with open jaw CGI sequences, was turned into yet another unoriginal sci fi flick.<br/><br/>The idea of having a set of numbers that predict catastrophes was far fetched (considering the 9/11 reference) but had potential. It would have been a lot more interesting had the writers and producers opted away from formulaic plot twists.<br/><br/>Let me state the following to all writers and studio execs that have a chance to read this comment: ALIENS ARE UNCREATIVE, UNORIGINAL AND COMPLETELY TASTELESS. Why? It's a safe way out of a supernatural mystery not even the writer his or herself can solve. ""Ah, hell, let's just say it was aliens"". There were so many superior existentialist theories about aliens in past science fiction masterpieces. But not today. It's not original. I would have preferred ghosts or spirits as the perpetrators of the numbers. Even angels or demons. But aliens? Again? We already saw it on The Forgotten and Indiana Jones, two movies that also lost their appeal after introducing aliens in the story.<br/><br/>Looking away from this intolerable aspect of the film (which is difficult) the story isn't consistent. On one end, you have a clichéd father-son relation subplot that doesn't have too much development, then you have some gritty yet spectacular catastrophe sequences and also, on the other end, you have an end of the world premise, with government announcements and frantic crowd scenes that don't hold much relation with each other.<br/><br/>The character scenes were rushed. Apparently, everybody believes blindly that a doomsday number list is accurate simply because someone says so and nobody asks questions.<br/><br/>The situation with the numbers isn't properly explained, by the way. If this elusive list was destined to be in the hands of the kid, why didn't the other girl have it as well? Why would the kid be possessed again to write more numbers if the world was going to end already? All of this makes the already exasperated viewer even more frustrated.<br/><br/>This movie is full with half baked ideas, that neither Nicolas Cage's nor the other actress' (that girl from Damages) average performances can salvage. It's not that Cage acts badly, but you can see he wasn't thrilled to do this.<br/><br/>Worth mentioning are Marco Beltrami's sometimes good musical score and the spectacular plane crash scene. Those may be the only positive aspects of this disgustingly unoriginal piece of work.<br/><br/>Mr. Proyas, please, don't insult your fans with this lazy directing again. And Mr. Cage, try reading the script before signing up, even if the paycheck is tempting. And to all execs and writers, I say again: DON'T USE ALIENS. THEY'RE UNORIGINAL, UNCREATIVE AND TASTELESS FOR TODAY'S SCI FI."
"japonaliya","5","3","8","6 April 2009"," Kowing was a great disappointment !!!
","I will keep this brief...<br/><br/>I will not comment in length about this film as it doesn't deserve it.<br/><br/>At least Mr. Cage's ""Treasure"" films, like the Indiana Jones adventure series was somewhat tongue & cheek, this movie is dead serious, and so full of flaws I do not know where to begin. I will just say this......<br/><br/>Though the first half of the movie was at least suspenseful, the predictable and overdone ending ruined any merits this film may have had. The basic premise of the film was plagiarized from a few eps. of the TV series, ""The X Files"" and those who followed the series know exactly which eps. I mean. However, THAT was the GOOD part. <br/><br/>The ending was such was virtually the same, and had the same message as ""Close Encounters"", ""Contact"", and among many others, the recent remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" We have seen the same ending per se in scores of SiFi films and we don't need it beaten into out heads again and again....<br/><br/>******SPOILERS******<br/><br/>> > > The scene where the two children are shown on a distant planet, supposedly to start the human race over again was problematic in itself... We see the two children running in fields of wheat(?) and we see other ""pods"" containing it seems other children landing in the distance...<br/><br/>Call me a fool, but here are some questions that I do not understand, and it wrecked the movie for me...<br/><br/>With the alien spaceships the size of the state of Texas, why did they have to gather up the children by twos, each in their own pods? YES, along with the rabbits, <br/><br/>I did understand the allusion to Noah's ark, TWO BY TWO..but come on...that is such a waste of spaceships..<br/><br/>Or...another thought...were the children somehow paired up by the aliens? <br/><br/>This is TOO freaky.. !!!<br/><br/>So..the little boy and girl barely 10 years old are selected to be mated in order to populate their new planet? <br/><br/>Is that the Utopian future for our kids...to be selected into a predetermined ""marriage"" like the children of the LDS church, or Hindu and Muslim sects that believe in pre-arranged marriage?<br/><br/>Sorry...I rather they were burnt to a crisp... <br/><br/>And to be taken away from their parents??? <br/><br/>What..there were no adults on the entire planet Earth worth saving?<br/><br/>Which brings me to another point. <br/><br/>Are the children to be left to their own devices, and possibly revert to ""Lord of the Flies' mentality? Or are we to believe that the kindly aliens will see to their every need?<br/><br/>The children are still human, no alien agenda or influence can change that. No alien can guide into adulthood, a human child anymore than we should attempt to modify the lives of the mountain gorillas.<br/><br/>Another passing thought.<br/><br/>IF the spaceships are Noah's ark(s) and the planet the new Garden of Eden, the boy and the girl the new Adan and Eve, then it is still an implausible senerio that makes me want to gag... <br/><br/>The scene in CONTACT where Jody Foster meets the alien who is the visage of her dead father was schmaltzy, but at least it made sense...<br/><br/>Give me a break!!! I could write a few more pages about specifics, but I think that I have given enough examples to warn off any lover of good science fiction from this drivel...<br/><br/>Post Script: I originally typed this without reading any other reviews. Now, having read a bunch, I can see that I am not alone in the comments I made, nor in my condemnation of one of the worst SiFi flicks of all time."
"omahonyjason","5","3","8","1 April 2009"," Knowing too little
","KNOWING Director: Alex Proyas Country: USA Year: 2009 Language: English Runtime: 120 Minutes Rating: 15A<br/><br/>Once upon a time I ran to see a new Nicolas Cage movie with the enthusiasm of a schoolboy running home but now I drag myself to see his movies with less zest than a schoolboy on his way to school. It's taken a long time but I've fallen out of love with his films.<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers' RAISING ARIZONA (1987) is pure genius and Nicolas Cage is damn near the best thing about it. He's fantastic in MOONSTRUCK (1987), even better in WILD AT HEART (1990) and in his Oscar winning role in LEAVING LAS VEGAS (1995) he is, quite simply, fantastic. But then he turned his back on the quirky, meaty roles that displayed his undoubted charisma and acting talents to such effect and, instead, plumped for the meaty pay packet. I can't really blame him there. I'd quite like $20 million myself.<br/><br/>Sometimes the films worked, like the wonderful THE ROCK (1996) and FACE OFF (1997), but sometimes they did not, like the woeful GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS (2000). It would probably be kinder not to mention THE WICKER MAN (2006) but how do you ignore what may well be the worst movie of all time?<br/><br/>Which brings us neatly to KNOWING, is it a movie to run to or a movie to run from? It opens in 1959 in a classroom full of eager students, filling a time capsule, due to be opened in 2009, with their interpretations of the future. One, clearly disturbed, little girl writes a series of seemingly meaningless numbers which, when the capsule is opened, make their way into the hands of Nicolas Cage, via his son, who is now enrolled at the same school.<br/><br/>Cage plays an astrophysicist and discovers the numbers may have a meaning, he determines this by looking at the numbers 911 01, drinking a bottle of whisky, and finally figuring out that 911 01, might refer to September 11th, 2001. Ya don't need to be an astrophysicist to figure out where this is going. The numbers predict tragedy and Cage decides he has been ""chosen"" to prevent the catastrophic disasters which have been predicted but have yet to occur. That's a lot for one man to take on, but Cage sets about his task with aplomb, tracing the numbers back to the little girl who wrote them and dodging some scary 'whisper people' on the way, as he strives to save the world.<br/><br/>KNOWING has some nice ideas, some nice special effects, the sometimes wonderful Nicolas Cage and is directed by Alex Proyas, who made THE CROW (1994), DARK CITY (1998) and, more recently, I ROBOT (2004) but it isn't, unfortunately, one that I would run to see. It's not one to run from either, just pretty middle of the road. Perhaps best to just walk away?"

","There are many things which need to be underlined in this movie. It's not suitable to watch for teens who cannot withstand horror/thriller. I am 25 and I was spooked by some of the scenes in the first half of this movie. So I'm guessing it should be categorized under mystery/horror/thriller. There are some slight tense sequences. As the title suggests, it started out very well, plot seemed really good but when we reached the middle of the movie, something seriously went wrong. It was almost as if they targeted young adults to watch the beginning of the movie, then drastically altered the storyline introducing some weird people who layed stones and towards the end of the movie, it was good for 8 yr olds to watch. I mean, it was kind of senseless. What could have been a beautiful mystery movie, turned out to be a pathetic SCI-FI horror mixed with some crude jokes and mindless sentimental scenes.<br/><br/>I suggest you not waste your money or time watching it."

","A time capsule reveals dates of every major world disaster of the past 50 years, written by a possessed little girl in 1959. Nicholas Cage discovers that 3 dates haven't come up yet and he decides that it is his calling to go and try and stop these events from unfolding. He meets with the possessed girls daughter and together they try to save the world encountering some very human like ""aliens"" on the way attempting to rob their children. A very disappointing attempt at a thriller and goes from the scary to the sci-fi. It's as if that halfway through writing the movie the writers got bored and decided to just turn it into a ridiculous X- Files rip-off. Nicholas Cage gives an average performance but even Nick at his best couldn't save this movie from being a complete disaster. I would recommend giving it a miss unless you are into special effects in which case i would wait for the DVD so you can fast forward to the explosions."
"bluebrace","3","3","8","29 March 2009"," Very Disappointing
","A boring and muddled plot that leads to nothing much. Wooden acting all round doesn't help the sluggish plot flow into its lack lustre ending. Most disappointing of all was the potential of this film to be great, instead its no better than predecessors such as 'Deep Impact' and 'Armageddon'. Its loose grasp onto its audience's heart strings is no more than a desperate attempt to sacrifice its lead actor into the shadow of 'I am legend'.<br/><br/>There are some excellent action filled moments if you can handle the motion sick filming but again these glimpses of entertainment are easily forgotten when the plot creeps along to its long awaited finale."
"schrodingers_duck","7","3","8","29 March 2009"," Hilariously cheesy camp
","Whether or not you like this depends on whether or not you like Nicholas Cage. Knowing is basically the purest essence of a Nick Cage film - Cage plays a hard-as-nails atheist astrophysicist single dad, distant from his religious father and improbably brainy son, who finds a long sheet of numbers in a time capsule. Cage picks a random string of 8 from the sheet, and by sheer luck picks the exact numbers that somehow predict the Sept 11 attacks.<br/><br/>Much of the rest of the film consists either of Cage staring at a sheet of paper as a look of wispy stoned horror builds on his face, running blankly as various pieces of transport infrastructure explode around him, or having ""tender"" moments with his 9-year-old son, who speaks entirely in stilted Professor speak (""I'm afraid that I think that's rather unlikely, Dad""). The film alternates between ridiculously slow (Cage must spend at least two minutes of screen time just sipping liquor) and insanely fast (Try to work out what is going on during the action scenes. Here's a hint - you can't), and builds to severely creepy (but admittedly quite brave) ending of sheer WTF-ery, religious metaphor and implied prepubescent sex. Treat this film as a serious action-mystery and you'll hate it - treat it as a cheesy B-movie and you'll love it."
"deltajvliet","9","3","8","24 March 2009"," Knowing: Grandeur That Transcends the Scope of its Own Story
","Spoilers<br/><br/>I went to Knowing for two reasons. My man Ebert, who I've only disagreed with three times to date, gave it 4 stars. Second, any movie with enough money poured into it is bound to have some redeeming qualities. <br/><br/>But keeping the bad buzz in mind, I went with low expectations. <br/><br/>It started off decently enough. Intrigue was essential in building interest. Still, I'd heard it went downhill, especially in the third act, so I didn't get my hopes up. <br/><br/>Enter the first catastrophe. Holy hell. The CGI was noticeable, but I didn't care. The screeching hurt my ears, but it was warranted and in my opinion worth it for the effect. The plane careens into the highway, skidding along the ground and bursting into flames. My heart sank; I've studied numerous aviation disasters, but none, even as depicted in other movies, even actual footage, felt as close or as real as this. In the same shot, the camera chases behind a distraught Nicolas Cage racing through the wreckage in a meager attempt to help any survivors he comes across. It was downright chilling. <br/><br/>Now that we know there's credence to the prophecy, the movie takes on an almost sickening atmosphere of tension. What will the next disaster involve? How many lives will be lost? How horrific will it be? Cage attempts to stop it, but in the end he is unable. <br/><br/>The last catastrophe looms. It's different. No location is given; no number of deaths told. Slowly but surely our suspicions are confirmed - the apocalypse is upon us. I'll get back to this. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie we see more and more of some seriously creepy albino guys. They seem almost supernatural, omniscient, uncaring. They are an element of the plot that comes into play towards the end of the film, and be warned I'm going to go into an in-depth analysis of this plot point, so take heed if you haven't seen the film. <br/><br/>They are angels. They guide the film's characters towards their respective destinies. When the world is on the brink of the end, they shepherd the movie's two children into an escape pod of sorts, an ""ark""; watching Cage reluctantly accept his son's fate is gut wrenching and touching. The children are each holding a white rabbit. I'm not sure if there's a Biblical connotation there, but at the very least I took it to mean innocence and fertility. The end of the world is vastly significant in its own right, a big enough event to really invest your emotions into, but when you throw into the mix the theological overtones present at this point in the film, I couldn't help but be overwhelmed. <br/><br/>I think this might be where the movie loses people. I admit I'm Christian, so maybe the movie held some inherent significance for me that it doesn't for others. That, and I had heard something about angels before going in, and I wonder if some who hadn't felt the religious development was out of left field. If God's not your thing, power to you. But maybe the movie can still be enjoyed with a grain of salt; it is fiction, after all. <br/><br/>Cue the end of the world. Cage has gone to his parents' home to be with his sister, mother, and father who he'd recently reconciled with. The apocalypse is upon us. Fires burn in the city, panicked citizens are looting. I'd imagine this wouldn't be too far off from what it would look like if the world really was about to end. The cause of humanity's demise is explained on a scientific basis in the film - it doesn't just randomly happen - though I'm unsure of the scientific validity of the explanation. To the best of my knowledge the cause is next to impossible for the foreseeable future, but it was nice to know that it was at least somewhat grounded in scientific reality. <br/><br/>The visuals are stunning; fire engulfs the globe. It almost looks as if a large nuke has been detonated in semi-slow motion in New York City, one where the fireball doesn't seem to have any intention of stopping. A shot of the globe shows what appeared to be a hauntingly beautiful visual of the atmosphere leaving the planet as it turns to rubble. Everything is obliterated. <br/><br/>And then, in one of the most grand examples of a story coming full circle I've ever seen, the children are dropped off, with a number of other arks seen landing in the distance, on a picturesque, unspoiled, virgin world to start again; they are in the Garden of Eden."
"Vic_max","Null","3","8","24 March 2009"," A great story ... buried in a grossly bad movie ...
","OK, let's be honest here. As one sci-fi fan to another, I'd say ""sure, see this movie"" but would add ... ""it has lots of glaring problems so be prepared."" I think you can see this ""like""/""dislike"" perception being played out in the ratings. The IMDb ratings are (currently) above 7, yet the reaction from critics is very negative (Rotten Tomatoes rating < 25%).<br/><br/>My take: There is a fun story underlying this film, but the implementation (the movie itself) is pretty bad. I rate it a ""6"" only because I enjoyed the story idea and the special effects.<br/><br/>The movie is basically about an MIT professor (Nicolas Cage) who comes into possession of a 50-year old note from a time-capsule. It identifies (through numbers) all the major disasters of the last 50 years ... plus a three upcoming ones. He resolves to look deeper into the final three ... and wonders - why him, why now and what is about to happen? <br/><br/>On the surface, the setup is very cool-sounding; something like that will always pull me into the theater. But when you watch the movie - it's kind of a train-wreck.<br/><br/>The acting is bad, the way the reality-checks in the movie are nuts and even the film's color (or processing) is sub-standard (and I generally never notice that kind of stuff).<br/><br/>Even with one of the most watchable on-screen presences like Nicolas Cage, the performances are almost painful to watch. The events drive this movie forward, not interest in the characters.<br/><br/>I think the worst part of the movie is that no one did any serious ""reality-checks"" in the script. For instance, the time capsule hardly looked protected - it looked like the burial hatch could could be pried open with just a couple of crowbars. A couple of kids could/should have raided that thing 2 days after it was put into the ground.<br/><br/>Even the 'skeptical' scientific sidekick of Cage was unreal. His fellow MIT professor friend recommended that he dismiss his decoding of the numbers - even with what seemed like a 99+% positive correlation to disaster dates and death tolls. There needs to be more ""gray"" area to inject believable skepticism - not go up against a 99% hit rate.<br/><br/>Perhaps the last problem worth mentioning is timing. Everything is happening tomorrow or the day after ... literally. I'm all for tension, but the timing is just too infeasible without further and better explanation.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the effects are fantastic. There are crashes and explosions that are among the best I've seen. The effects crew deserves an award for the intensity and thoroughness of their work: bravo!<br/><br/>All in all, this is pretty interesting idea couched in a bad movie. I managed to maintain my fascination with the story in the midst of a lot of terrible movie-making. I would not recommend this to the average moviegoer, but to the sci-fi fan ... ""sure, see this movie, but it has lots of glaring problems so be prepared."""
"dvc5159","8","3","8","24 March 2009"," The most surprising, exciting, and thought-provoking science fiction film since 2006's ""Children of Men"".
","I'm not sure what I just saw. I went into the cinema expecting a cliché-ridden film with great special effects and the usual Hollywood fare, nothing more, nothing less. Oh, and Cage trying his best to still flaunt his haunted action hero persona.<br/><br/>How happy, in both cases, was I to be proved oh so utterly WRONG, because ""Know1ng"" is NOT your usual Hollywood cliché-fest, instead it may just very well be the most surprising film you've seen in AGES, if not ever. Why? Because it is fun, hugely exciting and entertaining to watch, and at the same time makes us think deep. Very, very deep.<br/><br/>The acting, while the only thing maintaining anything Hollywood, is above average. Cage delivers a surprisingly great performance as the hero, the professor who tries to solve the puzzle and save lives. He is a standout in the film, and I can finally say that he has redeemed himself after that unintentional laugh-fest called ""The Wicker Man"". Everyone else is just fine, but the kids' acting are the only minor flaw - their acting is, there goes that word again, clichéd.<br/><br/>In terms of storytelling, it succeeds in every count. The story starts out as simple, typical Hollywood fare. Expect the usual clichés for the next 100 minutes, or so I thought. Now imagine that every cliché you can think of being thrown out the window, or rather, blown up to smithereens. Yes, this film not only challenges the clichés by the film's second half, it completely destroys them. People, this is the disaster film we've all been waiting for. It keeps you on the edge of your seat even after the apotheotical ending. The ending...oh God... I can't say it, although I know a lot of people will be divided over it. You're gonna have to see it for yourself to believe it. I'll give you a hint though - think Neon Genesis Evangelion.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of the movie is also excellent. Director Alex Proyas... I liked ""I,Robot"", I absolutely LOVED ""Dark City"". This is close to ""Dark City"". I can proudly say that ""Know1ng"" is one of Proyas' very best films. His direction is taut, kinetic and intense throughout the film, and he does have a visual eye for some scenes. The tone of the film is dark and suspenseful, and that's a good thing. The special effects are terrific. For a US$50 million budgeted film the special effects are nicely handled and very believable. Accompanying all of this is Marco Beltrami's (yay!) music score which fits the movie really well and sets the overall mood for the film. Especially when he uses a piece of classical music for a powerful scene.<br/><br/>This movie raises a lot, and do I mean a LOT, of questions. If I explain them here in detail it will spoil the movie. The questions posed are bleak, disturbing, and mind-bending. This film has not got me thinking like mad since ""Children of Men"" three years ago.<br/><br/>I walked into the cinema hall expecting a fast-paced, popcorn munching good time, to be hugely entertained by Nic Cage and his heroic antics to save the world. I got much, much more than I bargained for. Good thing, because I spent the entire week haunted and thinking about the movie. I'm still thinking about it even as I type this review! And I think most people will too.<br/><br/>Thanks to the rightfully misleading marketing campaign, the public are in for a treat. This is a film that deserves the success, and it has to be seen and appreciated for a long time. I'm sorry if the review does not sound like it's giving the right rating, but believe me, if I had to review it in full detail I'd have to spoil the movie. This film is an absolute jolt to the eyes and head, and with scenes that will leave you talking, thinking and guessing, this movie is one of the greatest disaster movies ever made, it should be placed alongside Irwin Allen's earlier hits. Go see this movie, you won't be disappointed. Cage is back in top form, and he'd have Proyas to thank for that.<br/><br/>Overall: 9/10"
"indyj1","4","3","8","21 March 2009"," Sometimes not knowing is better...
","Let me preface this by saying I am by no means panning this movie. The general premise was intriguing, the action and intensity for the first 3/4 of the film was terrific.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage, who time and again has proved he has no range as an actor, once again plays a perfect role - a now alcoholic, cynical, one-dimensional widower with a precocious young son.<br/><br/>The unearthing of a 50-year old time capsule and subsequent discovery of a list of numbers inside that appear to have predicted every major disaster on earth for the past 50 years, combined with witnessing a disaster called for in the document, suddenly turns Cage's world upside down.<br/><br/>As he seeks answers to what's happening, the plot thickens, excitement ensues...until the sudden appearance of mysterious strangers who seem to have direct connection to what's happening. Unfortunately, the more they show about them, the more outlandish this supernatural subplot becomes.<br/><br/>By the last 20 minutes of the film, it appears the filmmakers had two stories in mind, neither of which was long or substantial enough to last two hours. So, they smashed both plots together to create the final product. Had I not seen the end of the movie, I think it would have been a better overall experience, regardless of not know how it all comes out.<br/><br/>The first 75% merits an 8, but the ridiculous ending is worthy of perhaps a 2 rating, thus reducing the overall movie."

If you exclusively enjoy movies such a Spiderman or The Fantastic Four (albeit good movies, but not exactly a complex storyline requiring much thought), this movie may not be for you.

This review is split into two sections: ONE CONTAINS SPOILERS for those who have viewed it AND ONE DOES NOT FOR PROSPECTIVE VIEWERS.<br/><br/>YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED :: NON-SPOILER VERSION FOLLOWS<br/><br/>Emotional, stimulating, and surprising; this movie was worth every penny. This is no typical disaster movie. There is realistic and epic trauma and unexpected turns that make this movie a powerful, heart-tugging experience to watch. You cant predict anything until it happens. It constantly surprised me and kept me on the edge of my chair. (I jumped several times too and got laughed at but oh well different story ^_^) The profound element of surprise it possesses makes it a constant emotional roller coaster that leaves you thinking long after the movie is over. It has the right balance of action in it to keep it visually and mentally engaging and the effects are just stunning. It is the best movie I have seen in years. Just keep in mind that this movie is highly spiritual in nature (especially the end), and has disturbing scenes; some resulting in epic trauma sequences, this movie is not for the faint (or young) of heart. But really, watch this movie. The critiques are wrong, It is amazing and full of meaning. It teaches that you should love and appreciate every day and every person in your life; and that while some things perish, some are constant and timeless.<br/><br/>SPOILER EDITION :) Stop looking now and go away. You must watch it first<br/><br/>The world is cataclysmically and irrecoverably engulfed in flames as billions perish and die, A graphic plane crash sucks you into the scene while you watch people burning and listen to the ambient screams, a subway bus derails and, well, ends epically. This movie is poignant, mentally and spiritually engaging and emotional from the very start. It follows the personal struggles of each main character to the very bitter-sweet end of the world and humanity. And what is so gut-wrenching is that in your standard ""Save the world"" movie, there is always a solution and everything works out fine, usually with a few complications or deaths. Some of the most overrated movies adhere to this style. But in this one, there is nothing John can do; nobody would believe his theory and the end of the world is imminent. It teaches important lessons of love and appreciation of life, as some things are not constant whereas others are timeless. The death of Caleb's mom was a turn in the movie I did not expect at all. The wreck was so intense and realistic it left me emotionally drained. But my mom did die in a car accident, so it could be a personal thing. And the ending was a little creepy, but its a believable science fiction movie. It takes biblical concepts about the second coming, revelations, and genesis and applies them realistically on a modern scale and its just..amazing as a movie. The bible says the world shall end in fire; and so it did. The only thing that would have made it perfect was the edition of thematic music (where a certain scene or idea is represented by a certain melody - in terms of musical scores. Picture harry potter or the lord of the rings). That would have added a sense of nostalgia that was somewhat lacking in the end. But look past the critique in me. Great movie."
"oakgen35","10","4","13","22 March 2009"," one of best movies i've ever seen
","I signed up on IMDb specifically to comment about this AMAZING movie. I was blown away, riveted, and (insert action adjective here). Special effects rocked you to the core. The plot had many unique twists and turns. The movie incorporated elements of horror, suspense, intellectualism, drama, and science fiction nearly flawlessly. It evoked awe, sadness, wonder, and fear in me. This movie truly is epic in the same sense as Lord of the Rings, Independence Day, or Titanic. I don't really analyze the job the actors are doing to much, because the content, plot, and special effects really steal the show, you could throw all but the most outrageously horrible actors in the roles and it would really not detract to much. That said, i believe that nicolas cage did a decent job acting out his role."

","first i saw the poster of ""knowing"" in a newspaper. and i liked the subject of the film that is mysterious. but i had thought that i would see an ordinary film and not enough end, before i went to the film. i went the cinema with my friend. there was no film worth to see instead of ""knowing"". so we went to this film and i am very pleasant there was no another film to see. ""knowing"" is perfectly suitable for me to watch. <br/><br/>there are many effective scenes in the film. john don't know what should he believe. he doesn't like the idea all the things in the infinite happens accidentally. but he can't be sure. one day he sees the paper from 1959 that is all about numbers. and (accidentally) he realized a date. near the date there is an meaningless number too. but when he look on the internet for the date. he understand number isn't meaningless. it shows the number of people who dead because of the disaster that happened in that date. the paper contains big disasters happened that in last 50 years. but there is a small detail, three of the dates hasn't came yet. it is one of the most effective scenes in the film he realized that detail.<br/><br/>some of the numbers still look like just numbers not more than. and (accidentally) john realized these numbers' meanings. they are about the coordinate of a place in gps. and those coordinates shows where he is, in the moment he realized them. first disaster happens in unexpected way. a plane fall down near him and the other waiting people. i feel like as John. i feel like see a real plane accident that happens near me. after the accident, hurt people because of disaster are running around. some of them are burning. some of them are just in shock. and you hear screams. it is real in all way ! and it is one of the best accident scenes in Hollywood i think.<br/><br/>subway scene has surprising event. while audience are waiting for a blowing, a surprising disaster happens. and john can't save people and change the future again. the numbers shows certain events have to happen. so john understand it compulsorily. <br/><br/>there is one more disaster will happen. and one more riddle to solve. and its solution shows the end. there will be a huge disaster. <br/><br/>foreigners want to save only two people to begin a new starting after the end. the plan was sent 1959 to the world is nearly finishing, not accidentally. john is worried but relaxed to know there is a fatal.<br/><br/>science fiction is not the true word for ""knowing"". the film has holy messages. it shows us the beginning. it shows us the life tree and first couple. and it does that in very effective way. if i show my opinion about film exaggeratedly, i can say i watched the film without breathing. excellent."

","Compeling plot, interesting, eerie, spooky, great settings, MIT, numbers/codes, great character development..... and then the ending! It was like a flash back - The Abyss, Close Encounters, what was that Jodie Foster Flick-First Contact?...we have seen this before. REALLY disappointing. I really like Nicholas Cage, he can save any barker, but this was too good a movie for this underlying ""our religion is really just based on aliens"" theme, and especially with the goofy presentation at the ending. Give me a break. I am writing this to discourage people from paying good money to support and encourage this weak, incomplete movie delivery."
"RebeccaWood","5","5","19","20 March 2009"," Nick Cage is on a role...
","""Knowing"" starts out with an intriguing premise: a girl accurately predicts the horrible happenings of the world until...???? Questions ran through my head as I watched the movie, how? why? what? who? huh?, but I soon began to feel confused, angry, depressed, dissatisfied...the list continues on and on. ""What the crap is going on"" was the most frequent thought that my friends and I conjured up, and, by the end, most wanted to leave the theater...and call their mom, for comfort from enduring this movie.<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong, the movie was decently made, I suppose. The brutality of the deaths of innocent people was unnerving. Seeing hundreds killed in burning wreckage left me with a feeling of despair, which was, perhaps, the intention of the filmmakers. The downright creepiness of some of the parts had me clutching onto the sides on my chair and desperately wanting the scene to end. Yes, it was intense.<br/><br/>However, there was plenty wrong with the film. The graphics for the most part were sub-par, except for at the end, when they were decent.<br/><br/>Acting overall was just OK. Many laughable moments or....""OK...what was weird/odd/completely ridiculous"" moments. Nicolas Cage as a lead character with a strong emotional role did poorly. He is, apparently, unable to act in an emotional role without evoking laughter from the audience. I guess it is up to the individual to decide how annoying he was throughout the film, but...Wicker Man, anyone??<br/><br/>Also, this is not a feel-good movie...at all. As mentioned before, the brutality and creepiness of it all will most likely get to you or at least cause some discomfort. I guess the question is, should someone spend ten bucks and two hours and ten minutes of their time devoted to this film? My answer: Heck no. But your curiosity, much like mine, will likely get to you, and you'll spend it anyway."

"ericericbob","4","2","5","11 July 2017"," Disappointing movie
","This movie was very disappointing. I like Nic Cage as an actor and expected more from the movie he played in. I watched the whole movie and felt like my time could have been better spent. I felt like different aspects of it didn't make sense. The aliens resembled zombies from a horror movie. Where they supposed to be friendly and care about our civilization? Then why were they so creepy. What is with the black rocks? What did they represent? Were the children supposed to fend for themselves after the aliens left them on a planet? Were they supposed to grow up and start a new colony? What's with the tree at the end? Is it supposed to represent something from the bible? This movie left more questions then answers. I like answers."
"gumo-44040","1","2","5","28 May 2017"," Extremely annoying
","Bunch of hysterical idiots doing completely irrational things all the time.<br/><br/>Also, they don't communicate because that would make sense.<br/><br/>Don't look for any kind of rational behaviour in this movie, it's just pure madness."
"filipemanuelneto","3","2","5","29 March 2017"," An interesting beginning. The rest of the film does not matter.
","When I started watching this movie I was excited. Finally, a good sci-fi movie, with touches of suspense and horror, and a nice tension. In fact, the two major strengths of this film are the visual components (airplane disaster or scenes of looting crowds, closer to the end, are visually impressive, for example) and the central idea of ​​the plot: a numeric prophecy investigated by a skeptical mathematician. The problem is that the good things in the movie end here.<br/><br/>From the middle, the film loses quality. With prophecies solved the plot thread ends. From there, the film extends because it has to close the story anyway, giving rise to plot holes the size of houses and inserting immense religious symbology for no reason. I read a comment that said the movie is full of subliminal propaganda to Church of Scientology... well, I actually detected symbols with religious connotations, but I'm not an expert in subliminal messages or in that sect to properly identify a connection to a specific cult. Another problem is the hammy and unnatural performance of Nicolas Cage, who ceases to be skeptical too suddenly and unbelievably. At the beginning of the film, he lectures at MIT in which he approaches determinism and coincidentality... even this could have been best used in the script! The film is loaded with CGI of fairly medium quality, but the end is more worthy of a computer game than a movie."

","With all due respect to this Nicholas Cage vehicle, but I am not really sure what I just watched on Netflix, but to be honest, I thought it was rubbish. You had me at national treasure, but this, OMG. WHHHHYYYYYYY!!?????? Scientology written all over it. Propaganda propaganda propaganda. First of all, long pause, where in the hell were the rest of the races being represented in this movies to be saved or rescued. Are you kidding me? Now I'm outraged, and it's gonna take more than Samuel Coburn to get me sedated. And not mention Nicholas Cage's character's fast decline into insanity. What is with these people? And that twilight zone music knockoff, Bad and sad. Again, WWWWWHHHHHHHyyyyyyyyyyy. It's clouded judgment. I'm just saying"
"anaconda-40658","1","2","5","21 May 2015"," Knowing How Stupid This Film Is.
","Knowing (2009): Dir: Alex Proyas / Cast: Nicolas Cage, Rose Byrne, Chandler Canterbury, Lara Robinson, Nadia Townsend: Ridiculous thriller about end times. A fifty year time capsule is opened at an elementary school but Nicolas Cage's son receives a paper scribbled in numbers that seems to predict major tragedies. Unfortunately it failed to predict the tragedy that would result in the releasing of this film to the innocent public. Lame concept surpassed by stupidity with albino figures appearing and a totally fake subway sequence. With special effects that bare all the excitement of a midnight run to the outhouse, it makes one wonder about the director. Alex Proyas is at his worst and that is a tragedy in itself considering that he previously made a visually stunning masterpiece called Dark City. Cage does what he can as a father concerned with his son but the role is standard and flat with an ending that has him watching his son go to a better place, such as onto the set of a better film. Rose Byrne overacts as the daughter of the author of those numeral scribbles. Chandler Canterbury and Lara Robinson also appear but nobody in this junk is making a career move that they will likely want brought up at a Hollywood party. It addressed the future but misfires horribly on delivering that message without being welcomed with laughter. It becomes a joke without the filmmakers ""knowing"" it. Score: 1 / 10"
"TwiZone","8","2","5","16 December 2013"," A criminally underrated film
","First off, I'm not going to say that I think ""Knowing"" is one of the greatest films ever made, nor do I think it's a perfect film by any means as it does have a few problems, but overall, I've always really enjoyed this one. I love the cinematography, the atmosphere, the tone, the premise, the score and especially the tense moments scattered throughout this film. Sometimes, it pays not to listen to what others say and instead watch a film and come to your own conclusions. For me, I always got a fair amount out of this film compared to a lot of others. It's not a masterpiece by any means, but it's one that I always enjoy. I would give it an 8/10 overall."
"mkcrbl","8","2","5","4 February 2013"," Very fine film
","This is a very fine movie. Plenty of people are like brats. They never stop griping. They can have everything in the world given to them and will continue to find some excuses to gripe.<br/><br/>Reasonable people will enjoy this film and Ebert is right in his critique and rating. Many people will complain about one thing or another, or multiple things, but it's a fine movie, certainly recommendable. And people who mostly have complaints about this film should produce their own version and then make it promptly available to expert critics to get their feedback, before releasing the film to the public.<br/><br/>Is it a decent, worthwhile film for entertainment? Sure. Are some people going to find excuses to complain? Sure. Complaining and doing nothing beneficial is a common human characteristic. This movie doesn't deserve derision. It's fine."
"puppydog237","7","2","5","26 November 2011"," Great Movie, Cheesy Ending
","This is a great movie overall. But by the end in the last 15 minutes or so it starts to get cheesy. In the end of the movie, that guy (its been a while since I watched this so I forgot his name) tells the kids and that other one (the daughter of Lucinda aka the girl that died) that they have to go to the mobile home because its the only safe place left on earth so they don't get blown to smithereens. Then the gang starts to think he's crazy and they will die there. They all ditch him and go to the gas station to fill up where the emergency broadcast system go's off and everyone go's nuts. The kids are left in the car and Keleb go's and calls his dad on the payphone. Keleb go's back in the car with Abby. soon after while the lady is in the building with all the lunatics some random person ( the ALIEN!!!) steels the car with the kids Keleb and Abby in it. So the lady steels someones jeep at the station and chases the alien. Then while crossing an intersection she gets hit by a semi and dies. A little later, That guy comes by the gas station and asks where they are. he goes chasing for the kids and discovers the body. He chases the alien to the mobile home which was the safe point. Then he chases them into the woods on foot and sees all the other aliens who look like humans. Keleb says all the stuff about all them wanting him and Abby on there planet and asks about his dad being able to come. they get taken with them and the dad go to his dads house to spend their last minutes on earth together. Everyone on earth dies except the 2 kids where they are roaming on an obviously fake planet."
"philboid-2","Null","2","5","25 July 2011"," One Thing Wrong With This Film
","Okay, there are many things wrong with 'Knowing,' not least of all the casting of Nicolas Cage as an M.I.T. astrophysicist. Is there another actor alive who could OVERREACT to the end of the world?<br/><br/>Anyway, the main thing wrong with this film is the tremendous flaw in the narrative. Do you know why the whispering aliens (who looked like a warm-up band for Kraftwerk with a fog machine) planted all those predictions in the little girl's head in 1959, then had them discovered by Caleb in 2009? That is, do you know what the purpose was for all that torment, sturm und drang? Neither did the writers. There was no purpose. All the aliens had to do was rescue the children in 2009 before the big boom-boom from the sun. In fact, that is what they DID do. There was no reason for any of the other stuff, no reason for the ridiculous Cage to discover the prophecies, and no reason to see this bombastic, blustering mess of a movie."
"MovieGuy109","5","2","5","24 July 2011"," Knowing is a preposterous film that turns out laughable.
","There are plenty of weird films with obnoxious plot elements out there, but none rival the sheer laughable absurdity of Knowing. Knowing starts out very clever and intense and just when it looks like its going to be a great movie, it runs out of ideas. The film has a really good concept, but the execution is weak and lacking. I applaud the writers for not falling into clichés, but this tries a little too hard. Ultimately, Knowing comes out empty handed and often laughable. There is one thing that I do like about it though, the disaster scenes really give you the feeling of being there. Director Proyas does a good job with that, but little else."
"derektrotteresq","4","2","5","28 December 2009"," What the hell did i just watch?!
","This film is so mind numbingly awful that it beggars belief. It starts promisingly, falters in the middle and the less said about the end, the better. The premise of the film is excellent but badly executed, with plot holes so massive, you could build your own island on them. Nothing is explained or makes much sense and the whole film seems like one big awful mess. I'm struggling to understand why Nicholas Cage would even entertain starring in this ridiculous turkey of a movie, it's not like he needs the money. In short, this movie made me want to gouge out my own eyeballs with a straightened out paperclip. I think the official term for movies like this is 'crapfest'."
"sddavis63","8","2","5","23 December 2009"," Pretty Heavy And At Times Creepy
","I suppose that any movie that deals ultimately with the end of the world has to be at times heavy. This one definitely qualifies on that count. It opens with a portrayal of children at a Massachussetts elementary school planting a time capsule in 1959 that was to be opened 50 years later. The children all draw pictures of what the future would be like, except for obviously troubled Lucinda, who scribbles out what seems to be a random set of numbers. Fast forward 50 years and the time capsule is opened. Young Caleb gets Lucinda's paper, and his father John - an MIT astrophysics professor who lectures his class about the competing theories of randomness vs. purpose - becomes fascinated with it and finally realizes that it's a list of dates when tragedies will happen, showing not only when they'll happen but where and how many will die.<br/><br/>From that point on there's a real creepiness to the movie as the next two of Lucinda's prophecies come true, and John finally realizes what the final one (which didn't identify a number of people killed, but simply recorded ""EE"") is. Through most of the movie there was a sort of quasi-religious, sort of new age/sort of Christian theme going on. There are a number of biblical references, and it turns out that John's father is a pastor, although John himself is filled with doubt, especially after the death of his wife before the movie started. The final prophecy (as it starts to unfold) creates suspense but also became a little bit silly, as the identities of the ""whisperers"" was revealed. Their identity wasn't really a surprise - there were perhaps 3 possibilities for who or what they were, and any of them could have worked as the basis for the movie. The closing scene returns to the quasi-religious theme as Caleb and Abby find themselves in a Garden of Eden type environment, heading toward a tree. Is the Genesis story now just going to begin again, with these two as Adam and Eve?<br/><br/>I liked Nicholas Cage as John. He did a good job with the part and this was clearly his movie. The feeling of silliness as the movie came to an end aside, this was a pretty suspenseful movie with a pretty good depiction of the apocalypse at the end. 8/10"
"koenschuringa","2","2","5","8 December 2009"," One of the biggest mistakes i made in a while. Don't trust the 6.5 rating!!!
","I was looking for a decent film to watch with my girlfriend just to have a relaxing evening. Already having seen most new movies i went to look for something decent we had not seen yet. Well.. we chose Knowing.. having a nice trailer and a 6.5 IMDb rating i was expecting a mediocre disaster movie. What is was not expecting was some sci-fi doctrine piece of random rubbish! <br/><br/>The film begins actually kind of good, but that all changes after half an hour or so and 2/3 into the movie it even gets worse! Its full of plot holes, bad acting, shitty special effects and it has the worst ending ever! On top of that it has an annoying religious propaganda like undertone.<br/><br/>Renting this movie was one of the worst mistakes i've made in quite a while. Don't trust the 6.5 rating on IMDb unless you are mentally unstable. Its a waste of money and 2 hours of your life! Go watch District-9 instead if you want a good original sci-fi flick!<br/><br/>I really was gonna give this 1/10 but gave it 2/10 because the first 15/30 minutes are actually kinda good."
"MrGKB","5","2","5","1 November 2009"," Weak sci-fi melded with pseudo-religious bunkum, signifying nothing...
","...more than Hollywood's ability to part poorly-educated American adolescents (and adolescent minds) from their parents' money. I knew ""Knowing"" was going to disappoint as soon as I saw three names credited for the screenplay. Checking here confirmed that initial misgiving; these are the folks who helped inflict a wretched ""Boogeyman"" upon the world. Needless to say, I'm not looking forward to what they're going to do with the upcoming remake of ""The Birds."" Still, I had some hopes that director Alex ""The Crow"" Proyas, who'd also helmed the deliciously bizarre ""Dark City,"" might come through again. Alas, this was not to be, despite what I'm assuming were his best efforts, given that he helped produce the thing as well. As is almost always the case, the main fault lies in the script, which, though compelling on the surface, is utterly flawed.<br/><br/>I'll try to be succinct. ""Knowing"" basically posits an alien race with god-like powers, including incredibly detailed (and accurate) prognostication and faster-than-light space flight. These aliens have determined some fifty years in the past of the film's current events that the Sun will suffer a coronal mass ejection which will cleanse the Earth of all life. They choose to notify a select group of humans of this terrible fate in order to (presumably) lead these lucky people to various sites around the planet, from which the aliens will take them onto their ships and transport them to a new and far distant world where these survivors can ""start over."" Isn't that special? One such pair of survivors is notified via a coded message planted in a time capsule, and received by the son of a crack astrophysicist M.I.T. professor (Nicolas ""I'll take that paycheck, thank you"" Cage). The clever, drunken prof manages to eventually crack the code and get the message (in bits and pieces) via a very nearly preposterous series of coincidences and a serious dollop of serendipity, including being witness to a spectacular airplane crash. One bit of silly business after another finally leads him and the two children to the proper lift-off point, and everything is resolved neatly, sort of.<br/><br/>Now, without going into further detail about the silliness involved in all this, I pose the simple question: why doesn't this incredibly advanced extraterrestrial civilization simply use its obviously incredible technology/magical powers to build a proper shield to protect the ""doomed"" planet and its miserable inhabitants? How hard can that be for a race so amazingly advanced that it can see into the future? Are they just picky about who gets to live? Do they think there are just a handful of humans that are worthy of salvation? Is it all really just ""God"" working His mysterious ways? It boggles the mind nearly as much as the stupidity of films like ""Independence Day"" and others of that ilk.<br/><br/>That said, ""Knowing"" does feature superb production values: great special effects, some startlingly effective visuals, decent if unremarkable acting, good sound, and capable direction. It's the story that falls flat on its face. There's a garbled attempt to pin some epistemological and/or ontological explanation for this skullduggery via a confused metaphysical argument, but none of it makes a lick of sense when considered for more than a second or two.<br/><br/>Other posters here have detailed some of the more egregious flaws in the script (cf. a time capsule stored under a manhole cover that any determined jackass could and would remove at a moment's notice with very little effort), so I'll leave Constant Reader to discover them on their own. Suffice to say, this is just more mindless eye candy for the indifferent masses, and only barely worth watching. Apocalypse geeks will get off on the destructive imagery, Nicolas Cage detractors will have a field day with his hair, teeth, and phone call acting, and no one will give a fig for the poor thing within twenty minutes of having watched it.<br/><br/>Time-wasting viewing only. I give it the rating I do strictly for the visuals, and its narrow escape from utter mediocrity by the narrowest of margins. Best rented for free, and certainly not worth purchasing unless you're (perhaps) a Rose ""28 Weeks Later"" Byrne groupie. You've been warned.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage really, really, really needs a better agent, not to mention a slap upside the head with a wet fish."
"whatever_123","Null","2","5","27 October 2009"," One of the biggest disappointments since Indiana Jones 4
","To this day, I am still appalled by this utter FAILURE. This movie starts to look good and really builds up, until halfway through when everything goes down the toilet.<br/><br/>The beginning was intriguing. The possessed girl writes down all those numbers on the paper, which is put into a time capsule. Then, you meet the main character, Nicolas Cage, and his son. The son ends up with the paper and Nicolas Cage finds out what it means.<br/><br/>Things really start to build up here. You start wondering what is going to happen and how our hero is going to deal with these problems. The disasters (plane wreck, subway crash) were intense and exciting. The combination of camera work and animation enhanced it and made it look like it was happening in front of you. All the adrenaline pumping action and horror of so may people dying make you think it could get way better.<br/><br/>I noticed that the movie steeply declined after that. For one thing, the little boy starts hearing voices in his head, and loses his cuteness, replacing it with a possessed grimace on his face, which he has for the whole rest of the movie. All the scientific concepts and the religious concepts in the movie start flying everywhere, and they don't work well together at all. Much to my horror, it got even worse.<br/><br/>For some reason, we are showed many times scenes of these creepy men standing in the woods staring at the little boy's window. Continuously, they appear out of nowhere and hand the little boy shiny black rocks. The nature or purpose of the rocks are never explained or even MENTIONED. The movie takes terrible risks, and fails every time to deliver something great.<br/><br/>There's one particular scene where the acting and the things that happen are so ridiculous and stupid, I actually laughed. Nick Cage's character runs after one of the creepy stalkers, demanding that he leaves his son alone. They stop in a small clearing, and for no particular reason, the stalker shoots a beam of light out of his mouth at Cage and disappears. This can be described with one word: HUH?????? The disasters keep happening, you keep seeing the stalkers, and just when you think things couldn't get worse, the movie ends in the same way that destroyed the fourth Indiana Jones movie: the uninvited appearance of aliens. ALIENS????? There was no hint at all anywhere in the trailers, websites, or anything that says there were aliens in the movie. It's like the creators ran out of ideas towards the end of the script and some genius said, ""I have the solution! ALIENS!"" It's like if you can't come up with a good ending, just throw in some aliens and the movie will still be good. Hollywood needs to crumple that idea up and throw it into the garbage disposal. It's amazing how many movies were ruined by this poor excuse for good writing.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie ends like this: The kids are kidnapped by the stalkers and the stalkers turn into shiny rip-off clones of the Silver Surfer with wings.The kids are also given big fluffy bunnies as gifts from the stalkers. They are taken away by the Silver Angel Stalkers in their giant spiky starship.<br/><br/>The starship took at least twenty minutes to take off. It wasn't important to the story, rather it was a display of ""look what cool stuff we can do with today's technology!!"" It was very irritating.<br/><br/>Soon after the kids and the gay shiny people FINALLY leave, Nick Cage's character goes to his parents house, when the ENTIRE WORLD is engulfed by a solar flare. What kind of ending is that where nothing is ever resolved and everybody on Earth dies?? Plus, the ending scene shows the two kids in some kind of reborn Earth running around like Adam and Eve with the Tree of Life in the background. WHAT??????? This was the most poorly writing, painful, agonizing, stupid, pointless, messed up, disgusting excuse for a major motion picture. The acting was terrible, the special effects were overdone, there was no resolution, depth, or point to this film. Do not rent this movie. Do not talk to anyone who enjoyed this movie. Hollywood, do us all a favor and take writing or directing classes, and most of all get some original ideas and some brains!!"

","I would like to understand a film and I started to read about angels and stones and all of this symbols and then understood that I'm abysmal know-nothing and I have missed without knowing it. All in film slot into place with new information. It appears that to learn religion is very interesting and that whole film relies on religion. The film became brighter and deeper for me. The angel in transfer means herald. Angels assume human shape when wish to help. And probably it should be exactly this - slim, sharp, almost transparent and luminous from within. I like his noble pallor. And bodiless: so lean - minimum body, only spirit. His eyes like dancing flame, and stare severe. I read that angels in the dark always, don't show themselves and that the light is dazzling mortal (Scene in wood) and them help and protect (Caleb told about it in the end), black stones is symbol of immortal soul, about burning animals was written in Scripture. Seraphs have wings instead of angels. Means they are not quit angel. And seraphs guard doors in paradise. Revelation belong them. They are endowed by power, will and mind. They clear fire and have light force. But also punish.And much such a thing that I not in a condition to understand. Means Strangers depict seraphs. All tallies exactly with it. He so strange, strangest of whom I ever saw. But... I have not found anything about that angels whisper. They sound the trumpet, their voices should sound! Certainly whisper is a thriller element. Probably only few people appreciated a film greatly and without reserve exactly because to find out for oneself not very simple. What for all of you wish to take away all people? Look on shot how the Stranger puts a stone in a hand of the boy! So a sunflower seed lower in the earth. It is not necessary to take a plant and enough only a seed. It seems to me children are seeds carefully replaced in the new earth. Knowing repeats to us that the death is not, but not all have heard it. The director drew attention of spectators away from the essence through effective scenes and complicated understanding. In addition, to understand it is necessary to KNOW. In a film there was no integrity. I think because it was a lot of all sorts. Something used only for fright and nothing more than that, something - only pursuit after an effect... and no more, something - only for intricate plot, something - for disclosure of the truth; and subject of relationship in family and many touching scenes. If all of it aspired to one purpose - the film could become excellent. As it is... The film left a huge incompleteness and dissatisfaction. It is such interesting film and casting ideal. Nevertheless has got to the category of Film-accident for the majority but, indeed, Knowing is above it.Simply it is clear not at once. That the film was the best - it is necessary to take the hint of all.That each phrase and each shot sounded and sang. And directed our thought to something to the only thing.That is why work of the director is estimated low. With such magnificent actors what participated in the movie,it would be possible to tell more.In my opinion the director tried to please general public. That any average person could tell: ""Wow! What plane falls! Cooool!!"" - and so on.The majority has paid attention only to it. The movie should not play up to the masses; on the contrary, the masses should follow it."

If you apply the logic these people are using for rating this movie so low you would have to give Close encounters of the third kind, The Da Vinci code, and E.T. the same low rating.

Put yourself in the right mindset and enjoy a great Scifi movie."
"secondtake","6","2","5","6 September 2009"," Slowly builds to an unexpected end...pure Hollywood stuff
","Knowing (2009)<br/><br/>Slowly builds to an unexpected end...pure Hollywood stuff<br/><br/>Knowing is terrific and terrifying, and it has some of the best disaster effects you'll ever see. But it's not brilliant or even original, though the plot has its own turns and specifics to make it distinctive. It uses so many familiar sci-fi/thriller/horror tricks to shock us and make us pay attention, you might feel as manipulated, and helpless, as I did, but you might also get swept along and have a great time.<br/><br/>The plot, which I have a rule against describing, is more crucial to the development of the action than many movies. Nicolas Cage is really fine as the lead scientist/dad, and in a very usual Cage kind of way. If you like him (which I do), I'd say you'll like the movie. The kids hearing voices and the building sense of doom are necessary and entertaining--if that's not too breezy a word for a heavy heavy story. Because it is all dependent on this 50 year old prophesy, and about how to decode it, and then, alas, what the heck to do about it. In some ways it devolves into a standard catastrophe scenario, with Cage holding his end of the stick very well. The scientist he plays faces his atheism and watches it evaporate with dry resistance, very nicely.<br/><br/>The really disappointing gripe is how poorly the concept is handled in terms of science and math and general likelihood. The numerology just isn't convincing. In some ways it's so simple and historically based, it's dull (and excessive) once you get the point. But having the information and then running around in a frenzy isn't exactly what you might expect. Furthermore, the solar flare idea is conceivable, but not presenting with a kind of scientific reasonableness that would give the movie credibility. Even the way the trailer has been abandoned for years and never vandalized doesn't match my experience of the back woods.<br/><br/>But then, maybe it just operates as a what-if kind of fantasy, with a holy-cow ending that will gag the most dreamy-eyed of you. They could have left the last minute off entirely...but you might disagree completely. If you see it on a plane (not likely) or in a motel, it's perfect distraction material, gripping and exciting. The first big disaster (you'll see) is so realistic it gives me goosebumps remembering it."

","The cardboard cutout does it again; Cage's wooden acting is slightly offset by the other actors, the plot may have been written on the back of a matchbook, the ending is no great shakes. A wasted opportunity but a pleasant way to spend an hour or so - cheers abounded when love interest died, pity Mr Cage didn't get it earlier as well. All that driving through the eye of the storm (mob violence etc), I would have jumped on the back of the truck - (the truck being the real star of the movie).<br/><br/>And why oh why did the aliens bother? just save the bunnies.<br/><br/>And take the pebbles back.<br/><br/>And who gives a damn?"

","I have been a long-time, loyal fan of Nicholas Cage. This movie, however, is absolutely the worst I have seen from him, to date. It's not just Cage it's the whole movie. Its cheesy special effects, terrible acting all around, and the ending seemed like it was written by Stephen King (who is famous for ruining the endings of good movies). I give this movie a 3 out of 10 because of the concepts in the beginning. The beginning was clever and interesting and I wanted to see what would happen. But then, three-quarters of the way through, I started thinking, ""What the hell happened?"" It turned out to be a mess. It was as if they switched writers toward the end and the producer said, ""Do what you want."" It's just didn't make sense! How Cage didn't recognize this flop while reading the script, is beyond me. Do not waste your time, money, or computer space on this one. You'll thank me in the end."

","There should be a law against directors who take a great idea and destroy it.<br/><br/>The whole ""predicting the future"" thing has been done before, but it's an endlessly intriguing idea because of its resonance for every person on the planet.<br/><br/>But to take something so ominous as the end of the world, then trivialise it with an incongruous throw away ending is little short of scandalous.<br/><br/>This movie plays out like a novel that someone got bored with - they got a few great ideas to get them started, but then the inspiration disappeared and never returned. Rather than taking the time to craft an ending, they simply plagiarised the worst of pulp sci fi, and came up with the sort of ending that will have viewers throwing things at the screen in disgust.<br/><br/>It's not even that the ending concept is so bad - it could have worked, if delivered more artfully - but as it is, what was a half decent film has been utterly ruined by the most schmaltzy, feeble, derivative conclusion ever.<br/><br/>I can only shake my head in disgust and wonder if this was given one single test viewing, because I can't imagine the howls from the audience would have left the director in much doubt that the end needed work.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage needs to take care - this is two consecutive junkers that he's lead. I'm beginning to think he can't spot a decent script..."
"xsinyxx","4","2","5","20 July 2009"," Not as good as it could have been.
","Nicholas cage has done some strange films before, usually they are pretty good. This movie on the other hand is a lot of nothing building up to a tremendous thud. The beginning starts out very promising with a disturbed girl in 1959 named Lucinda, who oddly enough is not evil and bent on killing people, who hears voices. She writes a note filled with numbers, that as we all know can predict forth coming disasters. It is placed in a time capsule and is opened in 2009 by Cage's son. So right there it seems like a cool plot, Cage will get the note and be the only one that believes it.<br/><br/>Now we get more tossed into the mix, the Strangers come along and start messing with him and his son. Now this causes him to go after the Lucinda's daughter. She and Cage get together with their kid's to try and stop the final disaster. Not so believable due to the fact that at first she runs from him before they can really talk and then eventually ends up on his door step ready to believe. We spend a good hour of the film trying to decide what the final disaster could be.<br/><br/>This is where the film makes no sense, I will try to not say too much. We find out the Strangers have known about this for a very long time. This disaster will be global, but rather than warn or help us at all, they work in the background against Cage and his efforts to help everyone. When it is revealed what their intentions are and can do to help, you are left wondering what the last 50 years and torturous effects on their victims were for. That is going to be the extent of the spoilers as the ending just needs to be seen to be judged for yourself.<br/><br/>In all honesty, I think Nicholas Cage needs to start doing scripts with some more substance and be less artsy. I really do feel that this was just a waste and I'm a little cautious to even pick up more films in this vein. Again, I think that a solid story, while it maybe considered a little stale, is better than a story that starts out solid only to put in extreme twists just to keep you guessing."
"zetes","4","2","5","12 July 2009"," P.O.S., but stylishly directed by Proyas
","This movie has been in production for several years, so it isn't too surprising that it retains the Bush-era old time religious overtones, comparable to a film like The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Knowing really is only one step away from Christian dreck like the Left Behind series (that one step would be the casting of Kirk Cameron). That's really only a small objection. One can easily ignore or laugh away that stuff. The real crime of Knowing is that it's just plain dull most of the time. It takes forever to get anywhere. Nicolas Cage steps into that old canard that is the atheist who became so after his wife died (wanna bet he'll find his faith again by the end of the film?). He's a single father now, and a complete non-believer. But his belief in science is challenged when he comes into possession of a note from a time capsule. It is just a long string of numbers, but he starts to notice a pattern. Many of the numbers announce specific dates on which enormous disasters occurred. When he has it all figured out, he makes sure to experience the next couple of disasters firsthand. The final numbers on the note indicate the apocalypse that will take ""everyone else"". Intriguing enough, but the film is bogged down by endless expository dialogue and some ridiculously obscure, villain-ish people who stalk Cage's son (as well as a little girl they meet later on; not really worth getting into). The film does have one thing going for it: director Alex Proyas. The guy really seems to have had only one film in him, 1997's awesome Dark City. He wrote that; he didn't write this. But a crappy movie like this at least demonstrates he has some major talent. The film looks great all the way through. The two least boring parts of the film are the two disasters Cage encounters, one a plane crash and the other a subway car derailing, are two of the most vivid disasters ever caught on film. I object to both of them morally, because Proyas seems to delight way too much in people burning to death and being squished by the train, but they are definitely exciting and well done (the dream sequence with the flaming forest animals, not so much). All in all, it's a stupid, ugly movie, but at least it doesn't feel like it was made by an idiot, like X-Men Origins: Wolverine or Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen."

Let's just throw in something that doesn't make sense. Like some aliens. We'll pull a Crystal Skull and just toss in some aliens. Yeah, that won't p!ss anybody off."" <br/><br/>Nicolas Cage plays a science professor who discovers a piece of paper in a time capsule that has a bunch of numbers written on it that predict every major disaster from 1959 up until 2009 (where the world eventually ends just in time for Nicky Cage to figure it all out...how convenient).<br/><br/>This movie just p!ssed me off. I was actually thinking to myself: ""Maybe this movie isn't as bad as everyone says it is. Maybe they're just hating on a Nicolas Cage movie."" But, alas, they're right. That concludes my review. First two thirds were good/decent, last act was an abysmal pile of crap."

","The movie ""Knowing"" is a well-told, intriguing, and at times, spooky story. The acting is on-par with the modern cinematic experience. There is action, wonder, intensity, and a wonderful sense of foreboding throughout. I liked it and it kept my interest. I had a feeling where it was going, but I was enjoying the journey to get there. There was never a moment where I thought, ""Why is he doing that???"" Nicolas Cage does what he's best at and it kinda works. The kids aren't too annoying.<br/><br/>However, from some of the comments I have read here, I would have believed this to be yet another bad Hollywood (despite being filmed almost entirely in Melbourne, Australia) popcorn flick.<br/><br/>phantasmagoric-1 from United Kingdom writes: ""... aliens! The second worst cop out in history ..."" How are aliens in any way a close second to, '... and then I awoke, and it was all a dream'? I don't understand why a movie cannot contain that particular story element? Who decided that it's off-limits? And when? (You do realize that Transformers are aliens, right?) Personally, I blame Steven Spielberg, Star Trek, Star Wars, and all those 50's science fiction movies. They really cornered the market, and paved the way for alien-free cinema.<br/><br/>This, in spite of the fact that the whole movie had the premise seeded throughout. This comment suggests that the aliens just popped up at minute 120 of a 2-hour film, and proverbially saved the day.<br/><br/>prezidanto from United States writes: ""I've been reading science fiction for 30 years."" Really? Well, I've been reading SF for 30 years too, and I've read many books with similar themes throughout those 30 years. There was nothing in this movie that validates this reviewer's comment, ""'Thought-provoking' only in the sense that if you start thinking about it, you'll be astounded at how little sense in makes, and how much thinking you have to do to force any of it to work."" The movie made complete sense. Yes, there is some thinking involved. A good story compels us to do that.<br/><br/>clement-reber from Switzerland writes that the movie is merely propaganda for Scientology. Well done genius. Now everyone's Googling the Scientology websites to find out where to sign up. Oh, hold on. They're not. Even if there is a Scientology angle to the film (and Hubbard did not invent the premise being told in this story... not even close), it doesn't work unless you put the phone number up on the screen, silly.<br/><br/>valonpimeys from Finland wants to know how a girl in 1959 could write down GPS coordinates... that are from the future. It's hardly worth my time pointing out such ridiculous lack of understanding. That's aside from the fact that GPS coordinates are simply latitude and longitude - a system that is way older than the 50's.<br/><br/>How about the one about the numbers, and how they're never explained. What? Never. Explained? Did some of you fall asleep? Did you turn your brains off, or were you texting on your phone through the whole movie?<br/><br/>So, now I get down to my review of the reviewers. The simple question that I want answered is this: Does anyone actually know anything about the movies they go and see? Or do they just blindly walk into a cinema based on the scenes of fire and destruction they saw in the trailer. It's obvious to me that a good many of the people that saw this movie rated it based on some misguided notion that it didn't play out how they expected.<br/><br/>Does anyone actually know how to be entertained these days? Not enough car chases and guns? It's my firm belief that people are getting stupider as time goes on, that unless a movie has a simple A-B-C plot then they don't know what's going on. Still more, in a tiresome attempt to relive the awe that followed their watching of ""The Sixth Sense"" refuse to accept a story that doesn't have a 'twisty' ending. How many films with tiresome plot-twists do you need to see before you realize that there just aren't that many great ideas left in the world. M. Night Shyamalan has proved that to be true on more than one occasion.<br/><br/>You're three quarters of the way through the movie, after every prediction comes to pass as written, and you still can't accept that John Koestler has no power to change anything. I mean, how dumb do you have to be to still be waiting for the big tangential plot-twist at that point. And did you wipe the constant appearance of the spooky aliens from your mind?<br/><br/>Were the constant references to the sun not a big enough clue? Didn't you understand soon enough that this wasn't a horror movie? That the occult wasn't being featured here? prezidanto from United States makes my point quite aptly when he asks: ""How come the aliens can't find *some* way to communicate with people?"" Well, big surprise for those of you who don't understand the obvious. They did. But, and here's the kick in the pants for you folks, even if they hadn't at all, or even if they'd phoned up the President himself, or appeared on the Today show with flashing neon underpants that spelled out ""The End Is Nigh"", they couldn't stop the inevitable from happening. And that, my children, was the point of the whole movie."

Sadly the writer and director give the viewer a toss. <br/><br/>Pluses of the film: The film's idea is catchy, so is its first hour. Nicolas Cage provides the star-value. <br/><br/>Minuses: The film loses grip, especially the climax which is a complete letdown. The Adam & Eve concept falls flat.

","If you really want to read one lengthy review, please give this one a go; I promise it's no knee-jerk, spoiler-free and considered with your bucks in mind.<br/><br/>Firstly - I've taken time to think this one over and read the reviews here. Opinion seems divided between love and hate. I'd say the haters have jumped the gun.<br/><br/>Nowadays, after decades of sci-fi mythery, everyone's a sage of the genre and oh-s-o-clever at second-guessing plot lines and themes.<br/><br/>Even a quick scan of the negative reviews will fill your weary eyes with stock-ready film student rhetoric. Well, have a chuckle at the trap they all fell into.<br/><br/>Right from the start this movie wears its heart on its sleeve, but such a duplicitous organ it is this time round, making no apology for its bombastic fanfare.<br/><br/>Christian parable, Scientology homage? Bullshit. For all the clever dicks out there who suspect subterfuge at spotting a Hubbard novel, there's another dozen who only saw the bible on Cage's bedside table (or wherever the hell it appeared; positioning is not the point).<br/><br/>Knowing's influences are varied, blatant and well contrived to provide two hours of solid entertainment in a blockbuster that requires its audience to think a little; of course every teenage 'knowing-all' (see what I did there, eagle-eyed students of the pun? lol) who's posted on here at 'getting it' within the first act has completely missed the point.<br/><br/>And the point was this: There IS nothing new this film can show you. There IS nothing new any sci-fi film can show you nowadays. You're all experts! What this film does, quite brilliantly in some parts - is take all those clichés, tweak them, mix them together and ask you to continually question if they DARE play it out towards the big apocalyptic premise that builds as Nic Cage unravels a 50 year old conundrum.<br/><br/>That's what I mean by far-reaching. I enjoyed the ride, impressed by the refusal to bend to Shaymalan twist or surprise denouement; this film grows and grows and eventually consumes its own audacity but it does so in a resplendent blockbuster manner that allows an intriguing premise to flourish without the need for paint-by-number building-brick exposition for the popcorn crunchers.<br/><br/>By the end I was sat grinning - not in mockery - at the ambition and execution.<br/><br/>It was, overall, an admirable job of clinging to the roller-coaster without being thrown to an unsatisfactory demise in the dark of the theatre.<br/><br/>I'm not going to even list any trivial complaints about certain late special effects being slightly ropey - they didn't influence the ending a jot. I won't even list praise for other spectacular effects which take the breath away. As a metaphor for the film they're perfect - a mix of ambitious vision and occasional shaky execution.<br/><br/>A solid 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>Refreshing and engaging attempt at growing the biggest of tales from the smallest of beginnings. Sure, we've all heard and seen bits and pieces of it before but as remixes go, this is a new beat I dug.<br/><br/>Go into it with an open mind, leave any lame cynicism at the door and bathe in its courageous enthusiasm to entertain on a big scale."

","I really admire the impressive body of work Mr Ebert built over the years. The quality of analysis and the knowledge gathered from relentless movie sessions. However, I'm starting to believe that his abilities to write reviews are starting to shift. I should be more accurate and say focus rather than abilities. Indeed, I think he is more preoccupied about metaphysical issues than movies. Therefore, maybe the reviews are based on how they echo with his concerns about death. Nevertheless, is it really a matter of concern? People going to his website are not going there to see how good the movie is, but what he thinks of it. It's fair, but it saddens me to see the whole body of work he so carefully and rigorously crafted being flooded by too much inconsistency. Though, it could also be seen as a last homage to Truffaut who constantly asked himself the question : ""Is life more important than work?"" Mr Ebert gives his answer. <br/><br/>What does that have to do with Knowing? Come on Mr Ebert... One of the best scifi movie you've seen? Really? But haven't you seen them all? Please, write an autobiography (suggestion: RogeBud)and keep providing us the sharpest and brightest reviews you almost always came up with. What? Am I judging him only on this review? No of course not, at the beginning of his career, he said Stallone was going to be the next Brando turned out he was the next Rambo. Waterfront under the bombed bridge, it didn't bother Mr. Ebert for his long career. I'm also referring to the movie he reviewed only after seeing 10 minutes... He did right doing it. Maybe he was trying to imagine how Godard feels like when he comes out of a theater after a couple of minutes? Whatever the reasons, it is a first time in his career. Then the top 10 list getting a top 20, why not? All of these seems to me like signs of bad auguries. Maybe it is time for us to accept that one day, the Roger won't be Wilco anymore."

","Knowing is Everything, says the publicity...<br/><br/>"" S**t Happens"" states John Koestler , the character played by Nicholas Cage in the film Knowing {Directed by Alex Proyas}...a bland statement of the obvious that sometimes is proclaimed as a Universal Truth...<br/><br/>Knowing too much can be very disturbing ( and as a warning, if you don't want to know too much about the film, avoid reading the last paragraphs of this posting... ) <br/><br/>This Latest of Apocalyptic scenarios,one of dozens to have graced or disgraced the screen , especially since the year 2000 ( and more so since the 2001 September 11th mini-apocalypse which did much to nourish our end-of-the-world fantasies ) ....may well disappoint the more exigent of jaded film goers, or fail to satisfy the intellectually hungry who have already read philosophical treatises and elaborated for themselves prophetically meaningful doomsday scenarios of great complexity ...<br/><br/>But , as with many Nicolas Cage films , no one was trying to fool the viewers with any false intellectualism or with pedantic over the top : the plot and script were simple, deceptively so. The age old conflict between determinist's and the proponents of absolute randomness is certainly not solved by this narrative , which , if it may fail to be Beautiful remains quietly powerful. Nor is the ""World of the Unknown"" unknown to Nicolas Cage , who amongst other things executive produced the very intriguing if moderately successful television Show ""The Dresden Files"" , and who starred in the archaeological mysteries National Treasure and National Treasure , Book of Secrets as well as other psycho and psychically inclined dramas such as Bringing out the Dead, (another Easter story from 1999).<br/><br/>The filming is stark and tense, and we are spared a happy ending . We are given nonetheless a message of ultimate hope, in a strange mix of pessimism and of optimistic triumphalism.<br/><br/>The horrible reality of death and it's inevitability , the sometimes inexplicable and ironic coincidences of life, the hints of precognition and the mathematical beauty of the universe are neatly served up in an entertaining thriller .<br/><br/>Much of life is random, at least it seems to be so... and we cling to whatever semblance of structure we can---for life, in essence is about maintaining structure where there ought to be chaos : it is about fighting entropy, the eternal principle of inertia that sucks the energy out of all systemic forms.<br/><br/>There were some very simple images in this film..The fine line between insanity and sanity, the whispering voices that haunt the children, hinting at another reality were pleasant brain-teasers.<br/><br/>I must say, that as a fan of Science Fiction I was very pleased by the wonderful representation of spacecraft that the filmmakers imagined--- and the visually satisfying maelstrom showed the extent to which CGI can now hyper-realize some of our worst imaginings..for none of us can imagine truly what being at ground zero of the equivalent of a 1000000 megaton explosion could be... but some of the scenes must certainly rank as amongst of the best approximations of what the experience might be like .<br/><br/>I liked that this film was simple. I liked the simplicity of the emotions that it evokes. If you need answers, avoid this film. If you want to be tortured by ambiguity and ambivalence because you enjoy existential angst , go see an Ingmar Bergman film at your local Repertory cinema, or if you want something absurd and inexplicable , rather than an overview of the Unexplained, choose a Fellini film and watch it while smoking pot.<br/><br/>If you want to dream a nightmare with and ending that is not too ghoulish, bitter sweet ,without being too overwhelmingly sad , this may actually be a film for you to see.<br/><br/>I guess this was definitely an Easter story, because it ends with bunny rabbits, symbols of eternal fertility of nature , and a tree which Is also an old symbol of resurrection and also identifiable as the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil. But it is a film that can be watched anytime, as it s not limited by strictly Christian symbolism.<br/><br/>A friend of mine at one of the local book selling nooks ( of which the logo is, guess what : a tree ,search Concordia Cop Bookstore on the web ) will tell anyone who will listen ( and also those who refuse to ) that there is no price to awareness.Well, I am not certain that awareness and Knowing,or Being ""In The Know"" , for that matter, are priceless. Certainly knowing something , (which implies direct experience ) is not necessarily the same as being aware (etymologically related to the Latin fearful, to the act of seeing in Greek , or of being careful in old English ) .<br/><br/>Being aware of the ever present possibility of an Apocalypse is not the same as knowing it is inevitable...There is a price to everything, and knowing too much could be costly to us. If we knew with certainty of the Apocalypse and of it's time, we would cease being motivated to live...most of us would simply, reduced to anomie , sit down , and cry.<br/><br/>or would we....???"

","John koestler and his son Caleb live alone, and when a time capsule is opened at his son's school with a load of random numbers written fifty years ago appears, it seems to be little more than a load of gobble-de-gook! However, after spotting a pattern within the numbers, John begins to investigate and finds a correlation between global disasters, their locations and death tolls and tries to prevent the next series of events.<br/><br/>On entering the cinema to watch this I had high hopes. Alex Proyas was responsible for the excellent ""Dark City"", and although the first half hour was hideously slow, once you witness these disasters (And believe me, you really feel like your witnessing these disasters) you are really drawn into the story, and as John sets out to prevent further disaster from looming the story picks up, the pace draws you in and you're really taken on for the ride. Personally I was loving it and really getting into it ...right up until the point were it ended, when the response ""What the hell"" sprung to mind.<br/><br/>The ending feels like a massive advert for Scientology and I almost expected to see the names John Travolta and Tom Cruise come up as executive producers. The ending of the film was such a let down as the children of earth, who know nothing of farming, agriculture or balanced diets are dumped on another world with little chance of supporting themselves, as the film progressively runs out of steam and comes crashing down with no way of redeeming itself, like the humanity in the film.<br/><br/>It's a shame really as about twenty minutes before the end, it was progressing quite nicely. Shame they seem to have gotten stuck for an ending when the writing strike was in full swing.<br/><br/>Nuff said."

Wow!! I still cant believe that they ruined the whole movie with that ending... and what is more most of the acting in the movie was bad, still I'll give a 5 to this movie as the first half of it and the reality in special effects were really good..."
"fredman5555","7","2","5","21 April 2009"," Like a Black Hole: It pulls you in, keeps you hanging, and then squashes you!
","The story starts out with a fantastic mystery. A young, albeit antisocial, girl seems to see and/or hear things her peers do not. Told to do a project for a time capsule, she begins writing down the numbers she hears in her head. Immediately we're drawn in wanting to know more about why she is obsessed with these numbers.<br/><br/>When we're forwarded to the modern day, Cage happens to come by the sheet of numbers and quickly figures out what they are. OK, this is probably a bit abrupt. He's a little ""too brilliant"" in that area; however, we're drawn further into the mystery because some of the numbers are as yet unexplained! The picture progresses nicely, and Cage's character meets an attractive young woman who also has a child about the age of Cage's boy thus adding the secondary story of love. Also a bit abrupt, it's adds an enjoyable element to the story so we can overlook the quickness of the romantic development.<br/><br/>Some further action, adventure, and suspense follows, and it's good enough to push you close to the edge of your seat as we make our way toward the end of the flick, but here's where they really dropped the ball.<br/><br/>Cage, good father that he is, coaxes his son to go ahead and leave with some nice aliens. ""It's OK,"" he says. ""They could have killed you before but didn't.""<br/><br/>Not only is this unsound logic (they could have killed you but didn't; therefore, they must be harmless), but no father in his right mind would ever send his son away into the unknown by having him beamed up into a never-seen-before crystalline orb piloted by creatures who felt it was in the boy's best interest to leave the father behind on Earth to die.<br/><br/>And it gets worse! At the end, we find these 12-something year old children paired up (male-female) and dropped off alone in the vicinity of their own individual snow white Tree of Life. How will they live? How many 12 year old kids do we know who are perfectly capable of fending for themselves???<br/><br/>It's an enjoyable story -- worth seeing. I give it 7/10 because the acting was good, I liked the mystery, it had a little love story too, but the ending was ludicrous as it could get.<br/><br/>My recommendation is it's not necessary to spend full theater prices. At least get a discount or wait for the video so you don't feel at all slighted."

","The first 3/4 of this movie was really good and creepy... then something just turned down the wrong path. It was like another director was finishing someone else's work. There was no more implying and letting the audience think... EVERYTHING had to be spelled out in agonizing detail.. So many scenes didn't even need to be shown (and shouldn't have). The characters fell apart and their behaviors unjustified.. It almost seemed like the actors even gave up. The audience just started laughing at it.<br/><br/>The art direction and effects were stunningly beautiful and composed very well. Visually the film is a nice treat... just lost something along the way."
"victor_66","7","2","5","12 April 2009"," A film of two parts
","I could have gave this film a better score but for the ending. It looks like it should have been on another film. This film in abundance had great effects, a great story and some good acting. With a blend of semi decent sci-fi and suspense its a good movie to watch and worth the admission money. Plenty of jumps and shocks but marred by the last 10 minutes but its still worth watching for the rest of the movie though. There's not many around at the minute but this is a decent Nicholas Cage film, unlike some of his more recent fares ie. National Treasure 2 and the Wicker Man. More importantly he seems to be getting to grips with his hair weave at last."

","I was very disappointed in this movie. I expected more action from this movie. There are 2 times only that the special effects are very good. The premise of the story was great, but it was carried out very badly, and the movie becomes a little slow and boring after a while. For some reason , I expected the movie to be a typical Nicholas Cage action movie like ""National Treasure"" - Fast and Interesting. This movie fails on both accounts. I liked the concept to start off with, but I feel it was not used wisely to develop the story. The story is supposed to be a man who knows what disasters are going to happen. Unfortunately, he actually intentionally manages to go to only one such disaster .. yes. only one !!! My advice to you is to avoid this one... you won't miss much ... knowing this, you will save a few bucks !"
"JoeyGreen","9","2","5","5 April 2009"," Mankind gets what it deserves
","A lot of people like this flick but complained about the ending. I don't know why. Man gets fried in the end, just like predicted. First the flood, then the fire.<br/><br/>Eschatalogy -- the study of the end times -- is a fascinating topic, and here the imagination must rule, not the intellect. Those of you who try to rationalize or everything will find Knowing wanting, but for me it was interesting speculation. If the world does end in fire, then what is man's destiny? Are some saved, none, or all? It's a mystery but one that any thinking person wonders about from time to time.<br/><br/>If you think we're all just worm food and there is nothing beyond the material world, then Knowing will not resonate a bit. However, if you have a spiritual side, and we all do whether we acknowledge or not, then you have to delve into the mysteries that, though unsolvable, are nonetheless there for our introspection and conjecture.<br/><br/>On some levels, Knowing may fall short, such as the less-than-stellar acting, although Nick Gage does a fair job, and the occasionally trite script. But the overall impression is to leave one thinking about the fate of mankind. I, for one, found comfort in the notion that only the innocent deserve a second chance at renewal. The rest of us should go directly into the flames where we belong, perhaps some to rise from the ashes, thanks only to the mercy of God, or Whoever is Calling The Cosmic Shots.<br/><br/>One quibble: Beethoven's 7th was perfectly matched to the scenes in which it is used; his 6th symphony (The Pastoral) should have been used at the end when we see the children in Paradise.<br/><br/>Go see this movie with an open mind and an open heart."
"triplestrikekid","5","2","5","5 April 2009"," Really????
","When you watch Knowing, you will probably find the first two-thirds tolerable, even entertaining. It is an interesting concept, that will occasionally send shivers down your spine. Alex Proyas shows that when he wants to, he can direct quite well.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it goes downhill from there. <br/><br/>Nicholas Cage gives a quite painful acting performance at the end of the film, and it becomes extremely predictable. I'm not sure the screenwriters knew quite how to close this movie, so they just slapped on an ending that had been used a million times before. By the end, you'll be asking yourself: really????"

Even if it is one that has been made quite a few times. Man finds out about events that are going to happen in the future and tries to stop them with some level of success or failure. Lots of special effects and action if nothing else.<br/><br/>The end of this movie could also be part of a good or even great movie. The end of the world is near and aliens come to save some of the children. Man discovers this and tries to ""save"" the children from the aliens until he discovers that the aliens are the good guys.<br/><br/>The problem is that that these three different scenarios were all crammed into the same single movie.<br/><br/>In the end this movie is reduced to 3 important scenes: 1) aliens kidnap the children 2) land them on a new planet and 3) the earth is destroyed but mankind lives on.<br/><br/>On a aside this movie seemed to be anti-green. Nick Cage lives in a huge house and drives a huge truck. Even the aliens drive a gas guzzler. There is also a fatalistic feeling to the movie. As in ""yes global warming might destroy mankind, but can we do anything to stop it, and maybe even aliens will come and save us"". At least looking at the movie in this light gives it a motive to be so bad, but likely there were just too many cooks and the large cars where just what the car companies where flogging at the time, and the house was big so it would be scarier."
"DICK STEEL","8","2","5","5 April 2009"," A Nutshell Review: Knowing
","It's been quite a while since Alex Proyas was at the helm of a film, the last being I, Robot back in 2004 where he adapted Isaac Asimov's science fiction classic of the same name. He continues to dwell in the sci-fi realm again with Knowing, with leading man Nicolas Cage plucked from his National Treasure roots because his character here, MIT professor John Koestler, follows in the tradition of running around everywhere in search for answers and the truth.<br/><br/>A widower, John's world consists of his estranged parents, sister Grace (Nadia Townsend) who pops by his home every now and then to check up on him, and his son Caoeb (Chandler Canterbury), and if this was a film other than sci-fi, you would've suspected that there's some incestuous relationship between John and Grace being suggested at, which I thought Proyas had failed in toning the downright awkward looks they are passing at each other.<br/><br/>But what Proyas succeeded, was the crafting of great atmosphere in keeping you guessing along with the characters, building up tension when necessary, but being succinctly to the point without dragging it out when it served no more purpose. It starts in the 50s where a time capsule is being assembled and the students are tasked to draw a picture each of what they perceive as the future. A girl who has been acting strangely had listed down a whole page of seemingly random numbers, which her teacher abruptly took from her to be sealed into the capsule.<br/><br/>Fast forward to today, and it's preordained that Caleb would be the recipient of that strange sheet of numbers, which he brings home and John begins to decipher it while high on alcohol, only to discover that there's a pattern to those randomness, and so begins the quest in search for the truth, hunting down that little girl's offspring Diana (Rose Byrne) in between running from a handful of beings who seem to only want to communicate with children.<br/><br/>There's this very strong theme running through the movie about randomness versus decisiveness, with one camp believing that everything's an independent development from one another, rather than a sequence already determined and laid out. It's like destiny, whether one has the option and choice to change it, or just perceived to have the ability to do so without any to begin with. When the numbers finally revealed themselves to mean something, could anything be done to prevent some of them from happening, leading to the ultimate event that seemed like a page out of the Book of Revelations. It too served as a cautionary environmental warning, though only fleetingly, in telling us how important the ozone layer is to our world, without which we would find ourselves in some really deep trouble.<br/><br/>I suppose Proyas continues to be bitten by the special effects bug, given some groundbreaking CGI some many years back, which continue to be dabbled in and employed for this film, accentuating three key action sequences that would make any disaster movie feel envious. I've always been in awe at Final Destination's airplane disaster and that from Kairo/Pulse, but the catastrophe here upped the ante for the next film to follow suit, given a perfect continuous single take that deserves a second viewing. And the disasters shown here, no doubt only possible through CGI, puts one in the driver's seat and gives you a first person's perspective in how one would bear witness to such events, should one be there and then at the site. Nothing less than jawbreaking, I tell you, as it doesn't flinch from its intended violence, nor gratuitously glorifying such moment.<br/><br/>It's been a while since we've seen a thinking man version of an action flick such as Deep Impact, and Knowing firmly rests with that film in being one amongst those that socks it right into your emotional core. Science fiction fans may be apprehensive after Hollywood's last big budgeted flick with The Day The Earth Stood Still, but Knowing comes definitely recommended and surpasses the former in almost every aspect."

It strucked me and it molded me to become a better person and put a meaning to my existence.<br/><br/>Majority of us today have no time seeing these films, but believe me, it is worth watching.

We still have a role to do, we must not end it on conclusions, but to our maximum effort on changing this world.<br/><br/>Because of this movie, i am enlightened to become a better steward for this world, whether we will suffer the same fate from the movie, or whether we can change the worlds fate.<br/><br/>""Our existence has a purpose, everyone is called, but few answer.

","Alex Proyas could turn out to be one of the most important big budget movie directors of coming years. He's demonstrated this successfully here by crafting an everyman-saves- everyone yar on a meagre budget, which performs well above the norm. The consensus view is that he has achieved this by avoiding big studio tinkering. This results in dynamic twists and turns that confound expectations – whilst still being a disposable dumb as nuts blockbuster flik - for those looking for big screen adventure. For most of the film Nic Cage seems a bit clueless as to what's going on – but fear not as this works a treat - as his character is also over taken by events he is powerless to control – so is Nic's acting, which fits well with his characters plight. The plot outline is nothing new, being a classic B-movie formula of mundane events that lead to major catastrophe – but Alex Proyas finds unique ways of telling and resolving the story and, without studio interference, introduces vivid flights of fancy that I for one did not see coming. I'm off to buy Dark City Director Cut on DVD."

I didn't follow what the aliens were trying to achieve with that apart from being prophets of doom. I can accept that aliens or angels may not think the same way we do, but in the end they could have (and did) just show up at the end and rescue their chosen few. The cryptic warning didn't help anyone.<br/><br/>Perhaps the message was, as the science lecture suggested, that everything is predetermined and our actions don't really matter. In that sense it is a Simpsons ending: Lisa: Perhaps there is no moral to this story. Homer: Exactly! It's just a bunch of stuff that happened."

","(This film is difficult to write about with out going into details, and this is the best I could do) Dark film from Alex Proyas about what happens when a time capsule is opened and its found that a sheet of numbers contained inside it seems to correspond to great disasters. As the story unfolds there are three sets of numbers left in the series which begins to worry single dad Nick Cage, an astrophysicist who seems to think that all of life is random and that ""stuff happens"".( I'm not going to really say more since the less you know about the film the better I think its going to play)<br/><br/>Much reviled (critics) and much loved (movie going public) film is an eerie debate about whether all life is a random occurrence or whether there is a dark order in the machine. I loved the first three quarters of this film which is structured as a dark decent into something potentially horrible. The film doesn't tell you a great deal, indeed we only know as much as Nick Cage does so our minds, like that of out hero, is allowed to wander and draw our own conclusions (indeed even when the film ends we still down know a great deal so the film is going to end up endlessly debated). I think the film works , even with the occasional over acting by cage because the notions of the film that there may be something to the numbers is so well handled that you can't help but feel the tension ,it also helps that the two central set pieces of a plane crash and subway accident are profoundly disturbing in their execution. (Trust me they may look one way in the commercials, but seeing them in the context of the film is truly frightening.)<br/><br/>I don't love the movie as a whole, but there is a point about 90 minutes in when the film hits a bump as it has to angle towards the ending and has to clear up, at least some (but far from all) of the mysteries. Its not that I mind the ending or what happens, its just that there is this sudden turn in direction- a direction that sends us to the end when the dues ex machine is fired up and brought into play and the film is fired through it. What was a well oiled and well plotted film is suddenly rushed and hurried. I was watching things with a ""What is all of this about""? or ""Where did this come from"" attitude.It knocks the film down from a great film to a merely very good one in my eyes.<br/><br/>I like the movie a great deal. I like that the film doesn't supply all of the answers, or even most of the answers. I want to say more, but I completely understand why Roger Ebert reviewed the film and then went back and discussed the film in two further posts where he went into details.<br/><br/>My advice is give the film a shot."

Now when I see his name on a new film I get that feeling like when granpa's about to do that thing that keeps getting him arrested.<br/><br/>The film wasn't so bad. It ticked all the boxes for a Holloywood blockbuster: big name, religion, Mr. Scientists, end of the world, aliens, prophets, bunny rabbits. Hold on. Bunnies? Yup. Nick Cage's seat on the ship to the new world was usurped by a little, fluffy bunny-wunny.<br/><br/>The characters were slightly interesting but the story was more prominent and couldn't hold water in the end. Cage's bereft, whiskey drinking, single father performance should have been predicted by those precious numbers he seemed so bemused by. And the love interest's early demise was a relief. ""Somebody think of the children!""

I knew nothing about it prior to the movie, having only seen the TV spots.<br/><br/>I loved it.<br/><br/>I loved the premise: it's engaging and hooks your curiosity. This would be a difficult movie to walk out of - you have to have your curiosity satiated about how on earth it'll be wrapped up.<br/><br/>I loved the special effects. I have read people commenting about the CGI in this movie, saying ""it sucked"". They're wrong. Did they see the same movie I saw? The disaster scenes are - quite literally -- breathtaking. They leave you gasping. The plane scene (which appears on the TV spots) arrives with no build up, and is shockingly realised in a single ninety second take which shocks and horrifies. The subway scene makes you wince. It's a long time since I have heard an audience shriek.<br/><br/>I loved the ending. I have heard people suggest that the film should have ended a few minutes earlier and leave the inevitable apocalyptic conclusion to the viewer's imagination. Forget that! For a popcorn film like this, that is movie snobbery rubbish - I didn't want to imagine it. I wanted to see it. I wanted to see whether or not the director would be fearful of avoiding showing what he hinted was coming, and he delivers some meat - with an ending that is not wholly happy.<br/><br/>That said, the plot does not survive detailed analysis. So don't bother, just treat it for what it is, a theme-park ride with a story that does manage to maintain your interest until the end.<br/><br/>The acting is workmanlike and effective, albeit uninspiring. Cage is in glum and mumbling mode for a lot of the film, yet this does suit the nature of the character he's portraying, and his supporting actors (including the children) are sufficiently convincing such that, unless you are expecting Citizen Kane, you won't find your eyes rolling.<br/><br/>It seems to me that many of the negative reviews question the validity and purpose of the quasi-religious message the film (it could be argued) offers as denouement. I didn't get that feeling - I just saw a bit of sci-fi fun, which did not need to be dissected in great detail and certainly didn't offend my non-religious sensibilities.<br/><br/>Settle down with the popcorn, put your brain in ""entertain but don't tax me"" mode, and enjoy the charging rush."
"AgentMovieGoer","6","2","5","27 March 2009"," Bravo! Another Failiure for Nic Cage
","By god, where should I start. I saw this movie today and I was so excited about it too. Tell you the truth, I kinda was a fan of Nic until recently. None of roles tend to impress as much anymore. Maybe because of the characters he plays for his age? Anyhow, I must confess that the beginning of this movie rocked and the ending did not make sense what so ever nor did it attracted any of the audience. <br/><br/>If you really must watch this, watch it if you got some time to spare. If you are a busy person like me, then you should stick with a movie like, should I suggest, Watchmen. <br/><br/>The story starts in an elementary school where, a little girl wins a competition for the best idea as what they should do in 50 years. She suggests that, all the kids should draw something and place them in a time capsule so that the kids 50 years from the given time could see and feel what these kids were like. The teacher gives them a time limit and one of the girls just write some numbers but unfortunately she was not able to finish it in time. The teacher complains at her saying that the numbers were not drawing and it was her idea in the first place and forcibly takes her paper away from her.<br/><br/>The same day, she happens to gone missing and when the elementary teach finally finds her in the basement cupboard, her fingers were all bloody due to the fact that she had to finish the numbers of the sequence. Then 50 years later, Cage's son happen to pick the girls envelope and he brings it home thinking that, these numbers mean something. Sure they did, all the natural disasters for the next 50 years were written on that paper and apparently the end of the world as well. <br/><br/>Ending was unfortunately pretty dull compare to War of the Worlds since the world actually does end and Cage and the rest of the people die but the children. Oh no I forgot to mention that, the aliens the ones that whisper these numbers to the kids and thus, they save our kids for the sake of a fresh start once the world gets destroyed. <br/><br/>The movie starts like Final Destination (The first one) then it ends like Artificial Intelligence. I was hoping the movie to be more like the Independence day or Final destination or deja vu but overall it was pretty lame. Just watch it at your own risk as this movie is very predictable. Maybe I'm being unfair but hey, it just me."

","The story was tight, the characters were real, and the movie was highly enjoyable until the recently familiar ending of 'aliens' becoming the answer. Similar to the recent Indiana Jones movie, aliens are now the God of our existence - how depressing. God is three in one, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. It may sound wacky but Satan makes alternatives, like aliens as our creators, sound so smooth and attractive. Guard your hearts, America, against the real agendas these plots possess. There were so many opportunities for the movie to take on a direction alternatively than the one it took. Like I said, the acting was superb, the script was tight, and the special effects were far and away better than any other doom-day sequences ever made. Just remember the real Truths."
"John K.-2","5","2","5","27 March 2009"," A clichéd horror film redeemed by some good special effects
","I went to see this film because it was tagged as 'sci-fi'. In fact, it plays out more like a horror film -- and a pretty clichéd one at that. If I asked you to guess which part of the USA it takes place in, what the weather is like near ground level, what time of day most of the action takes place, and the age of the character at the centre of the strange goings-on, you wouldn't find the answers hard.<br/><br/>The ending is far-fetched and features some major plot holes too, which I'll submit to the Trivia section. It's pretty, though.<br/><br/>The film is saved from mediocrity by some decent acting, and especially by the special effect sequences.<br/><br/>You might enjoy it if you liked ""Millennium"", a rather old B-movie with Kris Kristofferson and Cheryl Ladd."

","Physicist Nicolas Cage's son brings home a page covered in numbers from his school's time capsule 50 years earlier. Cage works out that the numbers give details of dates, locations and numbers of dead for disasters over the last 50 years ie. they are predictions. And there are three left which haven't happened yet....<br/><br/>That is pretty much what you get from the trailer, and I wouldn't want to say too much more, because what follows is not entirely what I expected. What I will see is that the movie always keeps your interest up, that there are some developments which aren't entirely what you might expect, and that the conclusion is satisfying.<br/><br/>There are some interesting metaphysical and philosophical issues raised early on, but never fully addressed.<br/><br/>There are some unanswered questions (what is the point of the black stones? Does the son's partial deafness have any significance beyond being a justification for the sign language near the end?), but any minor irritation caused by them is more than made up for by the plane crash at about the halfway mark. This isn't a surprise if you've seen the trailers, but it is stunningly well done - completely convincing and absolutely terrifying.<br/><br/>This is a well-made, entertaining and engaging film, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."

It's different then most I've seen and the previews don't give too much away honestly, cause the movie had so much more in it, or had to do with much more then I even thought at first. So it's nice to walk into a movie and still be surprised by the happenings in it.<br/><br/>Ending was great, or fine. I had no issue with it, it ties up the questions you possibly are left with. I rather know more then be left with questions. There was nothing wrong with the ending.<br/><br/>All the special effects within the movie aren't bad there are some amazing scenes, i've never seen a movie that had such heart pounding scenes like that, its not in there for the heck of it, everything that was displayed in the movie was relevant and it couldn't have been done any better in my opinion. The movie seemed very well thought out.<br/><br/>I heard some good things on it before I seen it, and I was blown away when I seen it simply cause there was so much more to everything.<br/><br/>I see people complaining about the Christianity in it, cause they think its all propaganda when its not, it's just how the story works. If you have a problem with being surprised on what religions are demonstrated in movies then bring it up to mpaa or something cause wow let's not let others beliefs ruin our day. Calm down and accept the world you live in. Be a little more open minded. Otherwise your probably just a boring person in general.<br/><br/>Movie was good and fine, good plot, it all moves at a good pace and it has a lot of good action in it, and it concludes with really what matters. it didn't confuse or trouble me at all, i understood the references the movie made and all that stuff alike, it was very excellent.<br/><br/>Warning if you seriously have issues with references to religion(s) in movies don't watch this, the previews don't make this clear. It has Christian references. If You are okay with the idea, then good. You won't be wasting your money, and thanks for knowing what it means to live in America or in this world for that matter."

","Knowing is a lot like being surprised on Christmas morning, you think you know what your going to get until you open up that one beautiful gift. I would have to say that is exactly what Knowing was for me and will be for a lot of people. It is one of those films that will leave you guessing from beginning to end. The way the movie begins will leave you with many assumptions on how this movie will turn out, but you will be speechless on all of the events that occur because none of them have any hints or foreshadowed scenes throughout the film. The symbolism in the film is awe inspiring and brilliant and could probably have a separate debate on the hidden meanings behind some of the symbolic scenes. This is a must see for all fans of science fiction, or just fans of great writing. Warning when going to see this film remember to bring some sort of rope to tie your jaw to your head so you don't loose it because this is a 100% jaw dropping feature film."
"socrates99","9","3","10","21 March 2009"," Even from the point of view of its craftsmanship, this is excellent work
","It's been hyped as a philosophical joyride, but I didn't find it much more than a wonderfully filmed and acted drama about the mounting dread caused by increasing fear for the world's survival. It builds so convincingly that you will be on the edge of your seat for its second half as if it were happening to you. And on top of this there are at least two over-the-top CGI sequences that are completely awe inspiring. In the trailer there's a train wreck being used to entice audiences, but that is not one of the two I refer to. The two I refer to are a complete joy to watch and if I were a filmmaker I would immediately find out who was in charge of them and I would try to hire that person away before he's put to work non-stop for the next ten years. Probably the second thing I'd like to do is contract the director for my next film. Long sequences are done with such care and skill that I was completely mesmerized. That's saying a lot as I've watched good films for about fifty years. Excellent work by all the stars as well. I really don't think Cage has ever worked with anyone as talented as Proyas. I'll bet he's anxious to join up with him again."

Also following Noah's flood, God says that the next time the earth is destroyed, it will be by fire.<br/><br/>I can't help but compare the final scene of ""Knowing"" with the ending of ""Battlestar Galactica"". The survivors are left to start over on an Eden-like planet (though on Galactica it is an early earth). They retain none of their technology but are starting over from zero.

","It's not a movie, it is true story, Amazingly summarized what all religions on earth want .. The main idea was at the end of the movie, when the man in black told the kids "" only those who heard the call can come"", That's so obvious! The ""Call"" > God's words, prayers to God, believing in God the one and the only, doing good things.. being human... That's the call in every single religion; which are all coming from one source , God. The second idea the movie wanted to show is that you can't change or alter destiny because it is written already, the movie incredibly showed that by the time capsule which was hidden for 50 years under the ground.... The third one was the greatest scene when Nicolas cage saw the sky opens and the ship or whatever that was landed, to get those who heard the CALL, for Gods heaven, and he falls on his knees, filled with sorrow and fear, knowing that he was screwed by not believing in God and Armageddon day ""Al Qyama"", and for the first time he begs the angel please take me with you, after he always attacked them, and bought a gun not to defend himself... no, but to defend his ignorance.....ONLY those who don't believe in God would hate this movie, Those who say it's inappropriate for kids because of the drinking scenes, need to reconsider.. you can deliver that idea> he didn't go with the kids to heaven because he did that sin, he drink ed alcohol , ignoring that Simpson's family got sex scenes and words everywhere.

"dimitri_alexandr","1","2","6","17 March 2012"," From a (formerly) religious perspective
","When 'Knowing' came out in 2009, I was a freshman in high school whose views on science and religion were pretty complicated. I had a profound interest in biology and astronomy when I was younger, but over the years the interest dwindled and paranoid fears about the metaphysical and supernatural set in. Around the time I saw 'Knowing', I was becoming slightly more rational. Science was becoming more interesting to me again, but I still kept a firm grip on superstition and the concept of God, in retrospect, as a means of comfort. Then I watched 'Knowing'.<br/><br/>Upon first viewing, I have to say a lot of the imagery and going-ons on the screen were, for me, emotionally overwhelming. The images of disasters on a massive scale; the idea of a predicted Doomsday approaching on target; and, above all, the sounds of people screaming in horror and clutching each other as Armageddon came; were far too much for me to handle. I actually remember tearing up towards the film's conclusion.<br/><br/>But then the film actually concluded. The aliens (angels?) ascending from space (the Heavens?) and saving the two children who heard them coming (the Rapture?!), and that final image of the two children running across a Dali-like landscape towards what appears to be the Tree of Knowledge from the Book of Genesis.<br/><br/>Once the film was over, I felt depressed and crushed from the cataclysmic events (I thought were) vividly depicted on screen, somewhat paranoid about the concept of these events being ""destined"" to occur, and rather cheated by the film's final scene. On the whole, I left the theater feeling very strange.<br/><br/>I hadn't watched the film in three years, and in that time span, my views on science and religion changed astronomically (pun intended). I now hold secular beliefs and find science more fascinating than I did years ago. I remembered almost nothing of 'Knowing', except for how I felt upon leaving the theater. I mustered the bravery to watch it again on TV.<br/><br/>I can safely sum up this film with the statement that it probably converted more innocent young minds to Christianity in two hours than Saint Paul did in 30 years.<br/><br/>I'm not going to take time to criticize the acting and special effects of this film; you'll find they were rightfully torn to shreds in other reviews on this website. Instead I'm going to talk about the message that is practically being propagated by this film, which is a pro-superstitious/pseudo-scientific one.<br/><br/>In doing a proper review of this film, I should also mention another film, (or rather, series of films) that focuses on a similar subject matter and presents this subject matter in a similar way: the 'Final Destination' series.<br/><br/>Both films are built on an intimidating and ultimately depressing premise: human beings having absolutely no control over their lives. The control is instead vested in the hands of malevolent, metaphysical forces; the sole purpose of the human being is to be held at the mercy of these forces from the moment of his/her conception to the day of his/her death. Human beings have no knowledge of this terrifying control that is held over them, except for one person who acquires such knowledge (either by the number/date sheet in 'Knowing' or the signs and premonitions in the 'Final Destination' series), and with this knowledge, tries to warn the public of the coming danger, and manages to save some lives before the catastrophe strikes. However, the forces continue to torment (as well as undermine) the protagonist, hurling at him/her more misfortunes from wide-scale disasters to little freak-accidents. The protagonist continues to fight the forces, but simultaneously laments that no matter what he/she does, these forces will always come back, wielding their fury ten-fold. This continues for about another 90 minutes or so, until finally, the forces either destroy the protagonist or reduce him/her to an emotionally/mentally-evacuated mess.<br/><br/>There is, however, one stark difference between these films. The 'Final Destination' series is targeted mainly towards a teen audience. Since its beginning in 2000, it has clearly devolved from entertaining, late 90s-esque horror to all-out, blood-guts-n'-tits horror-comedy. It's clear the films no longer take themselves as seriously as the first one did in 2000, and probably not even the filmmakers/producers releasing them do either.<br/><br/>'Knowing', on the other hand, takes the aforementioned message far too seriously, and hammers it hard on the viewer. It does so with its elaborate (though I will admit now, somewhat mediocre) special effects, stark imagery, convoluted (though I must admit now, ridiculous) plot, and, to top it off, a profoundly terrifying, Penderecki-esque soundtrack by Marco Beltrami (still scary years later, and probably the only aspect of 'Knowing' worth praising). I wasn't the only one who left that theater in 2009 teary-eyed or feeling/looking extremely depressed. Interestingly though, a good number of those who did were within my age-group (I was 14 at the time).<br/><br/>There is nothing even remotely scientific about this film, save the few brief scenes of Nicolas Cage teaching as an astrophysicist at MIT. It's superstitious propaganda from beginning to end, takes itself far too seriously, and if taken seriously by the viewer, comes off as extremely bleak.<br/><br/>If you want to see some really good films about man and his physical/emotional relations with Nature and space, you'd be better off watching films like Kubrick's '2001', Tarkovsky's 'Solaris', even Zemeckis' 'Contact'. If you still want to see this film in spite of everything I've just said...even then, you'd be better off watching a 'Final Destination' film. There at least you can find yourself some good 'turn-off-the-brain-and-enjoy' entertainment."

","Watched this on TV the other night with anticipation & I wasn't disappointed - well, for the first hour or so anyway!!! I loved the start - very strong, full of enigma & filling me with intrigue about what would happen next. I watched the opening scenes with relish assuming that I would get a half-decent explanation of why Lucinda could hear the voices & was chosen to transmit the number sequence that predicted forthcoming major disasters (didn't predict this movie though!!!).<br/><br/>It all seemed to go horribly wrong when they shifted forward 50 years where the numbers are unearthed at a school ceremony.<br/><br/>Firstly, I seemed a bit bemused by Calem's hearing problems - he can hear but things get mixed up - so what the heck was the point of the hearing aid then if he could actually hear?! Secondly, when Nic Cage starts to look at the numbers - a very long string of unbroken numbers yet it only seemed to take him seconds to spot the 9/11 reference. I found it very hard to believe that he worked out what the numbers referred to so very easily?! I realise his character is hardly Captain Stupid but c'mon, really?! Also, for someone who seemed to be highly sceptical of such phenomena Nic Cage got swept along with it all a little too easily & quickly.<br/><br/>Rose Byrne (who played Diana) seemed to be good to start with but she really grated on my nerves when the hysteria kicked in - way too much screeching - surely it would've been much more chilling if she'd have kept things a little more hidden. I felt absolutely nothing but sheer relief when she didn't make it!<br/><br/>Then all of a sudden the aliens/angels make an appearance seemingly out of the blue - no real explanation is given as to who they are, why they have chosen those two particular children to carry on humanity elsewhere or why Lucinda was originally chosen 50 years prior.<br/><br/>The special FX used in the film were pretty shoddy given the spectacular effects that they could've used. Apparently the film was completed in only 3 months & it shows, a lot!!! Very disappointing ending - Nic Cage seemed to be very unaffected (apart from the few howls of unconvincing emotional pain he gives) by the fact that his only son is about to be transported to God knows where!!! His son also seems to just give into the idea far too quickly as well.<br/><br/>This film could've had so much going for it - plenty of room for originality & imagination but it just seemed to get more far-fetched as the minutes rolled by."

","After a promising start, the movie turns into cheap religious indoctrination very quickly. Cage's not a good actor, everyone knows it, but here his attempts are exasperating. He looks ghastly. The kid actor playing his son is Laurence Olivier in comparison, in looks and acting abilities.<br/><br/>The methods used by the producers to scare you into believing that we humans aren't just a series of biological accidents (which any reasonably intelligent 15 yo. can prove) are the same ones used by religious leaders to recruit weak-minded cultists throughout the centuries: either you believe there's a creator you must fear, or you'll end up in horrible plane crashes, or burned alive, or perish in dreadful explosions, subway derailing, left behind in the final spectacular rapture, etc. Cage's a non-believer and for that he lost his beloved wife in a fire, became an alcoholic, his pastor father (what else) doesn't speak to him and his son's taken away. Only at the end, when it's too late of course, he becomes a believer. So there's the message, folks, don't let all that happen to you, become a believer NOW before it's too late! The ending is ludicrous, racist and corny (in a cornfield, where else?). Two white kids are seen as one of the 'chosen ones', plus two white (again) bunnies. It makes one's stomach turn.<br/><br/>The final visuals are in good taste but the crashes and derailing are fake with that artificial, bogus look that only the digital age can offer us, what happened to REAL special effects, the ones that we can SEE? Beltrami's score is great until he tries to rip off Herrmann's Psycho flight theme. Scientifically, the entire sun premise has absolutely no merit.

"breszfr","2","2","6","2 August 2009"," This movie was horrific
","Warning this contains spoilers - if you want to watch this movie do not read any further - just know that it is stupid and you will be disappointed. <br/><br/># The movie starts out interestingly enough. We see some kids working in their school room and a teacher talking about a time capsule. Makes sense - the trailer talks about knowing about impending disasters and what would you do. There were several places where it seemed like there were opportunities to do so much more with the movie and the mysterious number sequences he uncovers, however the movie seems to miss every opportunity at suspense and settle for cheap every chance they can. Here's a few details:<br/><br/># Cage plays an MIT astro-physicist although he never lives up to this potential. Throughout the movie he does a surprising amount of stupid things. # Random stupidity - the kids sing ""This little light of mine!"" a children's Christian gospel song - being sung at a public school in Massachusetts - the most liberal state in the union and nobody was there from the ACLU taking exception # There is a plane crash that happens just after he makes an interesting discovery regarding the number sequence, and he attempts in vain to save several burning passengers. Eventually the first responders tell him to go away - which he does with little discussion or drama. # We spend untold minutes of screen time wandering around in the dark with diver quality flashlights ala X-files. # Cage's kid has some wild dream that, as near as I could tell, was a test of the special effects crew's capabilities but little else. # At one point he makes a call to the FBI to warn them of what will happen instead of stating: ""I am an MIT professor, please listen to me when I tell you something"" which could have led to all manner of intrigue and discussion regarding the number sequences, what had happened, what will happen, etc. instead, he yells into a random pay-phone ""something will happen at location X tomorrow - get everyone away or they will die"" which would clearly put him on the terrorist watch list. # Later in the sequence he walks up to a random cop and asks why they haven't cleared the area - surprise all law enforcement starts chasing him # When chasing and being chased in the subway he is cornered by several cops, he states rather bluntly: ""you should arrest him"" and points to the person he is chasing, they instantly unfocus on Cage and focus on the other guy. # He frequently abandons the children in his charge to go investigate random things. # The end of the movie was off scale high on the stupid meter. With about 20 minutes left in the movie and no realistic ending, we throw in a random car chase where a woman essentially kidnaps his son and in the middle of the chase Cage pauses in his pursuit of his CHILD to spend a few minutes with the now dead woman he has known for 36 hours, this enables him to see an intriguing black rock # Finally, we go completely implausible with an ending involving aliens rescuing mere earthlings from impending disaster and over the top stupid dialog between Cage and his son. # We also have a token reference to Noah - 2x2 animals and some (I think) reference to ""The Matrix"" with two white rabbits. # Finally, while the entire movie is set in and around Boston, when disaster strikes big time - New York City is what we see - hello continuity department where are you? Poor New York City- always the place to destroy - Independence Day, Armageddon, Sudden Impact, The Day After Tomorrow, I'm sure there many others. I'm sure there are more specific stupid things - but that's all I can think of right now."

But what were they thinking? The last 30 minutes were not worthy of the rest of the movie. It's like they just wanted to make a movie with some awesome action scenes so they had to shoehorn a bunch of plot about time capsules and predicting disasters/the future that have absolutely nothing to do with where this movie is eventually going.<br/><br/>Every single idea in this movie, whether about the end of the world or the loss of a parent/beloved spouse or even seeing the future, have been done before, and done much better. Toward the end, I found myself thinking a lot about Signs, which has some similar themes about faith and loss, etc, and it even has similar looking aliens.<br/><br/>I would love someone to take the first half of this movie and give it the denouement that it deserves.

","SPOILER<br/><br/>People got different taste, but if you are one of those who always loved movies where the world gets into an end, where the last part of the movie are completely made up on a computer with mind-blowing special effects, this is the movie you might have been waiting for.<br/><br/>I rated this movie 10, 2 minutes after watching, this due the reason my body generated a lot of adrenaline in the ending (also during the mid-part of movie) i was totally exited and satisfied.<br/><br/>U can tell if a movie is good, when u generate so much adrenaline that u almost lose your breath. Its the same on how u like music, when a good part comes, and u get fully pumped.<br/><br/>---------The Movie---------<br/><br/>In the start, i taught this was some kind of drama movie where Nicolas got a girlfriend and had a family and they was doing some random science research together.<br/><br/>But i was wrong, this movie actually points one way, The end of the world! Still, all ppl that watch the movie still claims about the numbers.<br/><br/>Thos numbers, for you who haven't seen the movie, was found on an old piece of paper, written down by a young schoolgirl, 50 years back in time. That piece of paper was in an envelope together with other envelopes from the rest of that school class back in 50's. On the papers the kids have painted what they taught the future would be like 50 years ahead from the 50's which in the movie are 2009.<br/><br/>But that only paper, from this girl, only contained letters, and Nicolas by some reason got hes hands on this.<br/><br/>It seems like the girl who wrote it could predict the future with the proper date and coordinates. <br/><br/>Nicolas hooked up every date and found everything to be exactly right.<br/><br/>----------The movie (when the movie gets a lil twist)-------<br/><br/>There still some dates left on the paper, and those happened to be just a few days away from the day Nicolas got this piece of paper. So he wanted to see if things were properly 100%, so he managed to show up at the exact locations and got himself some huge surprises.<br/><br/>This is where the movie starts getting really exiting, where the special effects comes in and make spectacular scenes.<br/><br/>But there's this ONE date, and the last date on that paper. Some research at a lab, Nicolas found that there was a solar explosion which was huge enough to burn the earth, and it was coming SOON.<br/><br/>--------------The movie (the end)-------------<br/><br/>Judgement day was coming, earth got heated up, people were obsessed. Nicolas first wanted to hide in a cave, but realized that the radioactive waves from the explosion would kill everyone still.<br/><br/>But he found this one coordinate, which was not written on that piece of paper, but still from the girl (which is dead), he prob taught that spot was the spot to save him/them or whoever, <br/><br/>but this is where the movie gets totally twisted, where someone from another planted comes, a spaceship comes, the solar explosion almost reached its 100%.<br/><br/>what happens after this, i wont tell. This will spoil the most important part of the movie.<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>But keep in mind, movies where someone from another planet, which the confused and scared people often refers as ''aliens'' comes, doesn't have to be a bad movie.<br/><br/>Because we haven't seen any, doesn't means a movie gets bad if they accidentally comes up in a movie, where u never taught they would.<br/><br/>This could have happened to you, today, in 1 year, or in 1 generation, or in 1 million year.<br/><br/>But this is what makes the movie unique.<br/><br/>I managed to give the movie a 10 out of 10 because its a long time ago i felt so satisfied after watching a movie.<br/><br/>The special effects were awesome, it made you feel like it was Almost real. Special effects will never become real, if they become real, then they are preformed IN REAL. which they aren't, and which never will be done ever in a such movie. so for those who felt like what happened didn't happen, then go wish for a judgement day to happen during your short life, then u get real stuff.<br/><br/>So for a quick summary;<br/><br/>Movie Beginning : 6/10 Movie Midt part : 8/10 Movie Ending : 9/10 Special effects : 10/10 Story : 10/10 Adrenaline factor: 8/10 General acting : 8/10 Would i like to see this movie again: Yes!"

","How would one go through life is one would know what would be happening next? It's a question that is silently posed in this film but it's never really answered. It all starts when a young kid, upon being asked to make a drawing to store in a time-capsule does not draw a picture but writes down what seems to be random numbers instead. When years after the time-capsule is opened again the paper with the numbers comes into the hands of a father and his child and the father starts to stare at the numbers, attempting to find a pattern or meaning in them. What he finds scares him more than anything has ever scared him before.<br/><br/>This film starts by making one big claim. If one can accept that claim to be truth it turns the film in a pretty standard but OK film with a fun but plot-holed filled story. If one can not accept that claim the film quickly turns into a long series of irritations. It plays out fairly decently, building on the initial claim and adding more twists to it, eventually digging its own grave a bit because it contradicts itself a few times.

","Okay, the premise of Knowing is fine, and honestly, all of the imagery, motifs, themes, etc. were all fine too, despite what some over-sensitive people might say.<br/><br/>However, the movie simply CRAWLED. The pacing got so labored, I ended up sitting there, aggravated, impatiently waiting for what I know is about to happen to actually happen. But, instead, the movie takes its sweet time, trying awfully hard to build tension and suspense but utterly failing to do so as everyone screams in their minds: HURRY THE @#$% UP! Much of this owes to Knowing trying to be cross into or be too many genres at once. It wants to be sci-fi, action, family drama, adventure, mystery, suspense, etc. etc. etc. and overdoes various elements from each, including plenty of spooky music, disturbing imagery, and flashy computer-generated special effects.<br/><br/>This, in turn, stunts much of the character development that could have been possible (but probably not necessary for the premise of this kind of film) had they just stayed focused. That said, at least one of the characters was so incredibly unsympathetic, uttering at least one line that was just so patently unbelievable, that you...<br/><br/>Yeah.<br/><br/>Interesting premise, flawed execution. Reminds me of Deep Impact, actually, which was another disaster/end-of-the-world movie with an interesting premise but ultimately incredibly unsatisfying and even aggravating. Actually, to be fair, Deep Impact suffered more from its unsympathetic characters (Elijah Wood) than it did from pacing, which is the primary flaw of Knowing."

","For years I have been waiting for a decent Nicolas Cage film. Alas I am going to have to wait longer. For the record I think he is fine (Wild at heart, Con Air, Leaving Las Vegas all okay films), it is mainly the scripts of everything else that lets him down.<br/><br/>So this film starts to look pretty promising. I am thinking thriller/horror. The idea behind the discovery of a piece of paper predicting dates, number of victims and co-ordinates of disasters is fabulous. The plane crash was really well done and quite shocking when it first came down.<br/><br/>However the last 1/3 or 1/4 of the film was terrible and undid all the good early work as it turned sci-fi (like sci-fi also but please, I think they were hedging their bets on the genre front). Aliens or were they angels?, bunny rabbits, Cage's endless crying and his stupid legs apart stick out the crotch stance whilst endlessly crying really started to grate. I longed for the end and eventually it came. The effect of the earths destruction was actually pretty good.<br/><br/>This gets a 4/10.

","The trailers for this movie really grabbed my attention. And for the first half of the movie, I was getting what I had hoped for. A neat sci-fi story about a prediction for the future placed in a time capsule 50 yrs earlier. Despite my inability to take Nick Cage seriously (honestly, how does someone who starred in Ghost Rider still have a career in acting?), the process of figuring out the code, what it meant, and how it came to be was intriguing. HOWEVER. And that is probably the biggest 'however' I've ever used... this movie takes a turn for the worst about halfway through. It seems like the writers had ideas for several different movies, and decided to cram them all into one. It becomes so disjointed and turns into an episode of the Outer Limits on acid. Enter aliens, UFOs, and the ""chosen ones"". I think I'm most disappointed because the trailers were so intriguing, and the plot had so much potential. Somebody dropped the ball on this one..."
"jobojoseph","4","2","6","1 May 2009"," tense and perverse
","'Knowing', as a tense action film works to some extent. The scenes of destruction are the most impressive iv seen, yet there is something rather perverse and pointless about the whole thing. The development of the mystery that fuels 'Knowing's' narrative is pleasingly ridiculous at the best of times, but as usual with a lot of recent American action films, the plot takes itself far too seriously, becoming at times unbearably tense, whilst at the same time (paradoxically) rather uninteresting.<br/><br/>The more problematic, or in fact worrying, element of this film seems to be its most outstanding contribution. The action scenes - the scenes of disaster - are incredibly real and intense. (Me and a friend watched this, and despite our cynicism we were both undeniably affected to a great extent by these scenes - for an American i imagine the imagery is far more affecting.) The problem with these scenes is that as a whole they seem to mean nothing - they lead our protagonist simply through an orgy of destruction that - in opposition to the action genre's tendency to depict such destruction - is neither enjoyable nor cathartic.<br/><br/>This film, despite creating some brutally real scenes (which is undeniably quite an achievement), seems to have no purpose. The carnage that ensues can, at best, be seen as CGI at its most powerful; however it often seems as if there is a kind of perverse enjoyment/paranoia in watching many people die in very real yet spectacular ways that this film apparently panders to. Along with this the tense mystery that keeps the plot going slowly comes apart and by the end of the film, the plot's conclusion, despite its grandeur, is rather unrewarding. Ultimately this film - along with much of the apocalyptic genre that is slowly emerging from the American disaster and science fiction genres - is unrewarding and at times slightly worrying."

","For the better part of ""Knowing"", the space aliens all look more or less like David Bowie. That's not such a bad choice for an alien where I come from. But once it gets serious and they start snatching earthlings, they mutate to look exactly like aliens in any other mainstream movie: cheap-trick, see-through, half-baked luminous creatures who happen to be human in both shape and size. Also, they drive a Mazda. Maybe aliens are enlightened in ways we can only speculate about. The story, a messy mash-up of ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Contact"", is too trashy to even discuss. Bloggers tell me ""Knowing"" is a Scientology vehicle. If that's true, I feel for Ron Hubbard. Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, Shiva and The Flying Spaghetti Monster all have better ground staff doing their books and movies. So why does a smart and serious fellow like Nicolas Cage keep appearing in stuff like this? It must be that medieval castle he bought and never lived in. Patchy roof, tumbling walls, leaky well, you know the score. Or maybe, unlike the aliens, he doesn't want the Mazda. He wants the Maserati."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","6","17 April 2009"," Start by looking promising, loses steam midway through, falls completely apart at the end
","This sort of movie has become a standard Nick Cage fare – adventure, puzzles, thrills, with family sentimentality thrown in for good measure. It often works, but not this time, because this movie is trying too much to be big.<br/><br/>It starts out with a promising plot line – a time capsule from 50 years ago with a collection of grade school kids' vision of the future. One of those, instead of the usual drawing of space ship, contains entirely numbers. It turns out that the numbers are predictions of 50 years' disasters with accurate time, coordinates of location and number of casualties. By the time the capsule is opened, only 3 such disasters remain to happen.<br/><br/>This is rather gripping. But the movie makers seem to be interested only in creating an interesting opening of a chess game but never bother to finish it. The movie soon slips into banality, predictability and, worst of all, sloppiness. That, to be fair, is in terms of logics and credibility. The special effect, on the other hand, deserves due recognition.<br/><br/>As someone who watched an average of about 150 movies each year in the last few years, I don't think I'm easily impressed, let alone sacred, by a disaster scene. And yet, the first disaster in this movie really scared me, sort of made me jump and gasp. I wouldn't spoil you fun but would just say that it's not one of those cheap tricks of sudden, loud bangs. It's a combination of many things – well set up, sudden, realistic, imminent, overwhelming visual power. This is the best in all disaster scenes I've seen in any movie.<br/><br/>But this, together with a couple of other well executed disaster scenes, is not sufficient to salvage this movie. The story is unconvincing and its sentiment shallow. The delivery, except for special effects, is painting by number.<br/><br/>By the sheerest coincidence, browsing a video store just before this movie, I found and bought a DVD that I have been trying to find for a few years – ""One the beach"", made in 1959, exactly the same year the time capsule in ""Knowing"" was buried. Both stories are about the end of humanity. Comparing them, you can't help but see the huge contrary – the advance in technology of special effects and the regression in quality and depth of the script. Yes, I know, ""Knowing"" is not based on a good novel, but is that any excuse?"

Normally I guess you should give it 6 or 7 but it was OK and very twee at the end so 5.<br/><br/>It seems to be a few different film genres all with one thread. It looks a bit like a thriller in parts, has scenes that wouldn't be out of place in a horror, goes a bit of sci-fi and has a little of the old spookynatural time travel fantasy. In the end it's a religious myth in new clothes or at least clothes that have been taking to the dry cleaners. Whilst you could probably find that any number of our favourite films, characters are based on religious myths this particular one is extraordinarily heavy handed. So much so that you simple hand to question the motive behind the film. Is this a film or a party broadcast?<br/><br/>The acting was a bit boring throughout. The kid was good, Nicholas Cage was good in parts (mostly with the kid), the family and friends were all nondescript and dull. <br/><br/>Watchable but not enjoyable, Pretends to be interesting until it can safely start preaching. I have nothing against religious myths and even though I am atheist I think the stories can be pretty cool. This one wasn't."
"virek213","8","2","6","29 March 2009"," ""Knowing"" That You Can't Stop It
","It's interesting to think of the extremes of reactions here to KNOWING, ranging from scorn to almost-uncritical praise. But while I'll admit it isn't the most credible science fiction film I've ever seen, even one of its sub-genre, that of the End Of The World, I know of quite a few others like it that are absolute clinkers.<br/><br/>The premise of KNOWING, in that an MIT professor played by Nicolas Cage, has discovered a parchment hidden in a time capsule at his son's school that was buried there fifty years ago with a random set of numbers that foretold of horrors that would befall us between 1959 and 2009, and the ultimate horror that would eliminate the human race, is a brilliant and even frightening one. Indeed, this is a film that involves both science and religion, which often seem to bump into one another both in the reel world and the real world. Cage gets involved because one of the disasters told in that parchment was an apartment fire in Phoenix that killed his wife and eighty others a few years back; and when he comes into contact with the daughter (Rose Byrne) of the disturbed schoolgirl who wrote the parchment, he desperately tries to protect himself, her, and their two children (Chandler Canterbury; Lara Robinson). In the end, however, knowing what the numbers on the parchment mean can only lead to the conclusion that the film gets to eventually--that The End can't be stopped.<br/><br/>Although admittedly imperfect, partly because of some occasionally lame dialog, KNOWING really does manage to merit a lot of scares. Its blend of science fiction and Biblical prophecy was, for me, rather interesting, because it did not totally dismiss the prophecy aspect out of hand, and yet it also avoided the ham-fisted soapbox shouting of the ""Left Behind"" series. The special effects here, not surprisingly, are quite good, especially the climactic destruction of the world and its rebirth elsewhere in the universe; and the music score by Marco Beltrami interestingly appropriates the ominous Allegretto movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 at a couple of points in the film as a musical prelude to the inevitable.<br/><br/>KNOWING probably won't go down as being among the best science fiction films ever, let alone of the End Of The World variety, but it works well enough, and it has provoked a lot of consideration about the impact of science and religion on the future of humanity."

Even if the whole world burned but miraculously the small family of 4 survived in that little shack would have left the viewer feeling fulfilled and entertained.
Interesting idea poorly executed, good acting, good script, nice special effects, suspenseful climax but every character I cared aboit died so left with a sense of disappointment.
If someone is to survive, we should care about those characters more. Mire character building of the boy and girl was needed. The ending just seemed like a pointless story twist to make the story intelligent and it failed, leaving thr viewer with a bitter, disappointed taste.
I don't think this would tick the box for the atheist or religious viewer as there's no confirmation that the beings are devine. It almost paints the idea that we are just an alien Petri dish.

","'Knowing' sits astride two genres, being in part a disaster film and a mystery-suspense film; it's a combination that does have a certain impact on the mind even if 'Knowing' uses middlingly unoriginal characterizations and largely obvious plot conventions.<br/><br/>If you have seen films in the vein of 'The Mothman Prophesies' then you will feel readily orientated for watching 'Knowing'.<br/><br/>Oddly unrelated acting performances from the cast, almost as though the actors had been performing seperately only to be composited together in post production, is possibly because of the directing but I suspect that this film has been very heavily edited and re-edited.<br/><br/>This would explain the quite jarring genre jumps, certain plot holes, unexplained plot strands and story points that aren't explained....an example being: how does Nicholas Cage's lead character know the death toll prediction of the first disaster if the pattern of uncircled numbers in the number sequence are still a complete mystery to him as we would be lead to believe at that point? I suspect serious editing after shooting is the reason for so many jumps and joins.<br/><br/>However the film does mix it's genres with some effect, the final disaster I found interesting in its scope and in its depiction and Cage often brings a liveliness to his role that almost humanises his character here.<br/><br/>Therefore I personally rate a fairly complimentary 4/10....I'm not sure why I liked this but I did find something in 'Knowing' that I liked.

"byson5186","9","1","2","8 April 2015"," Benjamin Gates In Knowing
","First off, I just finished running on the treadmill while watching the movie National Treasure. National Treasure with Nicholas Cage is a fun movie to watch that I immediately remember including the characters, and it takes me back to when that movie was new in the years 2004 and 2005, which I seriously can't believe was a decade ago. Of course, I'm not here to talk about National Treasure, because this isn't the IMDb page for National Treasure, however while watching that movie I immediately thought about this movie. Let's think, what do these two movies have in common, that's right the main actor Nicholas Cage. He starred in this movie some years after National Treasure was made. While I believe Nicholas Cage is a big actor, I haven't seen him in that many films, and the movie I remember him the most from is National Treasure. Sometimes when you see an actor you recognize from a movie or TV show, while that actor plays a different character we almost feel like that character played by the actor in that movie, is the same character played by the same actor in a different movie, as if Benjamin Gates from National Treasure was John Koestler in Knowing. The characters seem to have some similarities and were possibly the right ones for the roles. For example, it seems like both characters in both movies they are very well educated men. In National Treasure, Cage's interest was more American History which made him believe in a hidden treasure. In this movie we see how his interest is more about ""Determinism."" That might not be the right word I forget what it's called, but the prediction of future events from past events and that each event happens in sequence from a prior cause leading to the next. Also, in similarity both characters come across a series of codes that only they seem to be the only ones to figure out what they mean and try to go after where the code leads to.<br/><br/>Among the differences between John Koestler and Benjamin Gates. Benjamin Gates in National Treasure seems to be a single 40-year old man hanging out with his nerdy friend Riley, and we later see his love interest Abigail. In this movie, John Koestler is a single father a widower. He lives alone with his 9-year old son Caleb Koestler and frequently acts depressed. So, seeing John Koestler as a father of a kid and as a widower gives different meaning to his character that wasn't in either National Treasure. The kids in this movie also give a certain scary mood from the movie seeing how the horror is coming from the few main kids in the cast POV. <br/><br/>This movie isn't quite like National Treasure in terms of action, fun, and adventure. This movie is more of a creepy scary movie and possibly even horror movie. Not really really like horror movie, but around as scary as movies like Jurassic Park which if you can handle, you should handle this. Also, how kids are the main characters in this movie when National Treasure doesn't really have kids as a main cast. National Treasure mostly has grown ups on a big adventure. Seeing how kids are among the cast gives more meaning to this movie. It also does not seem quite as cheesy as National Treasure, as National Treasure can at times be cheesy. The first two that came out seemed to have the same mood. This movie has a darker mood which if you like horror movies, you should enjoy this. The intensity of the scenes should get to you, as a lot of scenes just have a really dark tone to them. But, in all while this isn't a fun adventure movie to watch like National Treasure, it's a fun horror movie to watch that will keep you watching, wondering what will happen next. I give it a 9/10."

","Is there any better way to ruin a movie than to give it a crappy ending? Why does this seem to happen in some of Nic Cage's movies? <br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT:<br/><br/>I love a good drama/thriller that keeps the intensity going, and I think this one did...but I could have done without the aliens, the whole reference to the Garden of Eden in the end, and the video game-like cinematics that made the blowing wheat field they were running through make me wonder what the heck just happened to a pretty intense disaster/end of the world movie. Oh wait...I know what happened...they turned the tides and inserted Christianity into a movie that had nothing to do with religion until the very end. <br/><br/>I give it a 7 because the suspense was good, but the ending doesn't make me want to watch it again any time soon."
"keen-6","10","3","12","22 March 2009"," The strongest point - almost flawless, well crafted story.
","I think this movie beautifully combines three major pillars that makes it work. First is the idea of the end of the world, which is always interesting if done well. Then this contemporary question of deterministic universe versus total randomness. Thirdly, aliens, which are a part of modern folklore so it is only natural to combine them in this kind of story. And that is this movie strongest point - almost flawless, well crafted plot, which is very rare in movies of recent years. The closest that modern sci-fi movies usually come to is a dumbed-down version of some old classics. But this story by Ryne Douglas Pearson survived all the usual trimmings by Hollywood. The thrill and tension was great. I thought Rose Byrne (Dyana Wayland) was very good. The visuals where also up to par. Good movie, very entertaining."

","I'll start by saying this could have been a good movie; even an excellent one, but the execution was downright awful. The first 90% of the movie was an absolute waste and it would have been more integral to the ending if the main characters had just sat out in the front lawn the entire time watching the grass grow. It seems the entire purpose of the predictive numbers was to get the kids to those coordinates at a certain time. Although, even that didn't matter because the aliens intervened and did it themselves anyway. It would have made a lot more sense for the aliens to do nothing since the parents wouldn't have suspected anything that way and said aliens wouldn't have had to engage in a car chase. The point is, I have a difficult time seeing the good in a movie that unravels itself completely in the last 10 minutes. It's lazy and a borderline dues ex machina."

","This my favourite film of 2009 (Along with Watchmen), Alex Proyas has us chasing a huge Maguffin- one that Hitchcock would have been pleased with. By the time we are committed to Nic Cage's wild goose chase, a whole new scenario presents itself. Great writing, great directing, and Proyas uses the Digital Medium to full advantage.<br/><br/>Music by Marco Beltrami, who is the new Ennio Morricone, which has strands reminiscent of I, Robot, not just of I, Robot but that ""This is a Proyas film with Music by Beltrami""<br/><br/>The basis of this film is the aged argument of Randomness vs Determinism, and Nic Cage's character gives us the best definition of Determinism that I've ever heard, one that agrees with my belief system. Actually, it is not ""Randomness versus Determinism"" - It is more like, Randomness AND Determinism, because the story here melds the two together. Things have to be Random, but the collection of random events builds a Determined Universe.<br/><br/>A very spiritual film, and also references the current events of this year, which must have been difficult as the film was made last year, before most of the issues we got facing us this summer had materialised, so it is a good piece of speculative fiction as well as the interesting story it tells.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 as far as I am concerned, worth watching twice in a row, and I'm going on a 3rd viewing now."

","If you haven't yet read the review of this film by RosenKratz from Washington DC, posted here above or below, you need to read their review as well. RosenKratz nails it beautifully describing the thought-provoking nature of this film.<br/><br/>The only reason I had no expectations of this film is because I had no real knowledge (heh, excuse the pun) of it until it hit DVD. I wish so bad now that I could have seen this on the big screen.<br/><br/>One of the most amazing scenes, without giving anything away, is this single shot scene that lasts over 4 minutes of a devastating airplane accident and it's aftermath. The scene goes on continuously with a single camera with no edits. As a student of cinema, that scene brought me out of my seat wondering how, even in today's technology, it was achieved! And indeed, when you look at the Special Features on the DVD it explains how the scene was (barely) done. After seeing how the scene was shot, I was still in complete and utter awe in how convincingly it all looked after the final cut! In my opinion, Alex Proyas has broke new barriers in the field of film making with this work. A standard that Hollywood has always nurtured, and a standard that I hope always exists in future film works.<br/><br/>If you are a lover of movies, or a student of cinema, you really need to see this at least once.....but I'm gonna see it several times, cause I'm both! :-)"

"funkyfry","3","2","7","29 April 2009"," Alex Proyas' Waterloo
","Nic Cage gets knocked enough these days, so I'll go easy on him. He didn't do anything particularly great or noticeably bad in this film. There's a sort of generic quality to the way he plays a character, and it's very hard to believe that he's really some kind of physics professor, but those are small beans in the larger picture. For me, the film was really a disappointment when you consider it as a film not only directed by but produced by Alex Proyas.<br/><br/>Cage plays an MIT professor, and the movie gets no more realistic from this point on. His son (Chandler Canterbury) receives a prophetic string of numbers in a school-related time capsule, and he believes that these prophecies must have come to him for a reason, perhaps so he could prevent the tragedies.<br/><br/>Proyas has always seemed to have some amount of trouble with the conclusions of his movies. They never seem to deliver on the promise of his stylish philosophizing earlier in the films. In ""The Crow"", that could perhaps be explained away by the premature death of his leading man, Brandon Lee. But even his best film, ""Dark City"", devolves at a certain point into a rather standard effects driven action sequence. Usually a certain note of poignancy is added right at the very end which acts in some measure to redeem this. What we get in this film is a corny scene of the 2 kids being ushered into some nirvana place. I thought the film would have been much stronger if it had been more ambiguous in the end. No doubt is left in the audience's mind as to the fate of all these characters, including the children. I would have liked it better if it was more open ended. I thought it would be great if the ""whisperers"" could be seen as either angels or devils. That would be closer to Arthur Clarke's ""Childhood's End"", which seems to have been an inspiration to the writers (along with perhaps that old stand-by ""Chariots of the Gods"", with its references to Ezekiel and UFO phenomena). The whisperers reminded me of the ""watchers"" from ""Dark City"", and I thought it would have been neat if it had been left open enough that I could imagine that they had actually kidnapped these children to take them into outer space for some kind of experiment. Maybe they shaved their heads and became the watchers. But the film slammed the door on that possibility and every other possibility as well.<br/><br/>There is an atheist interpretation of this movie floating around as well as a theist interpretation. Neither of them makes complete sense because this movie doesn't make complete sense. If the whisperers were going to kidnap the kids in the mom's SUV anyway, then why did they go through all the stuff with the prophecies and the little black stones and all of that? If they are ""angels"", then why do they go around dressed up like they're going to a NIN concert? It only makes sense internally, in terms of the logic of how the story unfolds, but it doesn't make sense when you try to put it all back together after the film is over. The only way I can make sense of it is in the theist interpretation: if the whisperers are biblical ""angels"", and if they represent ""God"", then their motives are incomprehensible. I detected a stronger Jewish religious theme in this movie than Christian -- this was the God of Job. The Cage character here lost his wife in a fire, a vague reference to the story of Lot. The film explicitly references Ezekiel. And in contrast to the Christian notion of apocalypse and salvation through Grace, these ""angels"" only save those who have been chosen for what seem to be arbitrary reasons, and they torture those who they choose with prophecy and madness for no reason that can be rationalized in human reason (the Christian God is always reasonable, as if he were invented by Aristotle, but the Hebrew God is rarely logical).<br/><br/>However the theist interpretation of the movie bores me and combined with the rather cut-and-dried ending of the film makes me feel like I've seen something closer to dogma than to scientific speculation. That's why the movie reminded me of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", another faux-SF movie that drapes itself in the clothes of science but is truly a story about faith. In an extremely awkward and obviously contrived scene set in Cage's classroom, we're presented with a naive dichotomy of the nature of the universe -- it's either completely random, or it has a logical order because God chooses what happens. However, naturalism actually holds that the universe proceeds along the lines of predictable physical causes and effects, the very opposite of the ""random."" What is actually ""random"" is the idea of a God coming along and deciding to, say, put certain kids on a spaceship and repopulate the human race with them. But the movie would try to convince us of the exact opposite -- that a universe predicated strictly on natural law would somehow be inherently unpredictable because it has no ""purpose."" <br/><br/>Please -- if you're going to make a SF movie, you have to give us science. Not ridiculous Nic Cage as an MIT professor who doesn't understand the basic tenets of science. The way I see this movie, it was an elaborate straw man argument."

Knowing was booted out of the best of the year spot, but is still on the list. The Plot: Back in the fifties, a classroom was supposed to draw pictures and put it in the time capsule, meant to be opened fifty years later. A girl named Lucinda didn't draw a picture. She wrote down tons of numbers. Fifty years later, the school pulls out the time capsule, and a boy named Caleb Koestler. Caleb brings it home and his father John, an M.I.T. professor looks at it. He notices that there are numbers that represent disasters that have happened. He circles them until he finds out that there are three sets of numbers left. These will be disasters also. So John must get help from Lucinda's daughter and try to prevent the disasters. The film leaves you asking yourself What happens when the numbers run out? Knowing is an amazing film.

","Forget the critics and go see this movie. It's entertaining, thought provoking and moves along at a quick pace. I like Nicholas Cage. I don't like critics that are so full of themselves they can't recognize a good story when they see one. It's just plain old fashioned story telling, nothing complicated, just entertaining. There are some disaster sequences that might make the squeamish amongst us shudder a bit, but, I hope this movie continues on with its initial popularity because I'm tired of what Hollywood has spewed out lately. A good, interesting Sci Fi type suspense thriller that leaves you somewhat uplifted is what I look for. The slasher stuff can cease to exist as far as I'm concerned. More movies like this one please."

As an example- the mysterious characters, some considers them as aliens and others angel. If you are not really a believer, then you'll be wasting your time watching this. Some people just can not accept the ending, it bothers them. If you can just accept to believe the message this movie is trying to give you, you will love this movie. I am big fan of Nicolas cage, may be that is what inspired me the most to watch this film but it was worth it. For me it was the best Sci-fi/disaster film I ever watched."

There are angels, garden of eden, the three of knowledge and all the other crap that makes religion a ridiculous notion. It is clear that the Christian fundamentalists and the creationists has entered Hollywood and is spewing their garbage. Films like this should be labeled just like music containing profanity is.

","From what i thought of the apocalypse, turns out to be a one way ticket to another world altogether. This was a very enjoyable film from frame one to last. The strangers were a bit under done but what the hell, looks are not everything. I really thought they were the seven arch angels of the apocalypse making one wonder if this was a religious aspect to the movie. But to my misdiagnosis i am glad i was wrong. The twist of having the strangers look for the very few who could be touched to the inner mind so that they themselves can have a second chance was refreshing. On a distant planet where no sickness or diseases can run rampant, and collectively having all the children in one spot to restart the race. And having the old wiped away in a burning cinder was quite original. Leaving behind the old memories and mistrusts of the human race, until the earth became a scorched ember ready to reconstitute itself for another million years, and to have the children come back to repopulate the species. Wonderful way to show how we really do not need this planet by the way its going right now."
"mr_popcorn","7","2","9","25 March 2009"," What happens when the numbers run out?
","After a not so hot streak of low end, trashy movies, Nicolas Cage has come back from the dead starring in this high powered apocalyptic horror/sci-fi breed from director Alex Proyas. I've always been a big fan of Cage, but not so much lately when he starred in what seemed to be a slew of uninspired movies that can be compared to garbage eaten by rats. But alas, guided by the right hands of a man with a vision and free reign, Cage returns to form and carries the whole movie all the way through. What's more is that he didn't need to don an ugly looking hairstyle, just a normal one and no killer bees, motorcycles on fire and Thai prostitutes either so my faith in him has been restored. I've heard news that he plans to retire soon, I say no.<br/><br/>The man clearly has more to offer and to some, the stench of the havoc caused by Wicker Man, Ghost Rider and Bangkok Dangerous is still there. Maybe take another jab at the Oscar gold too. Nicolas Cage aside, I can't figure out what the movie really tries to be. There's part where it passes off as a horror movie and there are parts where the vibe is just pure science fiction. But I call a mix between the two because there's just enough to make it horrific and just the right amount to call it sci-fi. Alex Proyas, the man behind such great films like Dark City and The Crow may have made his best one yet with this movie. Peppered with great CG effects, just the right amount of dialogue for a movie like this and a couple of mind melting scenes that will cause your brain to leak out your ears. I saw it in a theater and I was on my toes the whole time probably because of the effective mood the director has toned it with and the astounding and ear shattering music score by Marco Beltrami.<br/><br/>I wouldn't wanna spoil the ending but I can vouch for its uniqueness. Definitely not your typical Hollywood ending one expects it to be, I like how the director probably just slammed it all over the Roman Catholic church with the way the ending turned out and still, leaving a mark and a message that will make an impact to the audience and they won't even see it coming.<br/><br/>One of the best films I've seen since 2009 kicked things off. It is just refreshing to see this one atop the box office and not some low rent, B-grade studio movie. Highly recommended."

His son Caleb's school opens the time capsule and Caleb receives the list with numbers. <br/><br/>John realizes that the numbers represent disasters and their death tolls with some yet to happen, including the end of the world.

John goes back to MIT and realizes that there's gonna be a solar flare that will kill all life on Earth. John tries to find coordinates in a door that Lucinda had wrote them but Diana takes both their kids and stops at a gas station where the stalkers who had been whispering to the kids the whole time take the kids. Diana dies in a car crash and John heads to the coordinates, which turn out to be Lucinda's house. <br/><br/>The kids are with the stalkers who turn out to be aliens/angels that chose them to be saved. John can't go, so he watches the kids leave in some ridiculous looking spaceship. John then reunites with his sister and parents as the solar flare destroys Earth. This would've been a decent way to end this idiotic movie, but instead they decided to picture the kids as Adam and Eve on a new planet. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie had an interesting start but went completely off the rails.

So yeah, about 40 minutes into the film you'll start playing on your phone while watching it. But I had to watch it because Nick Cage takes so much heat for it and I wanted to see if he was the problem with the film; he wasn't.

","The story is just another an apocalypse narrative like any others. The variation in the story that aliens are protecting humans by selecting some kids and 'whispering' them signs and clues about the impending doom, and ultimately taking them someplace else to start over doesn't really make the story a unique one. The thriller side is quite nice. Combined with the strong sci-fi practice, this movie managed to keep me curious and stayed on to watch. Although I must say that I'm rather disappointed with the ending because the mysterious whisper people are revealed not as expected. The depiction of the alien race is quite nice. In some ways, it tries to connect our science, reports of alien sightings and experiences, myths, and religious faith into one depiction. The acting by Cage is just a so-so and is not a special thing. Byrne's performance though, is a nice one because she can grasp the emotions involved in the scenes, whether on the calm situations like most of her scenes, or the elevated situations like the one in the gas station."

","I quite enjoyed the first half of the movie. The beginning was very promising. I very much enjoyed the ""time capsule"" concept.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie was intriguing, but then... was the second half written/directed by entirely different people?? <br/><br/>I didn't think the acting was very good, either. Absolutely everyone in the movie was sub-par, especially the teacher in the beginning. Well, they were not *horrible*; just not very good.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage's character was quite one-dimensional and unlikeable. The way he neglects his son throughout the movie and treats him like s***. How do you expect people to root for such an uncharismatic, wooden, unremarkable character? <br/><br/>The ending was just 'lazy' and thoroughly disappointing. They could've thought of something more original. Honestly. If you're going to have aliens in the movie, at least take some time to introduce them - and their purpose - properly.<br/><br/>The second half of the film is just some cheesy religious propaganda. Total drivel. And that scene with the two kids on a supposedly new planet as Adam and Eve... oh, the horror! Words can't convey how cringe-worthy it was.<br/><br/>The special effects were a bit lame and unrealistic.<br/><br/>(1) Lots of WTF moments, too. For instance, he wasted several hours writing those numbers (from Lucinda's paper) *by hand* on a chalk board?? He could've just made a bloody photocopy! (2) And what about Lucinda? She's clearly disturbed and a major weirdo, yet nobody in school seems to do notice - or care about - her issues. That kind of behavior is impossible to ignore. There wasn't much background on Lucinda at all -- basically, we know nothing about her, even though the whole movie is based around her.<br/><br/>(3) What the f*** was that plane crash all about? A plane has crashed (and exploded -- several times!), yet all the people seem to have got away with catching a little fire. Not even them, but their clothes. They seem to be in impeccable condition i.e. not injured in any way. That scene was incomprehensible.<br/><br/>And plenty more where that came from.<br/><br/>I'm giving it 7 stars just for the premise, which I thought *was* excellent. The execution seriously sucked, though."
"Quebec_Dragon","6","1","3","20 November 2012"," Knowing how well the movie turned out without spoilers
","I thought the concept was great, the implementation was interesting, but in the end the reason for that prophetic document was far fetched and didn't make sense. Initially, I was quite engrossed by the movie and thought it might pleasantly surprise me (I didn't expect much from a relatively recent Nicolas Cage movie). I thought the mystery aspect was well built-up. The performance by Cage was better than usual, but then he's usually good at acting quietly depressed. The first disaster sequences were amazing not only in their intensity, but in the way they were shot. That first one involving a plane crash in a sequence of roughly 3 minutes with not cuts was viscerally gripping as if you were really there.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie fell apart in the last quarter because of a few things. The aforementioned revelations were certainly shocking, but why were they made in that indirect, stupid, relying-on-luck-and-finding-someone-smart-enough way (document lost in time capsule for 50 years) when they could have easily been made directly to the people involved? It's not as if the responsible parties weren't around all those years! One might argue there couldn't have been a movie then, but whenever I try to think too much about common sense logic, the plot doesn't make sense. Characters also started acting irrationally. Considering what was happening, this might be excused. What cannot be excused however is how poor the acting by the modern kids was. I had already noticed how unemotional the main boy and girl were, but their seriously lacking ""emoting"" near the end basically ruined any emotional connection with me, the public, there should have been. Even Cage, more believable, could save that climactic moment.<br/><br/>So despite an initially thrilling slow-paced mystery with exciting, yet short, disasters sequences, the film didn't work for me intellectually or emotionally. It's also a case of a lousy ending (and no, it's not because of the tone) ruining the rest. For the first three quarters of the film, I would rate it a 7 or 8. The last quarter I would rate a 3 or 4. I cut the apple in half for my final rating.<br/><br/>Rating: 5.5 out of 10 (average-good)"
"asda-man","7","1","3","24 October 2012"," Knows a lot! Until the end
","Knowing is one of those sci-fi films that rely on a jaw-dropping ending. Something really well thought out and intelligent. Unfortunately Knowing fails to deliver that impact. The film starts off brilliantly with an interesting flashback to a distant little girl who scribbles a load of numbers into a time capsule. Flash-forward to 50 years later and who ends up getting that picture but Nicolas Cage's son (not his actual son, but you know). I thought the film did quite a good job of building up th characters and creating an involving storyline, so you cared what happened Nicolas and his family. Although some of it was schmaltzy and over-sentimental such as the sign language when his son went to bed, but it made a great effort of caring for the characters.<br/><br/>Some of it did defy belief as well, such as randomly noticing that the bunch of numbers had a link to 9/11 but I suppose the story does need something to push it along, whatever that may be. But what's great about Knowing is that it's never boring, thanks to the great build-up to the disasters. The disasters themselves aren't that incredible, but the build-up of not knowing what's going to happen is highly suspenseful. As the mystery unfolds it also becomes incredibly gripping, and you look forward to what the end is going to offer! Unfortunately it doesn't offer much.<br/><br/>I found the ending to be incredibly clunky and awkward. It didn't feel as if it fitted within the film and also seemed lazy and plonked. The ending was a total cop-out to me and it's a shame because the build-up getting there is marvellously entertaining, but all you get is a piece of hokum that deserved to be something intelligent. However, Knowing is not an amazingly clever film, it's just a piece of entertainment and it certainly achieves that. Nicolas Cage is as wooden as ever, but if you can over look that, then it's certainly a film worthy of your time (if you can learn to forgive the ending). The special effects are quite impressive too."

","It is not exactly as bad as it is portrayed to be. Yes there are a lot of things that could have worked goes wrong. Be it acting, unnecessary side plot, simplicity of the discovery or overall execution. But one has to agree that the premise is quite intriguing and exciting and that worked for me.<br/><br/>John (Nicolas Cage) is an astrophysicist and a single parent to an ear-disabled kid Caleb (Chandler Canterbury). In one of the school events, each student gets a letter from a time capsule (letters buried 50 years earlier by students of the same school). While most of them inquires about flying cars and robots, one that Caleb gets just contains random numbers. John gets obsessed with these numbers and accidentally cracks it to find that it contains the list of dates when major accidents or catastrophes happen, number of casualties and the location of where they occur. The last item in the list is soon to happen but the number of causalities and location is incomplete.<br/><br/>Somehow Nicolas Cage gets these stories or they come searching for him of late. He is the only A listed actor in Hollywood who acted in most B movies. If the original plot from the synopsis was developed further and presented independently, it would have worked better as a good B movie. Adding the unnecessary subplot, hallucinations, personalization of the premise wrecks the whole interest in the movie. The climax feels more like a mash-up of other superior movies. The special effects are glitch ridden, acting sub-par thanks to Nicolas Cage of late and dialogues are cringe worthy.

","""Please take great care of each other and our mother; she is meant to be the color of trees, sand and water; her name is Mother Earth and if she is hurt, she is an unforgiving force to be reckoned with!"" This is the message, or lesson that I chose to take with me from the 2009, Drama, ""Knowing"". Knowing was directed by Alex Proyas and written by Ryne Douglas Pearson. It was John Koestler, played by Nicholas Cage, is a professor in the field of astrophysics, a widower, and single father to Caleb Koestler, played by, Chandler Canterbury. I believe that the author intended to point out that if we continue to ""bite the hand that feeds us"" we will lose any battles against her. We are a fragile race at the mercy of the land. (Boggs, J. 2008; Proyas, A. 2009).<br/><br/>The film begins in 1959, at William Dawes Elementary School. Children are drawing pictures that will remain underground and opened by students on their fifty year anniversary. Meanwhile, Lucinda Embry, (Lara Robinson), is frantically scribbling numbers on her paper. Before she is able to finish, her paper is taken from her and put in the capsule. Lucinda is later found in a closet where she scratched the remaining numbers on the door. Fifty years later, Caleb receives Lucinda's paper from the capsule and takes it home. John eventually begins analyzing the numbers and discovers they match dates, coordinates and the number of deaths that took place during major disasters in history. John also discovers that there are three dates that haven't occurred yet. It then becomes his mission to prevent these events. (Proyas, A. 2009)<br/><br/>As the film progressed, the idea for my theme became more and more apparent through the use of camera angles and effects during certain scenes. These effects appeared to emphasize a message during specific important scenes. The directors ""interpretive view"" shot during the looting scene employed the use of low camera angles, slow motion, and close ups shots. The camera effects focused on the anger, fighting and ruthlessness during this scene. This scene was also just before the fires had begun, possibly implying, that ""this is the reason you (the human race) must leave"". The low camera angles seemed to symbolize to me that ""humans couldn't get any lower than they were at that moment."" In the beginning scenes of fire, similar, and contrasting effects were used for emphasis. Distant aerial shots, close-up shots, and slowly panned out effects were used during this scene. In addition, the director again employed the use of slow motion. These slow moving, angles were utilized mostly during the fighting and theft scenes. The emphasis and low lighting during these scenes told a story of disgust in our behavior. It forced the viewer to reflect on human behaviors and their effects on the earth. During these two scenes the viewer is watching in first person. My interpretation of this scene coupled with the objective view is to look within at what is most important in life, the well being of our planet and each other. Finally, the ""indirect-subjective point of view"" was applied in the scene where we watched John and his family hugging just before being consumed by the fire. The audience can feel their pain and joy of being together in their final moments. (Boggs, J. 2008; Proyas, A. 2009)<br/><br/>Although I didn't care for the direction taken at the end of this film, I was intrigued by the films recurring message that reflected on our destructive behavior. It was an obvious message that was sent with a bit of a fictional yet questionable twist. Frequent disasters, a harsh and unforgiving ending, coupled with effective use of camera angles and low lighting; conveys that we are indeed at the mercy of our home. We should take heed that as we waste, destroy, kill and ravage our beautiful earth, she is our only home, yet we are ripping her out from under our feet. We can really learn a lesson from this film.

","**Warning: Spoilers!** <br/><br/>NOTE: I do not read other reviews before writing my own.<br/><br/>First a word about cinematography. Overall the movie has a good look and feel to it, appropriate for the script. CGI of the aliens and their ships was good, but the fire in the plane crash scene was very poor.<br/><br/>The movie held my interest for a while, the acting was OK, the plot had potential, but the execution left much to be desired.<br/><br/>The movie presents three questions from the beginning: 1. Who is whispering? 2. What are they whispering about? 3. Why are they bothering to communicate that information? The answers came too quickly. #2 was answered first, then #1 was easy to guess when the we are told the whisperers offered to take the boy with them. OK then, I thought, it's an alien movie, but what motive do they have for sending such a cryptic message? As it turns out the aliens are either stupid or evil, but the movie makes them seem like saviours. Think about it: if their technology and/or ability is advanced enough to know the future, could they not have, at very least, organized a mass evacuation of the planet? Why choose several pairs of children to populate a new planet? The most logical answer is: ant farm. Sure, help the little creatures survive for a while, maybe teach them to be 'better' humans than the rest of the human race and let everyone else burn. Predictable and unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Another interpretation implied by the movie is religious--but if this is the case, science fiction and Christianity are mixed and muddied into a nonsensical mess (the aliens remind me a bit of the end of the Babylon 5 TV show and its 'angel' character). Is the point that humans have crapped up the earth, deserve to be destroyed, but hey, let's start over on another planet with a few of the young, impressionable ones! Again, predictable and unsatisfying.<br/><br/>This movie could have been written to leave a person pondering his/her existence, instead it left me wondering where the last two hours of my life went.<br/><br/>Overall, not really worth a watch."

","This one is awful. It begins from a completely unbelievable premise and gets less credible from there. It serves as a vehicle for Cage to show his single expression -- a cross between bewilderment and rage. I give it a 4 because a couple of special effects -- the plane crash and the ending in the city (which I won't give away)-- are well done. The attempts at family values are mawkish clichés. The effort to construct an allegory from fragments of Revelation that will somehow move a contemporary audience into a recognition of relevance is laughable. The directors thought that life would be re-propagated from the neo-Eden of the films' final shot, where two adorable, white bunnies are permitted to survive. That is a final insult the film lays on its helpless audience."

Well, I can't claim that “Knowing” isn't an entertaining film, but new?.. fresh?...<br/><br/>The beginning of the film wasn't entirely bad. It was even intriguing, it had some potential. But as the film carried on, everything just went straight to hell. When there were approximately 30 minutes left until the end, the film reached a completely new level- it became funny(not intentionally) and as far as I know, that's never good for a sci-fi film. It seems as if during the last 5 minutes of the film, the director remembered that he was making a sci-fi film and tried to fix everything, but even that turned out to be quite pathetic. The main idea, the concept- it's been used many times before and dare I say- with much more satisfying results.<br/><br/>First of all, I know that there are people who believe that this film is really and SERIOUSLY “deep”. Of course, you can see the whole film as one big allegory. But if you really want to, you can do that with every single movie. The truth is, I saw this film two days ago, and I still haven't decided which point of view I'm going to take to understand this film. I'm still not sure if it is a religious film? Or is it one more science fiction film, with a rather cheesy plot? One more option is that Alex Proyas has joined the Scientologists, and now is trying to promote his new found beliefs. Overall, I get the feeling that the director wanted everyone to be happy with his film. You know- Christians, regular viewers, sci-fi fans and Tom Cruise with his supporters. But apparently the result wasn't as successful as expected.<br/><br/>Another thing that caught my attention is that it seems as if both the writers and the director wanted “Knowing” to be a multi-genre film. At the beginning is looks as one of the Japanese horror film remakes, later on it fuses into mystery. Then we find out that Nicolas Cage plays a scientist, not only a scientist, but the ONLY scientist in the whole world ( 6,7 billion of bloody people) who realizes that world is coming to an end( like 24 ours before it is supposed to happen). Fine, I'm willing to let this one go, lets just say that the Sun isn't such a major object and nobody figured out to look at it. But what I really can't stand is the drama. I realize that diversity in film is necessary. There has to be certain amounts of various emotions in a movie in order to get to the viewers, but come on. As if Nicolas Cage's and his huge beaten-up-puppy eyes aren't enough, we get the single mother, whose screams are not only fake but also incredibly annoying. When the truck hit her car I just laughed out loud. That's also what I did after the ending titles started rolling.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a rather odd film. Even though I just expressed quite some criticism, I must be fair and admit that the special effects and the music in this film are spectacular. I'd also like to mention Nicolas Cage because his performance really wasn't bad. But in my opinion, it seems like he decided to put his serious career aside and just have some fun (doesn't really make him a bad actor… it's just sometimes his role choices seem as a waste of talent).<br/><br/>To sum up: I’d recommend this film for an evening with some friends, just to have some fun. But if you want a “serious sci-fi experience”- there are much better choices out there."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","6","1","3","12 January 2010"," A decent disaster prediction concept that tries too hard to be original
","The problem with ""Knowing"" is that it goes too far. It's a tough act to juggle so many overused story conventions such as decoding numbers, the apocalypse and the supernatural these days. Movies like ""Knowing"" have become almost a genre of their own thanks to Roland Emmerich and other disaster/end-of-the-world-predicting filmmakers. And with that comes expectations as well as a need for originality. What is supposed to set ""Knowing"" apart? Disaster shots? No; A protagonist trying to convince people he's not crazy though he can see the future? No; Nicholas Cage? Ahaha.<br/><br/>""Knowing"" tries a bit too hard to compensate for this lack of an original premise and the result is a plot riddled with holes. As talented as director Alex Proyas (""Dark City,"" ""I, Robot"") is with science fiction and blending sci-fi themes with commercially appealing techniques that please producers, he can only capture our attention for so long until we realize how disconnected and far-fetched all the story elements are.<br/><br/>I'll give the film a bit of credit for trying to piece together a message about family and knowing that the end is inevitable and how we struggle to decide whether we believe the events of our lives our connected or completely random, but it gets lost in film's lasting impression because of the absurdity of events. Cage plays an MIT astrophysics professor who discovers a list of numbers from the time capsule uncovered at his son's school. He discovers the numbers are the dates, locations and body counts for every major disaster from 1959 - 2009 and that includes some that have yet to happen.<br/><br/>The glitch here is that there's no actual justification for Cage to go running toward life- threatening disasters that he knows will happen. He is a single father with a young son who he promises (in sign language no less) that he will be with forever and ever. It's convenient for him to chase these events because otherwise there's barely any action or special effects, but it sets the film off on the wrong foot. <br/><br/>Conceived by an inexperienced Ryne Douglas Pearson who wrote the script in conjunction with ""Boogeyman"" writers Juliet Snowden and Stiles White, I supposed I shouldn't be shocked that the story plays out like M. Night Shyamalan meets ""The Day After Tomorrow"" meets ""Indiana Jones 4."" It certainly keeps your interest but when it's all done you realize they tried to make something work that didn't quite make any sense. Most blatantly, ""Knowing"" leaves its audience imagining too many hypotheticals.<br/><br/>Proyas ultimately gives ""Knowing"" half its competency. He has envisioned some pretty cool action sequences and found some way of pulling something resembling a theme out of this story that tries to make something original out of a premise inherently unoriginal. Without him, this film would be in the Nic Cage scrapheap along with ""Next"" and ""Bangkok Dangerous.""<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site http://moviemusereviews.com"
"jdkraus","8","1","3","27 December 2009"," Interesting and great...until the end
","I read Ebert's review on this movie, and he gave it four stars. He doesn't hand out four stars easily and neither do I, so I sat down and watched this movie to see how good it really is. For starters, I'll say that ""Knowing"" is not the typical science fiction film with big explosions and overwhelming CGI like much of this summer's blockbusters. It is a movie that draws a fine question: Is there a purpose to life or do things just randomly happen?<br/><br/>The performances are rock solid. Nicholas Cage takes on many odd roles and once again he proves himself to be very versatile as the depressed John Koesteller who's left alone with his estranged son Caleb (Chandler Canterbary), who starts having visions of the end of the world. A fifty-year mystery is unraveled at Caleb's school as he finds a piece of paper that has coded writings, which predict events that have happened in the past and in the incoming future. <br/><br/>I won't go too much further with the film's plot, because (a) it would ruin the film for those of you who haven't seen it and (b) it would take a book to try and explain it; Knowing is one of those film's that you have to see from start to finish to get the gist of. For the whole two hours, I was interested and wanted more when it ended.<br/><br/>The cinematography is beautiful, the editing is crisp, and Marco Beltrami's score adds depth of mystery, suspense, and beauty to the film. I'll also note that the visual effects are not overdone or overused. They look and feel real. But when I mention that I wanted more when the film ended, I wanted more plot and answers. <br/><br/>Now I hate to give too much of the ending away, but I have to say that I was very disappointed in it. In the last twenty minutes of the film, it felt that the screenwriters did not know what to go for in a good resolution as well as a point to the film. Was it a look at fate? Selflessly acting to save lives when gifted with special knowledge? Or finding faith, better late than never? <br/><br/>And since aliens were involved, who enabled a young girl to predict the next fifty years of disasters, yet stood idly by while such prophecies was wasted in a time capsule, providing no one with such knowledge? No one except one man, far too late to change anything at all, who would merely ""know"" that the end was too soon? What good was there in his knowing?<br/><br/>If the screenwriters had chosen a route regarding God and faith, it might have made sense. If they had stuck with a sci-fi view, with aliens, it might approach something like ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"", and made some sense. If they had merely wanted a commentary on fate, destiny, or another one of those ""the universe holds many mysteries"" interpretation, they could have worked with that too. Instead the resolution is meaningless disaster.<br/><br/>My point being is that the screenwriters could have worked something more interesting for an ending and a message. The movie was a great film, until the very end. Things are left unanswered, up to the audience to decide what the message is. I guess this works on some viewers, but in my opinion, when a filmmaker makes a sci-fi film, all knots need to be tied and there should be a point, even if it is as ridiculous as a Paul Verhoven film. My rating: ***/****"
"jonarim","7","1","3","26 December 2009"," Good movie but way too many questions left unanswered
","Spoiler Alert<br/><br/>I personally quite enjoyed the movie as it does change direction half way through the movie and keeps the audience guessing , whether this was intentional is open to debate. Certainly the reviewers here who believed they knew the ending after 10 mins, I think are conning themselves , they probably saw the trailer or heard it on the grapevine as clearly up to half way through the movie the audience is led to believe that Cage's character is clearly there to stop the disasters from happening or at least try to save some lives , the end of the world does not come into it at all.<br/><br/>The biggest problem that I had with the movie is that it simply leaves too many questions unanswered as to the point of various story lines within the movie and this is shown by the various different interpretations by other reviews.<br/><br/>I shall ignore the various ""believability"" of certain actions in the overall storyline as this is a sci fi movie so you will get loads of them e.g. cage just happens to spill his drink and highlight 9/11 but concentrate on the ones that need an explanation:- 1. What was'Lucinda role in this? Apart from the production of the numbers. She could hear the Angels so why was she not picked by the Angels to leave the planet? Why commit suicide, why did she live in the exact place the aliens were picking up the children, why did she never try to warn people of the disasters like Cage character did? 2. What was the role of the stones? They were clearly given to all the children that were to be rescued but what were there purpose? My guess is they were tracking devices , used by the aliens to track the children they wanted but we never find out or were they directional finders for the other children to know where to go? or where all the children kidnapped to get them to the correct location , if so what is the point of the numbers at all? 3. The numbers on the paper that Cage's character used to eventually work out where to go to save his son, was this their primary purpose or was it a fluke that he had the paper and his son just happened to be ""chosen"" at the same time.<br/><br/>4. When Rose died , Cage's character tried to explain to his son at the end that she had died , his son simply stated that she would be OK , how would she be OK , she was dead and why have the stone in her hand when she died , what was its significance? <br/><br/>Anyway any answers to these questions would be most welcome."
"gatsby601","2","1","3","8 December 2009"," Knowing It's A Dumb Movie
","Knowing is the latest Nicolas Cage film that seems to be following a theme that started with his National Treasure movies - an educated teacher discovering a great secret before time runs out. Sort of 'The Da Vinci Code' light.<br/><br/>This time out Cage is an MIT professor whose son is given a sealed envelope recently recovered from a 30 year old time capsule at the boys school. Unlike a drawing of a spaceship or some other 50s inspired doodle his letter is a series of numbers written by a child with a troubled past.<br/><br/>What follows is Cage deciphering the number pattern (rather easily) and racing to avoid disaster, save lives and warn the rest of us idiots who just won't listen.<br/><br/>This journey is o.k. as long as you don't take a moment and question the premise. Basically, if this child could see the future why didn't she tell someone at the time instead of locking the information away for 30 years? Maybe so Nick Cage could discover it in the future and for fill his destiny. But then, if 'the strangers' gave the little girl 'the knowing' in the first place why didn't they just clue in Cage directly instead of being needlessly elaborate? <br/><br/>I mention destiny because the films final act is very much about this subject. There is a plan for us all, can't escape our fate, cosmic order in the universe and all that sort of thing. Comforting on one level perhaps but it doesn't give Cages character much to do except keep an appointment and hug it out with his estranged father the pastor.<br/><br/>If you dig Nicolas Cage this will make a decent rental, there are explosions and the film doesn't run to long. Like the National Treasure movies however it aspires for a depth that just isn't there, it wants to be an insightful thinking mans adventure but in the end is little more then a shallow idea produced only as well as it needs to be."
"lndench-1","3","1","3","14 November 2009"," Pointless, ad hoc movie!
","Save your money and your time. This movie looks like it was written as it was filmed. Nicolas Cage has never been my favorite actor, but his movies were usually a 5 or so; Worth watching on pay-per-view if nothing better was on, but not worth the price and trouble of seeing them at a theater. However, this is a new low for Cage. I'm guessing that the plot and script were written on the fly as the picture was filmed, and then pasted together in the editing room to try to make some sense out of the material. Why, I asked myself, why so bad? Then I read about his current financial problems and realized that he's probably cranking out movies as fast as he can to stay ahead of the IRS and creditors, and regain his losses. Understandable, but a definite problem for the paying audience. Now, i just read he has 5 more movies (yes, five!!!) in the works for the next year!!! Come on, how can anyone possibly make 5 movies in 1 year and maintain any kind of quality? If this movie is a taste of what's coming up in the next 5, then you best go somewhere else for your theatrical entertainment."

","This movie was bad. The acting was terrible. Arguably the worst I've ever seen. And I say that having seen ""Shark Attack 3: Megolodon"". Nicholas Cage is pathetic, child actors are typically bad and these are worse, and the female lead is rancid.<br/><br/>I like Alex Proyas and the sci-fi concepts he tends to tackle, but this one is far from new and the way he approaches it is awful. Very little explanation where it's needed, implausible character behavior, and horrid tech babel.<br/><br/>Suggestions for things to do that would be a better use of your time: learn to wipe from back to front; find out how many licks it takes to get to the tootsie-roll center of a tootsie pop; kick a stranger's dog; buy property in the middle east; wed a step-sibling."

","All right, I didn't expect much. Nicholas Cage, lots of special effects, big ballyhoo... Intriguing premise, though. Actually, to be fair it started off okay (even if the Spooky Little Girl character has long become a bit of a cliché), not that bad at all. Sadly, about a quarter of the way through the movie blew a tyre and it was a rough, uncomfortable ride on down to the really, really bad ending. Think of a snowball rolling down a hill, only it's picking up garbage, not snow. Normally I'd just chalk a bad movie up to experience, but this one made me mad. The dialogue was banal, the special effects were anything but, and to put it nicely the storyline didn't bear close scrutiny. In fact it was mildly infuriating nonsense. By the time those angels-sorry-aliens Close-Encountered the kids and took them away to the Marvellous CGI Planet, I'd wanted my money back for well over an hour (BTW, just because something is two hours long, it doesn't make it an 'epic'. Just long). Nonsense. Bland, silly nonsense."

","The movie opens up in 1959 where these elementary student put a time capsule in the ground with one of the student who has this paper with numbers buried with it. And we cut about 50 yrs later the character played by Nicholas Cage finds the paper with the numbers after his son brings it back from the time capsule the elementary school decide to dig up. Than he finds out the number means something and goes about researching about it. It was just a boring film although the start is okay and you think the film with be more complex and deep but you will be very very disappointed. The couple of accidents that happen throughout was good with okay special effects but besides that the premise of the movie was crap. Maybe I expected too much cause Alex Proyas directed some great movies that I thoroughly enjoyed although he did the best he can with some crap material.<br/><br/>Read if you have seen the movie ***Spoilers below*** This film had potential cause the beginning was somewhat gripping. Than it just starts to get predictable, except maybe the ending cause I just didn't expect it to be shamefully ridiculous during the third act. It has to do with aliens and biblical stuff with the Garden of Eden, it's a mix of bible and Scientology. Basically the message is we screwed up the earth and only the chosen shall live on while the rest are pretty much screwed. What starts off as a decent science fiction film goes terribly wrong basically cause they needed a better screenwriter. Even for what starts out as something that is supernatural it's just unbelievable and plain down right bull crap. And at the end, when you see people stomping all over other to get what they want and even looting, you just feel the human race had it coming.<br/><br/>4.2/10"

","I'm afraid I have to side with those who found this really disappointing. As I watched the first two-thirds of this film I was really engaged. The premise is really fun. Cage is at his quirky best as he tries to juggle his obsession with his life, one that requires an equal share of attention. A brilliant man, he breaks through the puzzle left behind in the time capsule by the little girl. Unfortunately, the script fails us. Once again there are children who can hear voices and mysterious figures lurking in the woods. Once again, we have a religious kind of resolution. When this happens, what was a scientific movie with Cage breaking through becomes another one of those ""We are so small, we can't understand movies. There are also red herrings all over the place. What's the deal with those rocks other than to make us ask, ""What's the deal with those rocks?"" After I saw ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and read ""Childhood's End"" by Arthur C. Clarke, I've gotten the message. These are outstanding works of art. This new movie begins wonderfully and then becomes another rip-off of the same old same old."
"Otoboke","Null","1","3","22 September 2009"," Do the numbers add up? Well, no, they really don't.
","Teetering between genuinely thought-provoking science-fiction and largely innocuous disaster movie pomp and circumstance, Knowing, which comes from director Alex Proyas (The Crow and I, Robot) is an irksome and mostly disjointed affair. Dealing with characters, situations and plot lines that go a little beyond the usual scope of cinema while offering viewers an experience with the potential to thrill and surprise, this outing for Proyas inevitably crumbles under the weight of its own ambition which is disappointing. Indeed, while the script for the most part portrays its lead character in shades of sheer lunacy and insanity, the movie as a whole can be seen as being just as schizophrenic, if not more-so. It's indulgent, overlong and padded to the brim with needless contrivances, puzzling u-turns and banal digressions that have little or nothing to do with the central theme at hand. The result is a feature that sporadically entertains and even raises interesting questions and ideas from time to time, yet too often falls victim to its own verbose, directionless prophecy babble to the extent where all focus and engagement is lost. Knowing certainly has potential, and this is evident in several startling scenes visceral and sensual, but such potential is never truly tapped or expanded upon. So the viewer is left to squander amongst the ruins of half-finished ideas, disjointed themes and a lacklustre, unconvincing narrative that binds it all together with a sense of bemusement at everything that transpires—sure, it's pretty unnerving and it's definitely got a sense of audacity about it that Nicholas Cage seems to seep out of everything he touches these days, but as a whole is it any good? Do the numbers add up? Well, no, they really don't.<br/><br/>For all intents and purposes, despite the movie's attempts to fool the viewer during the first two acts, Knowing is first and foremost a disaster movie. Taking place in our current day, some six months down the line after a astrophysicist named John (Nicholas Cage) comes into possession of a series of numbers written down and placed in a time capsule by a crazy kid fifty years prior which predict disasters from that date onwards, Knowing is a disaster movie in every sense. What perhaps could have made the feature a little more convincing and interesting on a visceral or cerebral level however was if it spent as much time expanding upon the ideas of determinism, causality and the eventual allegorical outcome that permeates the whole of the film in retrospect. Instead however, much of the movie resorts to mundane fabrications set up for the sake of giving the audience those big disaster movie CG shots—train wrecks, plane crashes, you know what the deal is. To be fair, Knowing pulls off these moments as good as anything else out there today, but in the end they all feel like inconsequential distractions or derailments from what the script is really trying to say.<br/><br/>Taking the theme of predestination and running with it to the extent where Stan Lee's infamous ""with great power comes great responsibility"" came running through my head, the character of John reveals why Nicholas Cage was picked for the job. For the better part of the middle section, John takes it upon himself to try and solve this mystery of numbers predicting dates, numbers of people dead and locations in order to prevent the inevitable. At one point he even estimates that had he been granted this ""window into the future"" sooner, he could have prevented his wife's death (and in turn also killed one of the movie's biggest clichés next to the distant family, lone, gifted son and the mysterious Strangers in the Woods) without giving one second of thought to the complete stupidity of such a concept and irrevocable implications involved with determinism that he flaunts so glibly during the movie's opening act. Sure, you can't blame a guy for getting a little crazy when faced with a possible End-of-the-World scenario, but at the same time you also have to seriously question the plausibility to all that goes on in the twisted world of Knowing when it so obviously and excessively wants you to believe in its tale.<br/><br/>The problem however, is that the script is a meandering mess devoid of any sense of compelling pace, or interesting elaboration on anything that it raises in the wreckage that it so ceaselessly creates. The resulting world isn't one that feels like ours, and so the whole disaster element of the movie feels contrived and irrelevant. Furthermore, there isn't much else to say for the ensemble of performances here outside of the fact that they downright stink. Cage, who to be fair isn't known for his humanist shades, is wooden and largely uninteresting as the movie's protagonist-trying-to-save-the-day-whilst-being-a-single-dad cutout. His co-stars are just as blasé and awkward, echoing last year's similar—but much more effective and stylistically distant—disaster romp The Happening in a way that only goes to further the movie's schizophrenic, somewhat alien nature. So in the end we come down to the most tired and truest of cinematic criticisms—if I can't relate to these people, if I can't believe in their plight then what else do I have but some nice looking photographs and a loose form of narrative tying it all together? For some, this will be enough. The fact that the movie takes the whole disaster thing and runs with it to the very end in a coherent fashion is one of the only saving graces here, yet science fiction fans and people just a little tired of these overlong, over-produced distractions will find no real joy here.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"

","After reading some peoples comments and ratings, it really does annoy me when people rate a film so low just because they don't understand it.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film because it tackles a subject which I have enjoyed to read about and debate with friends. How humans began life on this planet. It mixes this great theory and storytelling with some really good action scenes. Personally the plane crash was quite touching when the plane went over the road (I think they could have improved the latter stages of the scene where Cage runs into the wreckage), It felt quite shocking. There was also some quite decent suspense scenes which reminded me of a classic horror film. Rather than rely on effects or too many jumps to scare people, it creates atmosphere which is what a lot of modern films miss.<br/><br/>I've seen some people who have commented who clearly didn't understand the whole premise of the film. That is no reason to give this film a 1 or a 2 rating. I would suggest reading chariots of the gods by Erich Von Daniken. You may appreciate this film a little more then."
"denisvn93-1","8","1","3","14 September 2009"," The disaster movie we have been waiting for!
","Knowing is a movie about a professor, John Koestler, trying to find out the truth and preventing the grim future from happening that a sheet of numbers has predicted. How many ways can Nic Cage screw this up? Many. But here he has proved otherwise.<br/><br/>ACTING: Nicolas Cage is fantastic in this film. I'm so glad that the wooden delivery of lines from him as the Ghost Rider has gone. Here, he clearly shows every aspect of a troubled individual: the limited happiness, the grief at the loss of his wife and the intensity as he tries to discover what the numbers are telling him. Rose Byrne does not do much here, I was anticipate for more from her but that aside, she works. I love it how she really shows uneasiness mix with confusion only by her eyes and her display of near-nausea. Chandler Canterbury again proves that child actors are sometimes even better than the older ones!. Deeply disappointed at his father's dullness after the death of his mom, absolutely rebellious when his father (typically) hides the truth from him or being very desperate when a choice of his cannot be made at a key moment in the movie. Sounds like a lot of emotions for one person to show, but Chandler, as Caleb, does it all. Overall, Knowing has assembled a wonderful cast.<br/><br/>DIRECTION: I can't say a lot about Alex Proyas as I don't follow him back to the days of The Crow or Dark City. The only movie of him I last watched was I, Robot - and that was reported terribly butchered by Fox Studio's genius Tom Rothman. However, seeing that his past movies have a cult following, I guess it is safe for me to say that he is good. He makes the audience aware that something threatening is afoot and creates a satisfying answer to the question that is at the top of viewers' heads. For example, in I, Robot, the culprit was within the company and the murderer of Dr. Lanning was right next to our main characters. Knowing does that again, with a satisfying cause as to why the alien wants to whisper into our characters' heads.<br/><br/>Alex Proyas has made Knowing perfect by injecting it with a bit of reality. Besides creating all those common feelings, moods and actions found in a family at loss, Mr. Proyas also shows our, usual, ignorance to our older generations in the family. With that, he has made Knowing a movie that is very human. <br/><br/>Now, I love silence because that is what (to me) makes a scene memorable and has a scarring effect. Mr. Proyas offers plenty of them here after a pivotal sequence in the movie and that just stops your breath (or opens your eyes...and mouths) as soon as it is over. As a result, Knowing offers a magical display of Hollywood cinema. <br/><br/>MUSIC: I absolutely love Marco Beltrami's score in I, Robot and I found it flawless in every way. Fast-paced, strong and epic - he offers what an action movie demands for its music. Knowing is on another area though and Mr. Beltrami again, operates things without using massive effort. From the intro, the man begins slow (with light brasses and sparse drumming) but effectively creates a stressful and tense atmosphere - just like what the viewers are about to see as the story unfolds. What is even more lovely is that there are no music during the disaster sequences and that brings forth the realism to Knowing. There are parts, however, where the music just falls apart. Especially when trumpets are used to emphasize the scale of one thing, they blare loudly and seem to make these moments hokey-pokey rather than eerie or suspenseful. 7 out of 10 for this. One suggestion for Mr. Beltrami: stay away from the brasses.<br/><br/>CINEMATOGRAPHY: Everyone knows that I, Robot was a photography delight, offering viewers angles that are dynamic and unique. Simon Duggan's skills work again in this movie, albeit like a reviewer said along the lines of ""more technical rather than artistic"". This is true since Knowing uses the REDOne camera, which is the hot new technology for photographers right now. Of course, Mr. Duggan really shows the audience the power of the REDOne, with trailing shots that are long yet super smooth and skillful documentary-ish movements to reveal the camera's flexibility (the plane crash sequence comes to mind). A job well done, that is all I can say.<br/><br/>VISUAL EFFECTS: One word: unbelievable. Nothing looks fake in here and for every shot with CGI is a beautiful shot. The Earth at night when you first see it, the disaster sequences or even the big reveal - the effects crew has accomplished in making you wanting to cover your ears when that hulking plane arrives, close your eyes when the subway jumps the track and make you sweat at the intense heat of a forest fire on- screen. Effects effective?<br/><br/>In general, Knowing is one of those rare perfect films that Hollywood has produced recently, so I suggest everyone to get it while it is still hot. This is a movie where its job is not only to entertain, but to get you thinking about it later on. An awesome film of 2009.<br/><br/>P.S. Knowing provides me a reason to NOT study Maths in future.<br/><br/>From Vietnam, Denisvn93-1"

","""Knowing"" starts out interestingly for about the first 25 min of it's runtime or so, and has some finale fireworks as a big spectacle. Too bad the meat of the movie is more or less vapid. The story doesn't dig deep enough - it's under-developed and ultimately superficial. Applying logic to a fantasy/apocalyptic movie is sort of a contradiction in terms, but the movie needs some heavy thought and editing obviously. For instance (SPOILERS) a completely ludicrous scene of Cage running toward a newly crashed airliner staring at burning people and exploding engines while not saying a word is beyond far-fetched. Or how about the cob-webbed cliché of characters deciding to go to dark spooky places during night-time...why?...Just because. And What really did it for me was the use of ""EE"", as if those who communicate in the future must be able to text on their blackberry's and iphones. This movie has some interesting premises, but needs better script and dialog as well as acting. I liked Rose Byrne in WickerPark, but she's pretty poor in this movie - and that seems more on the director and script than she herself. Nicholas Cage is pretty much going through the motions while both child-actors seem to be reading from a script-board off-camera. The finale scenes showed some interesting imagery and creativity - not enough to save the ridiculous and dullness that preceded it. Maybe worth a rental for the effort. Nice try...."
"Kanadian1","5","1","3","24 August 2009"," Knowing is a total let down
","After the first half, I almost turned this off. Completely stupid. Like other commenters said, it was full of holes. Just dumb.<br/><br/>Save your money. I downloaded it illegally, so at least I only wasted time and not money.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage used to do good movies. Not lately. The special effects in this looked like a cartoon. At the beginning I actually thought it was going to be a good, kind of freakishly thrilling flick. But as soon as aliens entered the picture, it became a waste of time. I have nothing against sci-fi, or a good alien movie. But the entire premise of this movie started out as a sort of thriller. It would be like a movie that's half sports and half foreign film. Not a mix. A complete switch right in the middle. Made no sense."

","'Knowing' offers a lot more than it actually delivers. <br/><br/>The action scenes sure are great - both two mass disasters pictured in the movie is realistic, dynamic and enthralling. These two scenes are the very peaks of the movie, because the plot revolving around the disaster events are not much more than rubbish.<br/><br/>Three story lines we have here, offering all kinds of exciting events, like the aforementioned disasters, numerology, foresight, Apocalypse, weird men chasing children, and some mistycal Genesis/aliens combo. Really a lot to keep one nailed to the chair watching the movie. <br/><br/>Dozens before me have bashed the ending, claiming various religions to inspired it and that it was a cliché at best. But the problem is not here. With the ending it becomes clear that the three story lines do not merge together at all. Characters and events are thrown in this mix to make the story seem like it does mean something. It does not."

"BeauEvil","8","1","3","1 August 2009"," Science AND religion!
","I'm buying this in Blu-Ray! I never expected to be so taken by this movie. Usually, everyone is all atwitter about any big budget movie with deep messages. I never heard a peep about ""Knowing"". I heard about the new ""War of the Worlds"", but this movie is much better.<br/><br/>When I saw that this was classified as a sci-fi, but that the plot was about prophecy, I rolled my eyes. I guessed that this was another example of dumbing down science, tying science to nonsense. Nothing could be farther from the truth.<br/><br/>I take exception with the many negative comments found here. Maybe some miss the sci-fi angles. For example, the transmitted number sequences are NOT ""prophecies"", in the sense of foretelling the future, predestined ""fate"", if the ""whisper people"" travel time as well as space. They ""know"" what has happened. This idea is left unstated. However, time travel is more reasonable than divining predestined fate.<br/><br/>Many can't stand the ending. Every story shouldn't have a fairy tale ending, for everyone in the story that is. In fact, THIS story DOES have a fairy tale ending, of a sort, the very best it could have. ""We"" are saved! The ""Earth"" is saved! There is plenty left unstated in the film. For example, several Bible tie-ins (and less-specific ""prophecies"", permitting non-Christian perspective) point to the revealed ""angels"" at the end. Unless one is familiar with the suggestion of ""angels"" of the Old Testament, ""flying"", in ""glowing, white clothing"" actually being visiting spacemen, the quick, significant scene of the aliens levitating with glowing streamers around them might be overlooked. Rabbits aboard, and deer in the area, strongly hints that the ""vessels"" (for lack of a better word) are ""Noah's Ark"" for all life on our little blue planet.<br/><br/>""Knowing"" bridges the ever-widening gap between religion and science because it provides a way that prophets of old could have witnessed the same ""whisper people"" in their time. If a good magician from our time could totally baffle some poor shepherds 3,000 years ago, imagine how these super-science ""angels"" (""messengers"") could spawn whole new religions by ""flying"", healing, raising the ""dead"", or whispering prophecies. Zealots could even argue that, perhaps due to supposed increasing wickedness today, the whisper people are REAL Angels and God is purging the Earth again, another Genesis story.<br/><br/>There is an expectation, that ""super-science"" (science yet beyond our present knowledge) might someday turn our present understanding on its ear. ""Use the Force, Luke"" will remain a fantasy, but ""anti-gavity"" will, almost certainly, be a fact someday. It is best to leave the details of super-science fuzzy and mysterious, as done here. I applaud the filmmakers for not falling into the (overdone) shortcut of Star Trek transporters or Stargates as an (unlikely) cheat to move things around.<br/><br/>However, I was quite disappointed that these weird aliens were, not just bipedal quadrupeds, with a brain and heart in exactly the ""right"" places, but were an exact silhouette of an Earth man. This could have been done better. The effects were VERY well done."

","There has been many a movie about people discovering important clues in seemingly random topics: ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""The Number 23"" are examples. Now, director Alex Proyas (""The Crow"", ""Dark City"", ""I, Robot"") brings us ""Knowing"". Nicolas Cage plays a college professor who lost his wife a year earlier. In his MIT class, he teaches students about randomness (things just happen) vs determinism (everything happens for a reason).<br/><br/>When a time capsule gets opened, his son finds a strange paper written by a girl fifty years earlier. While at first looking like a bunch of arbitrary numerals, he realizes that it shows the dates of famous disasters and the fatalities therein. Sure enough, it starts to look as if this relates to him.<br/><br/>I found most of the movie intriguing - I've never come across any series of numbers (anything else) that looks like what the flick portrays - although it seemed as if the end got kind of religious. If you ignore that part, the rest of the movie is pretty enjoyable (although I still consider ""The Crow"" Proyas's best movie). Just pay attention the next time that you see a list of things."
"sdlitvin","5","1","3","26 July 2009"," Starts out great, then decomposes later
","The best part of ""Knowing"" was the first part: In 1959, a schoolgirl seems to be hearing voices. They command her to ask her teacher to create a time capsule (good thing the school principal said yes), and to write down a series of numbers and put them into the time capsule (good thing the teacher said yes). This part is creepy, gripping, and suspenseful--we're waiting to find out what this all means, and what happens when the time capsule is eventually unearthed.<br/><br/>Fast forward to 2009, when it's unearthed. A schoolboy gets a hold of the numbers. His astrophysicist father (played by Nicholas Cage) figures out what the numbers mean--they're references to all the disasters that will have taken place since 1959. Too bad this list of disasters didn't include the second half of this movie.<br/><br/>Because as the plot moves forward past this point, it gets extremely jumbled, with plot elements that are introduced and seem important (like the camera keeps focusing on them), but are never explained. There are too many plot holes to list here. And the connection between the sci-fi elements and the obvious Christianity allusions seems weak; it's as if the producers started out with a straightforward sci-fi/thriller plot, and then decided to overlay Christianity on top of it.<br/><br/>Also, the plot seems far too derivative; it is reminiscent of ""The DaVinci Code,"" ""Signs,"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" with even some ""Chariots of the Gods"" stuff thrown in.<br/><br/>The acting is mediocre; Nicolas Cage seems miscast as the astrophysicist plunged into mysticism and horror; and there isn't much chemistry between the characters.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Knowing"" was a disappointment. It's as if the producers had exactly one good idea--the premise of the numbers placed by the schoolgirl in the time capsule--but didn't know quite what to do with it."

","I found this to be one of Nick Cage's poorer films. <br/><br/>The storyline has great potential and the beginning is promising. The middle adds to the expectation, but then the ending becomes so transparently obvious and is, therefore, a real anti-climax.<br/><br/>Some of the number deciphering did not have any real method to it, which marred the plot somewhat. I know one has to suspend belief for such films, but not to the extent that the decoding was totally random.<br/><br/>I do not think I have been disappointed in any of Cage's other films that I have watched.

","Most of the comments here on IMDb already make clear that which I wish to comment about the movie itself, I got more to add, i will spear you, because that would be mostly about basic mistakes in film making. What i really wish to comment upon is the subject of this movie as such, especially after having watched the special feature that came with the DVD trying to tackle the subject of the coming Apocalypse. I thought the feature would have been a hell of a lot better, or at least it promised to be so at the beginning, maybe when it spoke of what we have learned from the past, but not the future. it was way too magical, and mystical. What i wish to point out is that when the dinosaurs seized to exist, it did not mean that life on earth seized to exist. Eventually we came along, there was us, humans. however it does not mean that we are anymore important then the dinosaurs were. At some point there was an amoeba which evolved into the frog and eventually that frog, maybe to attract a mate gave out its first croak, but just like that frog had no concept that its croak would eventually evolve into all the languages of the world, with Shakespeare and Dostoevsky and what not, then neither can we possibly conceive whats to come. We might know a lot, achieved a lot, but in contrast with the universe we might be no greater then that cow that thinks it very smart to chew on some grass, we are just a crap idea.

","Don't have high expectations for this sci-fi thriller that is Knowing. Nicolas Cage leads the cast and his acting is truly terrible. He adds no character into his character, making his performance totally forgettable.<br/><br/>The film starts off extremely well in 1959 where a 6-year-old girl Lucinda Embry predicts the dates and locations as to where disasters occur. After this flashback and the burial of the time capsule, things start to descend, especially when we introduced to Nicolas Cage's character John and his son Caleb. <br/><br/>Later on, things get good when a plane crashes on a freeway and 81 people die, as predicted and just after, a truly spectacular train collision (the effects are amazing) <br/><br/>Rose Byrne's performance as Lucinda's daughter Diana is great, as she is quite troubled and her death in an horrific car crash as predicted is handled well.<br/><br/>With the annoying side plot involving 'The Strangers' that Caleb and Diana's daughter Abby comes across, things get rather boring, especially the long dreadful ending when Caleb and Abby are sent off to space.<br/><br/>The 3 most annoying things about Knowing are: 1. The ridiculously long running time. 115 minutes - could be cut down to 90. 2. Nicolas Cage's awful, dreadful performance as troubled John. 3. The END. Whilst the whole bombing of the entire world is good, the long ending with Caleb and Andy getting taken away to space by 'The Strangers' is very frustrating.<br/><br/>The film deserves the benefit of the doubt. The effects are magnificent, the plot is good then gets bad, the acting's okay, but the film's running time and the sub-plot get really annoying after a while."

"overcranked","5","1","3","15 July 2009"," Mildly Entertained
","I didn't expect much going into Knowing—just something to keep me reasonably entertained for a few hours while I stuffed my face with overpriced popcorn—but even the big screen special effects couldn't save a movie as hopelessly absurd as Knowing.<br/><br/>John Koestler (Nicolas Cage), an MIT physics professor, comes into the possession of a paper which contains the dates and locations of every major disaster in the last fifty years. Koestler discovers that the paper, retrieved from a fifty year old time capsule, also makes predictions of major disasters to come, and he attempts in vain to convince those around him that the fate of the entire planet is at stake. The premise, while a bit outlandish, is not so ridiculous for a sci-fi flick, but the unbelievably sloppy movie-making that follows is such a major disaster that one wonders how the director and writers did not predict it, or, for that matter, divert it.<br/><br/>The first two acts of the movie are only mildly entertaining, while seriously lacking in substance. One knows exactly where the storyline is heading, so the only thing that really keeps the movie going is the special effects sequences that occur when John Koestler witnesses the disasters predicted by the paper. Unfortunately, the special effects are hardly enough to keep one absorbed in the movie, let alone keep the whole movie afloat. While at times the CG is shockingly realistic, for the most part it is extremely overdone and unnecessarily violent, which ultimately adds to the strange clumsiness of the storyline. The acting throughout the movie leaves something to be desired, the dialogue was truly appalling, and as the whole film drudges on, more and more characters are introduced but never adequately developed.<br/><br/>The third act is where the movie really takes a turn for the worse as the cheesy sci-fi/fantasy elements of the movie (mysterious men in black trench coats, children hearing whispers, etc) take center stage. The pace of the movie picks up, but the plot becomes utterly ridiculous—something that seems inevitable in a movie that predicts the destruction of the entire planet. The movie is insulting in its stupidity, and it is unclear whether the key to avoiding the imminent global apocalypse (discovered in an abandoned trailer home, mind you) is natural, supernatural, or extraterrestrial. And if the story isn't muddled enough to make you shudder, the movie's execution is just as appalling. The third act of the movie revolves around car chases, magical unexplained rocks, and aliens—wait, no, angels— oh, I don't know. It was unbelievable what the writers were willing to do to make the pieces of their puzzle fit, resorting at one point to killing off a character in the most frivolous way.<br/><br/>The end of the movie was the crescendo of the absurdity, and one has to give credit to the CG animators for attempting to craft a scene as unbelievably senseless and laughable as the conclusion itself. It's hard to really describe how awful this movie is without spoiling the 'plot' or discussing events in detail... You just have to use your imagination—or watch the movie for yourself.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Knowing made the mistake of taking its own subject matter too seriously, when no intelligent person could do the same. And so my one regret about this movie-watching experience is that I didn't see the comically awful movie Next (starring Nicolas Cage) until a few months later—or else I would have had an uproariously good laugh at the expense of Knowing's creators.<br/><br/>Written by Anton for www.overcranked.net"

"M&J","9","1","3","12 July 2009"," Sci-Faith Flick That I Liked
","SPOILERS First off, the director of this movie also did a little flick called Dark City in 1998. That movie never hit it big in the box office but became a huge cult classic in rental stores among sci-fi fans, and rightly so. In that movie, director Alex Proyas presents the audience with a gripping, intriguing yet pretty standard hitchcockian thriller for the first part of the movie. Then, blam! Aliens! The entire city is located in space! The hero has psychic powers? And the prophecies, oh the prophecies! Knowing has a lot of similarities to Dark City. First off, the sun plays an important part in both flicks. Knowing, like Dark City, starts off as a gripping and thoroughly spooky thriller. The first time I saw the ""whispering people"", I got chills. The mystery of the numbers had me glued to the screen. Then the disasters started--and I have to say, they use some of the most realistic special effects I've ever seen on film. They were horrifying, and simultaneously beautiful to watch--and they had a purpose. Without them, the main character would not have the motivation he needed to complete his character arc.<br/><br/>Then the aliens are revealed. Strange, disconcerting, out of left field--all this is true, but then again, that's the point! All of this was also true of Dark City and the sci-fans all liked that twist. Here, people think its jumping the shark? The only thing I can think of is that the special effects are so good in Knowing, that sci-fi fans blame the studio or re-writes or big budget bloating for the alien ending. Meanwhile the same twists in Dark City were pulled off on a smaller budget, and everyone thought it was genius.<br/><br/>Unlike Dark City, this movie deals with faith, predetermination, and religion. This may of turned off a lot of people in on both sides of the religion fence. Science minded people may have resented the role of religion in the film, and religious people may have resented the inference that the four horsemen of the apocalypse were aliens, and that the aliens looked like they had halos and angel wings. I didn't mind the blending of science and religion, which is why I feel I could better appreciate the film.<br/><br/>The inevitable final disaster was absolutely flooring, and again, the cinematography and special effects were stunning. It conjured up references to Superman and the end of Krypton--or of the 1950's classic, When Worlds Collide.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was simply fantastic. It plot wasn't standard by any sense of the word, and that may have upset some folks. It's a journey, that's for sure. But I, personally, enjoyed the journey. 9/10 (better than 90% of sci-fi out there: better than Indiana Jones IV's alien ending, better than Star Wars Episode I, way better than the directors other flick--I Robot, better than day V for Vendetta, Better than Cloverfield)"
"robertbrown798","7","1","3","11 July 2009"," I think a lot of folks don't understand the point of the #'s
","The point of him getting the numbers is not to save the world or even save lives (sans his son's). The point of him getting the numbers was to ensure he would believe the prophecy by showing him validity of the predictions with proof of past events so he would make sure his son was at the right place at the right time. I don't understand why people are having a hard time understanding this. If he was meant to save people why would the number of victims be listed with each disaster? I think it would have to be a little more open ended by not listing the number of dead to allow for him to save lives. The deaths were set in stone and nothing he could do would change that. Get it?7 Also everyone that is questioning the way the aliens communicated whether it was by voices or by the stones is being kind of silly. How do we know how an advanced alien life form may try to communicate with us? As for everything else, every time I see a Cage movie since the amazing ""Raising Arizona"" I dislike him a little bit more. Everything is so forced with him, in fact I don't think any of the acting was very good in this. Other things in the movie irritated me as well. The scene when they were going to the museum they pulled into the garage of a hotel/mall (I actually remember when it was built as I grew up a literal 3 streets over) and there is no museum such as the one shown in the movie in Boston. I usually love it when the show my home town in movies and they did an okay job with it, but not great. I also think Cage's character did a lot of wasting time in the film. For example: when he calls his estrange father. Why do it in the yard when you could be doing it from the road? If you know for a fact that there isn't much time left don't you think you would be using it a little more wisely? There were a lot of religious undertones but that is to be expected in a move depicting the apocalypse, why people are surprised or offended by this is beyond me. As disturbing as the final outcome of the planet was, I applaud the makers for not sugar coating it with some unrealistic solution to the flares."

Yet, even with this talent, the curse or gift can become a nuisance as it's also called The Cassandra Complex. It states, even if you can tell people the future, few will believe you.

At first he dismisses it, but then discovers it's terrible secret. With his troubled son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) they try to fathom the paper's ultimate prediction. With the power of a gifted Thespian, Cage give a riveting performance and throughout the film, the audience is drawn into his fanatic and desperate race to safeguard his son and the rest of humanity.

"wzevonfan","3","1","3","11 July 2009"," Knowing is not very good.
","The first 20 minutes of this film are commendable. There is no time wasted on unnecessary dialogue, and as much as I hate Nicholas Cage and his performance, I still think that the beginning of the film showed promise. As we watch the little girl Lucinda fervently scribble this ominous sequence of numbers, we sit there, knowing (no pun intended) that they hold significance. But precisely what...and more interestingly, why? Fast forward to fifty years later, and we meet an emaciated looking Cage; an MIT astrophysics professor who had lost his wife in a fire and now lives alone with his son. They are obviously both lonely. Cage drinks to forget his past, and his son watches home videos of his mother to help him sleep at night, but neither can find complete solace in their methods. Cage feels he is not yet ready to move on from his loss and meet another woman. In moments of depravity he often forgets to pick his son up from school. In this particular instance at the beginning of the film, he arrives to his son's school late. Today, they are opening up the time capsule from 50 years ago, and Cage's son Caleb happens to get Lucindas number page, his earpiece ringing and clicking as he takes the envelope from the teacher. That is where things start to go downhill. Cage discovers and ""decodes"" the sequence that very night, maybe two hours after his son brings it home. Too fast for my liking, which means the other hour and a half of the film will be spent on extra ""filler"" ; new plot devices and characters. Agh...they had a good thing going. Case and point; the aliens, and Lucinda's daughter, and Cage's sister, and the black stones, and etc. The film does not delve into why Lucinda knew the numbers, why it was Cage who discovered them, and if these things are in fact inevitable and sequential (as Cage explains in one of his seminars), or changeable. Is Cage enabling these events or preventing them through his intervention? Well, we never find out. Instead, they show us aliens. Bravo, really.<br/><br/>If you want to see a film with the same idea, watch Signs, which is so much better I cannot even begin to understand why it has such a low rating on this site, nevertheless why Knowing has such a high one. Far more crafty and well acted, Signs has all the elements this film has and more, without all that clutter and silly spectacle."

","I liked the movie. It had lots of intrigue, great special effects, and good deal of action. That being said, I did not understand the premise.<br/><br/>Aliens apparently left coded warnings of future disasters by encoding them in the brain of a school girl who scrawled them on a note to be left in a time capsule in 1953. The time capsule was not to be opened for 50 years. Yet almost all of the predictions were for catastrophes that took place before the opening. What was the point of that? If it was simply to validate the code, then what was the point of predicting the end of everything when nobody could do anything to stop it anyway? <br/><br/>The aliens obviously knew well in advance what was going to happen, down to the exact time and location. They had already implanted a homing beacon, so to speak, in many of Earth's children. They really didn't need the coded predictions, which is what almost the entire movie is based around.

Most of his movies have endings which you either love or despise. And much like a Shyamalan film, there is an underlying mystery mixed with a sense of where the hell is this film going. And again, much like a Shyamalan film, there is a delicious (or disgusting depending on your taste) dose of pretentious nonsense.<br/><br/>But this is an Alex Proyas film and he stamps his signature all over it visually, and as with his previous work like Dark City, he keeps you guessing and directs the narrative with flair. Nicolas Cage is at his Cagey best, slurring his dialogue and drooping his face like only Cage can. The little boy who plays his son is fine until he shows intense emotions but hey, he's a kid and I trust, you as a viewer, will not be taking all this nonsense seriously now, will you? You'll have fun with this movie and you'll have a great time discussing with your movie loving buddies why you hate or love the ending.<br/><br/>Because of the similarity of this film and Shyamalan's movies in terms of structure and twisty narratives, I'm guessing you will love this if you are a Shyamalan or Alex Proyas fan. If you hate their output, I'm guessing you'll hate this film too.<br/><br/>Me, I love it."
"drewfamilyman","7","1","3","9 July 2009"," Pretty good movie
","I like good movies, and I'm not saying this movie was one of the best I have seen, but instead I will say it's still worth seeing. Everyone seems to be harping over the ending, but to make the move out like it had three parts, or it was put together by three different people is ridicules.<br/><br/>(HERE ARE MY SPOILER SECTIONS) <br/><br/>The bottom line is that a girl puts numbers onto a piece of paper, then into a time capsule for fifty years, but before that happens, you are made aware that she hears voices in her head. Now flash forward fifty years, and you're in the back yard of John Koestlers' while he is looking through his telescope with his son, and they start talking about the probability of life on other planets. At the unveiling of the time capsule, John's son is seen looking at a guy staring at him from a distance while he hears voices in his head. The number's turn out to not be random, and so begins the knowing part of the movie, and John realizing what the number's mean. The ending involves aliens taking children away while the world is being destroyed. It turns out that the aliens knew our planet was going to be destroyed.<br/><br/>I don't see how the aliens should have been a surprise to anyone unless they thought the voices were really ghosts talking to the girl in the beginning, then talking to John's son later in the movie. Had there been ghosts instead of aliens, then this would not haven labeled a SCI-FI movie.<br/><br/>I give Knowing 7 stars, and I will say anymore is too much, and any less isn't fair. I think the 1 star people were not paying attention, and had they been paying attention, then they may have known that aliens may be involved in this SCI-FI movie."

","I will give credit for decent direction, photography, and an interesting premise. However, the premise is somewhat moot in that most of the events happen with the time capsule buried, with only 3 remaining (and resting on the chance that a drunk guy would leave a Scotch ring right where it counts.) The kid was vapid, almost as expressive as the kid in Superman Returns. And I had a hard time understanding what either of them said half the time.<br/><br/>I started to see the religious overtones when Nick Cage was proposing his idea to the other guy, and the other guy says ""You need to ignore all this and start thinking like a scientist."" and Cage agrees! Hello? A scientist would be intrigued by the possibility that something was there and pursue it intensely.<br/><br/>If there was any other movie besides A.I.:Artificial Intelligence that falls apart in the last act, this one is it. The ""angelians"" even looked similar. It was subtle, but you could even see ephemeral wings when they moved around.<br/><br/>What was the point of Caleb writing a new set of numbers (and his dad taking it away before he was finished, like the girl's teacher did)?

This is a powerful, compelling and endlessly suspenseful film that feels like something out of Shyamalan's glory days. <br/><br/>The film-makers clearly really cared for the story they were telling and allow it to live up to its initial premise in unexpected ways. It's not just a blockbuster. It's original, and it takes risks, and they pay off.<br/><br/>The score was also particularly good, one of the more notable and tangible ones I've seen in recent film. <br/><br/>Proyas, Cage, and the writers all did a really good job, and I highly recommend seeing this. 9/10."

","I loved this movie. I don't see what everyones problem is. Just because it deals with some Christian beliefs, maybe some Scientology doctrines added in for good measure, take it for what it is. It is not preaching to you, it is not all about God, and creation, it's about a threat to the world. I won't go any further about that, because I don't want to spoil it for people.<br/><br/>But please, give this movie a chance. Don't go into it thinking that it will be like every other disaster movie you see, this one actually requires a bit of knowledge of some prophecy (set out in the bible - no I'm not preaching) to really get some of it, but even if you don't know anything about the bible, you should enjoy this movie for what it is. The is definitely not a movie for a date night. Unless your both into impending doom movies, but this is an excellent movie all around.<br/><br/>Parts of it really got me on the edge of my seat, and the music that goes with it at those tense times really help build it up. Some scary parts, just because you don't know whats going to happen, where the men in black (no not Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones Men In Black), but other men in black appear, and they are genuinely creepy looking.<br/><br/>Love this movie, love it love it love it. I didn't want it to end at the end of 2 hours. I could have gladly watched another hour or so.<br/><br/>The only silly part in it was when the plane crashed, someone who was on fire was running past Nicholas Cage, and Nic was like, ""Hey-HEY"", trying to ask them a question from the looks of it.. I mean the guys on fire, he's not going to talk to you.... But apart from that one particular line in the movie, it was AWESOME!!!"
"tburke85","6","1","3","8 July 2009"," Knowing A Decent Sci-Fi Apocalyptic Thriller With Flaws
","Knowing is a decent sci-fi apocalyptic thriller with flaws from director Alex Proyas whose admirable in making this movie giving audiences some suspense, cool special effects, and well paced intense realistic disaster sequences. A slow pace however, unanswered questions, the lack of character development, and the ending is what weighed it down the most. Nicolas Cage is okay as the main character John Koelster but this isn't his best performance. No offense. If you want to see a good Nic Cage movie I suggest you watch Con Air, Face Off, or Leaving Las Vegas. Rose Byrne does what she can with her small role but her character isn't really developed because most of the focus is on Cage. The rest of the relatively unknown are decent but none one stands out. The movie starts off good because it's weird, different, and there is some suspense but there could've been more. The mysterious men in black were effective in their very limited screen time but they could have been more developed. The disaster sequences are well executed and intense because they look at least for the most part very realistic. The same can go for the special effects which may not be spectacular but they're effective none the less. The film does leave many questions unanswered that I'm not even going to get into because it would take me forever and the ending does sort of reveal some secrets but the conclusion wasn't the greatest. I can see that there might be some message with the way it ends but if they had changed the ending and improved some of the other things that weighed the movie down I probably would have enjoyed it more than I did. Overall despite some flaws though Knowing is a so-so sci-fi apocalyptic thriller with intense disaster sequences, some suspense, a few surprises, and decent performances by the cast but it could have been better."

I was expected some revelation on that front, sci-fi style, but it was unfortunate that the ending had to be so dry and disappointing.<br/><br/>A good role by an old Nic Cage (he's been my favorite for a while now), but I guess even he was beaten blue by the poor writing (for the ending).<br/><br/>My suggestion for those who haven't yet watched this movie: Watch up to about 2/3rds of the movie, and when you just complete the gas station scene, get up, go home and leave the rest to your imagination. I'm sure that can do a better job than the movie."

I have a soft spot for this one), and sadly Impact 2008 (honestly, this movie could have been so much better).<br/><br/>Please don't misunderstand, movies with heroes is a nice concept; we all want heroes! However, sometimes there are no heroes and there is nothing more you can do than watch the events unfold and hope for the best.<br/><br/>This movie made me think about it for days; it is frightening because some of the events that occur are plausible (granted not exactly as depicted).<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was very well done, excellent acting, thought provoking, and most importantly, memorable! I was grossly underrated and definitely deserves a much higher IMDb rating! <br/><br/>** Potential Spoiler ** <br/><br/>Without revealing too much, I have to also state that I enjoyed the alternative take on the biblical account of the rapture; please understand, this is NOT a religious movie as some reviewers claim. Like any mythology (technically what the Bible is), there is an ounce of truth in many mythologies. Stories were written in a manner familiar the people of the time when technology of today and the future was magic to them. <br/><br/>Knowing describes an alternate take on the rapture. Biblical fundamentalists might have a problem with this movie but seriously, with all due respect, Knowing is just a movie!"

Knowing all that---you are not disappointed---the acting is bad and the movie is garbage---and you KNEW it---Knowing is great.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: Cage and his son acquire a document that has random numbers on it. Ala National Treasure---Cage figures what the numbers mean---don't know how or why he breaks this code---but he does without breaking a sweat. It seems the numbers predict every major disaster over the last fifty years. Why? Never really explained. Supposedly an alien race sent these numbers so future generations would hear their ""whispers"" and they could save them from the end of the world. Pretty stupid that they have to ""whisper"" in code every disaster for fifty years. Cage stumbles onto things and the aliens--who by the way have a HUGE ship that could save thousands---only want the ""chosen"" few and choose his son and a little girl. Now they brought all these super huge ships and put only two humans on board when they could have saved thousands upon thousands.<br/><br/>This movie was dumb and it got worse as it went. It basically was National Treasure meets ET. Cage figures everything out with no rhyme or reason like in National Treasure---then meets the benevolent aliens who will only save select people.

There was one point when the special effects were so bad that I actually laughed out loud. 3. The soundtrack - totally ripped off the movie The Fall.

Without taking the credit away from Cage's excellent acting skills(sarcasm), I think this script could have had promise with another director on board. Alex Proyas did good with ""The Crow"" but outside of that not too impression of a directorial resume. With that said, I did give this film a 6 of 10 rating only because the suspense factor this film brings to the table. You will say to yourself ""WTF"" on a few occasions and find yourself on the edge of your seat a couple times, but the overall story is goes too far and WAY over the top!! Especially with as many tragedies involving major airlines I think the sensitivity level could have been a little higher, though it's also something I like about the movie.

As the film progressed, the director pulled the cards out of his behind. ""Colonel Mustard"" ""in the library"" ""with a knife"". No internal logic.

","John Koestler (Cage) is an MIT astrophysics prof with a very precocious preteen son Caleb. At Caleb's elementary school, a 50 year-old time capsule from 1959 is opened. Other kids get drawings of what kids from then thought 2009 would be like, but Caleb gets a sheet full of row after row of numbers, apparently meaningless, written by a girl called Lucinda. <br/><br/>It takes a little while for John to figure it out, but the numbers refer to dates and number of fatalities for every major disaster for the past 50 years - in perfect chronological order. Later, immediately before witnessing the crash of an airliner - predicted on the sheet - he discovers that the GPS coordinates (latitude/longitude) of the disaster are also included in the hitherto mysterious ""joining"" numbers between disasters.<br/><br/>So far so good and quite engrossing. But what begins as an interesting mystery rapidly evolves into an end-of-the-world scenario with hardly any lead-in at all (compare the months the world had to prepare in Deep Impact). This in itself might be OK especially as superhuman/alien influences are involved, but read on..<br/><br/>Global disaster looms in the form of an impending solar super flare. Solar flares regularly engulf the Earth, but the effects have to do with communications disruptions, possible destruction of electronic devices and spectacular displays of northern or southern lights. This one is different and Koestler describes it as a super flare, ""a 100 µTesla wave of radiation that would destroy our ozone layer"". But that's something which would have resulted in a slow, lingering death for much but not necessarily all of planet Earth rather than an apocalyptic one where the Earth's surface is swallowed in fire and humanity perishes, as in the film. There's doubt too about that ""100 µTesla"" - when Googled, that intensity doesn't seem particularly lethal. The impression is given that the Sun's fatal outburst is a natural phenomenon and not something that the aliens have induced..<br/><br/>Curiously, while the authorities know about and start to give warnings of the event in the day or so beforehand, they clearly have little prior knowledge despite the fact that the sun is under constant study by various learned bodies involving Earth-based observations and dedicated satellites. Please SF makers, work within what is and don't insult viewer intelligence.<br/><br/>The idea of Whisperers/Watchers is OK - outside of normal human experience so it's possible. They have been monitoring events for at least the past 50 years and drove Lucinda to create the sheet, then made sure Caleb received it. He and Abby (Lucinda's grand daughter), among other children throughout the world, are Chosen. But why only kids (and bunnies) get saved is a bit of a puzzle tho, surely some mature humans should be included. <br/><br/>Mainstream end-of-the-world movies where the End actually eventuates and is depicted in graphic detail are understandably not too generally popular - the only other one I can think of is When Worlds Collide though there are probably others. I am inclined to think that the ""sudden"" ending caters to the ""24""/attention-of-a-goldfish mindset where the audience majority are assumed to be idiots who will quickly lose interest if something dramatic (however improbable) does not happen, and happen SOON. After all these blockbusters do cost heaps to make and as always, money rules (sadly)...<br/><br/>SF geeks like me will find this movie irresistible but it's too bad the proposed means for the destruction of the Earth does not make sense. Otherwise it could have been a great, rather than a merely good, Sci-Fi flick. 7/10"

The problem is that it is total nonsensical pseudoscience. Unfortunately this speech is setting some of the premises for the plot and where this movie is going towards the end.<br/><br/>OK entertainment value, but don't expect too much from the plot."

","The thought alone of M. Night becoming a source of inspiration to other filmmakers gives me the creeps. That is, unlike the spooky kids, nerdy astrophysicists (pardon the redundancy) and high pitch ""awe-inspiring"" sounds that this movie abounds in.<br/><br/>While watching the first half of Knowing felt a bit like an early episode of The X-Files (""Conduit""), the movie on the whole did have this direct-to-TV feel to it, had it not been for the decent FX. Story-wise though, Knowing is a disaster on its own. It does redeem itself to a certain extent during the second half, but the damage had already been done by then.<br/><br/>If there's one thing that sets this one apart from the rest of the doomsday blockbuster pack, it may well be what it seems to postulate at the end of the 2 hr long drag. Namely, that fluffy white bunnies, when not butchered for their fur and/or meat, will earn their salvation. You'll have to see it and laugh it out to believe it."
"Tim851","3","1","3","21 June 2009"," A horribly unsubtle movie
","Knowing is as subtle as '80s Hard Rock.<br/><br/>From the first scene you know it. There's the little Cassandra character who is a pale, nearly autistic creepy little girl with the ominous stare all the time who writes down a chaos of numbers while in trance. The movie continues along these lines. <br/><br/>Nic Cage's character is basically Mel Gibson's (not too great) character from Signs. He's a broody widower, who lives with his half-deaf son in a creepy horror mansion somewhere outside of Boston. His son gets the number chaos from a time capsule at school and Cage somehow finds the date of 09/11/01 in there. The pale standing-around-people from Dark City are back as well.<br/><br/>All in all this movie is just a collage of two dozens movies, most of them not really classics to begin with. Not a single figment of it is original.<br/><br/>And Nicolas Cage must finally be considered to be amongst the worst actors that are A-list in Hollywood. His performance in this is astonishingly bad at times and barely adequate at best. It doesn't help, that his character is clownshoes. Only trumped by the female sidekick character who got some of the worst writing since the 1950s.<br/><br/>There is a lot of CGI in there. Every single scene has been visually enhanced. Some of it looks better, some worse. All looks fake. There are two CGI disaster sequences that are done pretty well. You see they're 100% computer generated, but they look very convincing indeed.<br/><br/>3/10, without the disaster scenes it'd be 2/10."

I believe not only is this film based on supernatural beings but also that this film brings a religious point to not conflict it, but instead pair with it.<br/><br/>Although not religious myself i am of the understanding that in the bible, God promised a promised land. Could this be a message, i also see the supernatural figures as a representation of angels.<br/><br/>However, this could all not be the the point of the film, but that is how i interpreted it.<br/><br/>The film brings deep meaning as well as a horror, thriller and action stance to it.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 Thanks guys"
"Geraa","2","1","3","14 June 2009"," What was this movie about?
","The first push to watch this movie was that I kinda liked the last several performance from Nicolas Cage. The second was, that I'm big fan of Sci-Fi so with the plot it seemed to be a promising movie which could have some fresh new flicks and great acting. Unfortunately it wasn't.<br/><br/>It is difficult to tell exactly what was my problem of the movie and that is because it is hard to tell what was it about at all. I'm a bit confused about what was the goal behind the script? It seemed that we have four-five different writers putting together what they had from half-ready scripts of horror, action, family drama, sci-fi, end-of-world movies and they could not make a deal, which would be the genre. It was scenes putting behind one another, without leading to anywhere and you could say that nothing happens in the movie. I admit there is a lot of action in the movie but they does not move the story, and they aren't original as well except the plane crash scene, which was the best 60 seconds of the whole thing.<br/><br/>The performing of characters are quite mediocre and unfortunately Nicolas Cage couldn't do any unique performance no matter how hard he was trying to, but because of the huge gaps in the non-existing story line it could be almost impossible. Characters do not develop a bit and even they don't react or behave logical. Why do we need in every ""clue-finding"" movie a scientist who refuses to see the pattern in front of his/her eyes because of being so proud? Why do parents think that leaving the kids in a car in a dark forest at night a good idea, when they know that some bad men are following them? The mystery behind the 50-year-old prophecy of major disasters annoyingly disappear by the appearance of the aliens. This solution is simply just so lame. We know it from the first scene we see them and is so frustrating that the creators think we won't find it out until the ending.<br/><br/>All together the basic idea behind the story was good and someone could have made a really good scrip out of it from which someone could have made a great movie, but there is only the idea. I rated it 2 out of 10 because after all it have one good scene and they worked a lot of creating nice (and a lot of bad) visual effects. But maybe they shouldn't."
"black_stars182","6","1","3","6 June 2009"," Disappointing ending
","Watching the trailer for ""Knowing"", I was so excited because I thought it would be really good and the end of the world would be stopped. Instead the children were abducted by aliens and the whole world was obliterated. I never thought this movie was going to be so unrealistic. I thought it was going to be somewhat like reality but I was wrong. I was really disappointed by the end. It is definitely not a typical and predictable film but ending was such a tangent that it was extremely discouraging. It put me off recommending this to my family completely. Otherwise, the beginning and middle were very entertaining and gripping."
"dutchs-1","8","1","3","5 June 2009"," Good try but an impossible mission
","At an elementary school near Boston in 1959, children are asked to create drawings of the future for a time capsule to be opened in 50 years. While most create robots, rocket ships and flying cars, one intense and withdrawn little girl covers a sheet with numbers. Fifty years later Nicholas Cage's son is given the drawing. Cage, an MIT astronomer, realizes the list predicts every major disaster of the previous fifty years. There are three more events on the list. He is nearly killed in one, tries unsuccessfully to avert the other, and finally deduces that the last event predicts the death of everyone on earth.<br/><br/>Cage's son is one of a handful of people to be saved by an alien race. But before then he has terrifying nightmares. In one he looks out his window to see the whole world on fire and animals fleeing through burning trees. I can truthfully say I never saw a flaming moose before.<br/><br/>Cage finally figures out that the cause of the holocaust will be gigantic solar flares.<br/><br/>You just can't pull off an ending like that successfully. If the end of the world happens and some people survive (The Stand, Independence Day), that may make for a good story. If the end happens and everyone dies, and it's our fault (Doctor Strangelove, On The Beach) it's a bummer, but also a cautionary tale. But if everyone dies, and it's not our fault, and there's nothing we can do about it, that's a guaranteed unsatisfying ending. The kids saved by the aliens don't count. They won't remember Beethoven, or the Parthenon, or the Sistine Chapel. Humans continue biologically, but not culturally.<br/><br/>And just what is it with the Nick Cage bashing, anyhow? To hear some people talk he's the worst actor in Hollywood. Is it that he generally portrays characters who stay cool? I see enough people who behave irrationally in a crisis in real life not to want to recreate the experience in a movie."
"shootingstarpictures","4","1","3","4 June 2009"," Please read only if you have seen the movie
","I was nicely surprised that after the movie started, I found the script cleverly written and the movie well directed. But as it went on, it became 'theoretically flawed' and extremely boring. It became about a story that was written thousands of years ago. As the movie progressed, it became an 'alienized' version of Adam and Eve. Interestingly enough, the story tells you that our destinies are all pre-determined and there are no ways of changing them. So if you have failed in life, don't worry about it, it is not your fault, aliens did it. That is why I call it 'theoretically flawed'. I don't know who would be happy with this story, may be 1- People who want to have an explanation for the story of Adam and Eve. 2- People who have questions about destiny and whether or not God has a role in it (or, it could be just aliens). 3- People who believe in Armageddon, and now are very happy because it will happen soon.<br/><br/>It is unfortunate, this movie had a good potential, but within the first half of it, it became very boring.

","Brilliant direction, and special and visual effects!!! That what makes Knowing really worth seeing. As for the performance, Cage was as stiff as a wood log and Byrne was overacting all the time. Something else really sucked... the music! The background music had that Spieberg's alien hype all the way, I felt that I'm watching a 70s or an 80s flick. It was completely inadequate to the action-packed events. Concerning the storyline, I think it is really good and will have you at the edge of your seat... up till the last 20 or 30 minutes!!.. when everything goes crazy and inexplicable things happen. That's why in the last part, one can find a lot of plot holes. I didn't also like the mixing of the religious allusions- that gave me the creeps sometimes!!- with scientific fantasies; it tarnished the movie with a quite childish mark. However, I think Proyas did a great job with a quite worn-out but confusing end-of-days idea... leave alone some of the movie's scenes he masterly managed to make unforgettable."

Then here comes the ending with the weird special effects and the non talking ""knowing people"" and what was up with that guy opening his mouth and a bright light shinned out? It had so much dull holes throughout the movie and the ending just completely ruined it. When the kids were put in the I guess it was another planet, The first thing that came to mind was Adam and Eve? IDK I'm confused, I did not get the whole symbolism thing with this movie and it's weird how the kids were okay with being taken away from their home and losing their parents well except for that 30 seconds of sadness the boy showed. The earth was destroyed they could have at least showed it having a new beginning with new species SOMETHING TO GET US THINKING. I guess the movie had some potential then it got messy. If you have some time to kill then why not but don't spend any money on it or go out your way to see it. It's one of those movies you don't mind watching because your so bored."
"samuel_i_roberts","7","1","3","12 May 2009"," It's like Signs, but with a better plot and not so hot acting..
","Alright, first off I'm a bit biased I love Proyas' work.. THE CROW / DARK CITY are films I have come to love and enjoy. That being said, The Knowing is not Proyas' best work by a long shot.<br/><br/>I'm sadly a bit of a Nick Cage fan, but unfortunately I found this particular performance lacking some his endearing characteristic acting. Heck, in general most of the acting was a bit bland. Though I tip my hat to the 'whisper people'.<br/><br/>Okay so the 'too many loose-ends' talk surrounding this movie seems a bit silly. People ask how this means that or that means this. For example why Lucinda was contacted and why Nick Cage got the code. The point is it doesn't really matter, Proyas' film has taken the road of determinism and so 'everything happens for a reason'. Also there is a lot of people dissatisfied about how Proyas' handled the determinism/coincidence debate by focusing on determinism, but is there really a story to tell from the coincidence side? I think we learn early on during Cage's lecture from his blank expression about the lack of meaning behind the coincidence argument that there really isn't anything more to say about it. The coincidence argument means life is random, how can you make a plot from that? Now, what I liked about the film was how these almost alien-like 'whisper people' were given an almost god-like angelic status.. Are they angels? Are the God? Are they aliens? Who knows? Their very vessel which carried the children to safety could be a space craft or a divine mechanism.. 'Deus Ex Machina'.. Also the biblical and the TREE at the end (The Tree of Life?) were a further blurring of the lines. Also there are beautiful allusions to other films throughout the film that are very nice. My favorite is the ""You won't let me play S.T.A.L.K.E.R."" line, ""S.T.A.L.K.E.R."" a decent pc game based on Boris and Arkady Strugatsky's STALKER novel of similar 'end of days' ambiguity to THE KNOWING.<br/><br/>Finally, why should you see this film. Because the soundtrack is nice, the acting is decent, the 'cheesy effects' are reminiscent of colored pages out of a fairy tale text or a 70's sci-fi (Close Encounters With The Third Kind), and the story is a beautiful homage to science, sci-fi, fantasy, and religion. Only downside is it makes you wait so long to find out what's going on, and who the 'whisper people' are."

Nicolas Cage is a good actor but chooses movies with horrible endings. From the first 60 minutes where suspense was there and a mysterious thriller about the end of the world got me going. The problem was the way they concluded the movie was just awful. They could have put a simpler ending without bringing up creatures from another world.<br/><br/>The director was good, but like I said in the end everything gets messed up in every aspect. Such a shame for a movie with good plot has to get treated this way. Many of the audience in the theater were not into the ending. You could see they started making fun of it and just were laughing at a dumb ending. Really disappointing."

But unfortunately, it starts becoming extra-terrestrial, with aliens and UFOs popping out all over the place.

","I haven't read all the comments, but someone did mention the ""Adam & Eve"" imagery at the end of the film. I just want to add that the obvious Edenic Tree they are heading for makes this a return to innocence, where the whole process of become human starts over again. There are probably some forbidden apples, too. You may or may not appreciate the overt religious theme (or, rather, ""aliens and religion theme""), but the kids and the tree pretty much cement that interpretation. I must admit to being somewhat startled with the apocalyptic ending; but I liked the fact that the movie had the guts to be true to its nature and not pull any punches. Another film that has an actual ""end of the world"" with religious bent is the superb, highly recommended Mimi Rogers-starring ""The Rapture."""

","I am extremely torn between what to say about this film. I was completely captivated by the overall plot, constantly on the edge of my seat, until that is about the last 20 minutes. After that, I simply felt like laughing. The plot was very well written, combining elements from both horror and thriller; for example the 'whisper people' or the young girl at the very beginning. However, in my opinion, it all starts going down hill when you discover that the 'whisper people' are in fact shimmering, blue aliens who have come, it appears, to rescue the two young children, and somewhere along the line, provide them with rabbits. Throughout the whole film I had expected some haunting, psychological ending, but I was left disappointed. I don't want to criticize this film too much as I adore Nicolas Cage and think that he is a brilliant actor, despite what most people say. Regardless of the comical element of this film, I think he played his role well. I would recommend this film if you enjoy disappointment."
"lyno_cfc","7","1","3","14 April 2009"," Review of 'Knowing'.
","Recently me and a few others went to see it and I enjoyed it, well, most of it. It was highly entertaining and exciting throughout five sixths of it or so. One of the aspects I loved was the way that Lucinda was in a sort of trance while writing the numbers franticly. Actually, she seemed like she was in a sort of trance all the time. I also loved the way that the numbers became the information (date, amount killed and location) to the disasters. The modern world is filled with disasters such as what happened in the movie. (Plane crash and terror, not really the whole world dying and aliens thing.) One of my favourite scenes had to be when the plane crash. It was so exciting and sudden and although the movie wasn't a horror as such it was frightening and intense. I loved the camera angles used then, it almost seemed like it was a live news report or something as the police just suddenly duck down, the camera swung round and you seen the plane crashing to the ground.<br/><br/>It was turning out to be a great movie until it entered that last part. I would personally advise anyone going to see it to leave the cinema just as Nicholas Cage is exiting the car beside the empty car that the children were taken away in at the clearing in the forest. After that bit it becomes extremely off what the rest of the movie was like and makes a dramatic turn into a sci-fi. I didn't like the ending one bit. It seems as if it has been written in an extreme hurry over a couple of beers and a few episodes of 'Star Trek' or something.<br/><br/>Apart from the terrible ending it was a very good movie and I think due to the thrilling and dramatic start it deserves the seven stars I have given it."

Normally Nicholas Cage I find annoying but he did a decent job in this one (surprisingly) as a drinking burned out world weary math professor.<br/><br/>Special effects are spectacular at times although the aliens ships are lame and so are their light-halo-emitting see through bodies. Still, a subway accident disaster scene is really jarring and left me gasping for breath it was so well done.<br/><br/>Yes, there are scenes so full of religious symbolism that it hits you over the head with a sledge hammer, and could have been toned down.<br/><br/>Contrary to many I liked the ending. It was sad I thought, yes it was corny, but it also was a perfect vision of a dream ""brave new world"".<br/><br/>I found the movie to have an emotional punch and this is unusual for a science fiction movie.<br/><br/>Above all it was an entertaining movie and recommended for science fiction fans."

","Hollywood has been teasing with ""The End of the World"" for decades, none had the heart to actually do it, until this film came along.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage is A depressed ""non believing"" MIT professor who lost his faith on causality due to untimely death of his wife. To him, everything in universe is random and meaningless. Things pretty much just happen without any meaningful connection with each other. He walks around like a zombie Oblivious of the fact that everything in life is actually pre-determined, until one day his son received a piece of paper full of mad scribbles from 50 years ago. The scribbles are numbers, predicting events before they actually unfold, down to exactly when, where and how many.<br/><br/>Interesting concept, if it is used in a meaningful way. In this case, it made me felt like a prop to fill the giant gap between the melodramatic beginning and the explosive end. There are two ways to interpret this strange phenomenon: 1. Life is indeed pre-determined and pretty much there's nothing you can do about it. 2. Life is not pre-determined but those aliens somehow can know the future. (this sounds really bogus and illogical). The more proper interpretation is that everything is pre-determined. Well, ponder that for a moment tell me if it's not equally bogus. No offense to the religious folks but do you really believe that God pre-determined the existence and the conduct of Adolf Hitler as well? What for? This film got itself in the same trap of those pre-deterministic religions.<br/><br/>The center piece of this story is a piece of paper with numbers written on it. What exactly is the meaning of this information? Is it a warning? What is a warning good for if you can not benefit from it? Warning: you will all die and there's nothing you can do about it. Great! Thanks for having me running around getting all hot and bothered for this eventual and inevitable death. The time might be better spend on tea and biscuit! Aside from the giant plot hole and quite literally WTF center concept, Nicolas Cage is actually quite good and convincing. The kids on the other hand, turned into one of those emotionless aliens before departing earth and humanity. Can you at least wait a few years and let them grow into it? Also, what's up with the rocks? I hope it will be explained in the director cut edition."

The idea was creepy, the evidence more so, the acting not too bad I guess (although it does deteriorate) and the story line was original and creative. However, as soon as the movie turned sci-fi I lost the plot... it should have remained a thriller or an action. I would have given it an 8 or so if the final disaster was a nuclear war, if Cage prevented a large terrorist attack or something along those lines. However, the introduction of 'aliens' and 'angels' completely ruined the entire movie.<br/><br/>Knowing was filled with pointless scenes, poor acting and unnecessary symbolism (seriously, wtf was with the stones. I know they are biblically relevant, but you can not expect the greater audience to understand this). I think the director was a bit confused whether he should make the movie a thriller/horror, action, drama or sci-fi; so he decided on all of the above!<br/><br/>The only thing that redeems it is the CGI and the few moments of great suspense early in the movie."

Aliens were enough, but aliens bringing children to what seems like the Garden of Eden?!.. Where did that come from? The problem is that the first part of the movie was really good and I wouldn't even mind watching the movie just for the first part.. but the movie just took such a turn that it's hard whether to say someone should watch it or not.

The viewer was always trying to figure out for themselves an explanation for the insanity that Nicholas Cage plunged us into, and were very often surprised at the results.<br/><br/>The acting was good, as were layouts of scene and occasional comic relief. I recall one moment well where I was sent into a fit of giggles, without realizing how serious the next few minutes could be.<br/><br/>My only gripe with this film is that it was predictable to the point of annoyance.

Is Caleb in danger?<br/><br/>""Knowing"" combines certain pop/cultural strands of philosophy/beliefs in a surprising way...such that you wonder what adherents of either strand would make of this melding of belief systems.<br/><br/>Generally, I think that this movie is interesting and entertaining. Doubt that it would have much, if any, repeat viewing value, but as a 'popcorn' movie for a cinema complex, it works fine. There are plenty of exciting special effects (concerning disasters of various kinds), and an engaging premise that piques your curiosity.<br/><br/>The ending is sort of interesting too...there is an element of 'wish fulfilment' to it, perhaps appropriate to the times we live in.<br/><br/>If some of this movie's elements appeal to you, you may want to seek out ""The incredible shrinking man"", which does have some overlap with this movie (though it is slight).<br/><br/>Recentish 'blockbuster' movies which have repeat viewing value in my estimation include films like ""Watchmen"" and ""Hancock"", which I've reviewed here."
"ros-52","4","1","3","8 April 2009"," Poor acting, poor plot, poor script - but some good screenplay
","I wasn't expecting much from this film and it turned out to be pretty much as I had anticipated. While it will keep you reasonably occupied for a couple of hours, the plot line is dubious, the characters are one dimensional and the acting is poor. The script in places is laughable, in particular the painfully clichéd interactions between bereaved father and son were enough to make me consider leaving the theatre. The film carries the theme of a man having his faith redeemed as a subplot. This idea has been explored in a much more interesting and less cringe-worthy way in many other films: Signs springs to mind amongst others.<br/><br/>There is a redeeming feature of this movie. The direction and screenplay of the disaster scenes is superb. The portrayal of the plane crash and the derailed train and the horrible fate of the passengers is harrowing but gripping.<br/><br/>Sadly, apart from those two exceptionally well shot scenes, there is little to recommend in this film, unless unlike me you find the poor acting and silly plot entertainment enough to keep you going through the duration of the movie."
"PWNYCNY","6","1","3","8 April 2009"," A slow sci-fi flick.
","For a movie that deals with the apocalypse, it was really quite a bore. Numbers ... disasters ... fate ... destiny, these are themes of this seemingly long and dragged out movie. This has to be one of the longest two-hour movies made by Hollywood. The action drags, the acting is humdrum and the story is devoid of any suspense. Even the scene with the airplane crash quickly loses its initial dramatic impact. Nicholas Cage gives a solid but uninspiring performance as a college professor with a secret that cannot possibly grab anyone's interest. The best part of the movie is right before the final scene when the earth ... well, if you really want to know what happens go watch the movie, but if you leave the movie feeling a little let down or just plain tired, don't blame me because I told you so."

Nicolas Cage films in general do not live up to my expectations... usually. On the contrary, this movie was far better than I expected! The action sequences were filmed well, the acting was decent, the special effects were reasonably well done, and the writing was decent. Overall, I think this movie is a winner.<br/><br/>I really think that Alex Proyas at the helm saved this movie from utter disaster. He is a very good director and I respect him deeply for his work. I believe he was the driving force behind the greatness of this movie. After seeing ""I,Robot,"" I was deeply intrigued by the fact that he had a new movie coming out.<br/><br/>I'll admit, I really enjoyed watching this movie, and if you're someone who is looking for some good, mindless movie-viewing, then I strongly suggest this movie.

","The same thing happened with Watchmen - I read a few crits here and thought 'Sounds good...' Yecch.<br/><br/>Another reviewer called it - starts well, sort of - at least the plot hook starts well - Time Capusule, code, something a little spooky about predicting the future. Unfortunately Nick Cage's first scene with his son was just awful and it made me sit up. I though, 'Hmm, this script really sucks. I thought Nick Cage was supposed to be good in this. Well, let's see what happens, maybe that was just a bad scene.' <br/><br/>Unfortunately all the scenes were like that. Wow, the acting was just terrible but the script was seriously terrible. So lame overall that I just groaned and writhed in my seat. So many predictable, hackneyed and stupid plot shifts and scenes that you just knew had been put in there because the director simply couldn't come up with anything original. I mean really really awful. You know the kind of thing where the hero says 'Wait here. Just wait here' and you just know the hysterical female lead is going to get out of the car and run into the dark, misty woods. Right? There were about 7 of these clichés back to back, separated by the lamest dialogue you can imagine. 'The world is going to end and I can't do anything about it.' At that stage I wondered 'How is the writer going to get him out of this total plot dead end? I hope at least that's going to be worth sitting here. Nope, the final scenes are just awful; pathetic, insulting to anyone's imagination and intelligence and such a cop out that I left the cinema disgusted. <br/><br/>So, my rating: Plot 3 - just because it started with a hint of promise; Script Minus 5 - deplorable, really terrible; Acting Minus 2 - Uniformly bad, embarrassingly so. When you're hoping the female lead will get killed soon so you can be spared her presence on the screen, things have gotten pretty low in the performance department; Direction Minus 2 - what else is there left for the director after scripts, and performances? The camera-work was fine. The Special effects were so much better than the rest of the movie that whenever they came on it felt like we'd changed channels.<br/><br/>It was a depressing experience, but if you don't care what you watch and are willing to have your intelligence insulted, go see it."

The ending is the most depressing I have seen in years. Everyone dies. We all get fried by a solar burst. Why was there no high winds at the end? For those who know astronomy that would be a good question. Six out of ten. I would not even rent this movie. The movie was not bad; I can name many worse movies.

","So what you get is young kids pretty convincing in major roles, cutting-edge disaster FX, cool music, and all the right plot buttons pushed at the right moments - until the end. (Also frantic DIY efforts). And mostly until the last sequence it keeps you guessing - is John Koestler (Nic Cage) just succumbing to gross paranoia after his wife's random death? Or is it really and truly The End of the World? What you also get is a lot of high class hokum; for a man cracking up enough to sink a bottle of Scotch every night, Koestler displays amazing resistance to continuously major trauma, and amazing fitness too - but in this it started to strangely remind me of 'Vertigo', as the obsessed, damaged hero (Cage is very like Jimmy Stewart) frantically follows a path at all costs that we hope will lead to some sort of redemption. And it's towards the climax that 'Knowing' starts to fall apart, because those mysterious 'men in black' take a hand. Literally, it's a Deus Ex Machina. 'Knowing' abruptly stops playing games with your head in its previous Hitchcock way, to switch to an over-the-top I, Robot-style FX-fest. Battlestar Galactica eat your heart out, and 9 out of 10 up till then.<br/><br/>**********SPOILERZZZ*********** <br/><br/>The last worthwhile plot turn is a car smash almost as shocking as the one in 'Adaptation'. And then - bunny rabbits? BUNNY RABBITS? The way the ending plays out is boringly neat and logical in story arc terms (and racist? - I mean, only two WASPS will be saved..?) and after the high drama and twists and turns of the previous 90 minutes it's a complete letdown. And slow. And FX overkill, actually - did they do this just to say 'we can portray the destruction of New York better than anybody before or since'? Because the story we were asked to buy into at the beginning, ie John Koestler's paranoia, grief and issues with his son and our doubt over his sanity, is literally overwhelmed by a sub-Close Encounters meets Armageddon meets Contact running-through-cornfields affair, which I momentarily thought was an Aero Bubbles screensaver kicking in. The bunny rabbits killed it for me. That was Harvey, not Vertigo. 4 out of 10 for the dénouement, which in hindsight makes no sense anyway - after all, why did the aliens choose those kids in particular, or Lucinda 50 years ago? What on Earth made them special? Hollywood demographics, I suppose."
"arcanaxv","8","1","3","5 April 2009"," A great idea with a very disappointing ending
","This movie grabbed me from the very start and held my interest until almost the very end. The mixture of psychic abilities, religious undertones and scientific theories was engrossing.<br/><br/>Without giving away any spoilers, the movie revolves around a series of seemingly random numbers written 50 years ago by a shy, obviously disturbed schoolgirl. The paper is locked in a time capsule to be opened in 2009. Deciphering the meaning of those numbers takes MIT professor Koestler and his young son on an incredible journey.<br/><br/>Don't let the few reviewers on here warning you about some sort of fundamentalist Christian agenda put you off. While I kept getting certain vague biblical references throughout the second half of the movie, there is NOTHING fundamentally Christian about the ending. In fact, I would say that it is rather anti-Christian.<br/><br/>The ending was a total and complete disappointment for me. I was expecting so much more after almost two hours of wondering what the real meaning of those numbers was. The movie got everything right except the end. It was just too easy and too simplistic.<br/><br/>Despite the letdown at the end, I would still recommend this movie. The plot is based on a great idea, the special effects are awesome and I certainly didn't feel like I wasted 2 hours of my life. As a bonus, it sparked an interesting discussion about science and religion between my 14 year old daughter and myself."
"SophomoreSlump","8","1","3","5 April 2009"," Requires the suspension-of-disbelief to the max!
","The movies starts off with a prologue about a disturbed girl, Lucinda Embry (Lara Robinson), whose class was asked to draw pictures to be placed in a time capsule 50 years ago. She however writes down numbers on the paper instead. Then, being out of time to completely write the whole thing, she runs away and scratches the remaining number at the back of a door. This gives us a clue that this movie is probably about psychic and predicting the future. But let me tell you that it has nothing to do with any of that.<br/><br/>Skip 50 years later, and we meet a teacher John Koestler (Nic Cage), an agnostic son of a pastor, whose son, Caleb, goes to the same school as Lucinda. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of the school, the time capsule is dug up and opened. Students from the school are given the envelope containing the pictures from the students 50 years ago. Somehow, probably by fate, John's son received Lucinda's envelope containing the numbers. Curious of what it means, John tried to find a pattern from the number and what he found are some chilling predictions of disasters that have occurred and those that have yet to occur.<br/><br/>John, believing that he is somehow responsible to stop this disaster, meets with Diana (Rose Byrne), the daughter of Lucinda, to find out more about her mother and try to stop it from happening. And that's the basic premise of the story.<br/><br/>The storyline will hook you on pretty fast. And will keep you guessing throughout.<br/><br/>The special effect is just tremendous and this is really no surprise coming from director Alex Proyas whose last movie was I, Robot. The highlight of the movie, I have to say, is the plane crash scene where John is caught in the middle of a traffic jam and a plane suddenly crash a few metres away and he tried to save some of the people from the crash. What's so amazing is that it is in a single continuous shot and it feels like you are a part of it. Quite frightening, too. And the last apocalyptic scene will take your breath away. It did mine.<br/><br/>The acting is slightly good. Keyword: Slightly. It is everything you might expect from Nic Cage. And Rose Byrne is slightly over-acting. While the rest of the cast are pretty generic. Not good, but not bad either.<br/><br/>The only problem with this movie is that the premise that has been set at the beginning of the story is not well-played with the ending. Quoting John Koestler, ""S*** just happens."" It felt like the writer had a change of mind midway through writing the story. And this might leave some viewers disappointed. Hint: Indy 4.<br/><br/>But this movie is for everyone. Seriously. It has the element of suspense, horror, supernatural, disaster, action (a quick chase scene), drama, scientific jargon, etc. But to fully enjoy it, we are required to use our suspension-of-disbelief to the max and just accept what's happening on screen.<br/><br/>Hey, this is a movie... ""S*** just happens."""

I can't believe that so many people are trashing up the ending because i think it was great. If you are all just to too stupid to see the whole symbolism there please watch it again. And the fact that so many people state that the ""end of the world"" part stupid and unrealistic i would like point out that Solar Flare theory is scientific theory and actually extremely likely to happen in the next 2 million years. So true, not in 2009 but in time such a thing is not stupid. I like this movie because ti was not only suspenseful with great special effects, but also had a fantastic ending. All the symbolism and metaphors add to the plot and make it deeper. If you didn't like the ending, than you're all just too shallow and stupid to perceive the deeper meanings. Watch it again!"

","Knowing - A page of numbers found in a time capsule from 50 years ago reveals the date and body count for every major disaster (really? on just one double sided page?) from then until up to now. It's up to Ben Gates...I mean Edward Malus...I mean John Koestler (Nicolas Cage) to save the day.<br/><br/>Before I get to the review, anyone else tired of one word titles that this year in particular seems to have accumulated? Taken, Push, Knowing, Duplicity, Fighting, Obsessed... It should be fairly insulting that marketing groups think our intellects cannot remember a title that's more than a word long.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage is Nicolas Cage. He's been giving the same performance with different levels of quirk and moroseness thrown in for the last 10 years, so you pretty much know what you're getting in to. He's got another dead relative to grieve over, and is rocking the single parent act again. His kid in this film, well...the less said the better. Okay I'll say it. Are there any good child actors in Hollywood? Is it all just based on who Julia Roberts' kid goes on play dates with? The first 20 minutes or so of the film are a bore, as the film takes the longest time of any in recent memory to roll through the credits. Things pick up occasionally and get very visceral, but by contrast make the low points feel that much lower. The film feels very long with several scenes that should have been cut. When there is action, the camera perks right up and we have some quality camera work, but this only happens two or three times. It felt like waiting for a car crash at a NASCAR race. The script offers few thrills as well. Funny (or is predictable?) that a film about knowing what is to come should offer so few surprises.<br/><br/>Another note-worthy problem which this film takes part in: the role and rules of prophecy. Prophecy is in the ranks of time travel in the writer's arsenal; an interchangeable plot device that gets used to the point of abuse. Either prophecies come true and there's nothing we can do about them, in which case there is no reason to watch. Or prophecies can be defied, in which case they were never truly prophecies, which is annoying.<br/><br/>This film has the guts to go through with it's prophecy, but it's still unsatisfying. I feel fairly disgusted that the film implies and seems to campaign for several of my least favorite ideologies: Scientology, Creative Design and the end of the Mayan Calender. Overall the film felt like a waste of time. If it felt meaningful or well made to you, you probably haven't thought it through well enough.<br/><br/>It didn't have Nic Cage in a bear suit and spin kicking women, but it was enough. D+"

Everything about it was simply un-nerving. The decor, the scenery, the ""Men in Black"" if you will.<br/><br/>It doesn't do it justice to call it horror, as most horror films are more about loud shocking scares, but it does excel in what most horror films fail to do, and that is make you squirm in your seat.<br/><br/>And really that was just the imagery aspect of it...<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage plays his normal character that we have come to expect, and as a rule if you are not a Nicholas Cage fan, then you probably wont like this movie.<br/><br/>Around the end of the film, the pace started to get somewhat disjointed and almost felt as if it wanted to end in about 10 different places. This, however, was do to poor editing and scene splicing.<br/><br/>The story line was solid enough and left little to the imagination. Of course the nature of the ending would make it hard to say that there were any loose ends...<br/><br/>Some people will probably be put off when they realize that this story is actually a fringe interpretation of the Bible, and while it is not technically a Biblical story it's basis is heavily laden with scriptural interpretation.<br/><br/>Pseudo-Intellectuals will probably scoff and dismiss the story as nonsense leaving the theatre grumbling that this is simple another one of those ""Christian Propaganda Films"". However the truly enlightened will see it as a caricature of factual events and possible interpretations.<br/><br/>Ancient cultures were not as ""quaint"" and ""simple"" as many have come to believe that they are today. In fact ancient cultures were highly intelligent and very much aware of the world around them is very much evident in the writings and works that they left behind.<br/><br/>The fact that they didn't have shiny blinking gadgets is not a testament to their advancement in mathematics or astronomy.<br/><br/>Of course many people today forget that 90% our knowledge in mathematics and astronomy is hundreds and sometimes thousands of years old.<br/><br/>In the end, this movie was enjoyable. Not too heady, not too quirky, and not too religious. You wont be seeing a film that crams dogma or doctrine down your throat."

","This review will reveal the ending of the movie so read at your own risk and don't block me from this site. This movie was new and different from everything else i have seen so far in the cinemas. It starts with a father and a son who find a note that predicts every major event that has and will happen from 1959 to a week after the note was found. They must find out about the person who wrote it, the meanings behind it and how to save themselves. i found it a little scary but i watched through it anyway. The ending was far from how i imagined it. There was a spoiled that i found with the trailer on Youtube. It was very true. It said, ""God Did It"" The movie ended with an Adam and Eve scene, like the first two people on a new planet. Everybody else is dead. Like I said, there are spoilers in this review. The graphics were excellent. i couldn't get enough of them. one of the last scenes in the movie was the entire Earth blowing up. They used pictures taken from Satellites and i actually believed that the earth was blowing up. They also blew up a train station and a plane. These were also very believable. i left this cinema worried that the earth would blow up on October 18th ALthough i must say i am a fan of Nicolus Cage (or however you spell his name) i was disappointed with his performance in this film. He was tense throughout many different scenes and it ruined the mood of the scene. One particular scene that he was awful in was the museum scene. He was flirting with a lady and he was god awful. Also in one of the last scenes he had to cry at the loss of his son. He cannot cry and in my opinion cannot portray any emotion of loosing somebody close to them. i don't even believe that it was his son from the way he was acting. This movie was overall good.

No. Was there any purpose to those stones? No. Was there any purpose to 50 years of preparation? No.<br/><br/>And as a Christian, I didn't find any meaningful messages here, even though I see that others thought there were too many hidden Christian messages. I just don't see it.

It is fiction from beginning to end with some very odd views of the end of the world. If the producers meant for this to be related to the Second Coming, they are poorly reaching. I would have been far happier if the movie had stuck with Aliens instead of using Angelic images. Wouldn't it be more interesting and uplifting to have Aliens help avoid catastrophes through numbers instead of predicting inevitable ones?

","I went to see this movie because the trailer made me curious what was all the fuss about with those mysterious numbers. now I've seen the film, I can split it in two: the first half was boring as hell. Nicolas Cage acted as if he was looking in a mirror. he was the worst actor of the picture. they could easily replace him with Kevin Costner. Costner may be a diva (as I have heard), but I really really like him. but Cage? what was the last movie where he was in that was good? anyway, so here I was trying to look at my watch, because the time seemed long. this movie was even worse than Disaster Movie, which is a movie that must be appreciated by the total sum and not the parts. lucky for me, this Knowing flick had a fantastic second half, which made me forget all about the first. by that, it made the total sum correct. this movie is BEEPing great. not superb, but still good. the second part was all about these terrible things that happen (maybe the numbers have an actual reason???) and the first accident really blew me away. it shocked me. not with electricity, but just with the content (which I will not reveal for anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet). the only thing I can complain about, is the trailer. it shows us too much already. so take my advice, avoid the trailer as possible but don't miss this film!"

","To all characters like kooist, I say don't be so closed minded. There are enough movies, TV shows, (cartoons even) that preach (sorry 'teach') no reckoning for right and wrong. The movie may have been unreachable for you, but a higher being in His infinite wisdom can use any manifestation of beings for His purpose. The jist of the movie, in case it was missed, was the end of the world, and a being higher than us choosing to continue a physical world in whatever way He chooses. This world will end and great pause should be taken when considering where we will be for eternity. Cage's character, in my opinion, sought redemption in the end and died with a 'peace that passes all understanding'. Kudos for Hollywood showing us a moral conscience."

","It's happened again- take a perfectly good premise for a film, and screw it up with a tacked-on ending about aliens. In this case, the trailer made Knowing look like a fast-paced Nicholas Cage action/thriller flick with amazing disasters and a clever plot thrown in, and I was massively excited to see it. However, by the halfway point, I was starting to go 'eh?' and felt like the rest of the audience was with me. Nicholas Cage finds a series of numbers that predict dates and locations of disasters for the past 50 years- this we know from the adverts. What it DOESN'T show you is the random sub-plot about albino men in black suits who hang around his kid and hand out black pebbles. As I'm sure has been said by every other reviewer, the train and plane crash sequences were definitely worth seeing, as is the end of the world sequence and even the forest fire one. However, as has also been said, Nick Cage spends most of the film driving around pointlessly and putting himself in danger whilst staring at the sheet of numbers. I can't fault his acting, there's not much he could have done with this tripe. There seems to be no correlation at all between the strange men in black and the disasters- it's like two films have been forcibly mashed together, in the most boring and unbelievable way possible.<br/><br/>And in the end, Aliens come down and take away his son and his friend's daughter, and randomly transport them to a field with a 'tree of life' or something in it. The kids seem to forget that they have just left behind everyone they know to certain death, and skip around. I'm not sure if the other spaceships were supposed to represent other children being saved too- if it does, it's not clear. Are the kids supposed to be 're-starting the human race'? If so, why is there only two of them? What if one dies before puberty? What if they don't find each other attractive? How did the aliens find out that earth was going to be destroyed, and why do they even care? Why did they hang around being all creepy and haunting the kids? All these questions and more will not be answered if you watch Knowing.<br/><br/>I have strong suspicions that there was a different ending to this movie at first- and that it was a straight foreword but slightly clever disaster flick with amazing special effects, which would have been a great film. But then at some point, someone said 'Hey, you know what made Indiana Jones 4 so rubbish? The aliens randomly slapped onto the end! Let's do the same with this movie!' Oh, and then the world ends and everyone dies. Hows that for a downer, anyone? I actually felt depressed for about half an hour after watching this. Luckily, due to Cineworld Unlimited cards I didn't pay to see this, or I'm sure the depression would have lasted a lot longer."

","This film is a hard one to sum up, i liked it and i think other people will too but you have to let go and allow yourself to laugh, don't try and take this film to seriously. I'm not too sure how to feel about this film as a whole, it was definitely not what i was expecting having seen the trailer, and this is where people will have a problem with it. <br/><br/>Lets start off with the good: <br/><br/><ul><li>The 'disaster' scenes, these are all done really well, i don't what to spoil anything by telling you about them but if you've seen the trailer you will have seen at least one of them. The CGI is really good and the scenes as a whole excite you. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The basic plot is good, but unfortunately the writers didn't stick to it, at points it felt like they weren't sure where to go with the story making the third act feel completely out of place. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Nicolas Cage's acting, well kinda, he's really good in some parts, when he's doing all the 'normal' stuff like teaching a class or being at home with his son, but the stranger things get the worse his performance gets. Saying that however this is one of his best roles for a while and i think he did well with the material. </li></ul><br/><br/>The bad<br/><br/><ul><li>The acting in general, Nicolas Cages son (chandler Canterbury) is the worst out of the group, but i'm guessing he's limited in the experience department. He's not terrible but unconvincing. Lara Robinson who plays both Lucinda and Abby isn't fantastic either, she's solid as Lucinda and does a good job but as Abby all her lines and actions seem forced. Diana, like Cage, is good when she doesn't have to do anything outlandish. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ending, without spoiling anything the ending seems totally stupid, you can't take it seriously, but on the plus side if you are getting sick with working out the end of a film you will never, ever guess this end. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Parts of the plot, somethings just don't make sense, the writers make a big deal about some things and then completely drop them. Also some of the things the the characters do during the course of the film seem illogical. But you can easily look past this. </li></ul><br/><br/>In all i believe this is a good popcorn film that if you allow yourself to laugh at you will enjoy, but don't expect to be challenged."
"spradley-3","3","1","3","30 March 2009"," Some parts were good - some were really bad!
","I'll start out by saying that I am a Nicolas Cage fan - big time. I love his movies - usually buy the DVDs and watch over a few times. I also go to movies to be entertained - and don't ask a lot from plots as in the ""National Treasure"" series. But this one - there are few if any one-liners - the ones that make movies such as 'Con Air' great viewing. In 'Knowing', the plot is actually pretty good - a time capsule is buried by a grammar school and unearthed 50 years later. One very odd student had written pages filled with numbers, in no recognizable sequence. Cage figures out what the numbers mean and races to prevent or survive the last prediction. However - and here's the 'bad' part of the movie - (SPOILERS NOW!!!) aliens have been hanging around for years, 'whispering' to the odd kid 50 years ago and 'whispering' to her kid in today's world. Then, as the prediction comes to fruition, the aliens take the kids who can hear their 'whispering' along with two of all the animals/life (ala Noah's ark) away to 'rebuild' on another planet. Gawd - the music was awful during the last alien scene! Cage drops to his knees when he sees the space ship, the kids are standing there with rabbits calmly, and the music is blaring crescendo for way longer than was needed. It's like a climax that was supposed to last 5 secs extended to 2 mins. So what were those aliens - who are obviously advanced enough to get here, figure out all the disasters that Earth has endured, figured out which kids and animals to take - out of the goodness of their heart or whatever - and they couldn't figure out a way to shield the earth from the 'disaster'? I guess I could have accepted the alien thing but the aliens looked to 'human'. Why make aliens who are all 'energy' shaped like a human body without skin? Head, two arms, two legs, ... The space ships were a cool design and the last visual effects of the earth were great. Again - too much loud blaring, climatic music. I felt badly for Cage at the end - so hokey. 4/5ths of the movie was pretty good though I missed Cage's one liners. Disappointing ending but not a bad way to spend a rainy day. Entertaining but poorly executed ending."

Nadia Townsend as well in her brief appearances.<br/><br/>The concept and visual effects make this worth seeing on the big screen, but immediately following the wonderfully done airplane crash you have a Keanu Reeves worthy moment with Nic Cage yelling ""HEY!

","Erich von Daniken wrote in the 70's that ""angels"" were extraterrestrials. I would never thought I would see a movie that would take this idea under the pretenses of science, and actually create a syncretistic religious myth by merging ETs, UFOs, and fundamentalist christianism. The irony: certainly those huge spaceships could have saved thousands, but ETs chose not to. Instead they find it OK to save two rabbits, but no parents. Why? Because they ""couldn't hear the call"". So the ETs could have warned mankind of impending doom with clear words in English but chose instead to use some ""tongue-speak"" that led one main character to self destruction in schizophrenia.<br/><br/>The reality is this: ETs (""angels"") chose those who were more susceptible to mind control thru their ""tongue-speak"".

","A time capsule buried underneath a school in the nineteen fifties. Exhumed five decades later provides the gryst for this movie which will put you through the mill, if you let it inside your head for a couple of hours.<br/><br/>I've just sat through it, in the cinema. Nicolas Cage - why the long face - plays Professor John Koestler is drawn into a seeming conspiracy which has shades of menace, terrorism and Armageddon.<br/><br/>This is pure science-fiction. It's stylish, thrill a minute stuff really. There are special effects. Some of them are stunning. A traffic jam on a crowded highway late in the afteroon - a downpour and a stricken airliner suddenly fills the screen. It hits the ground an the inferno is instant. A few survivors, some on fire stagger out of the wreckage. This is as real as you can get, given the screaming multi channel soundtrack.<br/><br/>It all revolves around a sheet of handwritten numbers - placed in the capsule by a ten year old girl Lucinda Embrey back in 1959. Cage's character manages to work out that the numerical sequence is not random, but points to almost every large scale disaster of the second half of the twentieth century - right up to present day. There are three disasters to come. The air crash is the first of them, and his presence on the scene is no coincidence.<br/><br/>Sooon he meets the daughter of the number scribbler - though I must say the handwriting would win awards in any class of ten year olds. Rose Byrne...slim and suspicious at first rejects the Prof. but before long she is 'knowing' something's up. Her daughter Abbie, played by the same lass who played Lucinda in the early scenes.<br/><br/>Menacing strangers in black coats seem to stalk Koestler's Son, Caleb, and a series of black, polished pebbles seem to be emitting messages from a mysterious source..<br/><br/>A hugely destructive 'accident' below ground and an undercurrent of F.B.I. involvement keeps the audience guessing until close to the end.<br/><br/>This movie requires a suspension of belief, like so many others. There are flaws but if you can overlook them, enjoy the effects and the fanciful premise of the plot then it's a rewarding case of 'The Day After Tomorrow' meets 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' If science fiction is your thing, and it's not usually mine you'll enjoy it, but might argue with the ending. I've noticed more and more films having bleak endings lately, but this one offers hope, if not for the more down to earth.<br/><br/>As the two younger cast members gambol in their brave new world they're are left wondering what's for tea, there's always rabbit stew."
"cafesmitty","7","1","3","29 March 2009"," An extremely enjoyable movie with a horrible Title
","I almost skipped out on this highly well made film because of Nick Cage's previously two films and the fact that from the previews that this looked like a Davinci Code rip off. This movie is much better than the Davinci Code (and nothing like it). Cage plays a scientist who discovers that a recently unearthed time capsule has a numbered piece of paper that predicted major future catastrophes where there is a high body count. Being a scientist, this challengers his way of thinking (obviously) and he is on a quest to find out what's next. Also thrown into the mix is the fact that not only is he brilliant, but he is a single father of a very intelligent young boy.<br/><br/>So let me just say this, this movie is rather PG13 and its is extremely intense for children. In fact, because of some of the images, I am surprise this film didn't get an R rating. I would not take anyone under the age of 15 to this film. I heard audience members saying that they are going to have nightmares and about 5 people left because it was so intense. I am a grown man and the accident scenes were some of the most intense I've seen in movies. But it was 100 percent believable. I got to warn you though, the first half of the movie (30-45 minutes) is a bit slow and dry, but once the film gets going, it moves at a pretty good clip. This is a summer blockbuster type of movie that has such a bad title, that the title itself (and the so-so preview) may prevent people from going to this movie. But the special effects are FIRST class. And the film didn't over do it (like the Day After). It's a drama/action/horror movie and its awesome. I highly recommend going to this film and seeing it on a big screen. You will surprise yourself on how much you will like it. I sure did. Still, I cannot stress this one point enough again. There are some extremely intense, graphic images that isn't appropriate for children and because of the theme of the movie, you may find that your kids will need some reassuring from you."

","""Excellent."" Knowing, for the most part, had stunning visual effects. There were a couple scenes that really showed that they were computer generated; from the visual aspect, not from the logical mindset. The plot and progression of the movie never had a dull moment. It was like a book that can not be put down, leaving the reader wanting to know what happens next. The movie addressed most of the questions formed from watching, except for some towards the end. The end of the movie, itself, was clear and made sense, but a part progressing towards the end left me skeptical. I remember thinking, ""Really? Where did this come from?"" Other than that one scene, I have no complaints. The beginning of the movie seemed, at first, to start slow, but the significance of how, exactly, it started became clear towards the middle of the movie. And it is obvious how critical the beginning is to the plot. The movie featured suspense, on a Jurassic Park level, and lots of action. The actors played their parts very well; quite convincing. One of the most appealing aspects of the movie is how it makes you think about what you, the viewer, believe  your morals and how you would act if it were your choice.<br/><br/>I think fans of science fiction, Nicholas Cage, drama, and suspense would be interested in Knowing.<br/><br/>I would give the movie a 4-star rating."
"raiderhayseed","8","1","3","29 March 2009"," I think I know what ""Knowing"" is all about, but what the hell is its genesis?
","The Australian newspaper's film critic, Evan Williams, wrote approvingly of this film assuring his readers that it was about global warming, not apocalyptic religion. I went along with that notion until the illustration from an old printed copy of the book of Ezekiel appeared on the screen. I guess Evan Williams has not spent a lot of time reading the book of Ezekiel.<br/><br/>That got me wondering whether Proyas had picked up funding from the people who profited from the Tim LaHaye - Jenkins ""Left Behind"" franchise. But the fight in which he is currently engaged with the Australian Tax Office over whether the film is ""Australian"" enough to qualify its investors for the Australian tax breaks would seem to suggest that is not the case<br/><br/>The female characters who hear the voices in ""Knowing"" have a fascination for the vision of the Jewish prophet, Ezekiel. This Old Testament book begins with a vision of God appearing in a chariot, the wheels of which are wheels within wheels  they can carry the chariot to and fro in different directions. The chariot is accompanied by four winged angels, each with a different face - a lion, an eagle, an ox and a man. <br/><br/>Ezekiel's depiction of God in all his glory is just about identical with that in the book of Isaiah and the Revelation of John, at the back of the bible. In the book of Revelation they may be identical to the four horseman of the apocalypse who are seen going about the earth as God's eyes and ears when Jesus breaks the first four (of seven) seals on a scroll that is usually taken to be the title deeds to God's creation. In fact that imagery of apocalyptic horsemen seems to be culled from the book of Zechariah, along with pretty well all of the symbolic images used in the book of Revelation. (If this synopsis is a bit dense you can get a rather more expansive explanation on my www.peterhenderson.com.au website)<br/><br/>So Proyas seems to have taken the four angels and dressed them up as rather spooky men with pale complexions  I thought I detected wings on one of them in their last appearance in the film. The children are conveyed into the skies by a contraption that appears to resemble wheels within wheels<br/><br/>The prophet Ezekiel was writing at the time during which most of the people of Israel were being held captive in Babylon by the emperor Nebuchadnezzar  a character who seems to be synonymous in the bible with Satan.<br/><br/>Ezekiel is even less impressed with the purveyors of organized religion than the Nicholas Cage character in ""Knowing"". In chapter 10 he sees God in his chariot leaving the temple in Jerusalem, and planet earth, The next time that imagery is used, God is up in heaven with Jesus in the book of Revelation.<br/><br/>But before God leaves the temple (and earth), he instructs a man dressed in white linen with writing implements in his hand to place a mark on all the Jews who grieve at the evil they see taking place all around them  especially in the temple. Revelation inverts this idea by having the sycophant beast of Satan putting his 666 mark on those who rather enjoy taking part in the evil that prospers on earth. So why is it only the kids who are shown receiving the mark, or more correctly hearing the whispering voices? I thought Proyas and his writers may have borrowed that teaching from Jesus about: "" unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven"" Matthew 18:3, etc. The last scene shows them romping around what may be the Garden of Eden with the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil as depicted by Dante at the end of Purgatory (or is it the Tree of Life in the new heaven in Revelation 22?)<br/><br/>The fact that the Cage character's father is a minister of religion fits with the prophecy of Ezekiel that was aimed at the priests back in Jerusalem who had not been transported to Babylon. If that is the case, Cage is lying to his son and his father when he assures him that everything will be all right.<br/><br/>In Ezekiel, the Jews who do not bear God's mark are slaughtered and the bodies are piled on top of each other in the temple in Jerusalem. In the film, the bodies will be piled on top of each other in what appears to be New York.<br/><br/>So have Proyas and his writers ""got religion"", or is he just commandeering the powerful religious imagery in the way that Fincher did in ""Seven""? Either way he has produced a very watchable and clever film that shares with Fincher's ""Seven"" the striking cinematography featuring gloomy overcast skies and compelling sound design. And of course, the exemplary performances from all the cast."

Now, at the end it switched into a Sci-Fi movie completely, with aliens that would re-populate another planet with ""chosen kids"". And then it became overly religious--the aliens looked like angels and the kids were dropped off in and ""eden-looking"" planet with a golden ""forbiden-apple-kind-of-tree""... Now, you might even believe all that but in that case if they were not able to stop any of these disasters, specially the last one... what was the reason of the whole numbers thing-- why not just say ""at this date be in this place, don't be late, take a sweater-might be cold"".

","The basic ingredients for this film are all here, a fine Big Budget Director (Alex ""I Robot"" Proyas), Big Name Leading Man,Nicholas Cage, the guts of a good story, and lots and lots of money. Sadly, it is holed below the waterline with one of the worst endings I have seen in Cinematic History, a view shared by virtually everyone whom I know who has seen this film.The relatively interesting plot also suffers prolonged assault from a very poor script offering trite, clichéd mechanical dialogue.<br/><br/>Recovering a 50 year old time capsule from an Elementary School is a promising enough start. Child actor Chandler Canterbury , as Caleb Koestler has a father who is an University Professor schooled in Random and Determinist Theory, who has a friend who is an Astro- Physicist. When Caleb is given a 50 year old list from the time capsule it is not difficult to guess where this story is heading. Disasters are both foretold, and anticipated and their place in them becomes central to the plot.<br/><br/>A plane and subway crash,separately, are brilliantly realised in two of the most compelling disaster sequences I have seen, these two items alone score 6/10 for the film. The exact denouement is reasonably concealed, but whenrevealed is preposterous, absurd, risible and excruciatingly realised.<br/><br/>Out of nowhere an ET moment occurs so sickly sweet and devoid of credibility and tension that all before it is destroyed. Why Caleb doesn't cry to his Dad ,""This spaceship is really cool, I'm going on board to take a look,"" is beyond me. We then have a hugely impressive, and pointless, ""Day After Tomorrow,"" sequence as New York is wiped out AGAIN ( this City must have some bad movie karma).The closing frames of children holding hands, on a mythical planet, clutching cuddly rabbits as waving wheat and barley sweep around them in a verdant valley, complete with the Tree of Life is about as ill-advised as it gets.<br/><br/>If the studio had halved the budget, a credible ending and script might have emerged. Instead we get lazy, bloated Hollywood at its very worst. I await the DVD release purely to see if there is an alternate ending. Otherwise, enjoy a reasonable enough effort  and leave 20 minutes before the end. You will feel much better for it."

","SPOILER! SPOILER! I WARNED YOU. SPOILER!<br/><br/>At the start of Knowing, I was intrigued. I had seen previews of Nicolas Cage surrounded by disasters, struggling to figure out what a cluster of numbers on a piece of paper mean. It seemed like an end of the world disaster movie, and I didn't mind that. As the movie unfolds, you see amazing graphics of planes exploding and trains crashing into a subway. It was absolutely mind-blowing to see these disasters on screen because they looked so real. I was left wondering, how did they do that? The plot was even something worth paying attention to. I was really enjoying myself, up until 2/3 of the movie. These blonde men come out of nowhere, and they look plain creepy. The kids are taken, and heaven opens up. They go into this spaceship-like thing, float up to space, and Nicolas Cage gets to die with the rest of the world. The last scene ends with the two kids starting as Adam and Eve, letting these stupid little rabbits roam this field. I'm a religious person, and though many people are saying this is a very religious film, no Christian would think so. This is more blasphemy than anything else. I couldn't believe they would set that as the ending. It was horrible, and offensive. I almost felt like someone else had written the ending. It just didn't fit. I was sure Nicolas Cage had received these numbers because he was going to find a way to save the world. I wanted that to happen. Then this? This ridiculous, hideous, blasphemous, horrifying ending? I left the theater feeling VERY VERY unsatisfied. Generally, I like films with Nicolas Cage, but this one has got to be the worst. It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. But it's up to you if you want to see it. I'm just letting you know, it's a waste of 2 hours that I wish I could get back."

But in a reversal of what usually happens in movies it got better and more interesting and was actually saved by the ending. Unfortunately the ending was taken from a very popular song from the 80s which immediately starting blaring in my head. I really don't see how that could be a coincidence.<br/><br/>It's interesting the thoughts that go through your head while watching a film. At one point I was thinking ""How much money does Nic Cage have now?"" And I got to that point because I realized he's been making action movies for 10+ years and he started off as a really good and quirky actor. But now he just runs around solving puzzles and averting disaster. I'd really like to see him act again. He must have enough money by now.<br/><br/>The movie is more of a horror movie than I was expecting. It's not gory or anything but it's full of horror elements and if you're comparing it to most horror films it's better than most of them. But there are many points where it's unintentionally funny. Still I have to give it credit, because it's trying to say things. It uses familiar elements but isn't like most movies you've seen. And I'll tell you the truth, I did not see this cribbed ending coming at all. Even though I've always hoped that is what will happen in that circumstance.<br/><br/>There is some hammy kid acting and we really need to figure out what to do about Cage's hair. But this movie was watchable. And maybe even rewatchable for genre fans who don't need everything to be too smart. Give it a shot if you're bored with nothing else to watch or if you're interested by the premise, which is solid, but don't expect anything too amazing. It's passable, lots of bad but lots of redeeming stuff too."

","I just saw this movie last night and I must say in terms of tensity and driving the viewer to the edge, this film takes a masterful approach. I don't want to give away to many details, but this film uses techniques of horror and sci-fi and combines them into a thriller that will truly get your heart pumping. The special effects were well done as well. Not the best i have seen but well done.<br/><br/>Now the reason i gave this a 5/10 was the ending. The ending in my opinion was completely awful. The only reason i watched it all the way through was because i watched it that far. I think the writer got really lazy and made a crappy end. I don't want to give away the movie because i still think its worth seeing. But the ending was one of the biggest movie buzz kills i ever experienced.

","You name it and it's in here, but that's OK there's only so much you can do with an apocalyptic movie so I'm not going to rate it down because of that. <br/><br/>The main problems with this film are Nicolas Cage, a stupidly unbelievable story and the feeling that it thinks it's way smarter than it really is. <br/><br/>There's no way on earth this film should be getting the ratings that it is, that's just ridiculous. It fills up a couple of hours of your life and you'll not regret losing them, but there's nothing new or exceptional to be gained here. I really don't know whats happened to Cage, I used to rate him as an actor. Everything he does now is just going through the motions, in parts that just don't suit him. I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable watching him. <br/><br/>The story is so rambling and pointless, basically anything could have been the answer for the mystery that drives the whole plot. Nothing tied together, nothing is explained and when it eventually is it's just soooo sickeningly obvious that I wouldn't even bother spoiling it. <br/><br/>There are some memorable parts though, special effects are almost perfect the entire way through. An unbelievable, inredible plane crash as seen in the trailer. I wanted to be watching it on DVD so I could view it over and over. The rest of the effects were also tip-top, a train incident seemed a little overdone but the finale is well worth waiting for. <br/><br/>All in all it's a good popcorn blockbuster, I enjoyed it as far as these kind of films go. But don't go believing the hype or thinking there's anything deeper, it's just a big, dumb movie and a Scientologist wet dream."

I'm sorry but it seemed stupid to me... Not the part about the world ending, that would have been fine. I don't see the point in the children being whisked off in a new age Noah's Ark of sorts, by some ""aliens"" that look like they belong as extras in Valkyrie. I suppose that they wanted to save the children's lives so they wouldn't receive bad reviews for killing kids. I tried to think of it as maybe the Christian faith, where people are Left Behind and the children are saved but that doesn't really seem feasible, the movie has a religious undertone anyway and if they were going to make it seem as if the children were being saved by God then all believers should have been saved as well.... Also... There were MANY children in the theater when I saw this movie on opening day. I am sure that many parents were as surprised as I was to find the movie with such graphic imagery. Personally I liked it in the movie, but I can understand where some people would find it not suitable for younger children. I think they could have gone with an R rating. Overall I liked the movie, the ending could have been written better. I would recommend seeing it, but only if you go to an early bird showing (such as I did) or rent it... basically, don't pay over $5.50 to watch it."

The set-up with the daughter and subsequent events are a bit clumsy though.<br/><br/>As the film gets to the final bend it's lining up nicely for a sprint to the finish. But then, bang!!

I understand that it made the movie more disturbing and dramatic, but it was completely unnecessary. And the whole thing with aliens? Come on. That was completely ridiculous. And what made that worse, was that the ending of them getting ready to go and them leaving in the spaceship was like 10-20 minutes long. It was stupid and boring. And then like just knowing that the scary people were harmless aliens kinda made me mad.

","This film doesn't know what it wants to say or how it wants to say it. It's like three films somebody spliced together in an awkward way. One is about a mysterious code that tells you where accidents will happen; the other is about finding God, accepting fate and the losses it might bring; the third is about mysterious aliens that stalk a family as Armageddon approaches. You literally could have made three films out of the basic premise of the story. But shoving all these ideas into a single film results in a confusing plot, a tone that wavers, and a dissatisfying experience for the audience. By trying to connect all the dots, which are too numerous, the film loses coherence and falls flat on its ass. But frankly, even with a trimmed down storyline, I doubt that the writers would have fared better. I was unimpressed by the writing. One star, for wasting my time and providing no payoff for my emotional and intellectual investment."

"CinematicInceptions","7","1","4","23 September 2014"," Interesting enough while easy to follow. Don't decide to watch it based on the trailer.
","I will warn everyone considering watching this movie not to base the decision too strongly on the trailers. I remember seeing the TV previews many times when it came out, but didn't see it until Fall of 2013. Still, what I expected from the movie because of the trailer was quite different from the actual film. There are several key plot points that they didn't put in the trailer simply because they were too important, but in the short trailer they make it seem like Nicholas Cage's character is the only one. There aren't many main characters, but there are some. It is a fairly balanced mix of disaster and sci-fi, but it is structured more like a drama. The acting from the main parts is pretty good, though I personally found John's kid to be annoying. The story and plot are solid especially at the beginning. After around forty-five minutes the story might not appeal as much some people even though it isn't very difficult to follow, but by that point, you'll probably want to watch the rest simply out of curiosity. I will warn you that if you don't like special effects and creepy images like Frodo in Lord of the Rings or the hallucination scenes in Batman Begins, this movie has a fair amount of that. I would not recommend that you watch it for typical sci-fi action, but it should satisfy people looking for good disaster scenes. Now, I will mark here as a place where the spoilers begin, so if you don't want to have the story or any other elements ruined for you, stop reading here. As I said earlier, it wasn't quite what I was expecting, but it wasn't much better or worse than I was expecting. One of my favorite scenes was the one where John cracks the code of the numbers near the beginning. I also liked how he tried to stop the one event, and how he responded to the one that occurred near him. Granted, it was rather unlikely that he happened to be right at the location of the disaster, but you don't exactly make a sci-fi story about things that are likely to happen to the average person. I was not expecting the element of aliens being thrown in, but it didn't detract from anything in my opinion. When that element was introduced, however, I knew that some viewers might have begun to speculate whether they were getting what they were looking for. The one thing that I was fully disappointed with was the lack of explanation for how the aliens were able to predict or cause the disastrous events that they predicted through Lucinda and Abby. The ending was all around intense. It was a little bit scary with the big spaceship and the demented way that Abby talked about the rabbit she had with her. It was emotional with John having to allow his son to leave him and John's family all facing the apocalypse together. The last shots were the strangest of all especially since you are kind of left to decide for yourself where the two kids are at the end. In summary, it has a pretty good story and the execution is unremarkable in any way. It's not a very fun movie, but that does not mean that it is by any means bad. For once, my decimal rating comes out to a solid integer in an 8/10 overall rating."

","I wanted to see Knowing because of Alex Proyas (Dark City, The Crow, Garage Days, I Robot), but, unfortunately, this has nothing to do with Proyas's earlier works. It has a fairly good beginning: a time capsule is opened and contains encoded messages about tragedies that are already happening. After that it goes out of control and it's just an insane Nicolas Cage trying to worn everyone about the end of the world. Finally, well, i won't spoil it, but the ending, let's say the last half an hour, it's not only senseless: it's stupid. It doesn't seem very deep to qualify a movie of being ""stupid"", but believe me this is the case. As some say maybe this is all a Scientology propaganda, maybe that's why i ""didn't get it"", but it still doesn't work as a movie itself: it has no structure, no coherence and no point at all.

","KNOWING will find an audience, whether that audience is the science fiction aficionados, the spiritualists, those waiting for 2012 ideas, or those who enjoy thrillers. It is a mixed bag - based on a story by Ryne Douglas Pearson who adapted it for the screen with Juliet Snowden and Stiles White - that depends heavily on the audience's perception of Nicholas Cage: after a string of films that cast him as a mad man it is nice to see him in a humanistic role. Alex Proyas directs. <br/><br/>50 years ago a school closed and the new school that opened to replace it called for a ceremony that included the burying of a time capsule full of children's drawings about what they felt the future would hold in 50 years. At the ceremony the enveloped drawings are dispersed among the class and Caleb Koestler (Chandler Canterbury) opens an envelope that is simply a page of numbers: Caleb begins to hear voices, but is reassured by his widowed astrophysicist father John Koestler (Nicholas Cage) that it is probably due to Caleb's hearing aide. But as John examines the list of numbers with his fellow associate Ben (Phil Mendelsohn) he begins to discover that the numbers are not random but are instead dates of horrible accidents or events followed by the number of lives lost in that event: the obvious number sequence is 9/11. John follows events that are predicted and finally discovers that an event listed as the last number set is predicting the end of the world. The little girl who made the original list lived a strange life and in her lineage is an adult (Rose Byrne) who has a daughter Abby (Laura Robinson) who is Caleb's best friend and also hears the voices Caleb hears. Together the two families explore the ramifications of the numbers and the film speedily progresses to a fantasy ending. <br/><br/>The story itself is interesting and the acting is fine - up to the point that the inevitable CGI effects take over. Then it becomes a matter of taste as to whether the viewer needs to have details splashed all over the screen or merely keep the story in the imagination of the viewers' minds. As Hollywood so often forgets, sometimes less is more, and in this case what could have been a rather tender film becomes another loud apocalyptic disaster sequence. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","Knowing is a film that requires the suspension of disbelief, but then so too does The Sixth Sense, Aliens and Terminator 2, and we easily manage with them and they are considered classics. For some reason this has been panned a little for being unbelievable yet a child who can see and interact with dead people does not.<br/><br/>In any case the first 90 minutes of Knowing is consistently engaging and for a few minutes outstanding. Unfortunately though it is let down a little through overreaching just a little in the last quarter.<br/><br/>Nic Cage plays John, a university lecturer whose wife has passed away and who lives with his son Caleb, who at age 11 ish is finding his way in life and as such is both idealistic (annoying) and wants to be more independent.<br/><br/>Caleb attends a school where 50 years previous a time capsule was buried (shown in a brief earlier sequence), on the day of the unearthing each child at the school gets to open an envelope left by a student 50 years prior, Caleb of course gets the one that sets events in motion.<br/><br/>Two things before proceeding: 1/ The Time Capsule was ""unearthed"" by two hooks, there was no code, padlock or preventative measures in place to stop theft, and it was in the middle of an open courtyard. You're expecting me to think that for 50 years no mischievous kids thought to pull it up and fill it with dog poop? Or used socks? 2/ The film revolves around an intricate code left by one of the students. 99.99% recurring of the population would have turfed it after a momentary glance, and even if they had decided to look into it there was no way in hell they could decipher it. The movie would be better served if it were titled Not Knowing, but that movie wouldn't have been made would it? Caleb instantly forgets the page filled with numbers, though he does take it home where John somehow deciphers a code from it.<br/><br/>In essence some of the numbers relate to historic (and future) dates, followed by numbers which relate to mortality figures in disasters that occurred on those dates, the nerve wracking thing is that there are more dates to come, and that they are all in the near future.<br/><br/>John goes to visit the teacher who was present at the original time capsule burial, we find that the girl who wrote the code was a little odd, and that after writing the code she was found in a dark room in a sort of trance. (Things the audience knew from the first scene by the way.) So far, so what really.<br/><br/>But the best scene in the film has John stuck in a traffic jam on the way to pick up Caleb from school, as he waits in traffic he realizes what the other numbers in the code refer to, and hi theory is instantly and spectacularly proved correct when a plane falls from the sky in a terrible crash that is both horrible and wayyy cool.<br/><br/>The fun bit, there are two disasters left before the code finishes, so now John knows where these events will occur, and the likely death toll, except that the final death toll simply says ""EE"", instead of numbers.<br/><br/>(Needless to say when they find out what the code means it's a bit of a bummer.) John has a decision, does he go to the site of the future disaster or stay the hell away? I'll leave that for you to find out, but after a slowish start I found the middle hour of the film quite immersive, even when the circumstances became more convoluted through the introduction of more characters I still wanted to see where it was going. It was only towards the end that I felt the plot went a little too far in trying to ramp up the cool factor that I got a little annoyed.<br/><br/>This is a Nic Cage movie, he carries the entire thing and it largely revolves around his performance, which is fine as he is believable here, Rose Byrne comes in after a while as the daughter of the code writing little girl (she had Rose once she was an adult obviously) and does the whole ""This can't be real"" thing for just long enough without it being tiring, and the two kids (by the end) are only mildly annoying mostly.<br/><br/>The centerpiece is really the plane crash, for the few minutes leading up to it and the thirty or so minutes after I was hooked and willing to take whatever leap of disbelief they asked of me, only they kept ratcheting up the action and overstepped the mark just enough that they managed to reduce the impact.<br/><br/>I still think that Knowing is a fine film and worthy of a look, it doesn't really go off the rails, but the ending did end up costing it some realism and impact, and I thought that by simply toning down a couple of things this could have been a great film.<br/><br/>As it stands I put it near Déjà vu as movies with noticeable flaws, but that are good enough that you are willing to ignore or move past them because the filmmakers tried to make something different, unique and exceptional, even though in both cases they didn't quite get there.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. If ever a Director's Cut was needed, this would be it. This could have actually been improved by removing (only) a couple of things. Right now though it is still good, just not great.<br/><br/>If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"

","I have heard many mixed reviews about this film, so it was with a little trepidation I put the disc in the DVD player. I shouldn't have worried, I can see why the reviews are mixed, but over all it's not all that bad. Admittedly, it could have been done a lot better, but I'll accept it as it stands. The setting is Massachusetts in the United States and we start in the year 1959.<br/><br/>Lucinda Embry is a loner and she hears whispering voices that she doesn't talk about. To celebrate the opening of a new school it is decided that they will bury a time capsule at Lucinda's suggestion. All of the class are to draw pictures of what they think life will be like in 50 years time, when the capsule will be opened. Lucinda just writes down numbers and her teacher, exasperated, puts her effort in anyway. On the day the capsule is buried Lucinda goes missing and is eventually found in a basement closet scratching more numbers into the door. We now switch to Massachusetts of the present day (2009) where MIT professor, John Koestler lives alone with his son Caleb. It just happens that Caleb attends the same school that Lucinda went to 50 years before. On the day of the opening of the capsule Caleb is handed Lucinda's envelope, which he takes home. John sees the numbers and is intrigued by them. He works out that the numbers represent disasters that have happened in the past, along with the number of fatalities and the location. The trouble is, there are three events that are yet to happen! He tries to find Lucinda, but she had died some time ago, but she had a daughter, Diana Wayland. John eventually tracks Diana down; she too has a daughter, Abby. As the predictions from Lucinda's numbers come true, John realises what the last event will be and what the consequences are for the entire human race. I think that's enough spoilers for one day! <br/><br/>It's a very well made film with a lot of use of CGI, possibly too much IMHO. There's plenty of excitement to keep the tempo up and quite a decent soundtrack. An element of mystery kept me interested until the end, but I did find it a little too long. Decent performances from all of the major players, honourable mentions go to Nicolas Cage as Professor Jonathan 'John' Koestler, Chandler Canterbury as Caleb Koestler, Rose Byrne as Diana Wayland and Lara Robinson as Abby Wayland & Lucinda Embry.<br/><br/>It's not the best film of its genre, but it's certainly not the worst. I found it pretty entertaining and the mystery of the 'strangers' kept me enthralled (I know I didn't mention them earlier). Over all, it's a little over long and relies a little too heavily on CGI, but apart from that it's not all that bad. Recommended for entertainment & mystery, but you'll probably only watch it once.<br/><br/>My score: 7.1/10"
"happygoluckyduck","8","1","4","6 February 2010"," On a scale of one to Casablanca, this film is a ""Big Fish"" (2003)
","Review:<br/><br/>If I had to make a thematic comparison, I would say Andrew Proyas' 'Knowing' is the action film equivalent of '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968). Though it is no masterpiece like '2001', 'Knowing' suggests the same thing '2001' did – that determinism and coincidence, intelligent design and natural selection - the great differing viewpoints on the nature of our existence - may not be at odds after all; they may be counterparts to a greater whole.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage plays John Koestler, an MIT professor who has recently lost his wife. He lives in a beautiful but shabby home in Lexington, Massachusetts with his ten year old son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury). At Caleb's school there is a ceremony where a time capsule is opened. Fifty years earlier a classroom of students was asked to draw pictures of how they pictured the future and to place their pictures in this time capsule. Lucinda, (Lara Robinson), a seemingly disturbed child in the class does not draw the future. Instead she lists a seemingly chaotic sequence of numbers. Now, fifty years later, John Koestler gets a hold of this list through his son and begins to see an alarming pattern emerge from the numbers.<br/><br/>In some respects, 'Knowing' is similar to popular contemporary mysteries like, say, 'The Da Vinci Code.' The main course of the film follows Koestler as he scampers throughout the east coast trying to find clues to what's going on and reassuring himself that the list of numbers means what he thinks it means. Along the way Koestler encounters Diane Wayland (Rose Byrne), the daughter of the numbers-writer Lucinda, and Diane's daughter Abby (Lara Robinson again). They embark on a mission to find the missing clues for discovering the secret of the numbers. All the while they are being pursued by mysterious, pale men called 'the whisper people' by Caleb and Abby. <br/><br/>Like in Andrew Proyas' previous films 'Dark City' (1998) and ""I, Robot"" (2004) there is both visual and philosophical food for thought at work here. The central question of 'Knowing' is clearly stated at the beginning of the film by Cage's character when he asks his students in a lecture whether they think the universe is inherently deterministic or a series of random events. As we know, determinism suggests a higher intelligence controls existence while randomness implicates a meaningless sequence of accidents led to our existence.<br/><br/>I've always thought determinism excluding randomness and vice versa is a limited way to think about the nature of things. We have such a frustrating inclination to seek out mutually exclusive answers. For me, 'Knowing' suggests that the universe is in fact deterministic on a grand scale but that determinism is fueled by smaller, random occurrences, if that makes any sense. The end is already written but it is only reached through the decisions of individuals trying to avoid that very end.<br/><br/>Rating:<br/><br/>On a scale of one to Casablanca, this film is a ""Big Fish"" (2003).<br/><br/>Rationalization:<br/><br/>To express my honest opinion about this film, I'd say I thought the ideas it evokes are more intriguing than the film itself. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Most films do not attempt to evoke cosmic ideas at all. Most films only evoke the idea that love is good. 'Knowing' is a thought provoking film that banks on time honored sleuth plot devices. Some of the disaster sequences are exquisite though, especially the plane crash and the final disaster. I would even go so far as to say that the final ten minutes of the movie is what elevates 'Knowing' above most mystery-thrillers. The last ten minutes are visionary. They made me think back to ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" And yet, when I think about ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" I must admit that 'Knowing' pales in comparison."

The premise of a girl predicting events 50 years into the future by using a sequence of numbers is very well done, and the obvious predictability here is that Nicholas Cage will inevitably come across some predictions that haven't yet happened. But the suspense is well balanced, and the real problem this movie has is that the build up to the finale is so well organised, that there is no way they can end the film adequately. In the end, we are almost forced to accept an ending not so much cheesy as positively laden down with cheddar. But thankfully the producers steered away from the cliché ridden 'America saves the world' type of curtain faller - goodness knows how much messier it could have been had Bruce Willis and not Cage been the star name. And that then got me thinking about endings and movies in general. It never ceases to amaze me just how much some movies divide audiences, and in some cases are we expecting too much? Shouldn't the function of movies ultimately be to set out to entertain and do we get too self centred and precocious about some titles? Frankly, there is enough pacy tension and entertainment in the opening hour of this film to more than paper over the cracks, and if Spielberg had been at the helm, we would have all been heralding it as a work of genius."

","What follows is a spoiler. Please read this before considering watching this movie.<br/><br/>So, what is this story about. Life on Earth is about to be extinct because of some radiation storm whatever. The Earth is actually burnt by the sun. And this is not going to happen in a long time after this present day, when the sun WILL burn the Earth while becoming a supernova. It happens in 2009.<br/><br/>Now, some alien species knows this. They know as early as ... 50 years ago. They have far more superior technology than us (you should see their spaceships) but ... they do not consider using it to save our planet. Do they have some directive which sounds like the Star Treck do not interfere thing? Who knows. Anyway, these aliens do not want to save our planet, they only want to rescue 2 kids, male and female, so that the human species can ""survive"" (wow, and here we go again with the debate: will they be cloned or what, brothers mating sisters ?) More probably they want 2 specimens to put them into a galactic zoo, but hey, it's definitely not clear in the movie either, believe me.<br/><br/>So, the film is about how do this aliens get the 2 kids.<br/><br/>Well, they begin by whispering to a little girl of 50 years ago, stuff that drives her crazy. They whisper to her the date, location and number of victims of future major accidents, terrorist attacks, plane crash, you name it, for the next 50 years, culminating with the great accident that wipes us all out.<br/><br/>The school of the little girl (who is American by the way) wants to make a event to celebrate the school's anniversary, and they choose (wow) this little girl's idea - lets make a time capsule .... the kids all make drawings for kids 50 years later to open ... while the girl writes numbers, numbers, numbers, incessantly ...<br/><br/>OK, so the alien plan goes on. 50 year later. The kid who gets this curious letter is the son of a astrophysicist. He has lost his wife in a fire one year ago. He is very troubled by this ... He is also the son of a pastor. He does not speak to his father (presumably because he is a pastor while the son has ""chosen"" science). This astrophysicist (I'll refer to him as Nicolas Cage to make it simpler) actually makes sense of the numbers, and finds those accidents cited in this coded letter all on the Internet. He even gets involved in both of the next 2 on the list .... while the last mentioned there is ... you guessed it, the LAST one.<br/><br/>He manages to get in touch with the daughter of the little girl who once wrote the letter. She also has a daughter. Both their kids have the same ability of hearing whispers ... remember the aliens? It is not clear why these particular kids hear the whispers - are they chosen, or the aliens whisper to all the kids, but only these 2 have begun hearing them ...<br/><br/>Anyway, to make it short, well yes, the sun will burn the Earth, these 2 kids will go with the aliens, while Nicolas Cage dies in peace (unlike many of the rest of ""us""), returning home to his father, because the revelation to him was that aliens saving his kid (or kidnapping his kid) means there is ""something"" more after death ...<br/><br/>Lets add some details - black stones all over the place means the aliens are near. The aliens are revealed in the end to be angel like creatures of light, still, when they take human form, they cant help but look very creepy. They also have the ability to open their mouth and emit a very intense light which will blind you and allow them to go away (while you're blinded).<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage thinks him calling the FBI will make them stop the traffic in a specific area. When he realizes this is not true, he argues with a policeman about it. He also thinks a terrorist got scared and ran because he stared at him.<br/><br/>Let me see what else I can remember. Oh yes, the first little girl, the one with the letter, commits suicide (why didn't the aliens rescue her, she was listening to their whispering and getting crazy because of it - oh yes, but that was also part of their plan).<br/><br/>The 2 kids get also to go away to their new world with 2 bunnies. And the final setting with their new world, when I think about it, it just reinforces my idea that it is a galactic zoo where these 2 kids are held in display.<br/><br/>OK, so this is it. Considering this kind of script, would you consider spending all the money, energy and effort it takes to make a movie out of this??? For me, this is a new low in how stupid can a movie get and how vast amounts of money can be spent on garbage in this world (instead of designing a device to save us from the sun hi hi hi).<br/><br/>Hope you do not go to see this. But it might work if you expect it to make you laugh."

","I'll give it a two - it started out fine. However, the initial hook has some really bad logical flaws that should have warned me. As the movie continued, the two main adult characters proceeded to engage in increasingly contradictory, stupid reactions (and I'm a parent as are these two protagonists) that, well, prove the point of the vast majority of watchable movies - it's the plot, stupid. If you want a good, solid science fiction movie, avoid this. It is what some idiot Hollywood script writer thought was science fiction. If you like Nicolas Cage, I guess you might find the movie tolerable. I will avoid anything written by Rune Douglas Peason and Juliet Snowden again."

","Is it fair to say that a movie must utilize the plot devices it presents to its audience in a full circle? If I show you lemons, water and sugar and tell you I am making a drink, is it fair for you to assume I am making lemonade? Would you not be shocked if you drank my concoction and instead of tasting sweet and tarty lemonade you were instead met with Dr. Pepper? I found myself thinking about this while watching 'Knowing'. The film is an insult to standard human intelligence and that is an understatement. I recall seeing the trailer and thinking, 'this is a movie I will not be seeing.' But I found myself watching it just a few hours ago.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage is only capable of playing Nicholas Cage. There is no difference between his character in this film and his performance in, 'The Rock' or 'Con Air'. This was my first problem with the film and a primary issue which I kept coming back to. There is nothing wrong with an actor who adds his own personal touch to a character but Cage is no Brando or Nicholson. He just thunders through scenes with bad hair and an even worse attitude. Cage spends most of the film rushing through crowds and barking orders. He seems to always be in the right place at the right time. He is confused, but at the same time he knows where he is going. I want to feel for the protagonist but I cannot feel a thing for this person because he is Nicholas Cage.<br/><br/>Another issue is one that has plagued the psychological thriller for years. The use of a creepy kid as a vehicle for plot. This film has not one but three! To be fair, the first creepy kid is necessary for the plot. But they make Cage's son and his Love Interest's daughter creepy as well. There is some kind of statement to be made about the purity of the child's soul in this film but I cannot bring myself to acknowledge that there can be such a concrete idea in all of the muck and mire.<br/><br/>Coming back to my Lemonade analogy, I cannot help but feel that this film has difficulty deciding what it actually is about. There is just too much going on. There are aliens, precognitions and disasters. This is all mashed together in an ugly cooking pot and then heartily seasoned with an unhealthy amount of apocalypse. The end result is aggravating and tiring. I was lead to believe one thing up until the very end and then it turned out to be something completely different. I have not problem with a twist but this was ridiculous. Also, the Christian undertones really left a sour taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>I would also like to take this time and address the awful dialog. I am not one to be nitpicky about it but I must be brought up. There is a scene where Cage is talking with his sister. She explains that Cage's dead wife had one wish and that wish was that her son would have a lasting relationship with Cage's estranged father. WHY???!!!???!?!?!?! When you mix that with the vomit inducing ending dialog between Cage and Son and Cage and Father it is enough to make suicide sound appealing.<br/><br/>Hollywood has become a singularly offensive bile inducing factory bent on the exploitation of tired ideas. This movie is no exception- it is in fact a poster child for this awful movement. 'Knowing' is a mish mash of overused ideas and in the end it is just outright bad. If you want twists and turns with a rewarding twist just rent a Hitchcock movie or 'The Usual Suspects'. This is film is simply sick and feeble. If it were a barn yard animal I would hope it would be taken out, behind the barn, and put out of its misery.<br/><br/>I submit a movement be started whose soul purpose is removing Nicholas Cage from movies forever. He is like the socially awkward son of a great business owner whose allowed to continue working at one of his dad's stores even though he constantly makes mistakes and is detrimental to any form of progress."

","This has one of the stupidest plots I've seen in years. Perhaps it started out combining the religious and disaster elements in a way that made sense, but clearly by the time the studio was done with it, it made no sense at all. Why was the list of disasters sent before they happened? No explanation is ever offered. Since it is demonstrated that knowing beforehand did not mean that they could be prevented, what on earth was the point, except to say, Hey, look! We can send a list of numbers to some kid, who'll write it down without knowing what it means! But what was the purpose? And what is with Cage's haircut? Just because he's a professor, he doesn't have to have such an ugly haircut."

","There is a reason why I don't listen to critics or audience reactions before deciding to get of my couch go for a movie I believe could be good. It was again clarified with Knowing by Alex Proyas who gave the great ""Dark City"" comes back with an absorbing sci-fi that will keep you by the hook for the whole length.<br/><br/>Without going into the nitty-gritty of the plot, the movie revolves around the nature and existence of our being. Whether it is deterministic, derived from a defined set and sequence of circumstances or just probabilistic (randomness). It is not a unique theme but not explored in this fashion. We have seen it in Matrix, Dark City and few others. But the drama is unique to the film.<br/><br/>Knowing is not without some problems, especially with some of the writing as the mystery unfolds, but it is fair to say there is absolutely nothing you can preempt. Proyas is a top director and story teller and I feel comforted to submit to his narrative.<br/><br/>Top Sci Fi, falls short of greatness, but aspires for it and succeeds for best part."

","Creators used rumors about UFOs, stories about the end of the world from the Bible and played on the sentiments of the crowd that humanity - navel universe, therefore worthy of salvation. Not Jesus was a savior in the film, but humanoids-aliens, not the court of God chose ""the righteous"", but newcomers from space. Then why in the movie mentions faith and religion, why the film has characters phrases like ""we will all be together"", why the aliens glow and with transparent wings like angels? For what all this mysticism?! <br/><br/>Planet will be burned because of the random flash on the Sun, but about it the aliens know of at least half a century, and they are silent. Who now, after this, our elder brothers of the mind? :) Maybe they were the cause of this outbreak?! Actually in the movie is not all in order with the mind of the newcomers (may be because their brains glowed as Christmas garland). They trying to say about the end of the world through telepathy, but they can not simply use the TV. They have space ships, which for 50 years can to remove from the Earth all population, but they did not want to do so. Then why would they save the ""chosen"" children? Where is common sense? Or aliens have the highest, the so-called ""divine"" sense? This means that aliens play the role of the gods, which punishes ""sinners"" and save the ""righteous""?! I feel sick of this vision of the creators of the film. I am convinced that the more advanced civilization should be less severe and must more to appreciate life. The Roman Empire fell because the foundation of its prosperity was slave labor. Napoleonic hordes, Nazi of Third Reich (with their primitive ideology and violence) were defeated by peace-loving East Slavs (Ukrainian, Russian, Belarusian), which had never attacked first and had defended themselves from attacks of enemies throughout all their history. Any civilization, based on a cult of cruelty, will be destroyed. Therefore, there can be no civilization of Predators and other militant aliens (such as in the movie ""Independence Day""). Therefore, aliens from the movie “Knowing” should have to rescue all the people of Earth (even more so that they could easily do so), rather than play the role of tiny gods.<br/><br/>In short, the movie is ""suxx"" and also have ""no boobs!"", so please ""author! drink poison!

","This movie is bad in every way it is possible for a movie to be bad, and even invents a few new ones. I don't have a problem with the Aliens-are-Angels / Bible-is-History tripe, though god knows it's been done to death - no sci-fi editor would ever accept this kind of hackneyed rubbish at two cents a word. But this movie doesn't even make SENSE.<br/><br/>* What's with the sheet of numbers that kicks off the whole story? We never find out. Why was this 'message' provided? (Never mind HOW.) And why in this peculiar way?? They numbers are almost impossible to decipher - surely super-powerful aliens (or angels from heaven) could have provided the information in a clearer form! (Even punctuation would have helped.) But either way, what's the point? Even once deciphered - by the wildest accident - it's clear that no one can actually do anything about this information. And it certainly has nothing to do with the resolution of the story.<br/><br/>* Why does the girl in 1959 hide in the school basement and scratch her last few numbers in a door, instead of writing them down? Couldn't she find a pencil? And more importantly, why does she write all the death tolls as numbers, EXCEPT the very last one?? And why does she write just that one not only backwards (!!) but in some sort of l33t shorthand that pretty much guarantees anyone reading it would misinterpret it as ""33""???<br/><br/>* Why do ALL the other numbers refer to disasters, yet the very last one refer to an all-important rescue location? In fact, why bother specifying this rescue location, when the angels/aliens are apparently quite happy to grab the kids and take them there? Was it actually important for someone to get this 'message'? (And if so, why make it so $!@$%* hard to read???)<br/><br/>* Later on, when Cage finds his son scribbling down numbers, why why WHY does he interrupt him?? (He actually tears the sheet of paper from under the kid's pencil.) At this point, Cage knows how important these numbers are. Wouldn't a further message be exactly what he'd want??<br/><br/>* When Cage tries to save the two families, why does the mother first believe him then arbitrarily disbelieve him? Why do we spend twenty vital minutes in the last act of the movie watching Cage chasing her around?? Isn't this is a really, really annoying distraction from any huge plot about aliens / angels / the end of the world?<br/><br/>* Why do the mysterious aliens/angels save only children? (And bunnies???) They seem powerful enough; why not save hundreds, or even thousands of educated experts? (Or dolphins? Or earthworms?) Why not deflect the solar flare? (They seem amply capable of such deeds.) And why wander around in the dark, scaring people before saving them? What do these men (no women) - or the events of the film - have to do with Biblical prophecies? Have these creatures been here before? Did they plant premonitions? If so, why??<br/><br/>* What's the deal with the black rocks? They don't match any legend or Biblical reference I can think of. They have no obvious symbolic meaning. They don't even have any clear role within the plot (such as it is). The aliens/angels give one to the boy, which makes it seem special, a message maybe, or an amulet of some sort. Yet we later find them under the crazy lady's bed, and strewn ankle-deep in the woods. Hunh??<br/><br/>* Why does the abandoned Cage suddenly seem to get Religion? (Or at least Faith.) Aliens came and saved his son. Cool. But it proves nothing about the universe in general. Human civilization is being arbitrarily destroyed. Not cool. In fact, such a monumentally hard thing to accept, it's very likely to make one flee to some sort of illusory refuge. Proves nothing, except that humans are weak and the Universe is full of arbitrarily cruel events. As Cage says right at the start: ""basically, sh*t just happens."" In this film, it certainly does.<br/><br/>I guess devoutly religious viewers won't be put off by the lack of logic. But this isn't religion, it's fiction. How could tens of millions of dollars in hard Hollywood cash come to be squandered in filming such an appalling mess of a script? 'Knowing' makes M Night Shyamalan look like Stanley Kubrick. Did Proyas think he was expressing some genuine Christian spiritual revelation? If so, then he should realize that the fervor of one's beliefs doesn't magically negate all the basic laws of dramatic structure.<br/><br/>I've been a huge fan of Proyas' previous work - not just Dark City, but also the enormously under-rated I Robot. Hopefully, with Knowing he's gotten something off his chest, and he'll be ready to go back to just making movies, as opposed to delivering apocalyptic revelations."

","OK. The movie had some great scenes, some interesting moments with good acting and that was all. The basic problem is that the storyline makes no sense. Why are there these warnings when no one can do anything about them, how do the aliens know the future, why are the kids the chosen when it was the professor that ""broke"" the code, why do they choose only human children (and no other animals) from the doomed planet, what were the peddles for? and many many more questions arise as you try to find some logic in the movie. The thirty first minutes were OK. After that I believe the writer of the script had too many drinks exactly like Nikolas Cage had in the movie."
"wavelengthgames","3","1","4","6 June 2009"," How did this film get a 6.7?
","I'd give this film at best a 5, and more like a 3. I usually like Nick Cage and he's a great actor, but he was wasted on this role. The main problem with the film is that it has what I call a ""30 Second Solution"". In other words, there's a shortcut to the ending that doesn't require the story in-between. The best example, without giving away the plot of this film, is Lord of the Rings. The 30 second solution is Frodo flies one of the giant eagles over Mt Doom and drops in the ring. 30 second solution. This film has a similarly simple finality.<br/><br/>The script has many problems that I won't detail as they would be real spoilers. Suffice to say that their is no heroic character in this tale because there is nothing to save.<br/><br/>I thought all of the acting performances were lackluster. I wasn't convinced by anyone, not even the characters that were meant to be frightening. The part of the sister was just bizarre.<br/><br/>I have a big problem with the darkness of the film. I understand that the director wanted to get across the heaviness of the theme, but some of the scenes are so poorly lit you almost miss the action. I found myself begging silently for some light.<br/><br/>Apologies to those who worked hard on this film, because your talents were wasted. In short, the special effects are weak, the script is severely flawed and the acting is mediocre."

Then when that apparently doesn't help, only 2 are taken (male + female), to a planet just like Eden. The message here just escapes me. Here are some of my groping attempts.<br/><br/>1 Science is evil and can't save you. 2 We are evil and need to be destroyed. 3 You will feel better when the World is destroyed if you believe. 4 These aliens know this and are in fact angels or agents for God. 5 You can't escape your fate, or is it destiny?<br/><br/>How did the aliens know these things would happen? Why tell a kid about hundreds of disasters, when they MUST know the information on a piece of paper, is going get put in the ground for 50 years? Where any of 3 remaining predictions changed because: 1 You can't do that. 2 You don't know how to do that. 3 You are not supposed to do that.<br/><br/>No answer is given, and we the viewer are kept in the dark on where and when and how many victims, these remaining tragedies will claim for far too long. The real clincher that this is a ""expletive deleted"" flick is when Nicolas Cage's son in the movie, starts to write these numbers that predict nasty future events. And the logical thing here to do is to rip it up, which of course Nicolas Cage does. The point here is, he KNOWS what it means, but he already KNOWS that the end of everything is also the next day. So WTF was being predicted by his son?<br/><br/>This movie for me looks like an over zealous attempt by religious radicals on why relying on science is foolish, and whatever is going to happen it is all part of Gods plan. If that is so then God is saying: ""I f**ked up, and now I'm starting it all over again, but this time I'll get it right!""<br/><br/>The longer I watched this movie, the more frustrated I got, and now that I've seen it all, it feels like something poohed in my brain."
"PumpkinPieRules","2","1","4","29 April 2009"," Such wasted potential
","Note: This is my first review, so if it is a little choppy I apologize.<br/><br/>This film starts off with an elementary school boy receiving a paper, with seemingly random printed numbers, from a time capsule buried 50 years before. After some difficulty, John (the child's father), decodes the numbers hidden meaning and realizes that the numbers have correctly predicted every disaster from the past 50 years.<br/><br/>At first glance it seems like a good premise to the film. Unfortunately, it does not continue on the same path. After all that John's child, Caleb, begins hearing all these sounds coming from an unknown group of people called ""The Whisper People"". These same people are the primary reason of the downfall of this movie.<br/><br/>These people continually haunt Caleb and Abby (one of the later characters introduced in the movie who is about the same age as Caleb). The two parents of these two lovely children act incredibly stupid because they do not seem to realize that whenever they leave the children alone ""The Whisper People"" seem to magically come out of nowhere. On one occasion I remember John ends up chasing on of the people into the forest, only to be blinded by a very large blue light that comes out of the dude's mouth; at this precise moment in the movie I completely lost faith in it having any amount of logic whatsoever.<br/><br/>As the plot goes on, it is realized that the last prediction of the numbers is an apocalyptic type event that will kill everyone. This makes John very emotional (which is quite funny considering Nicholas Cage is portraying him). In the end we are told that ""The Whisper People"" are actually guardian angels of some sort that were protecting everyone after all(big surprise). OK, think about that for one second, guardian angel alien type things sent to protect us, we don't even know were they are from or who sent them. Why, you may ask. Simply because the movie NEVER tells us. Now I don't know about you but that bit of information would have been rather intriguing but I guess we will never know.<br/><br/>The kids are taken by those alien guard things and are set off somewhere to ""start over"". Where are they sent? Again, I don't know because the movie conveniently leaves out some important information.<br/><br/>The actual scene where the children are taken is laughable at best. They are taken in this clear glowing globe looking thing of some sort of thing. They then go up into the ""larger ship"" I suppose which looks more to me like spinning top. Imagine looking at a large glowing CGI spinning top in the sky and you pretty much have the the ship.<br/><br/>What happens to John? Luckily the movie actually *gasp* answers this question. He goes to see and wait out the event with his family. He then reconciles with his father who he has had a grudge against (grudge is not known of course) and turns to religion in a way after being an atheist the entire movie.<br/><br/>To sum it all up this movie just left out too much information to be considered good. I would have loved to know more about those guardian angel beings. Also Nicholas Cage was not a good choice for the lead role in this movie. I'm not saying he isn't a good actor but seeing him go all emotional just makes me laugh instead of sympathize. Lastly, the film just got to unbelievable. I'm not saying that a paper with random numbers predicting every known disaster from 50 years is believable, I'm just saying that a bunch of guardian angel other worldly beings is just completely illogical in way I feel my knowledge is being challenged in a way. I mean even the list of number predictions has some logic, it's a phenomena called Pareidolia. If the movie would have stayed on the same course it started instead of drifting off into the realm of illogical things, it would have been a much better film. Unfortunately it did not do that."

I kid you not! <br/><br/>Others will describe the plot in more detail but basically Nick Cage's son gets a letter from a school time capsule with numbers in it that when transcribed details the date, location and the number of dead of specific disasters (past and future). Nick Cage goes about trying to resolve it while weird looking men (aliens/angels) whisper the truth to his kid and it all turns out there's a sun flare that's going to toast the earth. The angels are there to save a few good children.<br/><br/>The special effects of the plane crash and some early parts showed this film had potential but the ending where the aliens/angels take the kids to the new world and Nick and his parents/sister group hug while they're engulfed in a global BBQ was just so off the scale that I just laughed.<br/><br/>My sister walked out half-way through the film and I thought that was the best move all night."

","Knowing is without a doubt one of the most intriguing movies of all time. Think along the lines of Julianne Moore in ""The Forgotten"" but in every way better. It presents the question: What do you do, what CAN you do if you know something bad is going to happen before it happens? <br/><br/>Many MANY will be challenged by the ending, but in my opinion that's a little like being upset that so many people drowned in the Poseidon Adventure. It's a movie about a guy who has fore knowledge of disasters... people are gonna die, and there's always a chance that it may not end as you hoped (which is true of any action movie). Along the way you will enjoy watching a movie where the characters have to deal with circumstances that they do not all of a sudden become super-humans with knowledge and abilities not present at the beginning of the movie in order to tackle them... you know, like in real life. In that sense it is styled like one of the classic 50s horror movies, but it is not ""horror,"" but rather thought provoking science fiction. <br/><br/>Simply put, if you enjoy movies on their own merit, if you enjoy watching a mystery unfold, this movie is one of the best ever!"

","John Koestler (Nicolas Cage) is a divided man. The death of his wife has not only left him a single parent to their son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury), but also leaves him questioning fate as well. Is there a reason why things happen? Or, do things happen for no reason? As a MIT astrophysicist, the question isn't one of mere scientific thought. It is now very personal and one which John hides from by finding a bottle.<br/><br/>John Koestler, unfortunately, will have an answer to his question.<br/><br/>The Knowing is a movie about fate and whether or not we can change the future. The question is also whether we would want to know the future even if we couldn't change it. Fate is something that has been written about before and been the center of many movies in the past. The Knowing takes the question into standard direction but with some special effects that are horrifying. However, the problem with the Knowing isn't a predictable ending but the fact that it takes some rather strange events to get there.<br/><br/>The discovery of a piece of paper covered by a series of strange numbers suddenly captures John's attention. The numbers, and the paper itself, were taken from a time capsule from Caleb's school which was buried 50 years earlier. John discovers that the numbers are not random and in fact give the exact date, location, and casualties for a series of natural and man made disaster. While a scientist, John realizes that what he has is something that is unexplainable.<br/><br/>John learns that the numbers were written by a school girl named Lucinda Embry (Lara Robinson) in 1959. Lucinda is now dead, but her daughter Diana Wayland (Rose Byrne) is still alive. John tracks her down only to discover that she is also a single parent but that, most of all, she wants nothing to do with the memory of her mother. During this time John has already witnessed a plane crash which the numbers predicted. By the time that Diana is able to speak to him about her mother, he also experiences a subway disaster that claims more lives in New York.<br/><br/>Caleb and Diana's daughter Abbey (Lara Robinson) discover a secret as well. The ""whispers"" that Abbey's grandmother Lucinda suffered from soon begin ""speak"" to them. John and Caleb have also noticed that strange men dressed in black have shown interest in them as well even though the men have always disappeared before they are confronted. John finds himself under more pressure as he attempt to solve the mystery of the numbers while protecting his son.<br/><br/>The Knowing is a movie that promises suspense but fails to deliver. Chandler Canterbury is underwhelming at playing a character who has been placed into the center of fate. He seems half asleep during most of the movie. John is the only character who is built up while Caleb, Diana, and Abbey are given almost secondary roles around his character. John's sister Grace (Nadia Townsend) only has a few lines which give little hint as to their relationship except that John and his father had a falling out. The characters of Grace and even Diana seem almost unnecessary. If the end result is predictable, which it is, then the Knowing should have chosen better characters. <br/><br/>The only thing that stands out in the Knowing is the final scenes in which the Earth is consumed in a solar flare. The whispering men, angels or aliens depending upon your view, rescue Caleb, Abbey, and other children (so we are hinted at) and remove them to a new world to start over. They knew that the world would be destroyed so they gave hints of the destruction to a certain few. Why those choose who they did is never answered but the guess is easy enough. Kids are pure and they have faith. They can believe in the future despite the unknown that surrounds it. <br/><br/>M. Night Shyamalan couldn't have come up with a better over the top moral ending. The problem for the Knowing is that even with him it is doubtful that it would have been a movie worth watching again. <br/><br/>6/10"

","I need to start listening to my instincts. I skipped this at the theater and only rented it reluctantly. Turns out my gut feeling was right. The film falls apart at the beginning of the third act, shifting gears from a taut thriller to a ludicrous kid-stealing-aliens movie, with everyone on Earth dying just before the hero's son winds up in some kind of alien petting zoo.<br/><br/>It's ""The Forgotten"" meets the remake of ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"". Rent it if you want to feel cheated and depressed at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Nick Cage's acting is passable, which is good because about 95% of the movie is him looking pensive, him drinking heavily, him looking scared, him crying or him running through crowds of extras. Rose Byrne is very watchable, it's a shame she's only on screen for about 10 minutes before being killed. The rest of the cast is decent, they just have nothing to do except stand around and burst into flames in the penultimate scene. I think 50% of the film's budget was spent on flame effects for the end of the movie, by the way. Effects for the rest of the film are sparse and somewhat unconvincing. <br/><br/>It's annoying that this was directed by Alex Proyas, who directed The Crow and Dark City, two very good movies."

","Well it was touch and go for a moment there. My interest in seeing Knowing stemmed from hearing how insanely wrong headed it was, but for quite a long while I just thought it was appealingly bad. It came through though. Actually for the first hour or so I was capably entertained, sure I was cringing or laughing at it but I wasn't bored. The plot is utter bunk, a religious parable uncomfortably wrapped in apocalyptic science fiction, its themes brayed with all the grace and subtlety of a naked street preacher farting into a loudspeaker (chaos vs. determinism, science vs. faith) and their resolutions as predictable as night and day, and the gears that move it asinine (a professor cracking a code with the powers of pattern recognition and perseverance that any serious researcher knows can only come of a whiskey fuelled all nighter), but it moves at a reasonable clip and is unusual enough to intrigue. It also packs a couple of surprisingly ballsy disaster set-pieces in the first half, pretty silly but more viscerally intense than expected. So despite few of the character decisions and none of the dialogue feeling natural, and despite the screen-writers omitting to even inject contrived likability to bring the characters above absolute baseline interest, for a while I was disappointedly thinking that Knowing was just a standard bit of entertaining crap. Then meteoric, the path gets clearer, the pace more obvious and the interest starts to burn away, preparing for the ending. And boy oh boy what an ending. Two pronged, both predictable, one kinda cool and one far less so, the good stuff is kept to less than a minute and the bad is a virtual revelation. Hilariously ill conceived crypto racist lunacy with lame CGI effects work and messy symbolism, its jaw dropping stuff and well worth the wait. And it isn't just terrible but sufficiently terrible that it casts revealing light back on everything wrong with the rest of the film, even things that weren't immediately apparent. Put simply, highly satisfactory. The side benefits are Nic Cage committed as ever doing a restless nervous weirdness schtick that rather convinces, Rose Byrne being lovely as ever and some lady I never even heard of before called Nadia Townsend who appears a couple of times and is also lovely. Oh, and it generally looks good and whatnot, professionally enough made. All in all I couldn't possibly recommend this one on any genuine level, but it's definitely worth a watch for people who like really bad films. 3/10 (but a happy 3/10)."

","'Knowing...' Yes.<br/><br/>First big turn-off for me was the claim 'starring Nicholas Cage'. Cage is usually the first choice in a B-movie that has pretensions of being grand. He takes the concept of vulnerable hero into wearisome extremis. He's a one-dimensional actor, and that's what he does. Here, he's a widower tortured by memories relating to the death of his wife. Yes; that tiresome old chestnut. He's a science Professor, single-dad and he hits the bottle. Get the picture? Still, a trailer depicting a passenger-jet crash caught my eye and suggested further interest.<br/><br/>What develops is a slow-burning (gosh, you can say that again) yarn about - well - almost everything. There's children involved; which, in an American movie, is usually a very bad sign. A strange script comes to light, written 50 years before, that appears to predict most every disaster up to the present time, and then beyond. At some stage mysterious men in black begin appearing and start handing out... pebbles. Mysterious men handing out pebbles? Very, very mysterious.<br/><br/>The air-crash occurs as predicted. And mighty impressive it is, too. The movie then movies into its second phase - whither the secret knowledge on the script? Now Cagey enlists the help of a single mum (handy) and we embark upon a 'Da Vinci Code' style investigation that entails a lot of running, fast driving, scarcely-audible whispered dialogue in gloomy places and self-indulgent navel-gazing. Pebbles keep turning up! What's the score? Well, it seems there's a culminating disaster in the pipe. We're doomed. And these MIB turn out to be extra-terrestrials in disguise who mean to save our species - and some rabbits. But for some reason they're only taking children. Why no adults? Ah that's something we are left 'unknowing'. Why this long-winded 50 year old prediction-mystery? That's unknowing as well. What about - The Pebbles, then? They come from a dried-up river bed near the alien pick-up point. Significance unknowing, but mysterious.<br/><br/>So that's it. The Earth gets cauterised. A (very few) kids get saved to grow up into feral adults like those in 'Lord of the Flies'. There's special-effects a-plenty for those who manage to stay awake. Booming cords to prevent the bored from falling asleep, with enough base to burn out your sub-woofer. And that's about it. Put 'ET', 'Signs' 'The DaVinci Code', & 'MIB' in a blender; here's the result.<br/><br/>It stars Nicholas Cage; let that be a lesson to you."
"Spaceygirl","2","1","6","14 November 2010"," Overblown and silly
","""Knowing"" gets off to a promising start but deteriorates into silliness at the end. Alex Proyas, who directed the masterful and vastly superior ""I, Robot"" gets all ham-fisted with this one. The child actors are like stepford-children, the little girl in particular, one scene not even allowing her to grieve her mothers' death. The adult cast fare no better. Nicholas Cage approaches his role with his usual intensity, which is a pity. He seems to have lost the ability to enjoy himself in a role, especially seeing it's a disaster flick. Where' s John Cusack when you need him? Rose Byrne, of TV's "" Damages"", comes off as whiney and shrill. The script is silly, is full of plot-holes and descends into schmaltz and a thinly veiled attempt at Christian propaganda. It is also far too long and may have been improved with tighter editing. May have...but I doubt it."

It's a feeble attempt at a spooky movie with a quasi sci-fi ending tacked on. The only amusement value was recognizing which other movie the current shot was ripped off from.

","A couple of dull kids, a useless prophecy, rock-collecting Nostradummies, and a pair of white bunnies. No wonder Cage was cast in this turkey.<br/><br/>""This is not the end"", says Cage's religious Papa - mere minutes before the movie ends. Was I the only one laughing?<br/><br/>Only 10 minutes into the movie, and the cretinous Hollywood liberal propaganda machine strikes: Cage's annoying kid tells his lethargic Dad that he wants to become a vegetarian, and because the kid seems to have a 1556 IQ, this is naturally supposed to translate into ""see? see? it's intelligent people who turn vegan"". Audiences are generally easily brainwashed, but I still don't think Hollywood will succeed in making even 2-3 people stop eating delicious, HEALTHY meat products due to pitiful ""ads"" such as this. <br/><br/>Since when are PETArds commissioned to write science-fiction scripts, anyway? Granted, they do know a thing or two about fantasy since they live in a self-made world of utter FICTION, but they know zip about SCIENCE. I suspect that the first draft might have even included a scene in which the Nostradummies send vegan recipes to Earthlings - in form of confusing series of numbers, of course, because these aliens a**holes like playing mind-games with us poor human slobs. ""Hey, let's see if they figure out this one!"" <br/><br/>The first 10 minutes are over, and we're already bombarded with not one but TWO kids, one of which is a smart-ass. Must Spielberg's cheesy influence spread into every fantasy movie? <br/><br/>X-File-ish, ""mysteeeeeerious"", mute aliens. But at least they weren't effeminate-looking or as indiscriminate as the bug-eyed Spielbergian morons in ""Close Encounters OTTK"": those miserable creatures even let Richard Dreyfuss aboard! At least Proyas's Nostradummies had the sense to refuse Cage the much-coveted Galactic Visa, in spite of his whiny pleading. After all, who needs the Coppola Clan spreading their talentless seed throughout the universe? If there is anything positive to be said about Armageddon it's that it'd forever extinguish all traces of Barrymore, Arquette, Carradine, Coppola and Fonda DNA.<br/><br/>I'm mystified about the choice of bunnies, though. Why white? Do the leather-clad Nostradummies have something against yellow, gray, or black bunnies? Alien racists?... And why bunnies, of all critters? The aliens chose humans according to criteria such as intelligence and political correctness, yet are bunnies known for being smart? Or were hares simply too cute/snuggly for our Nostradummies to resist taking them aboard too?<br/><br/>Nostradummies predict the future (in minute detail, unlike Nostradamus's ridiculously vague poems), and yet they make no proper use of this knowledge: ""Listen, y'all, we must warn these Earthlings of a series of cataclysmic events, but we don't really want the warning to bear fruition. Basically, we want humanity to perish – while appearing like do-gooders. So no intergalactic e-mails. We'll provide them with dates/locations as random-looking sequences to some selfish, semi- autistic girl."" <br/><br/>If they're so psychic, why fail preventing the 50-year vault fiasco? How come they are psychic in the first place? (We're supposed to take that at face value - just because they're oh-so ALIEN.) Why would they bother with the list at all? (They could have just as easily appeared in the year 2009, picked up the kids'n'bunnies, and flown away - without all the Cage-related hoopla.) Why didn't the girl warn the world about each disaster? Was she a bitch, then? If the aliens are so nice why didn't they organize a major rescue party for more than just a few lucky kids and a pair of horny white bunnies? Why would the list even predict so many comparatively minor disasters when a huge one is about to strike? Why would the aliens wait until the LAST MOMENT to pick up their few ""chosen ones""? (And then dump them on some Utopist planet where white bunnies can eat their grass and shag all day) A plethora of loose ends and logic holes; I could have swore De Palma wrote it.<br/><br/>An alien race of ""whisperers"" (they can do just about any trick in the ""Intergalactic Magic Manual"") refuse to talk to humans, yet they have this vague intention of trying to save them. Basically, the whole thing was a charade, orchestrated just so Cage could wave a baseball bat while playing a scientist(!) in a daft Hollywood big-budgeter Why are all those peacenik Hollywood aliens always so friggin' uncommunicative? <br/><br/>And why are they always so THIN? But I guess that's because they're vegan, hence eat ""healthy"": the two bunnies are safe... Nostradummies send adult bunnies, but when it comes to humans they only want the young? Are the bunnies supposed to tutor and guide the human kids through puberty and adolescence? No? Then who is?? Don't those all- KNOWING aliens know how useless rabbits are as mentors?<br/><br/>You gotta love the schmaltzy ""agnostic-scientist-becomes-believer-again"" cliché ending, accompanied by the rape of Beethoven's 6th. They should have played some violins instead. ""Son-hugs-Papa in a at-long-last- family-reunion"". At least in ""Signs"" we had an ex-priest re-discover his faith, but here it's an astro-physicist. <br/><br/>Proyas tried desperately to make KNOWING philosophical, but the flick ends up like a MacDonald's balloon with ""I think therefore I am"" scribbled on it. KNOWING glorifies nonsense, while trying to make atheists and real science look foolish. Proyas's ambitions were lofty – but so were Ed Wood's. <br/><br/>The ending is supposed to be poignant, glorious yet devastating, humbling, thought-provoking, awe-inducing/hope-inspiring, disturbing. But it just ends up looking like another mindless Cage vehicle. Still, I've seen worse end-of-the-world, Sun-behaving-badly flops. Just think of ""Sunshine"". Or ""Last Night"": it's got Sandra Oh in it. She makes Cage look like Claudia Cardinale.<br/><br/>Love the last scene: the kids (as Adam & Eve, get it? get it?? the aliens are God) chuck away their bunnies, then walk towards the Great White Tree of Gondor. Where is Saruman and his deadly power when you need it?"

","Knowing is a modern time version of Ezekiel with Hollywood sprinkled in. Many say they don't see the parallels but there are so many. The book of Ezekiel is the most time documented book in the bible. He gives the date and the place of everything - just like the paper John's (Cage's character) son receives. Also, Ezekeil came from a family of priests. Likewise, Cage's character of John is the son of a preacher. Ezekiel's wife died and he's told not to mourn openly. John's wife died and he won't talk about it. Ezekiel starts acting really weird and so does John. The idea of a wheel within a wheel within a wheel within a wheel is so hard to understand when one reads Ezekiel. So is the concept of seeing an angel but not realizing it. However, the special effects at the end of the movie make those concepts so much more mentally tangible. I thought it was the most emotionally scary movie I've seen in a very long time."

In the real world there is nothing that we can do in such a situation.<br/><br/>2) for those who are interested in the aliens topic, there is something very interesting in this movie. The drawing they find in the house where Lucinda dies regards a passage from the Bible, where Ezequiel seems to see beings and their spaceships; a similar spaceship can be seen in the end of the movie. The ""angels"" or ""gods"" we know are simply these watchers from space who in fact are only interested in keeping our species but do not really care about us. We are indifferent for them as individuals, that's why they do nothing to save us.<br/><br/>3) Very good plot... time capsule with paintings from children kept for 50 years, etc...<br/><br/>It's worth watching (mainly if you like topics like ""Chariots of the Gods"" and so on) ! it's a pity that it has so many bad criticisms.

That's a proof that it has something big inside.<br/><br/>Indeed, I have never seen movies with such brilliant and haunting ideas, which linked together, form something powerful.<br/><br/>Here, they are:<br/><br/># Predicability or Fate: Are we free to decide or are we mere puppets? The lecture Cage delivers to his students is excellent because even my grandmother would have understand it<br/><br/># encrypted prophecies: breaking the code is thrilling. Here, film-making is better than a mere book because it brings visual strength to an idea barely explained by words. The google search is thus an excellent idea. Then, knowing what will happen is provocative. How can you prevent it? <br/><br/># Apocalypse: it's one of the rare movies in which ""everyone else"" is doomed. You get particularly anxious for the last moments. For Cage, those with his son and his last final heartbeats are really pretty moving. So sadness and love together, it's terrific! Again, the choice of Beethoven 7rd Symphony is pretty astute and it is something a book can't deliver (except if you switch on your Hi-Fi)<br/><br/># E.T. are God(s): Already seen in Indiana Jones and a great debate: it's sure that UFO (if they exist) are the fairy tales of our modern, technological societies, and that would happen like God(s) to the primitive men. It's maybe the weakest part of the movie, because I still don't understand if they are more ""chosen"".<br/><br/>In fact, all those questions is one single question, that's ""Is God exist""? If you try to answer this, you will have to answer all those thematic, and backwards, when you deal with any one of this thematic, you ask yourself this fundamental question and you do an act of belief, even if you aren't conscious And the better is that the movie can't answer clearly any of them!<br/><br/>All the cast/characters is excellent and moving: Cage as a single but lost father, his son as a mature and witty boy, his girlfriend with her fragility of having a terrible legacy!<br/><br/>In my opinion, it would have been the perfect final movie for the ""X-Files"". As a sequel is unlikely, it would have been an unforgettable goodbye, all the more poignant that with Mulder running all his life about UFO and Scully always wondering about God, they would have joined finally but shortly together!"

If you aren't a big fan of any type of propaganda film to get you to join a religion like I am, then I don't recommend this movie. I do recommend this movie if you are into disaster movies and big special effects. The acting in this movie is very subpar. Nicholas Cage is like what Sean Penn call's a ""performer"" rather than an actor so his performance is understandable. The female lead in this movie is by far one of the worst female leads I've ever seen in a disaster movie.

When a time capsule buried fifty years earlier is dug up at the boy's school, he chooses a piece of paper with a load of numbers on it as his memento- but this piece of paper holds the key to a series of disasters that have occurred since the time it was buried and, to Joe's horror, a series that are about to happen that he is powerless to stop...and the last one's looking set to be the end of the world.<br/><br/>Shoot me, I've gone and watched another Nicolas Cage film. His recent output of relentless mediocrity and outright crap should have made me avoid his name like the plague, and Knowing didn't look particularly interesting to watch. Selective director Alex Proyas has chosen this as his latest script, and his old style now seems completely out the window, and the style of his last film, 2004's I, Robot is back in this intriguing but undelivering end of the world thriller.<br/><br/>It's clever and a bit unsettling how the sums in the film really do add up to real life disasters in the last few years and how they're worked into the context of the film (if a little inconsiderate to the families of the victims?). What's less impressive is how utterly flat and and unremarkable the end result is. There is no genuine air of tension and suspense in the film, and the ending doesn't feel like it's resolved anything in relation to the rest of the film. Cage simply goes through the motions in the lead role (like we could have expected anything else?) and the supporting cast are stuck in the same boat. Some brilliant special effects sadly can't cover up all the other problems present. It's not awful, and is perfectly watchable in it's own way, but a more dynamic and comprehensible script and a director and lead actor with more verve could have produced much better results. **"

But the ending is very thought provoking. Maybe the most thought provoking ending in a recent sci-fi film since ""A.I."" and ""The Fountain"". Both flawed but daring movies.<br/><br/>Visually the film is mostly a marvel. Director Poyas has a firm grasp on powerful visual imagery used repeatedly as motif.<br/><br/>Bottom line: this daring film has an amazing amount of craftsmanship, decent enough acting, and very ambitious ideas<br/><br/>on the downside: ""Knowing"" suffers from enough plot holes to fill.. (insert clichéd line here), Cage has some ""worst acting ever"" moments. And the third act feels like it needed a rewrite or three hundred..<br/><br/>I should have hated it...but I can't. It's too ambitious a movie to easily dismiss. And since big budget spectacle movies are never ambitious and very rarely ""thought provoking"", I have to give ""Knowing"" it's props.<br/><br/>end kdc"
"dbdude7","9","1","6","23 March 2009"," Explanation of ending
","Overall the movie was very well put together, the acting was great, music was awesome, and the story keeps you on the edge of your seat. But I want to talk about the ending of the movie, I felt most people were a little confused about the ending. Basically the story is based on the prophecies of the Old Testament Prophet Ezekiel. He speaks of a giant wheel with lights coming down from the sky like the spaceship shown at the end of the movie. He also talks about 4 angelic beings in it he doesn't specifically say if they are aliens or angels. They aliens/angels do not take the kids but let the children decide if they want to go with them before the earth is destroyed by fire. In the end times in the book revelation God will destroy the earth with fire, just as he destroyed it with water but saved Noah. Whether the director was trying to say that there are angelic or alien beings that chose the fate of the beings of earth or trying to interpret the vague prophecy of Ezekiel is unknown. But at the end the children are dropped on a perfect planet with a tree possibly representing the Tree of Life like the one in the Garden of Eden. Whatever his reasons the director used biblical references to make the movie some true some not true. If you are further interested dive into the book of Ezekiel and read over some of the chapters he refers to."
"dallon-thorup88","8","1","6","23 March 2009"," To those who saw Knowing.... great movie!
","~SPOILERS~<br/><br/>To those of you who saw knowing and are confused. I went with a group of people who saw it and got confused, like a majority of people, about the ending. They are not aliens. They are guardian angels that take Caleb and Abby with them. It was their job to protect them and guide them into the direction of reaching them to replenish a new world after our world was destroyed. It can very easily be taken as aliens, but don't forget the main points in the story line that make this movie a religious/faith based film. Cages character questions the existence of heaven and how the earth came to be. His son believes in heaven. The father of Cage's character is a pastor, which is mocked by Cage in the film. Religion is a touchy subject, but they are known in the movie as ""The Whisper People"" because they are mysterious. There is no evidence of this being an alien movie, and don't think it is. The whisper people are guardian angels, telling these two children what they have to do. That is why at the end Cage's character is so keen on letting Caleb go. He realizes it is the only way to save his son, and himself.<br/><br/>Great movie. Great suspense. Great Acting. I love this one!"

The prophetic parts of the movie as well. No doubt about it. All I have to say is that was awesome. Great Job! That showed more truth than any of these other movies. There were no boring parts. At the end it is breath taking. The whole thing about a new heaven, and earth. Also the fact that the earth shall perish, and there be a new heaven and earth. That we are all children of God.

"freaky_dave","8","1","7","23 March 2009"," An enjoyable movie
","When I saw Knowing, I wasn't expecting much more than a sort of popcorn film like Day After Tomorrow. With Alex Proyas directing, the same director who brought us the wonderful Dark CIty as well as THe Crow, I should've known better. Knowing is not just a simple popcorn movie, it goes much deeper, just as Dark City did.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage plays John Koestler, a professor at a college and also a widowed father who is taking care of his young son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury). Fifty years ago a little girl, after hearing whispering voices, wrote random numbers on a sheet of paper which were buried in a time capsule. As you know, it is John's son who ends up with those numbers after the time capsule is pulled up in present day. Caleb takes the sheet of paper home with him and lets his father see it to see what those numbers might mean. John at first is upset with his son for not returning the sheet of numbers back to the school, but soon after while in a drinking binge, something he does a lot, he comes across certain familiar numbers and begins and investigation. WHat he discovers is that the numbers are actually dates of natural disasters as well as how many died and where they all happened. What's surprising is that all these events were prophesized by that little girl named Lucinda(Lara RObinson) fifty years before any of the events took place. THere are a few left on the list, which haven't occurred yet, and this leads to JOhn making an effort to stop them from happening. He enlists the aid of Lucinda's daughter Diana(Rose Byrne) to try and understand it all. Diana also has a daughter named Abby (Lara Robinson again) who seems to connect with Caleb in very important ways. This eventually leads all four down a path headed for a surprising conclusion. I will say no more for fear of spoiling what's to come.<br/><br/>THe acting in this movie was very well done. ALl the characters, including the two children, pulled their parts off well. SOme people complain about Cage, but he strikes the right notes here as a widowed father drowning himself in alcohol because of the death of his wife, only to improve once he realizes where everything is leading. THere are of course mysterious figures, just like the strangers in Dark City, who are more then what they seem.<br/><br/>Knowing has a lot of religious undertones. THis may be one of the reasons why people might be turned off by it. As I've read some critics reviews, I am already seeing a lot of negativity. It's a shame because Knowing goes much deeper than a lot of science fiction movies ever do. It is thoughtful and engaging, and I think that a lot of people will be talking about this movie for a long time.<br/><br/>SOme will read this review and wonder why I didn't give it a 10. Here's the reason why, and it involves the conclusion and the special effects. I had no problem with the religious undertones at all, but at the same time I think knowing less about the mysterious figures might've had more of an impact on viewers. THe final reveal becomes a little distracting. Of course none of this can really take a way from an otherwise good movie.<br/><br/>On a final note, even though some of the visuals were weak, the sound effects were quite awesome."
"skene19","9","1","7","23 March 2009"," Director: Proyas has done it again! Great film!!!!
","This my first attempt of expressing my thoughts on a film through ""imdb"" so bare with me here...<br/><br/>I watched ""Knowing"" last night and quite frankly, ""I was blown away!"" As a filmmaker myself, I've come to appreciate Alex Proyas' contributions to the Sci-Fi genre. ""The Crow"", ""Dark City"" and ""iRobot"" were all exception films to say the least, but ""Knowing"" is easily his most ambitious project to date. Along with those other movies, ""Dark City"" in particular, Proyas created another setting and/or look that was truly one of a kind. The viewer can't help to be transported into that particular time/place. With the use of incredible cinematography, and special effects, Proyas' visual style is definitely his greatest strength. He is now among my top ten favorite directors, and I feel he ranks up there with Ridley Scott, Peter Jackson, James Cameron, and Steven Spielberg in relation to Sci-Fi/Epic type filmmakers.<br/><br/>I'm not going to discuss the plot at all because every comment on here has done so already. All I have to say, like all films, this film isn't for everybody. ""Knowing"" requires an open minded viewer to understand and appreciate its ideas. I found this film surprisingly very thought provoking. Honestly, I went through every emotion while watching it. ""Knowing"" had everything I look for in a film and more. The acting was all very believable but I honestly think Proyas made that possible through his brilliant directing. Nic Cage was perfect for this role and the rest were all casted very well for their parts. <br/><br/>Overall, I was truly impressed by the direction and visuals of this film. As I predicted, the cinematography was top notch. This may sound bold but the special effects were revolutionary and ground breaking, in a sense. I realized this when I witnessed, no experienced, the plane crash scene. For those who have seen this film, I hope you noticed that scene was all ""one"" camera shot without any cuts. Meaning, there was 90 seconds of straight shooting blended with special effects. It looked amazingly terrifying. <br/><br/>There were several other moments throughout the film that had the feeling of ""awe inspiring"" and ""epic"" drawn all over them. Seriously, this film is worth seeing for the visuals alone. The professional critics are way off on their ""Knowing"" reviews. I was really surprised to see the poor ratings on the ""Rotten Tomatoes"" site. I mean, ""Watchmen"" has almost 3 times a better rating than this film. I read ""Watchmen"" and thought that was a horrible movie adaptation. I can't imagine what people thought of it who didn't read the graphic novel. It was so bad!!! Who knows what's going through the minds of some of these critics sometimes? <br/><br/>Anyways, ""Knowing"" is a must see, especially for those who love Science Fiction films. I know its only mid-March but its the best film of 2009 so far. I can't wait to experience it again."
"philipr09","Null","1","8","20 November 2011"," 'I Robot' guy needs oil-change...
","Utter tripe. The kind of movie 'Signs' could have been if Night Shyamalan had a death-wish (instead of merely wanting to sink his own career). Nicholas Cage's miserable, bereaved astrophysicist is handed a page full of numbers retrieved from a school's time capsule buried 50 years previously. Somehow, he works out that these numbers are a code that reveals when and where (but, unfortunately not HOW) certain disasters will occur, and the accurate death toll therein. Will this enable him to find some 'meaning' in everything, instead of just the random nastiness he suspects? This mildly amusing notion is rapidly flushed away in a toilet of dizzying, technically swish but ultimately pointless special effects (read 'body count orgies') and predictable 'apparitions' heralding much worse to come. Much worse for the world, and the movie... Alex Proyas gleefully has the planet torched as the finale (thanks Alex, that was...special) but the Cage character's young son and the daughter of his New Best Friend are spirited away by some seriously unconvincing aliens (duuhhhh!) to a delightful, sunny, pastoral new planet to 'start everything again'. Oh well, that's OK then...! Cage's performance (and indeed everyone else's) is, fittingly, by the numbers. Mr. Proyas, if tired of film making as this burnt offering would suggest, may do well to study astrophysics himself: more work needed on the effects of solar flares! ***0*** Two Glasses Later: actually, this piffle looks a whole lot better if you can view it as a bile-laden swipe at the movie 'system'. It would sort of make sense if it was a warning about everything in the industry being down to brutal (commercial) numbers that leave production possibilities on rails to a specific destiny -making expensive, effects-bound nonsense like this very movie! Because however awful they are, they will pay out ('Pearl Harbour', for example). It will all end with the inferno that engulfs good and bad, creative and dull alike. Just a thought..."

","Well... I got used to the fact that Nicolas Cage's talent only can be compared to a block of wood, but this is one of the most ridiculous movies ever.<br/><br/>Simply terrible, from story-wise and from acting-wise as well. By my best judgement only positive part of this movie is the Mazda3, which eventually is a great car (however this is my personal taste only).<br/><br/>When the car is not on the canvas, the movie is simply a piece of crap. Most of the time Nicolas Cage's face shows only three types of emotions: 1, dumb 2, desperate 3, dumb again<br/><br/>The rest of the actors are crap as well. The story is really inconsistent. It has some creepy scenes, but if you watch it during the daylight then you would only laugh because these plots only operate with the good old ""it is dark and there are creepy voices"" method.<br/><br/>Long story short, after you watch this even oprah will be a relief for you."

As with all movies i'm debating about watching, I consulted my trusty IMDb for ratings and reviews before deciding to take the plunge (the movie, not her).<br/><br/>Let me start by saying - the IMDb community has let me down.<br/><br/>Normally, a 6.4 rating would be watchable (entertaining, but not life-changing). This one? An absolute pile of steaming mess. The negative reviews really aren't doing justice to how absolutely bad this film is. Why? Because it's nearly inexplicable.

It's like we just assume any Hollywood film with big actors just MUST be good.<br/><br/>I honestly believe that the only >5 star reviews were given by Nicholas Cage himself.

"jboothmillard","4","1","9","12 April 2009"," Knowing
","I had seen one or two clips of this film, and thought it might be alright, and I was right, alright is all it will ever be, from director Alex Proyas (I, Robot). Basically in 1959 a time capsule full of student pictures of what the future will look like is buried, and young Lucinda Embry (Lara Robinson) puts in a paper of random numbers. Fifty years later, 2009, this time capsule is taken out of the ground, and young Caleb Koestler (Chandler Canterbury) is the one who takes the paper of numbers. When his scientist father John (Nicolas Cage) takes a look at the paper, he begins deciphering it as cryptic but accurate messages pinpointing the dates, death count and co-ordinates to every major global event. He is convinced the numbers he hasn't circled are clues to many other major events to the world, so he is trying to find out more about little Lucinda from people who knew her, including her daughter Diana Wayland (Rose Byrne), with daughter Abby (Robinson again). John does try to warn authorities of one event that he pinpoints, but he was too late, and he knows that a heat ray from the sun is going to strike the Earth, and the only way to survive is to find somewhere deep underground. So it is now a race against time to reach some caves, but after some mysterious encounters with them earlier, it is apparent that the kids are meant to leave the planet with some alien strangers, while Diana died in a car crash, and John stays on Earth going back to his sister and parents to die. Also starring Ben Mendelsohn as Phil Beckman, Nadia Townsend as Grace Koestler, Alan Hopgood as Rev. Koestler and D.G. Maloney as The Stranger. Cage needed a break after some bad choices, e.g. The Wicker Man (remake), Ghost Rider, and if it weren't for the film being so predictable and not engaging enough, I would say he made a good choice. The only things I enjoyed in this film were the plane and train disasters assisted by special effects, and the Bernard Herrmann-inspired music score by Terminator composer Marco Beltrami, but other than that, it is only worth one viewing. Okay!"

","The movie takes a more religious approach. It builds a world and a lead character who is hurt from the loss of his life and therefore doesn't believe in anything, purpose, or God. The film takes him on a journey where his views change. This is screenplay writing 101.
If the protagonist starts as a nihilist, he can't finish the film, remaining a nihilist.
If he started as a Christian and then ended as an atheist, I don't think Christians would be as aggressive as the anti-religious folk on here have been.
For some reason, the idea of the world being a bad place that needs redeeming or that humans are sinful strikes a deep chord with a lot of reviewers on here, which is ironic to say the least.<br/><br/>All in all, it's not close to a perfect film but don't let alternative world views cause irrationality to prevail.<br/><br/>Heck, I don't agree with the premise/theme of Life of Pi which is almost the opposite of this films, and I still think it's a good film!<br/><br/>8/10"

"wolfen244","8","0","1","2 September 2019"," After the Gold Rush
","The ending of this movie is completely based on the last verse of Neil Young's song ""After the Gold Rush"" from 1970. I wish they'd've at least acknowledged that. Oh well. Not important except that I was highly disappointed that the old folks had to buy the farm - including my crush for the past 20 years Mary Rose Byrne. The interesting thing about Byrne's character is that she went completely off the rails in a very illogical manner - extremely understandable actually - since she was hysterical and panicking and therefore making upside down decisions. Cage's character was lucid and logical for most of the end where he had all of the excuses for panicking. I thought it might turn out to be a love story then when I heard the Funeral March from Beethoven's 7th, I realized that it was not to be. The saving grace was that Lucinda who morphed into Abby was saved. I felt very close to the Lucinda character as she was being haunted by the whispers and worse with her finger nails bloody.
I usually give an Alex Proyas film solid 10's because he is a seriously top director in every way. This one only an 8 because the ending was a bit unsatisfying and not as romantic as I'd like to have seen. But that's just me. Also the strange idea of ""knowing"" what is going to happen and then not being able to take much advantage of it is rather sad.

"ehabich","8","0","1","4 August 2019"," Extra-tempestrials
","In my view this is a fictional movie about evolved humans from the future that are able to travel into the past. The biologist Dr. Michael Paul Masters calls the beings shown in 'Knowing' extra-tempestrials. The extra-tempestrials leave warnings about impending doom to their distant ancestors. The humanoid future humans (angel like) seen at the end are able to telepathically transmit information about catastrophic future events. Foreknowledge of future events (from our point in time) is pretty easy when you are from the future and are looking back in time! Contemporary humans are still working out the theory of time travel. For humanity to survive in the movie and to be able evolve into their future form, selected telepathically gifted children are saved from a destructive solar flare, by transporting them to a new home, an earth-like ecosystem around a different sun. Solar flares of the depicted magnitude are unrealistic, but the movie solar flare can be substituted for a more realistic catastrophic extinction level event, for instance an asteroid impact. It's strange that the spaceship only collects a boy and a girl. If the movie script was more faithful to the biblical template then 144.000 would have been saved. I think there are 12 vessels in the movie each transporting a boy and a girl, analogous to the twelve tribes of Israel. The theme of leaving a stone at the place where a person perishes on this world, adheres to the jewish custom of placing stones on graves of departed ones, to remember them by (or as a symbol of their memory). The sheet of numerological predictions given to John Koestler is simply a plot device to get him to bring his son and Diana's daughter to the designated pickup location. This cunning plan is foiled by Diana not believing John Koestler (Nicholas Cage) and running off by herself and crashing her car, so that the 'angels' intervene personally. They succeed in preserving the germline of John and Diana, that is needed for the evolution of the new race of humans. The physicist Stephen Hawking asks in his posthumous book 'Brief Answers to the Big Questions' whether time travel is possible. The answer is that it is a ""very serious question"" that our current understanding cannot rule out and which can be approached scientifically. The whole movie is nicely executed with great special effects. So, there you go. :-)"

","This film should have been much better than it is. In fact, the premise is quite intriguing: A time capsule is opened and found to contain a page of seemingly meaningless numbers written by a strangely spooky girl 50 years ago. By chance, a professor discovers that the numbers are the dates, locations, and the number of the dead of disasters around the world since the time that the capsule was buried. And there are some major disasters just around the corner, including (as we find out about two-thirds of the way through the film) the end of the world.<br/><br/>By the time your bum is well and truly sore (this film drags on for two hours), you eventually discover that the spooky girl was receiving the numbers from some Swedish-looking alien dudes, who know all about the end of the world. In fact, they've come back to earth to save the professor's son and his girlfriend from global Armageddon. Nice.<br/><br/>Not only do the angelic aliens take the kids, but also two fluffy white bunny rabbits. (Seriously!) We eventually find that these two kids are apparently not the only ones being saved, since as the spaceship takes off, we see lots more Noah's Ark spaceships taking off from all over the planet. Presumably on those ships other kids are carrying pairs of elephants, giraffes and wildebeest.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the whole planet is engulfed in flame. But not to worry because the blond aliens drop the two kids off on an idyllic looking planet. It's a regular Garden of Eden, in fact, complete with its own Tree of Knowledge -- presumably an ever so biting and cynical suggestion that we humans will again fall from grace in this new world. With no groundwork established in the film to suggest that we ever did fall from grace in the first place, this ""meaningful"" bit at the end comes across as utter pretentiousness.<br/><br/>""Knowing"" is essentially an extremely boring and silly film. The premise could have been developed intelligently. And things do go quite well until about the time that the second disaster foretold by the numbers comes to pass. But after this, the film soon grinds to a tedious halt, crushed under the unbearable weight of its own ridiculous self-importance, laughable script, and preposterously overblown score."

","Knowing, in short, is about professor John (Nicolas Cage), an intelligent chap who cleverly decodes a message that was unearthed in a time capsule buried 50-years ago at his young son's school.<br/><br/>Still interested? Ok, read on. Inside of this time capsule are things like futuristic drawings and trinkets from 1959, left by school children of the day. In 2009, a new batch of children at the school open the capsule and, one by one, reach in and pull out a treasure. John's almost-as-clever son, Caleb (Chandler Canterbury), picks out a rather boring piece of paper filled only with numbers. It's almost befitting though. After all, the kid is very smart and has a future as an astrophysicist it seems. But he is a kid, man, and he notices that his classmates each got something cool, like hand drawn, colorful pictures imagining what life would be like in 2009 (think spaceships and jet packs). Like, where's the fun in a plain piece of paper full of stupid numbers?<br/><br/>Enter Dad, M.I.T. scholar John, who's a big fan of numbers. He finds Caleb's discovery rather fascinating, and, in fact, has uncovered something that no one else cares enough to believe. These numbers, when one looks close enough, each mean something significant. When properly sequenced, they foretell horrible disasters, past, present, and future. Life altering disasters!<br/><br/>Knowing, IMHO, isn't as great as some popular critics have called it. It's, meh, ok. I'm not a critic, I'm just a fan who opines. I like the idea behind Knowing, but I think Nick Cage sort of overacts a wee bit. He's been guilty of it a few times in other movies, too. Maybe that's what he's going for here with his character, but it doesn't really work for me. There's no need to scream at everyone (sure, I get it, people just don't believe him when he predicts disasters). Also, I found the script a little predictable, and believe me the irony is not lost on me.<br/><br/>One thing that is really cool in this film is the disasters we get to see. I must admit, even now, watching this film again 9-years later I find some of the CGI impressive. Sure, I did say ""wow"" a few times, and not like a ""this is lame"" kind of wow, either. It's good to watch once, then put it away for a few years and watch again. That's what I did, and now it's filed away - probably for another 9 years or so."

Somewhere closer to the ending or after the mid of the movie seemed like the movie makers just lost interest. The excitement was lost and the ending was too obvious and predictable.

","I was first attracted to this movie because it just so happened to be the lowest rated movie ever made that was given four stars by Roger Ebert. This director also made ""Dark City"", Ebert's favorite movie of 1998. I really doubted that I would like this, much less give it four stars, and I was pretty much right. This movie tells the story of a guy played by Nicolas Cage who finds a message written by a kid fifty years ago in a time capsule that's nothing but numbers. He realizes that she listed down all the major disasters in the upcoming 50 years. This raises too many questions. This girl/woman was alive and well for more decades, so why didn't she just tell everyone about the horrible things that would happening? I mean, she did predict the end of the world as the last thing she wrote down. Maybe she just assumed that since the world would end it wouldn't matter that all those other people died.<br/><br/>But then why did she even write this down in the first place? For the positives of the film, I did find the special effects good and it actually does have a pretty original concept. I still couldn't help but think of ""Signs"". You know, a movie about a guy who lost his faith and learns about aliens coming and has to help two kids survive? I mean, the idea was original, it was just done in a clichéd manner. I do enjoy Nicolas Cage and it does have some rather intense moments. I have to give Ebert credit for giving the full score to such a, well, mediocre movie. I was never into disaster movies to begin with as they were too formulaic. A lot of the scenes just go nowhere and while not terrible, it's not worth your time, unless you want to learn more about Roger Ebert. **"

It's 50 years later. Caleb Koestler needs a hearing aid. His class is opening the time capsule. Caleb is given Lucinda's letter which is a long string of numbers. His father John (Nicolas Cage) is an MIT Astrophysics professor. He starts making sense of the numbers. First, it's 9/11 and 2996 deaths. He matches every numbers with disasters except three still pending mass deaths. His wife Allison was part of one of the past disasters. He's there for the next disaster and figures out the location coordinates in the numbers. He becomes obsessed and tracks down Lucinda's daughter Diana (Rose Byrne). Throughout, there are mysterious strangers haunting Caleb.<br/><br/>The start has an intriguing premise. It's on track to be an interesting moody horror. It adds on some big CGI action sets. Once the mystery of the numbers is solved, the story loses its intensity. The ultimate ending requires much more foreshadowing.

","As usual I didn't know much about this movie beforehand. This way I can really enjoy the experience and be free of prejudice. The beginning was quite OK although one gets the feeling straight away that it's a Hollywood-movie - instead of creating characters that feel real we are presented with characters that resemble well known stereotypes, so instead of a teacher we are presented with a mediocre actor who most resembles the stereotype of 1940's teacher, same with students, staff and so on. It gives kind of surreal feeling to everything and makes you wonder if it's intentional and somehow part of the story. It's kind of disappointing when you discover it's not. The acting was mediocre, at best. Nicolas C (Cage) is becoming the Kenny G of the movie world, steadily. Others weren't that much better. For kids it's somewhat understandable (but here again we see how kid actors were chosen because of their looks not how they act) and they probably acted as well as they could, whatever the movie or story. Adults looked like they really struggled with the characters (and staying in character), my guess is because of the silliness of the story. And the story is silly. No spoilers but the story is so silly it made me wonder if the film is either partially financed by some religious group or if the film is tailored to bring a lot of religious people (and their money) to cinemas. Or maybe it's just that the authors thought that the story as they presented it would cleverly tie together science and religion and nicely align with majority (in US) knowledge and view of the world. Characters remained shallow and discordant (eg Cage plays a sad and forgetful MIT professor in velvet jacket with drinking problem who drives big gas-guzzling flatbed truck, wears big macho watch and has a athletic tanned body - possible but not likely). In the end the film didn't clear anything up - some parts of it suggested that it aligned more with contemporary Christian views, some parts suggested that it supported more of the scientific view of the world, it just left viewer confused, maybe intentionally to allude to some deeper meaning or something like that. There were also quite a few fact and logic flaws in the story (eg determinism; new planet). Maybe less if the viewer assumes that there's an all-powerful god in the story who can do anything (which at the same time destroys the story altogether). I intended to watch the film at least partially again while writing this review but I couldn't bring myself to do it. I'm not sure who really would enjoy this movie, maybe a die-hard Nicolas C fan, a teenage Christian sci-fi fan?"

It's a pity, actually, as the beginning was, if not original, at least promising some flavour to the pop-corn. The children did fine, in my opinion. The plot is remarkably boring; I spent the first 90 minutes trying to find the login in the muddled story-line, and the remainder looking for the polite exit. Yawn... Four more lines to write! Well, it is a challenge but here comes: 50 millions spent on a substandard film like this could have solved a lot of problems: publishing colouring books for art therapy; building some wells in the desert; funding some worthy projects on Kickstarter or Indiegogo; paying Rose Byrne to attend some acting classes; paying the kids university scholarships - and the list goes on."

It really got everyone hooked even more; it didn't say too much, it got to the point, but gave enough detail for viewers not to have to ask questions. And that is where that ended.<br/><br/>From then on the film is set in present day, and really what saved the film and the plot from then on from being a total disaster was the special effects. Some of them are seen in the trailer, and others are not, but all of them were just amazing.<br/><br/>And that is sort of where the good things end. The story had many holes in it; in the FAQ section it actually says this screenplay was rewritten many times (probably by potatoes). A lot of stuff was purposely mentioned but then never again spoken about or explained properly. Examples include the little black pebbles, the deer type animals and their involvement, any science related stuff (where he works), neither he nor his son went to school/work throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The following are questions i had after watching:<br/><br/><ul><li>If Lucinda was the chosen one, why was she not saved?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>If Lucinda kept reminding her daughter of the day she was going to die, why didn't she tell her the coordinates so she could avoid it?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why was Caleb's acting so bad?</li></ul><br/><br/>And finally, we have the ending. It seems like the ending was changed from what it originally was; if the ending shown was the best they had I really don't want to know what else they had ready. The whole alien thing made no sense and to be fair, it would've been a better film if they were not involved and the film was kept realistic. Beyond the alien ending we see the annihilation of the planet Earth, which is another one of the brilliant special effect scenes mentioned before, but then when you think the credits are about to roll we see an Adam & Eve like scene which really didn't fit. It was like they showed the film to a test group and they were not happy with the lack of a happy ending so they just had to make something up.<br/><br/>I was very excited for this after the trailer, and even more excited after the first 10 minutes but I feel it took the wrong path in terms of the plot and sort of ""lost the plot"".<br/><br/>Could've been a brilliant film.

Nicolas Cage has got to be one of the most talentless, uncharismatic and unnatural actors ever.

In fact, Knowing is quite well made, and it would be even better if it didn't have Cage in it (although this is one of Cage's better efforts). Despite some average performances, the film is well paced, it's atmospheric, well scripted and pretty well shot with good CGI effects, and if you like obscure science fiction then chances are you will enjoy this.

Please note that this is not a family movie or CGI Mumbo Jumbo. I would say few actors chosen by the director really do well in this. But the ending...is not the worst but painful and illogical. Where I disliked it the most? The ending sequence where the child was taken away by human like aliens. Because: if you are a Lord fearing person then you will dislike it too like me. It should be like this ""A chosen few will apparently be swept away by angels to a better place"" and not by stupid aliens or extraterrestrials in the shape of human. They should given priority to angels instead of these stupid aliens. They could have make the movie more interesting at the end by maybe introducing demons instead of aliens following the child or angels are departed from heavens and taken the child to a safer place but instead they show the stupid mother-ship and weird glowing aliens that any child could have gone scared and ran away. Well, since it was a 2 hrs movie limit they stayed with the writer's script instead of changing it. It would be best if they introduce a different ending or a twist or may be a cliff hanger like we saw in the ""Inception"" to the viewers to decide. I would suggest you all to watch this good movie carefully with open mind and figure out the gist of this movie then you will understand.

","It's as if the 3 screenwriters credited with this film sat down and said ""I'll write the beginning, you write the middle and you write the end and we'll see if we can match it up later."" Well, I can tell you, it didn't match up. This movie started out promising. The whole time capsule thing with the little girl's list caught my interest and I wanted to know more. 50 years later they open the time capsule and we find the list was actually a list of predictions that have come true throughout those 50 years. Okay - I'm with the movie so far and can't wait to see what will happen next. Then the middle writer takes over and it gets a little lost (not a lot, just a little). We introduce this rock thing that was never explained and Nicolas Cage acts like - well every Nicolas Cage movie. The story does move along though and I'm still interested. That is, until the 3rd writer takes over and does the last 1/3 of the movie. At some point I just watched it because I knew I was near the end and I was hoping they would write themselves out of a mess. The introduction of the little girl and mother was almost a waste of time - they didn't move the plot anywhere and the mom annoyed me. Now, I don't always have to have a ""happy"" ending, but I do need an ending that makes some sense. I mean, why in the world do you even have predictions if in the end everything is totally pointless. I gave this 5 out of 10 stars only because of the great start to this film."

","John (Cage) and his son Caleb are given a prophetic warning in a series of numbers written by a little girl in 1959. I'm still very much confused after watching the movie. I honestly didn't see the point of John even getting that number list in the first place, since he couldn't stop any of it! At best, he was just there so we, the audience, could see all the awesome special effects. There were three disasters within John's time frame to prevent, a plane crash, a subway crash, and a solar flare that would genocide all life on Earth. Each time, he was there as only a witness. To be fair, there really wasn't anything he could do, really. One man can't stop a plane crash, subway crash, or the end of the world with just a date, location, and body count. On to the weird ending, the aliens(angels) could have shown up anywhere and persuaded the kids to come with them. Overall, great special effects, great acting, but I'm still wondering, What was the point?"

","Not much of a Nicolas Cage fan, but I will say that he puts in his best performance in years and in what starts off looking like it's going to be another typical Nic Cage adventure movie quickly turns into a dark and scary sci-fi disaster movie with essences of The X-Files, Armageddon and the best M. Night Shyamalan thrillers.<br/><br/>The score is also worthy of mention, as it borrows much from John Williams' Jaws, but also reminds you of E.T. and Close Encounters, i.e. a powerful score that becomes part of the movie, rather than just playing softly in the background.<br/><br/>This film will surprise you and it will scare you, if not in its intense and graphic disaster sequences, then in its many spine-chilling scenes of terror when our lead characters are in the woods, in a car or in their own bedroom! This is not a family-friendly disaster movie that has any comic moments like Armageddon or Independence Day, but a more modern disaster movie for our time that you will either love or hate. Some of the audience will laugh at its ridiculousness, but others will find its impact stay with them long after they've left the cinema. To entertain, this film relies on your suspension of disbelief. For a deeper impact, it depends on what you really believe in. At its core, this film is a debate on coincidence versus fate.<br/><br/>The movie plays well on a big screen with big sound, but will not have such an impact on the small screen. This movie may go on to become a highly under-rated, under-watched cult classic or it may spawn a new wave of far more family-friendly disaster movies but with the same theme... it will probably do both! Go rent this one out, it's worth the buck of two at least."

","First of all, I gave 7 to Knowing only because I didn't expect it to be good. However, the first 50 minutes with The Sixth Sense-like atmosphere got me into the movie so badly that I was 'actually' scared of several scenes including the one where a Cage's sister came out from the behind when he was looking up Lucinda on the Net. Nothing couldn't divert my attention until the identify of suspicious people around kids was revealed.

","I'll be quite honest, there are a ton of things good about this movie and bad about it. I think the best way to describe it is if I simply list the pros and cons I observed.<br/><br/>Pros: 1. The beginning is actually somewhat creepy. 2. The disasters (Especially the Coronal Mass Ejection and the following damage) look incredibly nice. 3. Minus the aliens, this would be a very plausible End-of-the-World scenario. 4. The fact that the aliens never talk is a nice touch. It makes them more eerie. 5.On the topic of aliens, I really liked what the spaceships looked like.<br/><br/>Cons: 1. The disasters were incredibly predictable at times. The first one was completely unexpected, but after that the foreshadowing was simply ridiculous. 2. The unveiling of the true form of the aliens was cheesy. 3. The smooth round stones were never explained. 4.The ending, while sad, would have been sadder had the aliens never been introduced, or were introduced as something other than aliens. 5. The story goes south when the last disaster occurs. While it was a shock when E.E. actually meant Everyone Else, the plot could have left a bigger emotional impact if, again, the aliens never played a part.<br/><br/>In short: It looks nice but only IS nice for about 2/3rds of the movie, and then it acts a bit like a confused child in a talent show. Randomly trying to tie up the act before the audience gets bored."

If anyone is stupid enough to allow something from Hollywood to shape their beliefs then there isn't much that can save them, or it seems they join Scientology.<br/><br/>What does knock a lot of stars off for me is the number of inconsistencies and complete and utter lack of logic even as sci fi. It just does not make sense.

","An interesting enough premise, but enough plot holes to sink the surface of the planet into the ocean before any of the catastrophic prophecies scribbled in numerology have a chance to occur.<br/><br/>It makes no sense for Lucinda's 1959 time capsule note to predict anything to anybody, even if they could decipher it in the absurd manner we see in the film, so why was this information ""whispered"" to her in the first place? When MIT Prof. Nicholas Cage (in an uncanny duplication of his American Treasure character) randomly picks out (from hundreds of mysterious) numbers that he reasons to be the date and death toll of an infamous event, it's weird enough, but ultimately, there seems to be no apparent rhyme or reason for him to do this in light of the larger order of things that happen later on. There are many ""Well, why didn't they just do such and such?"" questions in your mind by the end; many elements of the story end up brazenly glossed over and disconnected.<br/><br/>There's some decent symbolism for several points of view that are presented in the story, but the film is too chicken to establish any stand towards anything. Instead, it thrusts a salvo of conflicting philosophies, and tries to stew them into a center intersecting place that ends up patronizing everyone, no matter what their view. Religion, Randomness, Determinism, Science, Science Fiction, even Ancient Alien Astronaut Theory, and others clash and collide with enough force to cause catastrophes without any help from accidents or nature.<br/><br/>Still, the film is an absorbing watch; it's even one of the more entertaining movies about this subject matter, which has been the foundation for many predecessors to this one. I've never been much of a Nicholas Cage fan, but his one-note approach seems to fit here, considering the grand futility of his situation. The supporting cast (especially the always dependable Rose Byrne) do pretty well with what they're given. The movie's best moments are saved for last: the two climactic closing scenes pull no punches and are contrasted one to the other brilliantly.<br/><br/>Far from perfect with illogical plot development, but overall a fair movie for an evening rental."

Is the universe deterministic or random, can a prediction be thwarted and still be called correct, what if you knew what was going to happen and no one believed you? Writers Ryne Douglas Pearson and Juliet Snowden jam these and more question into the story of an MIT scientist and the numeric code that conveniently falls into his hands. If the writers have an ambitious agenda they are slackers compared to Alex Proyas who throws in one thematic element after another. Beyond the mystery of the code and its predictions and Nick Cage's character's grief over his deceased wife and subsequent alcoholism, there are aliens and maybe ghosts and government agents and a whole lot of whispering. Eventually the subplots and complicated mythos overwhelm the plot into something harder to follow than the old sci-fi film version of ""Dune"". Cage, who is far more at home as a the disturbed genius character than all of the action figure jobs he consistently lands does his best in their subplot soup but gets little support for a most forgettable support cast. In short, fans of watching stuff get blowed up really good get their money's worth but others should look elsewhere."

","Not all's well with this film. It starts of promising with some good scenes - one involving a crashing plane and the others involving Nicolas Cage's character puzzling over some numbers on a piece of paper. From here on in it all goes to pot. The initial premise is intriguing as your wondering what the numbers mean and where the filmmakers will go in order to resolve the mystery. But do they go far...no. Instead, they go down the route of dealing with the same old themes such as religion and you guessed it - aliens. Now in more capable hands this may have worked, however, the director here is not up to scratch and delivers a very mundane piece of filmaking lacking in any real suspense or terror. To top it off the special effects are quite weak and the cinematography is murky and everything's shot in the dark all the time which is extremely annoying (especially if, like me your watching it during the day). So to conclude, it's worth a watch as it is watchable and the acting's fine all round, just don't expect yourself to get many repeat viewings from this altogether dull fair."

Nick's kid gets hold of it in the now time, sending him into a sort of A Perfect Mind state, whereby he divulges the numbers as dates, locations and (GASP) body counts for every disaster for the past 50 years, right up to a plane crash that happens dead in front of him. Being a hero type, he tries to warn the feds of the next one, but he was slightly off-target, and ends up watching a subway mess itself up. The final disaster he figures out from something he ""hypothesized"" about solar flares. A super flare, intent on roasting little old earth, as well as Mercury and Venus... But screw those planets, we're not there, are we?

Watch the movie for details on that little series of events. End of the movie and we learn the aliens didn't pick Nick but the two kids and two fluffy white bunnies, thus leaving you to figure out the obvious true plot line: NOAH'S ARK!!! The aliens leave from multiple points on the planet, and Nick returns to whats left of civilization, now ruined because the military had to open it's big mouth about the solar flare coming.

","Knowing is a science fiction disaster movie directed by Alex Proyas and stars Nicolas Cage, Rose Byrne, and Chandler Canterbury. The film takes place in modern day New York state.<br/><br/>The films starts off in an elementary school in 1959 with a little girl Lucinda. Lucinda is haunted by voices she is hearing in her head and when her teacher asks her and the rest of her class to draw their picture of the future for a time capsule she just writes a lot of meaningless numbers (or are they?). Later that day Lucinda goes missing for a while but then she is found by her teacher in a closet where she clawed some last numbers on the door. Then it is cut to present day where the time capsule is taken out of the ground and John Koestler's (Cage) son, Caleb (Canterbury), gets Lucinda's page of numbers from the time capsule. John accidentally discovers that some of these numbers are the date of 9/11 and the exact number of people killed then (It's a good thing he discovered this or else it would just be a movie about how Nicolas Cage needs to get a haircut). After a while John comes to the conclusion that there are three more disasters left on the list and the last one is, ooh my, the end of the world! The acting in this film was dreadful. The best of them was the Oscar winner Nicolas Cage who was somewhat decent as John Koestler. He really brought nothing to the table as the lead and basically read the lines and put on a concerned face. Rose Byrne plays the mother of a girl that can also here the whispers that Lucinda and Caleb can hear and she was terrible, so much so that I grew to hate her as the film went on. She was just made terrible decisions when the film lead you to believe that she was a somewhat intelligent woman. Her acting made her unlikable though. I am not going to say anything bad about the child actors, but none of them were as good as Haley Joel Osment.<br/><br/>The screenplay for this film was just so typical. I felt like I saw it already a hundred times and every supposed twist was a yawn. It was entirely predictable, I always knew the next step. I may have not known the next step after that but it was soon made clear before I reached it. This is the screenwriters first big film but that doesn't mean it has to be as bad as this.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film a solid 4/10 due to its poor acting, weak script, and below par direction. I would recommend this film to fans of the sci-fi and disaster genre."

Cage soon discovers that each number tells a date and location of a disaster from each year after the list was written, as well as the number of people who will die. He also notices that there are disasters left. An airplane crash, a train derailment, and a solar flare that will reach Earth and burn the planet.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie, some of the writing was bad, but the disaster scenes were cool, and it was just a cool idea, even if it wasn't executed as perfectly as I hoped. The only horrible thing about this film, the ending, I won't say, but one question, were they aliens, or angels."

","First of all, Aley Proyas is one of my favorite directors and it's pity he doesn't make movies more often. The Crow and Dark City are one of my all time favorite movies where he demonstrated how talented director he really is. To this date, The Crow may be the best comic adaptation ever made. Dark City may be one of the most intelligent movies made in 90-ties and Knowing somehow reminded me of that movie. Following Garage Days and I Robot were good, but I knew Proyas can do better than that. And he did it in this movie.<br/><br/>Lots of people crucified this movie. Not sure know why. I presume it's because they just don't like Cage or they don't know how to relax and enjoy the movie. I know it's not perfect. It doesn't deliver all the answers. But who said it needs to? It has intelligent screenplay, suspenseful plot, astonishing special effects and great performance by Nicolas Cage. It was a long time since a movie got me literally attached to the screen. And I'm sure it was because I didn't bother myself with questions Why and How simply because this is a science- fiction movie. And the word fiction is very connected with word imagination that doesn't necessary means it can give you all the answers. You can only guess them. Damn, this is not Columbo, Sherlock Holmes or some other crime movie where you expect all the questions to be answered in the end. This movie is made to entertain you. And in that area, it does one hell of a job."

","WARNING SPOILERS! This movie starts off great but then trails off with plot holes and typical clichés with an anti-climatic ending. It tries to be all genres packed into one and it fails at most. It tries to be a bit of a horror flick, adventure, sci-fi, drama, action, disaster.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie sets the tone that this will be a scary thriller/horror type movie (creepy girl scratching numbers in the door with bloody fingers). Some drama and character development is added in after when Cage tries to bond with his son and sister after his wife's death, and with some special effects thrown in for good measure (plane crash, subway scene).<br/><br/>Afterwards it tries to be an action movie when Cage runs around with his gun (which he doesn't use) in NY chased by cops as he's trying to stop a disaster. It goes back to being a horror flick again with Cage and the woman going to a creepy mobile home in a foggy forest after which a bunch of scary looking pale people (that appeared randomly in the movie earlier) show up looking for CAge and the woman's kids. There are loose plot holes like those black rocks that don't really mean much but are found in random places during supposedly suspenseful scenes, and when Cage's son scribbling numbers on the paper towards the end of the movie (what's he predicting when everyone will die the next day anyways)? Finally it ends with a giant spaceship coming down in the forest and taking the chosen ones with them while the rest of the world is at the mercy of the sun.<br/><br/>Great idea (time capsule, predictions), but poorly executed."

","After reading a number of reviews of this film I was somewhat surprised to discover that it's nowhere near as bad as a lot of people make out. In fact it's an enjoyable experience as this kind of film goes. Nicholas Cage is his usual self and the supporting cast do a very good job of keeping it all quite real. The CG is great and the photography is very good to look at. OK, the plot is a little thin, we've seen most of this before spread across several movies, but it's engaging and well directed. Other reviews have mentioned the 'stones' and the paper that Cage's character had written years before that suddenly enters the plot... but these are just devices to help us along the path to the fairly obvious climax (with the children) and denouement (with the adults). The stones are given to the chosen as a link to where they must travel (like the mental imprint of Devils Tower in Close Encounters), the paper is to tell us of what the disaster comprises, and perhaps explain why Cage's character has been given the clues. I would say that if you liked The Abyss you will like this film too, they're really quite similar. This movie is perhaps a little darker and the plot not so well drawn, but all in all it's probably worth a good, solid seven and a half... not great, but certainly not a bad film... nowhere near as bad as James Cameron's Titanic for instance."

Hat's off to the screen writers who must have had a tough assignment bringing this concept to the big screen in such a way that keeps the audience thinking. As a scientifically possible apocalypse, the film works on one level, and as the predicive nature of the numbers comes to light, all of our fears of doom are highlighted as the emotional level comes to a rolling boil. In an age when every typical Holly-wood-Michael-Bay-Transformer-Teenage-explosion-laden-shootem-up gets really tedious, this refreshing and intelligently written film is a real change of pace, most definitely making ""Knowing"" the sleeper of the year."

","If you have preconception about what a SF movie ""should"" look like, you might be disappointed. This movie is different, in that it asks a direct and specific question, maybe the mother of all questions: are we living with a purpose? Knowing kind of answered that question in a ""SF"" way. But just as the title ""Knowing"" tells us, we all know the answer, we just won't accept it!<br/><br/>Talking about the film ""itself"", I agree with Roger Ebert who was enthusiastic about the film, rating it four stars and ranking it ""among the best science-fiction films I've seen—frightening, suspenseful, intelligent and, when it needs to be, rather awesome"" in the Chicago Sun-Times. He continued, ""With expert and confident storytelling, Proyas strings together events that keep tension at a high pitch all through the film. Even a few quiet, human moments have something coiling beneath. Pluck this movie, and it vibrates."""

You will watch it twice to try and piece together everything that is going on. Many of the holes in the plot disappear on the second viewing.<br/><br/>It's a good movie to watch late at night in bed.

On further reflection I realized that I was too harsh in my criticism. The film certainly has problems, but it has some virtues compared to the crappy action sci-fi prevalent in Hollywood today. It follows conventions you might know from Bradbury or Phillip K. Dick (still better than movies from his stories like Next and Paycheck). If you like this you should watch Dark City.

","*PLOT SPOILERS* <br/><br/>In 1959, a grade-school Nostradamus puts a piece of paper containing seemingly random numbers into a time capsule. When the container is opened fifty years later, it turns out that the numbers were not random at all but rather numerical predictions of future disasters, pinpointing the dates they were to occur and the number of people who would lose their lives in them. Enter John Koestler, a professor of astrophysics at MIT, who decodes the messages and becomes convinced that if he can just get others to heed the warnings, he'll somehow be able to avert the catastrophes. Unfortunately, John soon discovers that these piddling little disasters are mere warm-up exercises for the Big Cataclysmic Kahuna that is to come <br/><br/>In ""Knowing,"" the clichés of plot and character come fast and furious. John is a single dad who turns to atheism after his wife dies in a hotel fire, convinced that nothing happens for a reason and that life is nothing more than a series of random events, blah, blah, blah. As usual, the atheist - an egg headed scientist, naturally - has to be shown that there is indeed a higher power somewhere controlling our destinies. I guess we're just supposed to accept that fact and not question the appalling nature of that being's actions as he proceeds to wipe out an entire planet (the movie manages to combine elements of the Adam-and-Eve and Noah's Ark tales into a single story).<br/><br/>In the tradition of ""Armageddon,"" ""The Core,"" ""2012,"" etc., ""Knowing"" is an apocalyptic chiller that reduces the destruction of all life on the planet to the level of a cheap carnival thrill ride. Nicholas Cage - who is stuck in yet another of those Droopy Dog save-the-world roles that have become all too prevalent in his career of late - does what he can with a script that starts off with a reasonably intriguing premise, then fritters it away on giggle-inducing hysterical-crowd scenes and a dopey subplot involving extraterrestrials that should have Steven Spielberg suing the makers for copyright-infringement. And the be-fruitful-and-multiply ending is as queasy as it is implausible.<br/><br/>There are additional wooden performances by other members of the cast, but the kindest thing would be to let them remain nameless and to forget that any of them were ever even in this picture."

","End of World movies always get a bad rap because everyone has a notion of how the world should end or shouldn't and then there's further arguments from the religious and the atheists and then big bang theory exponents are rarely happy either. So with all contentious theories out of the way, I think director Proyas did an excellent job approaching this subject, I saw this without knowing the plot and half-way through this movie I didn't think it was gearing up for the apocalypse so I was pleasantly surprised (if that doesn't sound too morbid) on how this panned out. I think the aliens/angels at the end whisking the kids away to the new world was unnecessary but we all know big films from big studios must have some element of hope or good so people don't leave movie theaters depressed. Some of the action sequences like the plane crash scene and the skyline burning up were mesmerizing and I made sure i saw those again on the interesting special features. And I liked the plot as well with cage piercing together all the individual disasters leading up to the big one. Good entertainment and I don't care if that will happen in that way but it should be said as a footnote that everything in life lives and dies eventually, even planets, its the cycle of life."

It's partly a fun thriller, partly a dark tale that talks about regret and mortality. Nicholas Cage isn't probably in a good shape, maybe he was never meant to be a leading man in an action-adventure film but in this case was really a lot below his usually high profile performances. The story grips the attention for its showing a lot of screaming, running around and scaring (the subway scene's truly gruesome), on the whole it works, in spite Cage's non convincing acting."

I decided this as it seemed to involve a cleansing of the earth to start afresh. I assumed the kids were taken as they would be presumably pretty much free of sin (and I doubt any of them would know how to knock a nuclear missile together in second chance land!). Maybe it was because I was watching it on a 4"" screen, but I could have sworn that as the 'Aliens' ascended they briefly developed wings...see where I'm going with this...Angels ?

","In the 50's an entire class of students made drawings of what they thought the future would look like and proceeded to place them into a time capsule meant to be open in 50 years time. Instead of drawing something,Lucinda,one of the girls from the class,wrote a series of numbers which were whispered into her head by something/someone.Fast forward 50 years and the story continues in the present day with the time capsule being open.The drawings are handed to the kids who attend the school, among them, the paper filled with numbers written by Lucinda which is given to Caleb, one of the students.Nicholas Cage plays John Koestler, the father of Caleb who later stumbles upon this paper.John starts to decipher the numbers and much to his surprise the numbers seem to indicate the date and the location where catastrophes have occurred in the last 50 years. And also how many people died in each event. Three events haven't take place yet and now John makes his mission to try and stop them from happening.As the story moves forward we get the feeling that something in a large scale is going on and as the tension rises there's also a building sense of doom and truth is, it kinda works,the movie,altought very unoriginal, entertains the viewer.The problem of this flick, for me, is the fact that as a viewer you long for answers and when they finally come the film turns into a major let down. In other words, the ending is terrible. It almost seems like the screenwriters didn't know what to do with the rest of the story and thought: what the hell, we might as well go with the aliens stuff.And so, in the end,the individuals we see whispering throughout the whole film are revealed as some sort of hybrid between an angel and an extraterrestrial being and since our planet is about to get destroyed by a solar flare they choose a couple of children and then they leave our planet in their fancy space shift and take the kids to an inhabited planet where mankind can start over.Very Adam and Eve sort of thing.Honestly I couldn't have been more disappointed with the ending,I enjoy alien stuff as much as the next guy but we can't have that in every single movie now, can we? And also the film seemed to be more about destiny versus fate,determinism vs randomness,the ending for me, felt out of place and contrived.Typical Hollywood stuff.Regarding the acting I think Nicholas Cage's performance was below par.

In short: the earth is about to be destroyed by fire, the whole thing was predicted by the prophet Ezekiel, only those who are ""chosen"" and who ""hear the voices of the angels"" can be saved, and all the good children are carried off by aliens to serve as miniature Adams and Eves (along w/assorted animals) and repopulate another planet.

","Coming from the director of such cult classics as ""The Crow"" and ""Dark City"" one would expect this too would be something that will endure the test of time and embed itself into the public conscious. Unfortunately, this movie only repeats tired clichés with mish-mashed concepts and will likely go the way of 'Signs' and the remake of ""The Day The Earth Stood Still."" <br/><br/>Aliens have always been a popular trend in movies, but in the last decade American cinema goers have not seen many that actually relied on story and characters over typical Hollywood flash. Honestly, I wish for once a person would spend as much on the writing as they do on over blown CGI effects. At least when pie plates on strings and rubber suits were the norm we were blessed with a decent story.<br/><br/>This is a movie that tries so hard to be unique and thought-provoking that it comes off as preachy and irritating. At first it starts out okay, there's the Wednesday Adams-looking little girl hearing voices, so you already know it's going to have something to do with the supernatural. Fast-forward to present day, with Nick Cage and his son who by some stroke of luck (or misfortune) gets the cryptic number prophecy sheet. Cage, in a drunken stupor, figures the sheet out for what it really is, and starts tying its numbers to 9/11 and a bunch of other disasters. How very Nostradamus....<br/><br/>There are some events that have yet to happen, and Cage, for some reason, believes he can actually prevent them... So he tries to be at ground zero of as many of the disasters he can. One of these involves Cage witnessing a plane crash tearing through a congested highway, and then running to the site of the carnage and yelling ""Hey!--HEY!"" at people walking around covered in flames. The other humorous moment is when he tries to stop what he assumes is going to be a terrorist attack in New York. He calls the FBI and rambles in detail about how there's going to be an attack and that if they don't do what he says, people are going to die... making -himself- sound like a terrorist.<br/><br/>Eventually we get to see Lucinda's old house with all her newspaper clippings of various disasters and her number codes scrawled on the walls, oh and there's this weird picture depicting a passage from The Bible about aliens??? Great, it isn't demons or some cult who're after Nick's son, but aliens... Angel Aliens who look like some crap out of 'Mission To Mars' and predict disasters (like a super solar flare about to kill everything on Earth) but won't do squat to stop them. Guess it's punishment for all the wars and ravaging of the planet, or maybe they're just voyeuristic death fanatics.<br/><br/>So the aliens take the kids anyway, poor Nick is stuck on Earth for it's inevitable destruction all because he couldn't ""hear the call"" (rapture?), and the worthy children get to go to a fresh new planet which I'm guessing is supposed to be Eden since there's the big ""Tree of Knowledge"" that God / The Aliens don't want anyone eating from or ""they shall surely die."" I hope they checked the place for talking snakes. This movie wouldn't have been so laughable if they'd got somebody else besides Cage and if it hadn't tried to mix Religion with Sci-Fi."

These disasters are visually appealing on an exploitative level primarily because they involve mass destruction and a large loss of life.<br/><br/>What kills the film in my opinion are bland characters, which make it hard to care about the potential destruction of the earths population because there is no emotional investment.

Knowing is one of those movies that starts really rather well, but ends up sitting on the fence. A religious nut's wet dream, it goes so far off it's original course that it forgets it's own identity altogether and literally makes it up as it goes along.<br/><br/>There are some nice pixelated effects during the film, but it isn't enough to carry it through on the strength of this. Again, while it does well at first, it is let down by someone at the studios giving carte blanche to the CGI guys, who really do push things so clearly beyond the capacity of their tools that a good deal of the effects look unreal and plastic. Less definitely would have been more here.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage puts in yet another lacklustre performance here, content to do 'just enough' to warrant his over-inflated pay cheque, while the other actors and actresses are frankly average or at worst, forgettable. The soundtrack does enough as do the sound effects, but the real problem here is the script and screenplay - when it works, it works well and keeps the viewer intrigued, but when it doesn't it's almost unwatchable.<br/><br/>So, all in all, an average film that reminded me of so many mainstream movies of late. It works for a while, but when the initial intrigue has faded and deeper questions are being asked, it simply refuses to give a straight answer and reverts to type. I'm rating Knowing at 6.0 out of 10, because it genuinely does start well - just turn it off after about an hour and you wont be disappointed. Shame."

Of course, there are many strong fantasy elements, which can be hardly called scientific, but make the story interesting. I was left with the impression, that with so much effort, money and good actors in this movie, it could have been much better.(like the 90% of other Hollywood production today). With just a bit more intelligent storytelling, it would be probably harder to understand for ""the masses"", but it could be a great movie. Instead of that, it has a somewhat mediocre feel about it, although a few memorable scenes and interesting ideas make it definitively worth watching."
"jantoniou","3","0","2","28 September 2009"," Where's the payoff?
","Though expertly filmed - great cinematography especially - directed and all around solid on the acting side (Cage seems to me to be playing to the middle in every movie he's in generally; ""Matchstick Men"" and ""Adaptation"" are notable recent departures for his rather flat acting style), and a storyline that holds tremendous promise, the third act is nothing short of a total rip-off.<br/><br/>Filmed and paced quite suspensefully in the first and second acts, this is the kind of movie that, like an M. Night movie when he was still a decent auteur, virtually demands a big payoff to all the expertly styled and paced build-up. Needless to say, it fails utterly to deliver.<br/><br/>Though I've announced there is a spoiler, I will try not to give too much away. Suffice it to say Cage's character is ringside at the end of the world. His purpose seems ultimately to be used to bring together certain people at a certain place at this set end-time of the world and then ride off into the sunset/destruction of the earth.<br/><br/>If it feels, tastes, and smells flimsy - well, it IS flimsy. The justification for all the brewing suspense seems comic and ultimately a total let-down. When the end credits rolled my wife and I looked at each other and we both went ""OH COME ON!"" If that's not exactly how you feel after watching this turkey, I'll be very surprised."

","Great artwork! The scenery has a consistent ominous and gloomy feel to it.

As the story unfolds and the end draws nearer everything around the characters reflect that, and the world starts changing resembling how the city changed in ""Dark City"".<br/><br/>I liked Nicolas Gage a lot in this movie, I think his sister was way too young to be his sister, but that's just a detail.<br/><br/>The only problem I see with this movie is that there are two stories here that are completely independent of each other, or rather, an attempt has been made to tie them together, but still there are two very good ideas for two individual movies: One movie is about the girl being able to predict the future, and the main character John discovering her ability and acting upon it, the other story is about how somebody tries to save the human genome from extinction. What could have made this movie perfect was if there were some correlation between these two stories, but there does not seem to be to me: John can do nothing to change events, and if he never had discovered the girls predictions his son would still have been saved! He finds that crucial prediction on the door (where to go to be saved) but he does not himself transport his son there and could just had left the story at that point - the end would still be the same.<br/><br/>You could actually have taken the entire ""girl making predictions about the future and John finding out about it"" away from the story, the ending would still (or could still have been) the same.<br/><br/>This I think is a flaw in the script.<br/><br/>Thus I have to subtract three stars from an otherwise perfect movie, which I enjoyed very much."

","A movie that turned out much different than what I thought going in. It's one that I can't really get into without ruining it for those that haven't seen it. We have Nic Cage and his son finding a page full of numbers from a 50 year old time capsule at the son's school. Nic Cage, being the brilliant mind that his character is, deciphers the meaning of these numbers and comes up with specific dates and victim numbers of catastrophes that happened on those dates. Every major catastrophe in the last 50 years is covered plus a few more dates yet to happen.<br/><br/>Nic Cage and his crazy hair decide that perhaps these catastrophes can be avoided with the prior knowledge of their occurrence. After a couple of really nifty disasters (the plane crash is really chilling), this movie in which Nic Cage and the daughter of the person who wrote the numbers fight to avert disaster takes a turn that takes the movie to a deeper, horrifying, more unpredictable and (in my opinion) much cooler place that leaves what went on up to the viewer and up for debate.

It seems to just flow through the motions. I really think they could have given Lucinda more face time, and should have given the older Lucinda some small part that would have helped explain the ""chosen"" factor. Some more historical references would have been good I think.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the overall concept, an emotionally devastated widower, single father, astrophysicist and son of a minister who has a broken relationship with his father and seems to be shunning his family, who comes to understand that the scientific approach isn't always the answer to life's questions. Sometimes you just have to go on faith, and when that faith is tested, and proved with logic, you become a teacher, something he eventually learned by trial to appreciate in his own father.<br/><br/>Sadly, the ending leaves us with the notion that though our hero did come to recognize certain truths along the line, his notion was a little too late to serve him in the flesh. His prodigy was allowed to carry on, but he, himself, had to suffer the fate of the rest of the planet.<br/><br/>I loved the scientific facts in this movie, and the reality is that most of this COULD be possible.

","As a big fan of Nicholas Cage since City of Angels, this newest flick seemed like a natural... and hopefully, at least as well done as his efforts in the recent 'National Treasure' series.<br/><br/>It didn't happen that way.<br/><br/>The story looks easily predictable in the beginning... and similar to several standard sci-fi scripts that have appeared before; with one later Outer Limits series episode being quickly familiar. You'll recognize the genre too: The world is going to end and time is limited.<br/><br/>After that, there are children involved, siblings, parents, grandparents, an institution of higher learning and what could have been a really effective romance... even if not in some ethereal sort of way. In fact, you will think that this is exactly where it is taking you until the female lead is mashed in a car accident and then left to die on an ambulance gurney without so much as a parting word for the audience, or cold kiss for good old Nick.<br/><br/>Oh... and there are the obligatory UFOs and aliens, but they are only interested in our children.<br/><br/>Yup, that's right, and with the combination of make-up/appearance and the unerringly suggestive story path, it is fairly convincing to boot. You might even wonder whether these ETs shouldn't be on a sex offender list instead of flitting about the universe snatching kids from dying planets.<br/><br/>Hey, I'm sorry but... they just seemed too doggone happy to leave dear old Dad to fry on this rock while beaming up his adolescent son and the daughter of that now-deceased mother, who was left in an abandoned ambulance to attract flies at the scene of the accident! <br/><br/>In the end, everyone, Dad, Mom, Grandma, Grandpa, Sister... all die.

","Knowing is an interesting movie to discuss. It's the kind of movie where it's very good...until the end. I'll save the end for later in this review, but let me just say that the ending SUCKS. The beginning and middle are a taut, yet flawed piece of cinema, however the end is so unbelievably far fetched and stupid that it ruins the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is another end of the world movie, but this time, it's not by Ronald Emmerich. Nicolas Cage plays a drunk whose son one day brings home a sheet with numbers written on it from a time capsule. After carefully analyzing the numbers, he finds out that they predict dates that people will die and how many people will die on that day. Things don't exactly run swimmingly for him when he realizes the list runs out which means the inevitable: the end of the world! Intriguing, no? Well, not quite.<br/><br/>Though the beginning and middle are actually quite good and interesting, the movie is very clichéd. Just about every sci-fi/horror cliché you could think of is in this. Things like the dark man lurking in the woods, the jump scene, and the ominous music are all seen here. On top of this, the acting is just awful. Nicolas Cage's acting teacher from college must be crying over how bad his performance is. Rose Byrne gives her usual, extremely boring performance. There is one thing I will praise: the special effects. I don't know how much went into special effects for this movie, but they are fantastic. I've never seen such good special effects in a movie before. It should win the Oscar for Special Effects.<br/><br/>Now for the ending. No, I didn't find the ending offensive although many Christians might. It's not The Da Vinci Code, but there are some pretty heavy anti-Christianity themes in it. The ending is completely far fetched. The ending includes Christianity, aliens, solar flares, and pebbles. You try picking up the pieces. You'll never guess how stupid the ending in when you finally see it. I won't say much more than that if anyone does decide to see it, however, I would recommend you rent another DVD. This one's not worth it."
"jotix100","7","0","1","31 August 2009"," Time capsule
","As the story begins, we are taken to a classroom of an elementary school. It is 1959. The teacher, Ms. Taylor, has given the children a project. It consists in creating something, maybe a drawing, an essay, to put inside a time capsule that will be opened in fifty years. Young Lucinda Whelan sits transfixed as she writes down a lot of numbers, while all the others drew pictures of their favorite subjects.<br/><br/>The scene changes to the present time. At the fiftieth anniversary of the interment of the receptacle containing relics from the past, the capsule is opened. Children get an envelope from their peers of half a century ago. Young Caleb Koestler is given the strange letter full of the numbers written by the young girl. Caleb's father, John, an MIT science professor becomes intrigued as to why such a young person could have written what appear to be a coded message. What he finds out will certainly amaze and astound him because Lucinda wrote a sort of document that has to do with human tragedies that follow.<br/><br/>Alex Proyas made an interesting film in which the real and the unreal live side by side. The story by Ryne Douglas Pearson, who collaborated in the screenplay with Juliet Snowden, gets an excellent treatment by the team led by Mr. Proyas, who is making quite a name in sci-fi features as proved with his ""I Robot"". <br/><br/>An inspired Nicolas Cage is at the center of the action. He is a no nonsense science man who knows that ""@&%#"" happens. This is one of Mr. Cage's best screen appearances in recent memory. Rose Byrne was another surprise. She is convincing as the daughter of Lucinda Whalen now living with her own daughter and who knew more than she first tells John Koestler. <br/><br/>Richard Learoy's editing add a new dimension to the film, as well as Marco Beltrami's fine musical score. Cinematographer Simon Duggan captures the fall colors of New England in all their splendor. <br/><br/>Fans of this genre will enjoy ""Knowing"", a triumph for its director, Alex Proyas."
"tieman64","Null","0","1","30 August 2009"," Beware the solar flare
","Alex Proyas plunges further into mediocrity with ""Knowing"", a film that pretends to be science fiction but is really a slice of Christian evangelism.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage plays John Koestler, a professor who has recently lost his wife in a car accident. Because of this tragic event, John no longer believes in God; the universe is vile and uncaring, he muses. Koestler's son Caleb, however, refuses to adopt this atheistic belief, and believes instead that his mother is alive and well in ""heaven"". Caleb's refusal to ""listen"" to his father's beliefs is symbolised by his partial deafness and his need to wear a hearing aid. Equally heavy-handed is the fact that this hearing aid allows the kid to receive messages from God-like alien beings called the Whisperers. In other words, the kid is deaf to the sacrilegious ways of mortal man, but attentive to the teachings of God.<br/><br/>More subtle are the names of the two central characters. Caleb, of course, is named after a famous character in the Hebrew Bible, a figure noted for his steadfast faith in God when the Hebrews refused to enter the promised land of Canaan. In ancient languages the name Caleb itself means ""Servant of the Lord"". In contrast, Nicholas Cage's character (John Koestler) seems to have been named after Arthur Koestler, author of ""The Roots of Coincidence"", one of the first books to deal seriously with synchronicity, a concept that Cage's character wrestles with in the film.<br/><br/>""Knowing"" ends with the news that a solar flare will destroy all surface life on earth. Because they don't wish for all life to perish, the Whisperers, who resemble angelic beings, send down spaceships to ""save"" those ""chosen few"" who can ""hear their voices"". These ""chosen ones"" are taken up to a new planet which resembles a heavenly utopia. Here they roam about this hokey landscape, playing in the grass and frolicking with white rabbits. Proyas perhaps intends to imply that this new race of ""saved ones"" will go forth and multiply like rabid rabbits, but the effect is more humorous than profound.<br/><br/>Meanwhile John, denied entry into heaven, remains on earth. With the solar flare approaching, Earth turns into a literal Hell, flames everywhere, buildings on fire and the skies boiling red. Proyas even goes so far as to throw in brief shots of scantily dressed civilians partying and running about like morons, Earth now becoming some kind of catchment area for the hedonistic, orgy loving, pseudo satanic MTV generation. It's all quite stupid.<br/><br/>So what we basically have here is a retelling of the apocalyptic events prophesied in the New Testament book of Revelations. Armageddon becomes a solar flare, faith in God becomes ""the knowing"", Whisperers become angels, white doves become white rabbits and Nicholas Cage becomes an atheist whilst his kid becomes a child of God who is saved from judgement by his steadfast belief in an odd blend of Christianity and New Age pseudo-scientific mysticism. There are also allusions to the ""white stone"" and ""new names"" prophesied in Revelations, though here they become mysterious black pebbles.<br/><br/>Ignoring the silly religious tone of the picture, the film fails to work as a conventional thriller. Proyas demonstrated that he is incapable of using CGI in ""I, Robot"" and here his FX work is equally ridiculous. A dream sequence features silly CGI animals, a plane crash looks wholly fake, a subway disaster looks like a poor imitations of a similar sequence in ""Speed"" and the final act ""apocalypse"" and ""heaven"" sequences look like cheesy outtakes from Keanu Reeves' ""Constantine"".<br/><br/>A far better film which tackles a similar message (ie - a wholly regressive message) is M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"". Shyamalan, himself a Christian, tells virtually the same story, only he refuses to use CGI and is a bit more restrained. Whatever his limitations, Shyamalan knows the power of imagination. More importantly, he knows that some things just cannot be rendered effectively on screen. Afterall, how can one imagine the unimaginable? How can one communicate, conceive and concretize something that is unknown, unknowable and inconceivable? In film, those who attempt to literalize these things tend to immediately render them trite. It is this lazy need to communicate everything directly with CGI, from the hokey heaven sequence at the end of ""Knowing"", to the revelation of the aliens at the end of ""War of the Worlds"", to the flying bubbles of ""The Fountain"", to the hellish landscapes of ""Constantine"", that often sabotages these ""high concept"" modern scifi flicks. Incidentally, ""Knowing's"" screenplay was written by Stuart Hazeldine, whose first short film was titled ""Christian<br/><br/>5/10 – A cross between ""Final Destination"", ""Signs"" and ""ET"", with a sprinkle of the same hokey new age mysticism of ""Close Encounters"", ""Knowing"" works best in its first act. The film contains one great sequence in which a child sleeps at night whilst ""aliens"" watch over him."

","Spoilers:<br/><br/>OK, this movie is not as bad as it seems. It's tense, intriguing, and ends in a spectacular way. The problem is that it doesn't make any sense. The director had to keep only the scenes with Lucinda writing her numbers, Nicolas Cage telling his story about the Sun, and of course the final episode in a Ronald Emmerich style. The rest is completely obsolete. Thus he could have give us only a 10-15 min movie, but save us from a high risk of mental damage.<br/><br/>Why were these numbers written? The two children were to be taken anyway. There was no point of Lucinda writing these numbers, she just wasted her pencil and a sheet of paper. Everybody died anyway, Nicolas Cage did not save anyone, Diana died exactly on the day predicted by her freaky mother.<br/><br/>And, many people may have missed that point, but this was not a happy ending – two kids and two rabbits (presumably female and male) cannot repopulate a planet because of the ""minimum viable population (MVP) size"" law. So this new beginning in an Eden-like world was mildly speaking, naive.<br/><br/>Why were exactly these children chosen, why could only they hear the ""whispering"" people? No explanation.<br/><br/>How an astrophysicist (Nicolas Cage) could think that a small country house would save him from a global disaster? Some positive sides of the movie: as I already mentioned it's intriguing, but the end spoils it in almost the same way the final pages spoil the John Wyndham's ""Chrysalids"". Also, the irrational Diana's actions and behavior at the end were quite logical for a woman in such a situation. Nicolas Cage and Rose Byrne (I still remember her role in ""Troja"") played quite well, the special effects were OK. But all this cannot save the day for ""Knowing"" and it doomed itself just like it doomed the world. With a breathtaking, but unavoidable ending."

We also get some religious imagery along the way of the sufferings of hellfire when a plane crashes and all these people run around fully aflame, tormented, and similarly a bit further into the movie when we get to see a moose fully on fire in a forest blaze. I didn't know a running animal could burn that well, and they probably can't, so this was one of many speculative religious images – in what I believed to be a sci-fi movie.<br/><br/>Well, sure, there was a kind of spaceship at the end, well a fleet of them, but that was about it for the ""sci"" part.

This movie has a few ridiculous elements to it.

This isn't a must-have or must-see but if you watch it you won't feel let down and it really is good for mixed company. The family drama is a bit tired but whatever, that's Hollywood for you. The action goes beyond the call in terms of CGI effort, and that was a real eye-opener. The cinematography is the same boring stuff you've seen everywhere.

","I just watched Knowing this morning on my computer and I'm a quite disappointed actually. At the beginning I got caught by the mysterious tension and the numbers which reminded me a bit of Joel Schumacher's The Number 23 staring Jim Carry.. I like those kind of movies. Most of the film was entertaining and unlike many other movies I wasn't able to predict what was going to happen next more than a couple of times but I think that's because I had a very different picture in my head. Suddenly at the end of the movie (about 1h40m) I realized what all the mysterious numbers, the whispering people, the picture in Lucinda's house and so on was referring to.. once again Christianity. I must admit I like this alternative view of what we know as 'God' and 'angels' is actually aliens or the other way around. But the moment the aliens got lost of their human cover and turned out to have some sort of light-wings the picture (which was already a bit cracked) burst and got completely destroyed when Caleb, Abby and the other 'Chosen Ones' (might be animals?) got placed on a new planet with a big tree. I don't know if it's just me but I think the film got ruined after mixing religion into it. The idea is okay actually quite good but the way it's used here I don't like. It's written too bold. I was hoping for a mysterious or just sad ending (yeah alright most of the world dies but I don't see this as a 'main-ending') that would have been at the same level as the rest of the story. I'm not a religious person, I believe in facts and theories attached to logic but I'm not denying the existence of something else. Actually I think some watchers of this movie would find it disturbing because of their faith. But back to the movie.

","Nicolas Cage made a movie prior to that (a couple of years before this movie actually) called ""Next"". My first thoughts were, that Knowing sounded to much like that movie.

Alex Proyas is on the helm, which promised me a good movie ...<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage just deliver 100%, the movie has it's holes and bumps, it just doesn't move along smoothly.

","piece of garbage. I am speechless. Cage is a very good actor. Leaving Las Vegas was quite poignant. But this last piece is beyond trash. What is the tree about at the end? A cycle of the bible, with Eve and Adam over again? Was the serpent lurking in the branches? And again, what's this choice of only American daft kids? The other vessels are, I guess, supposed to make us believe that 'samples' were taken from several continents, but that is far from being explicit. Another ethnocentric 'intelligent design' piece of junk. And by the way, the early definitions about determinism and its loosely defined antithesis killed the movie. I wish Cage could work on real movies like he use to, like Dafoe or Rourke do. Cage has earned enough dough through his mediocre views. How much more does he need?"

","A good sci-fi movie should have a few things. Firstly, a possible, yet not always plausible, vision of the future. Secondly, an intriguing story and finally impressive design. I found that all of this was there. The solar flare ending of the world is not as far-fetched as most of us would like to believe and the abundance of earth candidate planets cannot be denied. Although why we would be saved as a species, I am not clear with! The film is a fast-paced action filled, dare I say, great movie. I found myself overlooking the fact that Nicholas Cage's acting skills are almost as wooden as the crucifix that wishes it was in this movie, because I had fun watching it. I was desperately waiting to see what disasters would befall our race. I enjoyed that Alex Proyas refused to bow to the modern-day action/violence cliché where people are killed remarkably quickly without suffering or gore in order to keep that much loved 12A cert, and instead showed some quite harrowing and realistic disaster scenes. The film kept you wondering to a certain extent, enough to keep me enjoying the film so I don't see why there was so much hate for it. Now, I know the ending has splintered people into groups and here's my outlook on this.<br/><br/>*************ENDING SPOILERS*************<br/><br/>After the kids are taken up to the ship and Nicholas Cage farts out his last cruddy moan, my partner turned to me and said, as I expected 100% ""we better still see everyone else die!"". I completely understand that this is how audiences work. They came to see the film after watching a trailer filled with exciting death and destruction scenes so they're going to want to see the world burn. I get it! I too wanted to see Nick Cage screaming for his life with his skin falling off and his hair on fire, sadly this did not come to pass; he did snuff it however, so all is good. You know they can't end the film there as you need to be shown that the kiddies were not taken to planet Boobieblam and chopped into cosmic pie, cue the 'Adam & Eve' scene. Look, you can't please everyone, but you did please me so 6/10"

","I was surprised upon viewing this film as it was a lot more dark and a touch more horrifying than one might have expected. For all its special effects and intended dark tone it struggles to draw in the cinema-goer.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage is always good, a picture with fast action (although this is more broody) grand special effects and he does not fail to deliver. Knowing does create a suspenseful atmosphere but its engagement with extra-terrestrial beings and its far-fetched conclusion really do hamper any strengths the film had.<br/><br/>I was not embroiled in the escapades of Knowing, apart from the great special effects it lumbers somewhat and doesn't manage to keep up the ante to a level of satisfaction."

","I am part of a proud minority who likes Alex Proyas' films. While almost everybody hated 'I, Robot' not having found in it, the image of Asimov's work that they expected I liked the way Proyas dealt with this theme. It looks that this time also few critics enjoyed this film and its ambitions - I actually liked most of its vision and coherence.<br/><br/>'Knowing' starts as some kind of Dan Brown mystery, with a time capsule letter put on earth 50 years ago by a young college student in Massachusetts being found by a nowadays astro-physicist to contain exact dates and number of victims of almost any catastrophic event that happened between 1959 until today. The today hero is played by Nicholas Cage, a widowed single father whose son plays a role in the story, as he seems to start hearing the same voices and has the same vision as the girl who wrote the prophecy 50 years ago. Philosophical discussions about determinism and fate develop in parallel with the anxiety of the characters, the atmosphere slides into Gothic including a Psycho-like mansion that starts to be haunted by strange visitors. The combination between horror and contemporary action films works very well, because it has logic and consistency. It is not only that the special effects are very well made, but they also are in the right place in the story, and the right dose, being not a goal but a means to pass a message.<br/><br/>Sure, this message is ambitious, and for some people it may look disturbing or may seem to question or explain too much fundamental religious beliefs. The final part of the film turns into something again different, big catastrophe film combined with extra-terrestrial visitors a la X-file story. I would have been normally shocked by such an exotic mix, but I actually enjoyed it and made to believe it - in cinema logic terms of course. In many cases the problem with films extra-terrestrial is that they are better when you expect the outer-space visitors than when you see them. Without completely avoiding the slight disappointment one feels seeing on screen outer-space visitors and their space ships, in this case the effects are well made and the graphics beautiful. It is worth seeing the film in cinema theaters by the way, for the dimension of the effects. The camera work and the pallet of colors are also remarkable, and so is the music which combines classical scores by Beethoven for example with the original music of Marco Beltrami. It is only in the final scenes that the cinema solution lacks originality reminding too much 'Contact', but it does fit in the intentions of the authors, and overall the film provides a good cinematographic experience."

","I started watching this film, thinking I would hate it, but it was surprisingly very enjoyable! The plot was terrific, good pacing and character development and the directing was top notch. At first the ""whispering people"" were irritating me, and I wish they had more of a non cliché presence in the earlier part of the film but it still worked out. 2 more things bothered me, the part where Nicholas Cage's character first encounters ""a whispering person"" in the woods and it just turns around and a big glow comes out of it's mouth. That was so cheesy. The same effect could have achieved if it just sent out a high pitched tone that distracted Cage's character.<br/><br/>My third complaint is that they shot it digitally on the Red Camera. The colors were way too saturated and polished. A film like this deserves to be shot on 35 mm.<br/><br/>Other than those 3 things, I really enjoyed it. Check this one out."

","It started very strongly in the set-up scenes, giving a delightfully freaky introduction (though not terribly much). It followed up with some refreshingly gory disaster incidents, too.. The score was nearly perfect, but tried too hard towards the middle-end to pile on the tension. This could spoil the mood for some, as it did for me. In fact that, and the lunatic brandishings by Mr Cage with his shiny revolver, were almost all that spoilt this for me... And perhaps the very last visual before the credits rolled, too.<br/><br/>I can't claim to have an in-depth knowledge of the source material from which the last quarter or so of this movie was based. That said, the smattering of my knowledge that relates directly to the visuals in that section left me quite liking what I saw. (This is me trying to tell you nothing, if you haven't seen it yet). In fact, I think that those images probably bumped it up a point on my 1-10 scale.

","I want to start off by saying I do not thing this movie is the best sci-fi hit like some are complaining this shouldn't be, nor a great directed/written movie. It was an entertaining movie that I gave a decent score for. It did have its weak points in the direction of the plot but, in the end, I was intrigued throughout the film. I do however want to comment on the blanket statements others have posted reviewing this film as some hidden religious agenda about the end times. Yes, you do find many things that are related to the bible... but that is the point. What I found interesting was the story pointed out a common sci-fi theme that is not entirely new... that aliens could have played a major role in our being and evolution. They went another route by tieing in a Christian flavor with the ""book of revelations"". I think those michael mann wanna be's exposing some hidden agenda need to realize the point of the film was to tie all common human history of god/myths/legends of our past into one defining possiblility... that it was all misunderstood as aliens. The aliens had a wispy aura like angel wings, prophets were merely people who received telepathy messages from the aliens warning of our future, the rapture was nothing more than a giant ""noahs arc"" spacecraft which grabbed certain humans as ""chosen"" to preserve the life on earth after doomsday. One way to prove this is the father who was a pastor... a man of faith who by religious edict should have been one of the chosen as the rapture states....though he remained on earth. I just get a kick of those who remember something painful in their childhood in Sunday school and say ""i remember a scary story of the end times, this must be a pro-Christian movie!""... without merely just taking all the information in unbiased and merely seeing it as that... entertaining."

The complexity of the clue was wonderful, the characters were well written and well acted, the spookiness (if that's a word at all) grew at a good pace throughout the film, the weaving of the events into a whole cloth was great, but then it came crashing down in the last 5 minutes. I don't know what went through Pearson's head as he penned the last chapter but I suspect the song ""Come Sail Away"" by the Styx was playing on a continuous loop. Here's the spoiler folks, the angelic beings we see throughout the film trying to make contact with the child lead are aliens. Not only are they aliens they are pretty weak aliens. They sent the knowledge of Earth's impending disaster to us 50 years ago through a child. While they had the ability to foresee major disasters on a stellar and local scale, and they had the ability to translate the information into our calendar and GPS systems, they did not seem to know it would have been better to broadcast a signal instead and possibly mention the whole ""world will die in 2009"" thing so that we might be motivated to do something about it. Instead they play mysterious and using their psychic powers contact some kids, make people think they are nuts and eventually spirit away a few human children and put them in a zoo. OK, maybe it's not a zoo but if it isn't, then you have a few human children dropped on an alien world with little or no survival skills and no elders to teach them anything (Thanks soooo much Mr alien, now we can all die from a thousand different problems or go feral).

","**WARNING - SPOILERS** Prof. John Koestler (Cage), gets his mitts on a piece of paper with a long sequence of numbers on it that – to cut a long story short - predicts the end of the world. As one probably would in these situations, Koestler sets out to try to prove this to anyone who will listen in a desperate attempt to save mankind. Meanwhile Koestler's son starts to see strange blond people skulking about in the woods around their house.<br/><br/>This movie had my eyes glued to the screen until the last 20 minutes or so. It was interesting, scary, disturbing and I couldn't wait to see what happened next. My movie snacks lay forgotten, the plot had me hooked. The plane crash sequence frightened the hell out of me and so did the story and Koestler started to uncover more of the mystery surrounding the final numbers. even the ridiculous blond people were eerie. Then the movie started to draw to a close and I opened a bag Maltesers to counter-balance my disappointment.<br/><br/>I found the sequences leading to the end predictable and ridiculous, and I think the scene with the children reaching their new home was out of place and unnecessary. I would have been happy just to leave that part to the imagination and watch earth's spectacular doom on its own. Their departure could have been concluded the same way without the scene. Their new home has an Eden-like vibe to it, complete with all-too-immaculate CGI scenery and a big shiny tree. It kinda reminded me of a shampoo commercial for some reason. I also thought that if the aliens/angels had taken that much trouble to make sure that the human race would continue elsewhere, they would not have just dumped these kids somewhere on their own and left them to their own devices, free to make all the same horrendous mistakes we humans seem to be all too proficient at. Maybe I am just skeptical, but I see a 'Lord of the Flies' type situation developing very quickly in this new place.<br/><br/>Despite this I was impressed with the subsequent ending scenes, set apart from many apocalyptic movies churned out by Hollywood. Aside from the few children and white rabbits the aliens/angels whisked away, no one and nothing is spared, and the desperation and despair of those who remain, along with the destruction of E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G is impressive. It makes a change from the typical ending where the resourceful and virtuous heroes crawl out from their clever hiding places to cry and clutch each other joyfully before skipping off to rebuild their shattered lives.<br/><br/>I give this movie 7 out of 10 - Silly and predictable towards the end (""please don't let it be aliens, please don't let it be aliens. . . awww, damn - it's aliens""), but also thought provoking and disturbing. Nicholas Cage is better than I have seen him in a while."

","WARNING: SPOILERS WITHIN.<br/><br/>I'm stumped by the negative reviews here. To me, this movie can't be worth less than 5 stars. Giving it one or two stars just betrays immovable mindset or a deep-seated bias of some kind on the part of the reviewer. If you're one who reads reviews before deciding what movie to watch (like me), I'd advise not to ditch it on account of the number of extremely negative reviews here, unless you're sure you share the same likes/dislikes as the reviewers.<br/><br/>As an non-religious person I wasn't offended at all by this movie, despite some here suggesting it smacked of a hidden Christian agenda (Narnian agenda?). Did the aliens really come to save the sons & daughters of Adams and Eve because they believed? Well, you could interpret it that way. But it could as well be that they came to save the telepathic/clairvoyant children. If anything, it reminds me more of Arthur C. Clark's Childhood's End, where the 'old' humankind dies in favour of the 'new' (telepathic/clairvoyant) one.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. As I write this I'm still having parts of the movie play out in my mind, which I liked. And that usually happens when the movie is good. The airplane crash scene was gripping (some reviewer said saying Hey! to a burning survivor was unrealistic, but I've never ran into an airplane crash before so I wouldn't know if I'd be responding realistically if that happens!). The solar burst revelation. Cage's heartfelt performance on having to let go of his child. The hopelessness of the final destruction.<br/><br/>I was worried it would use the aliens as a deus ex machina, but it didn't. Well, maybe it did partially (for the children), but the fact that a whole lot of people died (an understatement) including the main protagonist, made it felt like it didn't. So in a way it is a very refreshing deus ex machina. Also, the aliens were woven as early and as best as possible into the storyline so to me it didn't feel ridiculous at all that they'd make a reveal-all appearance at the end.<br/><br/>8/10."

","An interesting tale that I went into blind. Again, this newfangled notion of Knowing all about the various aspects of a film spoils things. More than likely, it is because I am growing older and used to a movie naturally unveiling its secrets and charms. Perhaps, the youth of today, who were born into the information age are naturally conditioned to expect a synopsis that will make sense with the subliminal every-scene-flashed-before-your-eyes trailers. At any rate, it was nice to let this one unfold on its own.<br/><br/>Knowing is a decent, well made film. It stars Nicholas Cage. Cage is a reliable actor because he plays himself, as he believes the character would be as Nicholas Cage. Audiences accept Cage in this way. We like him as a measured lunatic (Honeymoon In Vegas), a funny lunatic (Vampire's Kiss), and a full on lunatic (Wild At Heart). When allowed to, Cage steps out of his skin and into roles fashioned for the big boys (Leaving Las Vegas). He excels in such surroundings, but you get the sense he does not love them.<br/><br/>Chandler Canterbury is fine as Cage's young son burdened with having to grow up too soon. Rose Byrne turns in a nice performance as a link to the to the mystery Cage so desperately needs to resolve. Both provide welcome company to Cage's tossed-into-the rabbit hole existence.<br/><br/>Special effects abound, and the CGI just keeps getting better with each new release. 'Knowing' has some profoundly realistic CGI sequences that are a must see for fans of FX. The computer gaming industry pushed visual and audio technology to greater heights until Hollywood got a hold of it. The town did what it does best: make magic. These days, teams of amazing technologists can be as important to a film as the cinematographer. They will one day replace them, when exterior locations are too unhealthy for filming.<br/><br/>My only grousing with 'Knowing' is in some of the run of the mill goofy movie dialog. However, it is minimal, and I tried to chalk it up to the characters 'state of shock' disposition. I would have liked to see a bit more science, especially from the academia angle that was introduced early on. However, it is addressed in the 'special features' section.<br/><br/>The story line is pretty much equal parts fantasy and science. As a sci-fi fan, I rate the film a respectable six out of ten tribbles. I would like to compare this film to some favorable films I have seen, but it would give too much insight into the plot. In addition, I would rather be sparse in a review so you might enjoy the surprises as well.'Knowing' is a nice rental when you're in the sci-fi mood."

","Regardless of what I though of the movie overall, nearly 24 hrs later and the movie is still with me. Overall, I thought the movie was well done. It managed to mix the thriller genre while successfully (to a greater or lesser degree) incorporating both the sci-fi and spiritual elements. Most of it worked. Most.<br/><br/>While trying not to give too much away, the plot can be summarized as the story of a widowed father that has resigned himself to the scientific as a result of her death. After a 50 year old time capsule is opened revealing a list of numbers, he begins to notice a patten defining every major catastrophe over the past 50 years. As he follows the pattern, trying to prevent the events to come, he begins to wonder what all of this has to do with him and his son. It is a good thriller and it kept me second guessing myself throughout.<br/><br/>I think the hardest part for me with this movie was the special effects. Now, whoever did the graphics certainly did a better job than I could ever do, but as this seemed like a big budget movie and as we've see many movies with similar visual sequences done so smoothly, I was very disappointed and I actually had to try to convince myself to ignore the music video par cgi so I could appreciate the movie. As an example, the fire at the plane scene was very flat and the subway lighting and textures were not believable. Even movies like what pixar has put out have been able to create realistic flowing so the long grass appearing so outdated, again, took away from the believability. Though I will definitely compliment whoever made the object that caused Cage's character to fall to his knees towards the end. THAT was impressive.<br/><br/>I think had it not had so many similarities to things such as Signs, or Armageddon, or Die Hard (high tension action), I think it would have gotten a better score.<br/><br/>But that said, I would still highly recommend this movie!"

","A professor of astrophysics (Nicolas Cage) stumbles upon a complex series of numbers that predicts natural disasters and even more amazingly how many people will die in them. Now he sees it as his job to save those who would perish, but is his role already factored into the equation? Can he change the future or only be a part of it? <br/><br/>Let us start off by addressing Nic Cage's bad acting. There are exceptions, such as ""Adaptation"", but generally if you want a quality acting performance you don't call upon Nicolas Cage. He somehow sells movies, often even action flicks (""National Treasure"", ""Con Air"", ""Face/Off""), but can be unreliable. He's like a slightly less goony Jeff Goldblum in many respects. That being said, Cage does a fine job in ""Knowing""... so maybe he's finally got a handle on his skills.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert loved this film and gave it four stars, if the cover of the box is to be believed. I generally have a high respect for Ebert, and can usually see his points. On this occasion, I'm not completely sure I do. I haven't read the full review, which would probably explain more, but this was not a four star film. Two and a half, maybe. Despite many great things -- the acting, the general plot, the decent effects -- it is a flawed film and sort of needs patching. To put it in the ""four star"" category is insulting to other films there.<br/><br/>I loved the cinematography and think they took lessons from ""Children of Men"". One scene featuring a plane crash was very well done with the ""camera-in-tow"" method and lack of cuts. I wouldn't mind seeing more of this in films, though I'm still torn on the shakiness that tends to accompany it.<br/><br/>As I say, the film is not flawless. I don't know much about science or astrophysics, so I can't comment on the accuracy of those parts. However, I do object to the idea that determinism says everything happens for a reason. Determinism may say everything has a cause, but to say it has a ""reason"" implies a meaning behind it, which is simply not true. Things may or may not have a meaning, but determinists are not all in agreement on that point. So, if that was what the film was suggesting, I disagree.<br/><br/>I also object to the use of putting the opening credits over a still background rather than during the opening scene. To keep the pace moving and the film a shorter length, this could have been changed. Lastly, the movie crumbles in the third act -- at least for me. I can't really say why without spoiling the film, but there's a twist and turn in there that was completely unnecessary and which doesn't explain some of the plot holes as much as I would like. A second viewing may help me (it was pointed out to me after the fact how much foreshadowing there is in the first ten or fifteen minutes), but some aspects just don't add up for me.<br/><br/>""Knowing"" is an enjoyable watch, but may leave you stale. I would recommend watching it alongside ""The Screwfly Solution"", as they would create an interesting contrast. Beyond that, I don't know... a good film but not the science fiction masterpiece you've been waiting for."

","It is obvious now that the idea of the end of our dear planet is popular, but until now it seems to me that only R.Emmerich has got it right ( The Day After Tomorrow , 2012 ),older movies to be disregarded ( e.g. Meteor , The Earthquake ) ,as everything else is simply more or else vacuous , with a storyline that sends you shivering , or ,as this is the case with Knowing , has too much empty space in between three well-depicted scenes of disaster . The idea here is in the best vein of Nostradamus' predictions , here discovered on a piece of paper in the form of numbers that the main hero N. Cage decodes easily, realizing that it is about the dates of accidents and major disasters with the Apocalyptical end nigh and unavoidable ( the major solar flare , original !) , and the group of children ,hearing inexplicable voices ,his son , of course , being among , what turns out at the end ,the chosen ones , and having been selected by the 'angels' , sort of energy –looking creatures tasked to save specimens of humans and transport them to another habitable planet , and that scene is to be looked at closely ! Christian symbolism is here more than tangible ,but there is just too much empty walking,talking and soul searching,and Mr.Cage is just too darn extra dramatical ,tragic and glum. Why do a lot of H-wood movies have to have heroes whose darling ones are deceased ,and ,the new trend , having only one parent ,who has to be a scientist no less –watch The Day the Earth Stood Still and wonder, this is just too stale and boring ?! Visual side is acceptable ,but only three scenes ,done by unknown nosy upstarts, where the angels uncannily resemble the creatures from The Close Encounters of The Third Kind ,while the rest is monotonous cinematic boredom ! And a poor commercial for Mazda vehicles , and I strongly doubt that this film will do any good to the company in terms of sales !"
"elshikh4","6","0","2","21 June 2009"," Feel Hoaxed?, Depressed?, or Like Someone Finished a Bad Movie?.. Then Read This !
","Few times in my life I felt that I need to scream right in the movies. The ""Get me out of here"" symptoms attacked me this time outrageously. So let's take it step by step. It starts like a fine X File. Actually, the first 3/4 of the movie is such a solid and attractive paranormal thriller. But after that, well.. you can say totally confident that the disaster hit it BADLY!<br/><br/>I can't forget the climactic sequence where our dear terrestrial globe got wholly exploded!!! Psychologically speaking, I felt that the movie's makers are desperate ones, having some hard problems in their life, so they had to make a movie that ends this world, and starts sweeter and happier new one! Or maybe, on the contrary, they lead a pretty restful life, and had to destroy the world for the poor us to make some money!<br/><br/>Anyway, it's an excellent movie till its end. The performance was fabulous; I've never seen Cage that deep - like in the lecture scene - unless too scarcely. Though, that wasn't the right movie to experience that well, or to relish it that long. The real outstanding accomplishment ever done by this movie was its music. It's a complete enjoyment to feel how eccentric and eerie the way it carried out the events. It's so horrific at places, expressing perfectly the story's oddity and obscurity, and presaging its ominous end as well. Alex Proyas's direction, with or without the master scene of the falling plane, was catchy enough. The pre-end scenes, with hundreds of extras, are a sign of extraordinary director. In fact, movies like (Dark City - 1998) or (I, Robot - 2004) might have problems, but still Proyas's direction is a mark of proficiency, and undoubtedly one of their best points if not the best. Which leads us to (Knowing)'s WORST points.<br/><br/>Simply, what this movie is about? It's obviously about Knowing, no less, no more. Knowing the fact about this universe as a wholly strictly systematic entity, where there is one mighty power that controls everything and everyone; previously and impeccably. So that's why the Quran refers to God as ""the Knower of the Unseen"". And all what this movie says is that man can't change a bit in this completed destiny already, even if he knew beforehand what's hidden or unseen. It's a profound faith message, but expressed in a bad way I suppose!<br/><br/>First of all, we watched a father who couldn't stop any of the 3 disastrous prophecies. Instead, he got to believe satisfyingly in the higher power, and its wisdom, even if it predestined the death of his wife, the ultimate decampment of his son, then his own death with the rest of the world too. So we all have the incapacity of switching anything of what's written, or what God have already decided, only the capacity of searching for the truth and, as this movie shows, believing in destiny whatever the case may be. However, the movie didn't implant carefully these lovely meanings earlier or extensively, presenting to us a thriller that, at best, would make us enjoy our times with another paranormal case, while it's utterly not. That makes you feel tricked eventually, let alone give you an effective depressing feel after, causing the ""Get me out of here"" symptoms; as if it's a thriller with awfully unhappy end, because it sated, like any other thriller, the suspenseful atmosphere smartly, while it didn't do the same with its different high meaning.<br/><br/>Secondly, the reaction of Cage's father when he knows about the possibility of his town's destruction saying: ""If god needed me, I'm Ready!!"". This is goofy; as a suicide more than faith on one hand, and as a way to embody the conflict between science (Cage as biology teacher) and religion (the father as a priest) on the other hand.<br/><br/>Thirdly, minor points. I mean Cage's character finds everything so plainly and quickly to a strange extent. For instance, he merely used the internet to find ALL the accidents of the twentieth century, in FULL details! Or how he gets all the earth's longitudes and latitudes by a small device which it happens that he owns one! Moreover, the fatuous CGI that made the train vaporize the people in the subway's accident! Or the scene in which the kid is writing unconsciously another series of disasters!! How is that since the world is about detonation anyway??!! Not to mention, one naively-made scene, where the divine creatures transport the 2 children to the other land. For one thing, its imagination wasn't that different from Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and for another, I don't think that these ethereal creatures, that disguise in human bodies, got bottoms after taking off these very bodies! And finally, the movie makers' conviction about angels that choose many young Adams and Eves for a new world is beyond me.<br/><br/>Years from now, I know, a lot of reviews will talk and talk about how this movie was misunderstood, how it's a lost gem. But for me, it's just a try to say something great in another thriller. However, that try wasn't harmonious, satisfactory or great itself."

"TheEtherWalk","7","0","1","21 April 2009"," Brilliant, BUT...
","Knowing is a terrific film by the director of Dark City that combines bone-chilling horror with a great story and amazing visuals. There is a feeling of sheer dread throughout, especially if you know how it's going to end. I had to keep telling myself it was only a movie. The musical score is excellent and really accentuates the terror and emotional impact of the whole movie. Nicolas Cage pulls off one of his best performances in years, and even though a lot of what he does ends up being futile, I really felt for all the characters. It seems a lot of the problems people had with the movie had to do with the plot, and while it's not flawless it's still really well told. Alex Proyas is known for being a stylistic director, and for this reason you should probably watch this with a certain frame of mind. Try to feel your way through the movie instead of over-thinking every little detail. It's an emotional roller-coaster ride and one of the best movies of 2009 so far. On top of everything, the action scenes are awesome.<br/><br/>EDIT: Upon further review, my opinion has changed about this movie. I still think it's really well made, but I have to comment on the weird symbolisms and imagery used in the movie. For example, the rabbits may seem out of place until you realize that rabbits were sacred to the religion of Baal, a solar deity. This and other things in the film are related to kabbalism and occultism. If you believe in the Illuminati, you know that they control Hollywood and put their symbols in many films, for example the Nick Cage movies National Treasure 1 and 2. This movie may be part of a broader agenda by very sick and dangerous people. Their final goal is to sacrifice all of humanity to their solar deity who they still worship. You may not believe it but its symbolized everywhere. So enjoy the movie but understand what these things mean."
"RCWjr","6","0","1","16 April 2009"," Almost a really good movie.....
","For about three quarters of the film, I was totally engrossed with the story and characters. Then the plot twist enters and the movie went to blazes and a hand basket from there.<br/><br/>I normally enjoy Nicholas Cage. He can play some quirky folks, but he is always enjoyable. That is the case here, there is really nothing wrong with his performance, or with anyones performance for that matter. The problem lies within the story and how it plays out.<br/><br/>We have this intriguing numbers riddle that Cage is able to work out. All of it is counting down to the end of the world. Can he stop it? Can he save his son? Is there nothing that can be done? The movie asks those questions and you are taken along for the ride wondering what those answers will be. For me, the answers were unsatisfying. <br/><br/>I walked out of the theater wondering just what the heck the movie supposedly stood for."
"Ric-7","6","0","1","15 April 2009"," Determinism Equals Intelligent Design?
","Early in the film, there is much made of the very old philosophical question of whether life is merely a random occurrence, or whether there is a plan being followed. This is not just a religious question--it is the FIRST question. And that question leads to others, such as how free will is constrained by the Plan. And the ultimate question--exactly what IS the Plan? This film is based on that series of questions, and the film maker elects to answer the questions unambiguously.<br/><br/>An earlier IMDb commentator referred to this film as religious propaganda, a fairly good assessment in my view (my impression of the last scene is that it is located in the New Eden). The aliens were also remarkably similar to angels. The religious propaganda never goes beyond themes into any specific dogma or theology. It is unlikely that any orthodox or fundamentalists would be able to reconcile the film with their beliefs.<br/><br/>Determinism seems to be the equivalent of Intelligent Design. The film suggests that the intelligence which originally designed the universe is also still in control--the Planner is determining future events.<br/><br/>The creators of this film are entitled to their view, but I think that view would have been much better served had the film ended with Nicolas Cage grieving at the departure of his son. Everything that comes afterward is unnecessary literal confirmation of what should have been only hinted."
"Stanto","8","0","1","12 April 2009"," This film surprises and carries you smoothly towards it.
","I watched the trailers for this film, as usual thinking that it'd summarised the film. Predictions, explosions, they find a way through it.<br/><br/>I was amazed to discover that the film is dark, it creates a foreboding atmosphere which it carries through the film well.<br/><br/>What was not presented via the trailer, or hinted at greatly throughout the start is that the film is science fiction and this is why I feel many people think that Knowing drops 'the ball' because it's not how they expect it to turn out.<br/><br/>Religious connotations, influences and science fiction brought together in a crescendo that works well and draws you in.<br/><br/>If you were told the details in the trailer; it would've been ruined for you. It makes a refreshing change."
"stephen-chalmers","7","0","1","12 April 2009"," Suspense, disaster scenes, dodgy ending.
","I did not know what to expect with Knowing and avoided reading reviews etc so I went in with an open mind. It starts off well enough, the time capsule idea is well done and the revelation of the dates and times of disasters is great. The movie has quite intense moments, something I don't experience too often, and the three disaster scenes, the aircraft, the subway trains and the solar flair are brilliantly carried off. About half way through the time I was beginning to have doubts about what sort of movie this was. I was half thinking it was of the DaVinciCode genre but humanoid aliens acting in a sinister manner who later turn out to be child abductors to an alien planet - well really! I know you should not question too closely when it can spoil your enjoyment of the experience, but with Knowing the end was really too much of a let down. I enjoyed it all the same for the sheer unexpectedness of the plot, the reasonably good acting by Cage and the effects."
"michael-turner13","6","0","1","9 April 2009"," Not to bad
","Basically the story is that a kid gets a sheet of paper with a load of dates, times and locations of each major disaster in the past 50 years and his dad uses to try and save the world.<br/><br/>My opinion of the story line is this. Starts off well and carries on in a straight line until the middle were it begins to fall part way down in to the abyss of weirdness.<br/><br/>As for the acting it above average. 6/10. I do not know what else to say about it. The same applies to the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Apart from the above I don't know what to say. Overall a decent way to spend a weekend afternoon."
"moviefreak92","7","0","1","3 April 2009"," They said it was a love/hate movie...
","Everything I read before seeing this film pegged it as either a movie you end up loving...or one you end up hating. I agree, and am glad to announce I fit in the former category - especially because I really wanted to like this movie.<br/><br/>Granted, it was nothing like I thought it would be. I didn't know it had such a strong ""sci-fi"" lean. But that ended up being okay.<br/><br/>I also wasn't sure about Nicolas Cage. I'll be the first to admit that I've seen him in roles I liked and roles I disliked. He isn't one of my favorite actors, but his movies intrigue me. Yet even though his performance in this film is one of his better from recent years, he wasn't the standout in the cast. I personally believe the claps on the back go to Chandler Canterbury, Rose Byrne, and Lara Robinson.<br/><br/>Chandler Canterbury's performance as Caleb, Nic Cage's son, is reminiscent to me of the kid who played Danny Torrance in ""The Shining."" Rose Byrne as Diana was probably the best in the cast--unlike Cage, whose reactions were not always believable (though I have to admit that he was admirable during the spaceship scene near the end), I easily recognized the terror she was trying to exhibit, especially in the few scenes just before her death. And Lara Robinson as both Lucinda and Lucinda's granddaughter (Diana's daughter) was terrifying as the former and impressive as the latter.<br/><br/>Not to mention the CGI in the movie. The plane crash scene was--to abandon proper terms momentarily--really, really COOL. And also really, really SCARY. The subway and burning forest/animals scenes also terrified me in an almost irrational way. It was almost too real, if that makes any sense. And the end--the destruction of Earth--was the same.<br/><br/>I could have done without the aliens at the end. Still, I think, somehow, that leaving the movie with everyone dead might have detracted from its overall effect. And the final cut, the children running toward the white tree, was surreal. In a good way.<br/><br/>I left the theater completely shaken and wowed. With a desire to see it again, and take all the friends who expressed doubt at its worth.<br/><br/>I can't say if you'll like it or not, because as I said, it's either love or hate. But ""Knowing"" is better than having no idea. :)"

The movie kept me entertained through the majority of the film until the final fifteen minutes. I was glad to see the end of the annoying daughter of the spooky kid who wrote the predictions 50 years earlier. The movie was going well for me until she flipped and drove off with the two kids. Then the aliens arrive to steal the car and kidnap the kids. Then Nic Cage tracks the the stolen car and find the kids and then let the aliens just take his son in their giant space ship ( Really ). After a 30 second of a sort of emotional goodbye. Nic Cage lets is son go while he and the rest of the world disintegrates. The effects are wow. The story is good apart from the aliens.
