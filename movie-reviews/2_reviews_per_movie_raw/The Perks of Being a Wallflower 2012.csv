","Went to an advance screening expecting your usual ""shy kid in high school learns to stick up for himself"" sort of feel-good drama. This movie is so much more than that - I was truly blown away by the mature themes and moving characters. Mental illness, sexual abuse, drugs and alcohol... I think the writer/screenwriter/director said it best in the Q+A after when he said it was a film that looked at the emotional aspects of that point in life without being sentimental. I really cared about these three teens - Charlie, Sam, and Patrick - and their story never felt cheesy. Just real, and moving, and touching. Go see this movie!"
"sleepyandawake","10","440","529","21 September 2012"," One of the best of 2012 so far.
","I had the pleasure of seeing Perks Of Being A Wallflower at Arclight Cinemas in LA yesterday and it was definitely worth the one hour drive.<br/><br/>The story is very simple yet complicated because of how much goes on. But the way it unfolds is beautiful and sad, sometimes all at once. While it has its funny moments, it also manages to go through dark topics as well such as homosexuality, drugs and death. Stephen Chbosky handles his story very well, never feeling like it's being forced but rather it flowed nicely and carefully.<br/><br/>Directing wise, it was shot very well. The cinematography is gorgeous, especially the scenes where the camera overlooks the skyline of Pittsburgh and during intimate scenes between the characters. You could not get anyone better to direct it other than the author himself because this is his book. This is his vision so he knows exactly how it goes in his head and we can see throughout the film, just how much his vision has truly come alive. The result is both engaging and satisfying.<br/><br/>Same thing with the writing. The dialogue is very honest and beautifully well written. It was very fun to quote along with the movie. Not just the writing but the overall tone of the film reminds me a little bit of John Hughes' work. Adapting a epistolary book into a film is incredibly challenging but Mr. Chbosky did a fine job of translating it into a film.<br/><br/>The musical score is done by Michael Brook who's also responsible for Into The Wild, another favorite of mine, and he did a very good job. In fact, one of the scores made me cry because of how it emotionally resonated with the scene it was fitting in. The soundtrack is awesome. Along with Mr. Chbosky, Alexandra Patsavas, who's also the music supervisor for The OC, did a great job of picking out the songs and treated it as if it were a mix tape.<br/><br/>Logan Lerman, my god, he did a masterful job as Charlie. The character literally jumped out of the book and made its way onto the big screen. Logan's performance blew me away. He did such an amazing job portraying the embodiment of Charlie through his expressions, his emotions, his movements, everything! So perfectly cast. The last 10 minutes of the movie alone is awards worthy because it really shows how talented he really is. I fell in love with his performance. So perfect in every way.<br/><br/>Emma Watson did a great job playing as Sam. She is very beautiful and charming. As for her American accent, I thought she did an okay job. There were times where you can kind of hear her British accent slip in and even though you notice it, it's nothing distracting and it didn't really bother me. But you have to give her credit for trying her best and she truly did. I enjoyed her performance very much.<br/><br/>The second standout of the film is Ezra Miller! He plays Patrick, a gay character who's not afraid of who he is and Ezra portrays him amazingly well. I've seen almost all of his work, and he's becoming a great actor who's very rare in the sense that he's brave and daring in contrast to the roles he has previously played. He steals every line and scene he's in, becoming the comic relief. But even so, Patrick has his own personal problem and this is where Ezra Miller proves once again just how great of an actor he is.<br/><br/>Everyone else in their supporting roles all have their moments. Nina Dobrev, who plays Candance aka Charlie's sister, did a good job. Mae Whitman as Mary Elizabeth was hilarious. Adam Hagenbuch as Bob was great. Erin Wilhelmi as Alice, Johnny Simmons as Brad and Nicholas Braun as Derek were all fine. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast: Kate Walsh and Dylan McDermott who play the parents as well as Joan Cusack who plays Charlie's Doctor were all good, despite having little screen time. Melanie Lynskey did a very good job as Aunt Helen. Paul Rudd as Mr. Anderson is awesome. He's also a standout. Paul Rudd in general is a very likable actor and again, he doesn't have a lot of screen time either but he still manages to play his part memorably. <br/><br/>What makes the cast so special is the chemistry. Everyone got along so well and you can tell that they're very comfortable with each other and you feel convinced that these people are really friends. It was absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>I love this movie. It's amazing. And I'm not just saying this because I'm a die-hard fan of the book. It has a great script, great cast, it's well directed, awesome soundtrack and undeniable strong performances. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower may not be the most faithful adaptation but the spirit of the story is still there and it does great justice to the book. This is one of the best coming of age movies I've ever seen."
"billygoat1071","10","216","257","1 October 2012"," Being Infinite
","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is another story about a simple guy living in a cruel life of high school. The difference is he's not ought to save the day, wants to lose his virginity, seeking to be popular, or revenge on his bullies. The story is about a shy kid who wants to get along with people and can't wait to leave high school. Behind it is the genuine pain and emotion of the characters which makes it more than just another story about teenagers. Stephen Chbosky tells his own story on screen pretty well and the performances are quite excellent. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is often heartbreaking, charming, and wonderful.<br/><br/>Charlie is palpably just another teenage protagonist, but he is not one of those who tries to prove everyone who mistreated him wrong. His goal is to get away from being anti-social and be like anyone else in high school. We may have heard a story like this before, but what makes this one extraordinary is when it mostly depicts the darkest aspects of their lives. Expressing the most heartbreaking truths about these teenagers. Knowing their problems easily makes it reasonable for us to care about them. The romance is rather credibly lovely than a mainstream claptrap. In the joyous moments, it's pretty delightful and plays a quite nostalgic soundtrack.<br/><br/>The film gives the actors some nuance. This is probably a good thing for Logan Lerman. He usually plays the simple charming guy in movies. Since he's good at those, he adds some credibility to Charlie. Emma Watson is likable enough as Sam. The best among the three is Ezra Miller. One might hams it up for Patrick, but Miller gave the character a genuinely wonderful personality.<br/><br/>The director and author, Stephen Chbosky, didn't try anything else than to bring his book to life. He tells it straightforward on screen with plenty of strong, effective emotions. The cinematography is bright and beautiful enough. The tunnel scene has the best shots. While the soundtrack is too conspicuous, the music score is noticeably melancholic.<br/><br/>The Perks of Being a Wallflower is best if you can actually relate to the lead character or have experienced the struggles of being an adolescent. When it's not depressing, the film goes to those blissful moments that make us remember the good times in high school. Overall, it's a great film. It's a film adaptation that replaces the clich√© mainstream swagger with some painful realities and simply let the audience understand the whole point of it. In the end, it's quite a remarkable film."

","Stephen Chbosky has taken his exceptional novel and made it an extraordinary film. As the opening credit rolled I was impressed with the quality of the cast including Emma Watson, Paul Rudd, Kate Walsh, and Dylan McDermott. And to top it off, Joan Cusak is there as well.<br/><br/>This is a story of coming of age and coming to terms of a boy entering high school and adulthood. Freshman Charlie (Logan Lerman) almost by accident becomes friends with Patrick (Ezra Miller) and his stepsister Sam (Emma Watson). Soon he is hanging out learning about the ins and outs of being a teen. But there is something that is left unsaid, is it about his last best friend or his aunt.<br/><br/>Chbosky must have been blessed by John Hughes. Not only capturing this timeless story with every word and sight, the film's soundtrack blows me away. Not many can take a book of such depth and keep the heart and soul of it alive, but it happened here. Go to the theatre and see it. Check out the book and read it. But most of all, Stay Infinite!"

","Greetings again from the darkness. Brace for gushing. Last evening I attended a screening that included a fascinating Q&A with writer/director Stephen Chbosky. It reminded me of how personal and intimate and observant and incisive a well-made film can be. A well written script is so refreshing, and an exceptional script can be truly breath-taking. Mr. Chbosky takes the unusual step of directing his own screenplay based on his own novel (a 1999 bestseller), and he left me stunned and enthralled.<br/><br/>The popularity of the novel would typically make the film version a disappointment for its fans. Not so this time. Mr. Chbosky remains true to the spirit despite the need to edit for the sake of continuity and brevity. The key characters spring to life thanks to the efforts of four strong performances from young actors: Logan Lerman (Percy Jackson, The Three Muskateers) plays Charlie, Emma Watson (Harry Potter films) is Sam, Ezra Miller (We Need to Talk About Kevin, City Island) is Patrick, and Mae Whitman (Arrested Development) is Mary Elizabeth.<br/><br/>If you have read the book, you know the story ... you know the characters ... you know the themes. If you haven't read the book, I will spoil nothing. The brilliance is recognized only as you get to know these characters and slowly uncover their stories. What we discover is that, regardless of our age, we recognize these characters from our high school days. We know the introverted, observant Charlie who so desperately needs a support system. We surely recognize the attention-starved, lacking in self-esteem Sam who is the epitome of ""We accept the love we think we deserve"". And we all knew a Patrick ... the flamboyant one who sheaths his pain with an over-the-top act of public confidence. What Chbosky does is shine the spotlight on these characters to ensure that we really SEE them this time.<br/><br/>The themes reminded me a bit of a darker John Hughes film (that's a compliment). There were also pieces of two other really good films: Stand By Me and Almost Famous. The formative years of a writer determine the depths to which his or her work will reach later in life. Admittedly, the film is substantially autobiographical, so when Mr. Chbosky says it's a personal story, we begin to understand the foundation of his remarkable writing style.<br/><br/>""Welcome to the island of misfit toys."" When this line is spoken, we realize that most every high school kid has thought the same thing at some point. These are painful and difficult times and as Mr. Chbosky stated, we should encourage kids to fight through this stage and get on to the next ... then able to find their true self. Clearly, the film made a strong impact on me. My favorite reaction to a movie is profound thought, and this one caused this in waves. The decision to release as PG-13 was wise. There is no excess of profanity or nudity to divert attention from what really matters ... the characters. I can think of no finer compliment to a writer and filmmaker than to cite them as the cause of my internal discussions related to their film. My hope is that you have the same reaction.

"tiarockz","10","142","186","9 September 2012"," Young Cast Give Amazing Performances, Great Soundtrack, Emotionally Moving
","I absolutely loved this film - specifically the acting, music and even at times the cinematography. Steven Chbosky captured the spirit of the book and the characters magnificently - Ezra and Logan give exceptional performances that deserve major credit. Emma gives a strong performance as Sam - you can tell that she really understands the character, however she does struggle a bit with the American accent. Not to worry - she's in Bling Ring next year and will have improved by then, she does a great job of finding her ground and portraying a troubled yet lovable and wonderful teen, at times her actions speak much louder than her words. Logan is phenomenal at every aspect of Charlie - awkward, unsure, emotional, honest - he gives an amazing performance. Ezra is hilarious but not gimmicky, and can flip to a somber tone at a moment's notice and have everyone spellbound. Also great performances from Mae Whitman, Nina Dobrev and Johnny Simmons. The young cast is truly the heart of the film and are all really great. There is a lot of humour, emotion, honesty, everything it needed, and also an excellent soundtrack to back it up."
"stanhdeeks","9","129","172","10 September 2012"," Saw this at TIFF 2012
","Saw this movie at TIFF and after watching the trailer was thinking I was going to enjoy this movie. Those expectations now are so very low, this movie is amazing. It speaks on many different levels of being a teenager, dealing with death, loneliness, and how awkward it can be trying to fit in. I haven't seen a move like this in a very long time and was very refreshing. The highlight of the film for me at least from a acting stand point is Ezra Miller really funny, but very heartfelt at the same time. Don't get me wrong the whole case is amazing (Emma Watson was perfect for this after HP) but Ezra really stands out. Stephen Chbosky really cared about this book, and it really shows in this film. Him Directing and writing his own book was a amazing idea. <br/><br/>It's going to get many comparisons to a John Hughes film, and rightfully so this movie is heart felt and just amazing. <br/><br/>I will definitely being seeing this film again."
"mc_warwick","10","117","160","25 September 2012"," Very Well Done
","I just saw the movie at the Pgh premiere and it was amazing. I was hoping I wouldn't be disappointed because I loved the book so much. The movie is very true to the book. A few things have been omitted or changed but it doesn't change the mood of the story. I think the casting choices were spot on. Emma Watson has a scene in which she tears up and cries and it was amazing. I also appreciate how Chbosky made the parents thoughtful people, unlike most teen comedies. I am definitely going to see this movie again because there was so much to take in. Very well done.<br/><br/>It's also lovely to see my hometown as the backdrop. Pgh is a beautiful city and coming out of the Fort Pitt tunnels into the city is an experience that isn't quite captured well enough in the film. It's still a powerful scene and I teared up watching it."
"EmmaDinkins","8","102","143","31 August 2012"," Chix Chat on Film Review: Not your typical teenage angst tale.
","The Perks¬Öas it were, was a bit of a marvel when discussing what teenagers have to contend with. Anyone that decides to see this film expecting a run of the mill high school drama or teenage angst tale will be pleasantly surprised at the depth with which this story delves. This adaptation of Stephen Chbosky's novel seemed to take the difficulties facing one young man embarking on his high school journey through one extreme situation after another. I could visualize a totally different version of this tale of misfit toys being played out where all is right with the world and Charlie (Logan Lerman) is the most popular freshman in school for the simple fact that all his friends are seniors. The immediate infatuation that Charlie had with Sam (Emma Watson) was no surprise, what did surprise me was the challenges that she and her step brother Patrick/Nothing (Ezra Miller) had to endure. Even I started to get annoyed as the school year progressed and the running 'Nothing' joke persisted. It's always surprising when a story focuses on well to do young people whose lives would be expected to mimic a fairytale. This story gives insight into the fact that some young people have the same if not even more struggles than others and having money can't really fix that. I found it interesting that there was no clear indication in the story as to the school year, even at graduation there was none of the typical 'Class of '92' or whatever to show how proud of their time graduates are. It may be that Mr. Chbosky wanted to steer clear of associating the story with a specific year, but it was obviously the early 90's when the primary mode of sharing and exchanging music was via cassette. I recall so very clearly the good old days when the 'mix tape' ruled. I have to say that I liked Emma Watson as an American teenager, she can cross the pond and put it down any time. Yes there were a few moments in her dialog that she sounded like Hermione, but this role did a great deal to paint her in a different and mature light. I am not drawn to tales of the human condition unless there is a deep truth to be gleaned from the story, so if I had to say the moral of the story is¬Ö It would be 'you gotta have friends'. This story worked because of what the three key characters gained from getting to know each other. I give it a green light."

"comicbookfilmfan","10","53","76","28 August 2012"," The Perks of a Great Cast, Writing and Direction
","Spoiler Alert: There will be some spoilers in this review.<br/><br/>I was very fortunate to have finally seen Perks of Being a Wallflower (POBAW) at an advance screening courtesy of a fellow film fanatic and blogger. I had to travel for the most part of a day through a couple of States to get to the screening but it was worth every penny of the toll fees charged.<br/><br/>Disclosure: I read POBAW nearly 10 years ago when I was just about to start college and it remains one of my favorite books alongside works by Thomas Pynchon, Jane Austen, Sylvia Plath, John Irving, Gore Vidal - a very eclectic bunch.<br/><br/>I had also been tracking any plans to make a film version of the novel since 2008 when Chbosky was quoted in an online interview that he was working on a script based on his novel. I thought that's a very hopeful, positive and at the same time brave sign. Around the time I read the novel, I was also totally engrossed in a new drama series on the WB called ""Jack and Bobby"" which starred a then 12-13 year old actor named Logan Lerman whom I had seen previously in the cult favorite ""The Butterfly Effect"" as a young Ashton Kutcher and the Hallmark Hall of Fame movie ""A Painted House"". I was struck by the maturity of Lerman's weekly output in Jack and Bobby and thought at the time that he reminded me so much of Charlie in POBAW.<br/><br/>Fast forward to 2010 when Variety broke the news that Lerman, Chbosky and Emma Watson were all involved in the POBAW film with John Malkovich's Mr. Mudd Productions - I knew then that it was going to be special.<br/><br/>And it is. It is a faithful adaptation of the novel to the screen but not necessarily a set piece-for-set piece accurate one. More than the plot elements and details, it is the story arc and the emotions in the written work that have made a successful transition to the screen. For that I must credit Chbosky for knowing what to cut and what to retain in the film version. Even the use of songs other than those in Charlie's mixtape works because the director and the entire team know the essence of the book and how and why it has affected so many readers and they respected it.<br/><br/>Spoilers: There is no abortion scene, no reading of Dr. Earl Reum's moving poem in the film or some of the scenes with Charlie's extended family over the holidays and yet, I have to agree wholeheartedly with Chbosky's decision on this. Fans of the book should not get into a twist because some of these will not be seen because Charlie's story and more importantly, his unique voice is there in all it's quirky, lovable and emotional beauty.<br/><br/>Don't let the obviously very commercial trailer fool you, the film retains the book's darker moments and the demons which torment the protagonist.<br/><br/>As for the acting, I cannot say enough about how the cast embodied and fully embraced the characters they were playing. First off, those who know Logan Lerman only from his Percy Jackon-franchise should take another look at this promising young actor. I have seen Lerman in other performances in 3:10 to Yuma and My One and Only and always found him to be a mature and sensitive actor. And while his performances in those films are noteworthy, Perks allows him to show his full range and versatility. He is Charlie no doubt about it and imbues the role with sophistication and emotion. I realize the Academy doesn't take notice of younger actors unlike the actress categories but Lerman's performance is truly awards-worthy.<br/><br/>Ezra Miller's portrayal of Patrick may surprise some fans of the book as his characterization may be slightly more flamboyant than the Nothing of the book but he delivers a funny, outrageous but ultimately warm performance.<br/><br/>Now Emma Watson really needs to do more work on her American accent as her natural one flits in and out but it doesn't totally distract from a winsome and winning performance as Sam. Perhaps not in the same league as Lerman and Miller but certainly a departure and breakthrough from just being known as Hermione. The actress knows how to choose material. Also the chemistry between her and Lerman is outstanding.<br/><br/>Mae Whitman, Paul Rudd, Joan Cusack, Kate Walsh, Dylan McDermott and the always great Melanie Lynskey also make wonderful contributions. I wish though that we had seen more of the young actor Chbosky cast as Michael (cut out of the film) and Julia Garner of Electrick Children.<br/><br/>Just a last note, Chbosky makes full use of his Pittsburgh setting to situate the characters in the film. The Christmas/holiday scenes are beautiful visually and so is the RHPS.<br/><br/>If there is one thing I hope fans of POBAW will do is to tell people they know to see the film. This is not your typical teen fare and certainly miles ahead of the Twilight series and the Hunger Games. As a coming-of-age film, I would place this in the same league as ""Dead Poets' Society"" and the classic ""Harold and Maude"". More substantial than John Hughes' work. This is real. I would love it if families could see this film together. It deserves nothing less. I hope that there is enough critical mass at TIFF and beyond to elevate this film for the accolades it deserves."
"illbebackreviews","10","20","28","19 April 2013"," Extremely touching film infinitely awesome!
","The biggest issue with this movie, I would have to admittedly say, is the fact that is such an underrated film. Not to say anything against Best Picture nominee, Silver Linings Playbooks, but I would myself place an Oscar nomination for The Perks of Being a Wallflower over SLP for a Best Picture nomination. That being said, let the review be underway A young and troubled freshman by the name of Charlie (Logan Lerman) attempts to make his way through high school and gain friends as he falls in love with Sam (Emma Watson) The story is definitely based off Steven Chbosky's novel which he writes and directs in this case. Normally, having the author of a book direct a film can often come out horrible as a reader's interpretation is completely different from a film director's. Also, a book must be structured and paced differently to that of a film and in most cases, an author directing a film would more so attempt to direct it like a film. It's not the case here, thankfully! The direction in this film is definitely marvellous and the way the characters were presented is truly fantastic. Having never read the book myself, I was almost immediately fascinated by the film and a while into the film, I knew I would love it. Despite only reaching a 100 minute run time, I would personally have loved the film to be another half hour longer.<br/><br/>The film is a truly moving one and is not an average popcorn flick. Very powerful emotionally, at least for someone like me, who has experienced a similar life to that of Charlie, it can definitely be hard to re-watch this film, despite its complete brilliance.<br/><br/>With good performances throughout, from Logan Lerman to Emma Watson, this film adds further credibility. If I were to pick a fault with this film, I'd really have a tough time sitting through thinking but perhaps, if a few characters, mainly Mary and Sam were elaborated a bit more, there may have been a bit more of an emotional connection but for Sam, it doesn't tend to matter much as her character is a likable one and the screen time she has is relatively long.<br/><br/>In a year that saw the releases of films like Django Unchained, The Hobbit, Skyfall, The Dark Knight Rises, The Avengers and Looper, I myself would personally rank it above all those great films of the year except for my personal favourite Django Unchained.<br/><br/>Fantastic direction, excellent writing and an excellent knowledge of book to movie adaptations from the book's very author, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a brilliantly acted story and is emotionally powerful yet displays elements of other films. A fantastic film, a near masterpiece of the decade. One of the most underrated films of this new decade."

","This movie takes on the subject of bullying brilliantly. The movies message is not forced upon the viewer. The characters and conversations are so well written that the unsensible with the story and people becomes natural. I really wanted to be a part of their ""strange"" gang and fell particularly in love with Charlie, Sam and Patrick. Maybe not the most cheerful movie, but it will still remain in memory for long"
"DJRMewzique","10","16","24","7 December 2012"," It doesn't get better than this.
","I kinda wish someone had warned me about this film, and at the same time, kinda happy I had no idea what was coming. If I had known exactly what this film was about, I may have been slightly reticent to go see it by myself, but I think I would have been equally as embarrassed to have seen it with other people.<br/><br/>Why? Because five minutes in, the film managed to grab hold of me on an emotional level like no film has done in decades, forcing me to fight against tears tooth and nail right through until the credits began to roll. And I am not exaggerating. Not even remotely. And I just barely won the fight.<br/><br/>With that in mind, I'll keep the details to a minimum, but I warn you, if my words move you to see this film, you may want to go in prepared (or wait for the DVD), although little could have prepared me for such a beautifully honest and gut-wrenching film.<br/><br/>Charlie is a loner. He had a best friend, but that friend is gone. He's about to start high school, but just doesn't quite fit in anywhere. A brilliant student with a complete lack of social skills. That is, until he finds every ounce of courage he has to speak with Patrick. And suddenly, he is introduced to a world of people kind of like him. People who don't need to question him to understand him.<br/><br/>He found a band of wallflowers.<br/><br/>I was well-aware that this little indie-ish film had been extremely well-received by critics, and has managed a moderate box office. However, what piqued my interest is the fact that, as Oscar murmurs pick up strength and sail from whispers to rumbles, critics after critic have randomly called this movie out of left field as a film that should up ""for your consideration."" All I could think was, ""Wow, really? A teen movie is THAT good?"" Well, without hesitation, I can say with all honesty that it is really that good. I will go as far to say that it may just be the best film I have seen all year.<br/><br/>Much of the Oscar whispers focus on two things: the flawless script by Stephen Chbosky (who adapted the film from his own epistolary 1999 novel of the same name and also directed) and Ezra Miller. After a phenomenal turn as a tormented teen in last year's exquisitely disturbing ""We Need to Talk about Kevin,"" Miller's Patrick is indeed an incredibly memorable young man, playing a teen held back at school with skin that has become so thick, he is not a victim of the torment of his peers, but has instead learned to embrace it. Emma Watson, in her first post-""Harry Potter"" starring role, is stunning as Sam, in terms of both her physicality and her acting, the beautiful young woman who is trying to put her past behind her and find her place in the world. But, in my humble opinion, the bulk of emotional gravitas radiates from the film's rising star, Logan Lerman. As the conflicted, unstable and completely lost Charlie, Lerman's performance is nothing short of revelatory. With every look, awkward touch and utterance from his mouth, he is like Michael Cena stripped of sarcasm and overloaded with brilliance and emotion.<br/><br/>And while their screen time ranges from actively supporting to mere minutes, even the secondary roles, played by Paul Rudd as ""that teacher"" that some of us will remember and cherish forever , Kate Walsh (""Private Practice"") and Dylan McDermott (""American Horror Story"") as Charlie's parents, and Mae Whitman (""Parenthood"") as one of the wallflowers, add to the incredible emotional complexity, lending this film such an unobtrusive air of honesty and genuine feeling that to not be deeply moved by the story as it unfolds before you is practically inconceivable.<br/><br/>If you have always been the pretty one with the perfect grades or the perfect job, the popularity, and attention focused on you, maybe you won't quite get it. But for the majority of us who have ever spent time wondering where the hell we fit in in this world, whether it be back in high school...or right now...keep the Kleenex close. If this film does not move you to your very foundation, make you think of where you have been, maybe where you are, or worry about what your kids might be silently going through, I don't know what else would.<br/><br/>""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is such an acutely executed film, it overflows with authenticity thanks to extraordinary performances by an almost implausibly perfect cast of young talent. If the AMPAS voters fail to take notice, it will be a shame, not just because nothing else hit the big screen this year like it and it deserves the extra recognition, but because an entire generation or two (or three) should take notice.<br/><br/>Yes, it is THAT good. In a world where we need to assure our younger generation that ""it gets better,"" parents, teachers, wallflowers? Please, take notice. And grab the Kleenex. You've been warned."
"larry-411","10","15","23","2 October 2012"," Sets a new benchmark for what the coming-of-age genre can accomplish
","""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" redefines the classic American coming-of-age story. Writer/director Steven Chbosky has raised the bar on the traditional adolescent drama, with an emotionally-charged narrative infused with just enough bold strokes of joy and heartbreak to set a new benchmark for what the genre can accomplish.<br/><br/>Based on Chbosky's own novel of the same name, the movie is about growing up in a tough and unforgiving world, yes, with its requisite lessons on overcoming obstacles. But it also touches on tragic notions of loss and grief, rarely explored in coming-of-age films with such mastery.<br/><br/>Chbosky has said that if viewers take away one message from the film, it's that ""you are not alone."" This seemingly simple thought can't come at a better time, as bullying and its often devastating consequences have dominated headlines in recent months.<br/><br/>The book's premise is deceptively straightforward. 15-year-old Charlie (Logan Lerman) keeps a diary of letters addressed to someone real or imagined. ""Dear Friend,"" each entry begins, as he recalls his tumultuous high school days, celebratory one moment, heartbreaking the next, but always poignant and full of promise. The movie brings Charlie's writing to life, with a charming cadre of schoolmates (and the occasional peripheral adult) taking the stage as Charlie stands in the spotlight. It's an ideal structure for a narrative as free of boundaries as the promising world of the adolescent. Charlie is everyteen, we've all been there, or have we? The Perks of Being a Wallflower wanders down paths seldom seen on screen, into surprisingly shocking territory that challenges audiences to open their hearts.<br/><br/>The indie look and feel of the film is undeniable from the start. Single-point lighting is used effectively as a plot device. Charlie's face often appears split down the center, one side brightly lit, the other in soft shadow, mirroring his conflicted soul and sense of confusion, trapped between two worlds. Light falls gently on him when he's serene, more harshly in moments of crisis. The darkness hides the secrets he deftly keeps to himself as the narrative unfolds.<br/><br/>Audiences of all ages will be able to relate to the 80s modern rock soundtrack -- evocative songs you undoubtedly know and love, spanning generations from Boomers to today's teens. Sound design is brilliantly orchestrated with action timed perfectly to the music cues. Michael Brook's original score is appropriately minimal. Nothing needs to be underlined here in a story that has no filler or room to breathe. Not a frame is wasted on extended character development or conventional transitions in this visualization of Charlie's nonstop roller-coaster of a diary.<br/><br/>Andrew Dunn's stunning cinematography patiently engages the viewer, eschewing the hand-held shaky cam style so prevalent in the genre. His use of slow motion dolly shots brings us, literally, into Charlie's world. The boy's fear and sense of unease is heightened by intense closeups that reveal the bittersweet emptiness in his eyes. There's a lot more going on in that youthful head than he allows those around him to see, but even he isn't aware of it. We are but voyeurs, watching, examining, trying to make sense of Charlie's vulnerability and confusion.<br/><br/>Editor Mary Jo Markey's loving hand allows us to embrace the plot's twists and turns without skipping a beat. The pace is calm but deliberate, and it's clear that Dunn, Markey, and the rest of the production team are as devoted to Chbosky's vision as a boy experiencing his first romance. You only have one chance to get it right.<br/><br/>Chbosky has unquestionably assembled one of the most talented young ensemble casts in recent memory. As Charlie's love interest Sam, 22-year-old Emma Watson dominates the screen with the maturity and wisdom that only a polished veteran could bring to the role. Nina Dobrev, Julia Garner, and Mae Whitman are the free-spirited girls who surround Charlie and attempt to bring him to life. Their performances shine with an authenticity that is clearly rooted in passion for the material. On the male side, Johnny Simmons portrays football jock Brad, whose enigmatic personality figures prominently in the story in ways which will be left to the viewer. Nicholas Braun and Reece Thompson are standouts in support and much-needed comic relief.<br/><br/>As Charlie's would-be best friend Patrick, Ezra Miller is shockingly brilliant as a gay-go-lucky teen who lives life as if every day is his last. His joie de vivre is infectious and vacuums the pain out of anyone who comes near.<br/><br/>But ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" primarily rests on the shoulders of Logan Lerman. As Charlie, his ability to play down to 15 (he was 19 at the time) owes itself to a physical transformation he brings to every role -- in this case, widening his eyes and keeping an expressionless face that projects puppy dog innocence. His posture, walk, and pattern of speech all serve to underscore Charlie's youthful vulnerability. However ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is remembered, wherever it stands in the pantheon of coming-of-age pictures, Lerman's authentic characterization of Chbosky's semi-autobiographical protagonist should stand as one of the most iconic adolescent portrayals of our time.<br/><br/>Some films are intensely personal, and that's as it should be. Art should move you, and you bring your own life experience to the table when considering it. ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" was so much more than I imagined. I expected to be moved but I had no idea where the film would take me. Whether or not you will be similarly affected is something you'll need to discover for yourself. I think you will."
"MartinHafer","8","23","38","23 January 2014"," Good but a bit scary to this old fashioned father.
","""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is a good movie. However, as a father of two girls in college, watching this film is a bit tough for me, as I WANT to assume that real young people don't do drugs, stand up in fast-moving cars, have sex, or, well...have sex. But I also know this naive and although I would hate for younger teens to see this movie (as it might give them a sense that they should grow up too fast), it IS a good film. Far from perfect,...but a good film.<br/><br/>The film is about a very insecure and withdrawn young man entering high school. He doesn't fit in and knows it. However, surprisingly, he does soon get taken into a small group of friends--friends who are seniors and mostly have a lot of hangups too. It takes place over this single year of high school and ends when the older friends go off to college.<br/><br/>The film has a very smart script. Sometime, perhaps a bit too smart because too often the kids come off as a bit hipster-ish and too glib. But it is very enjoyable throughout and quite poignant--and deals with some VERY tough and complex topics--some of which are rarely ever addressed. While I don't think the movie is as wonderful as most (since it's in the IMDb Top 250 List), it is quite good and excellent for an audience 16 and up...well, perhaps 17 and up."

","This movie impressed me in a way that I didn't really expect. Unfortunately I haven't read the book but I want to do it as soon as possible. From the first moments when Charlie started to write his letter I felt a strong empathy for him. I recognized myself in his way of seeing life, his fear of the others...and of the whole world actually. He made me remember my own fears from the time when I entered high school. I'm also a ""wallflower"". I'm the one who always keeps quiet, observes and understands facts. Logan Lerman's character made this movie so worth watching for me. <br/><br/>I found myself even in his mental illness too, because, after all, it is a symbol of the ""ghosts"" which haunt each of us, the drama that lies behind our appearance. I think every teenager in this world should see this movie! It presents all the forms of anguish, anxiety, queerness and peculiarity that take over us. This story was made to show us that we're not alone! and that we're not some creepy aliens!<br/><br/>I'm only 19 but at the end of the movie I felt so very old! It made me want to stop the time and remain there...at that moment when Charlie had finally touched the apogee of this adventure called adolescence!"
"rubenm","4","105","218","7 January 2013"," Doesn't stand out
","Although most reviewers on IMDb seem to be ecstatic about 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', I don't think this film really stands out. To be honest, it didn't really move or impress me in any way. In my opinion it's a decent film, with some flaws, that could have been far better if it wasn't so mainstream. <br/><br/>I think most of the enthusiastic reviewers are young people, who recognize themselves in this story about teenagers who choose to be different from the rest. It's a very romantic story: a melancholic teenager befriends a group of progressive/bohemian/intellectual youngsters, who differentiate themselves from the rest of the school. They introduce him to parties, drugs and music from The Smiths and David Bowie. He falls in love with one of the girls, and another girl falls in love with him. There are secrets to keep, memories to share and experiences to cherish. <br/><br/>This could have been the cinematographic equal to Donna Tartt's novel 'The Secret History'. But it lacks the dark, mysterious, Gothic aspects of the book. There are traumas and secrets in 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', but they are implied and not clearly explained. <br/><br/>It's clear this movie appeals to young people, who perhaps can recognize a lot about their own life in the film. But to be a good movie in its own right, it should also be attractive for viewers in other age groups. I think in that respect this movie fails."

"chicagopoetry","4","67","143","10 December 2012"," Angst Overdose
","I usually don't bother reviewing anything at IMDb that's already been reviewed a hundred times, but since the vast majority of reviews here are glowing, I thought I'd offer my two cents.<br/><br/>I kind of hated Perks of Being a Wallflower. Why? It was like an angst overdose in a depressing fantasy world. Now I know there exists bullying in high school, but generally high school is not like it is portrayed here. Everyone in high school is not mean to you from the first to the last day and even if jocks can be insensitive, depicting them as nothing but evil bullies is a tired, stale plot mechanism.<br/><br/>The main character Charlie is so introverted that we never quite care about him. I'm remembering the introverted character from Almost Famous and how he ended up being really funny and lovable. I really didn't feel anything for Charlie. And both his parents are just robots so we're never given an explanation of why he is the way he is other than his aunt molested him and then died in a car accident. Really? That's what totally screwed up an otherwise normal, intelligent, halfway good looking kid?<br/><br/>Patrick is probably the best character but, really, he's a flaming queer and knows every word of the Rocky Horror Picture Show by heart but he has never heard of David Bowie's song Heroes? Really? And he isn't into theater? He just goes to parties and acts flamboyant while he is secretly depressed? Yet he and the rest of the ""wallflowers"" probably have more friends than any of the so-called ""cool"" kids do, so what are they so depressed about?<br/><br/>The teacher Mr. Anderson is a minor, minor character yet supposedly he has a great impact on Charlie's life. Why? Because he gives him books? There seemed to be some homo-erotic thing going on there that's never touched upon. Perhaps a moment a bit more awkward than the hug Charlie gives him--that might have shed some light on their mysterious relationship.<br/><br/>Charlie's high school crush Sam is an okay character but she also just sort of goes along with the absence of plot. She tells Charlie that she loves him but then she acts totally surprised when Charlie kisses her during the game of truth or dare. Really? And then later she's in love with him again or something. Whatever.<br/><br/>And of course there's Brad (no, can't be a reference to Rocky Horror, can it) the football star who is having a secret love affair with Patrick, a love affair that's so obvious that the only ones who can't see it are all Brad's knuckle-headed jock friends who don't even question him even when Patrick practically announces it in the cafeteria.<br/><br/>And where are the rest of the freshman, and the sophomores, and the juniors. This schools seems to have one freshman, Charlie, and everyone else is a senior. It makes NO sense.<br/><br/>I kept looking at the time realizing I still had forty five minutes, a half hour, twenty minutes to go, wanting to puke from eating so much angst, until I finally was shouting out loud ""It's David Bowie's song Heroes, good God, it's not exactly obscure!!!!"""

","This is my first review and its brief. I do not understand the need for lengthy reviews. After watching this four times in six days i felt compelled to give my own ten pence worth. I've never seen a film like this where i have loved all the characters. The cast are brilliant and story moves along at a nice pace. The soundtrack is amazing. I love movies and its very rare that one comes along like this that works on so many levels. I am not usually one for this sort of genre and came close to taking this back before actually watching it. I am so glad i did not. Its going to be a very long time before something tops this. This is a feel good movie with some disturbing undertones. If you love movies and want something that moves you emotionally then this is for you."
"NJMoon","6","34","68","17 October 2012"," And those perks would be...???
","I'm not sure. I wanted to like this film, but I felt like I'd seen it all before elsewhere and better. The narrative is a little too crowded for it's own good - and no one gets full attention, though all deserve it. Unlike some, I think the script might have benefited from being set in a specific time and place (it is, 1990's Pittsburgh - but it is never stated). Like so much of this MTV book of the month selection, it tries to be universal instead of specific - even in it's characters. Joan Cussack is billed, but her role amounts to two scenes at the VERY end of the film, so (although she's no 'star' attraction) you spend most of the time thinking ""I thought Joan Cussack was in this?"" But I guess this film is meant for a generation who doesn't know Joan Cussack, is texting during the credits, and doesn't know Pittsburgh, and wasn't alive in 1990."
"zetes","6","53","112","25 December 2012"," Clich√©
","Mostly a trite and clich√©d high school picture. Logan Lerman is miscast as a moody high school freshman (who looks like he' at least 16) who befriends a group of seniors (Ezra Miller, Emma Watson and Mae Whitman chief amongst them) who help him come out of his shell. That's not too unbelievable, but it becomes increasingly silly when Whitman becomes romantically involved with him, and Stone, on whom Lerman is crushing, would probably be game if she weren't already involved. This plays out like a fantasy, not reality. If you've ever been in a high school as an adult the maturity difference between freshmen and seniors - Hell, freshmen and sophomores - is hugely pronounced. Even among alterna-kids, no 18 year old girl is going to even think about dating a 14/15 year old. I couldn't quite get over that, but that's hardly the only flaw. Ezra Miller is definitely the stand-out. His homosexual character is a bit clich√©, but I was happy that they actually weren't afraid to give him a sex life (though not graphic, I'm surprised it didn't land an R-rating because of it)."
"Red_Identity","Null","13","23","11 December 2012"," A little masterpiece, incredibly touching
","I never read the book this film is based on. It was never on my radar to watch. It wasn't a film I was even planning to see. And guess what? It turned out to be a gem of high proportions.<br/><br/>Now, the cast here is all wonderful, and the three leads all work perfectly. Miller and Watson are great, and the former has some really great scenes that would definitely put him in my Supporting Actor line- up. But the real star here is Logan Lerman. I don't have any say on how he portrayed the character in the novel, but what he did here amazed me to no end. His ability to reflect so many of his characters' past with such simple glances is incredible. It would have been so easy to make the silent-type lead teenage boy feel lazy or uninspired, and even in a lessor actor's hands it could have felt that way. But Lerman is mesmerizing from start to finish, never once hitting a false note or detaching himself from the emotional weight his character is living under. This is one of the best teenage performances I've ever seen, and as of right now easily the best performance of the year. Granted, I haven't seen most of the awards contenders, but this is truly incredible stuff and Lerman has enormous talent that I really hope carries him through a long and successful career. <br/><br/>These kinds of films are always hard to navigate exactly. It's kind of hard to not fall into clich√©s or stereotypes. At first glance it seems like there's nothing that makes this stand apart from other films of this kind. Granted, I don't watch many that are under this specific genre simply because they never seem like anything out of the ordinary. So to be as moved by the film as I was, for it to have emotionally touched me the way it did is a huge surprise. Technically this isn't some high achievement, but there is no other film as emotionally rich this year. The characters and story lines all work in marvelous ways. I can't even say that some of it wasn't familiar territory because most of it verges on what we have seen before. And it's not perfect, some of the dialogue at times is a bit clunky, some of the plot mechanics. But it all comes together to create what is to me, a deeply, deeply personal film. I connected with the characters in ways I forgot were possible. There have been many great films in recent years, but I don't think there's been one that has reminded me of who I am as a person or who I was, what my life has been like, what life in general is like, this much. I always dread sentimentality, and if anything I am easily put off by any kind of emotional manipulation. But this is the only film in a long time that really was trying to be as emotionally investing as it could be, and one that never hit any real false notes when it came to the emotions it stirred in me. <br/><br/>I've always said that as great as any story lines or characters are in observing a film you've seen, the art of film is ultimately a medium of feeling, just like any other art form. And this is why I haven't mentioned, really, any of the plot. Being able to talk about how it made me feel is enough, and this is a film where the emphasis on the word ""feel"" is all but deserved. This is a small gem of a film, but as rich of an experience as one could hope for. The best film of 2012."
"JvH48","3","31","64","23 October 2012"," Superfluous film. Adds nothing new to many other films and TV series about the same social environment
","I saw this film at the Ghent filmfestival 2012. I must confess upfront that I find this film superfluous, given the overload of TV series and films that also center around high schools and their population. One might falsely think that striving to be popular and ""cool"" is the main occupation of an average adolescent. This film adds nothing new or original to this overload, and does not even attempt to show that there is more to the subject. Further, this film concentrates too much on a single person, the alleged ""wallflower"", and leaves the remaining persons very much as entourage.<br/><br/>What hinders me in the scenario is that our main character can only be considered a wallflower for a relatively small time frame. He gets some friends in an early stage of the story, albeit all these are older than he is. What helped in acquiring these friendships is that he could show several talents in the context of prose and poetry, and that he also had some talents as a stand-up comedian (probably only when under influence, but still).<br/><br/>I scored a 1 (lowest) for the audience award when leaving the theater. I am at a loss why this film ended on place 8 for this award, with an average score of 4.52 (out of 5). I can only assume that other people find interesting material in these stories, which theory seems confirmed by the scores on IMDb. Maybe I'm just too old (64) for this."
"colossus24","4","30","62","8 January 2013"," A Mediocre Attempt
","I wanted to like this movie. I read the book about a decade ago, while in my late teens, and the story resonated with me on several levels. I have been hoping (and praying as much as an atheist can pray) that the Hollydood commerce machine would not screw it up. Alas, in vain.<br/><br/>I am struggling of what to describe first in this review, but I think that I will give the makers of this movie a little credit. ""Perks"" was always going to be a difficult story to televise and the attempt is not a total cop-out. The movie stays true to the book in many respects and it's obvious that there was some thought put into capturing the feel of the written tale. That it didn't succeed is a confluence of several factors.<br/><br/>The main problem is down to the casting and portrayal of the main characters. I have no issue with the protagonist, Charlie, but the roles of Patrick (Ezra Miller) and especially Sam (Emma Watson) have been rather absurdly twisted, albeit each in a different way.<br/><br/>Patrick is overtly and flamboyantly homosexual, which becomes a real distraction. In the book, he was just a cool and funny guy for whom sexual orientation was a nuisance with which he struggled, but he didn't seem to consider it a core of his persona. The movie falls way short of that level of subtlety. Here Patrick is oozing gayness - that's where he begins and that's where he ends.<br/><br/>The character of Sam is even worse. I am not sure what is the big deal about Emma Watson. She has very little in terms of acting chops and it's a shame that she keeps getting roles, on the strength of ""Potter"" fame, that she is totally ill-suited for. She lacks any kind of charm and on top of that she looks androgynous. Sam is supposed to be a slutty girl gone good who is still feminine and unwittingly seductive. Emma looks and acts like a preteen boy making it hard to understand Charlie's infatuation with her.<br/><br/>The last problem that I want to touch upon is the lack of flow in the narrative. There is just no feeling of cohesiveness that characterizes good movies. It's a succession of short vignettes, loosely related, and strung together. The book also makes frequent jumps in time, but they are easier to digest due to transitional material. It makes sense that there is a time lapse when Charlie starts writing his letter, but somehow that doesn't translate well to the screen.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 4/10 score as I consider it a slightly sub-par effort. It wasn't for a lack of trying, but I wish that the creators resisted the urge to capitalize on Emma Watson's supposed star power and instead found an actress well suited for the role."

","Actually I don't think there was a single shark attack. I kept thinking throughout the film, ""maybe this is where the shark will come and attack."", but i don't even recall a scene where any characters were even near the ocean. The whole story takes place around Pittsburgh, which is in western Pennsylvania. This is an area world renowned for having no sharks. The cast was great, Ezra Miller being the standout, but I feel like they shouldn't sell a movie on a marketing campaign around shark attacks, and then have no gosh darn shark attacks. The movie felt as if it were leading up to a trip to the ocean, where Logan Lerman's character would be attacked by a shark. This motion picture was almost all build up with no payoff, the payoff here being that there were no sharks, and no shark attacks. Jaws was a good movie, because it promised shark attacks, was suspenseful, and had shark attacks. That is how you make quality cinema."
"terrypeck","2","28","58","25 February 2013"," What was THAT all about really?
","Where to begin? It didn't make sense. It didn't have laughs. It didn't make it clear which period it was set in. It didn't have character development - it merely had characters to whom things happened. It didn't have any understanding of the drug culture. Or the music culture. Or the technology of the day - whichever day it really is set in. OK, it must be the 80s, 90s because of the cassettes. But as a group they dressed so unlike any teenagers I have ever seen anywhere. And they don't know Bowie? Old music aficionados? It didn't make sense.<br/><br/>The school. It didn't ring true. All the pupils were stock characters. Don't get me started on the gay jock storyline. Cartoon land. As was the fight scene. As was much of the film. A few tender moments, but mostly stuff we've seen a hundred times before. <br/><br/>The acting was fine. Patrick's character annoyed me though. He seemed to have no depth, whereas Charlie was all depth for a very clich√©d reason. I am still none the wiser as to why he wasn't sorted out at his first trip to hospital before the film began. You mean the psych doctors didn't probe far enough first time around? And once he lets it all out to his new smiling psychiatrist, he is instantly cured? Freud still lives? Oh please...<br/><br/>It didn't make sense. And what were the perks of being a wallflower anyway? Free pot brownies? Besides he wasn't a wallflower for about 95% of the movie. Oh, so the whole clique were wallflowers, misfits, outsiders? No they weren't. They were just like everyone else with around three good friends each, but in their case, dubious taste in music. I mean Eileen and Heroes? OK, I like Heroes, but so inappropriate for a bunch of youngsters seriously into retro. They think Something by the Beatles is 'out there'? Embarrassing musical clich√©s at every turn.<br/><br/>Emma Watson, you need to choose better directors and scripts or you'll end up glossed over. Take a leaf out of Jennifer Lawrence's playbook is my advice. Not sure why some here took her acting to task. She delivered. But with the lines she was given I shouldn't be surprised some didn't like her.<br/><br/>This film is a sorry mess that I was expecting much more from. I found myself finding fault with almost every scene. Don't like doing that. Perhaps it might work for kids who have had little movie experience, but wouldn't the music put them off? Why the high IMDb rating? It's a mystery to me."
"lassehold","4","25","51","16 December 2012"," Well, yes. I guess.
","I viewed this film as something I've seen before. I'd go so far that I thought it was more something very typical for these kinds of movies and it was also very overstated. When this should be a character driven film, it's plot is way too controlling. <br/><br/>We're hanging out with a smart, but introvert guy who has problems with something that was done to him, rather than something he has done. Nothing is his fault, even tho he feels that way. The protagonist is a thoroughly nice person, but haunted by a gruesome past that ultimately will strike him in what is the climax of the film.<br/><br/>The film is, however, not about his head. It's about the cool, alternative, smart, pretty and older group of people he starts hanging out with. (And these are not the popular kids? Wow, why?) <br/><br/>Even tho the members of this group are all very bright in theory, this does not reflect on their choices within the film's plot. <br/><br/>Sam is having a relationship with an all-through asshole and it's very obvious that he has a lower level of intelligence as well. Sam then goes on about how she loves Charlie and kisses him. But wait, she doesn't leave the asshole. Why the F not?<br/><br/>Charlie is then persuaded into a relationship with Mary Elizabeth, supposedly a Harvard candidate, who is also ignorant to seeing Charlies real desires to want Sam. (Does this group of friends even talk to each other?) They become mad at Charlie when he reaches into these desires during a dare. The group becomes mad at him because he has now hurt both Mary Elizabeth and Sam for desperately showing this. He's suddenly the asshole. <br/><br/>Charlie now feels that his is his fault. He becomes, for a very brief period, cast out of this group until he hits (this bit is unclear even in the film) a person and is suddenly a hero again. <br/><br/>This leaves me with the impression that the film's 45 minutes to 1 hr 15 minutes are just time extending plot material. It does not in any way, provoke the climax of the film or lead up to it. Conflicts in this time area of the film are quickly started and solved. It's overstated, annoying and boring. I pounded my head a lot to my desk during these minutes.<br/><br/>I like the ending, because it is much more intriguing than the overstated personal dramas of this overly cool but not popular group of people we follow. If the film had been more about Charlie's head, displaying more of his inner conflict surrounding his past and his feelings towards his 1000 days left of college, I would think this film is great. But a lot of the plot is only to please the youthful audience and to feed them with a film that appears alternative but is really just a remix of the old. (Much like Easy-A and it's ''self-reflective'' script discourse). But I mean, if you're fourteen you'd not only love this film, but maybe also find it intriguing to display yourself through the identity of the characters. <br/><br/>Emma Watson is hot, she has 3 of my 4 stars."
"Gordon-11","Null","27","56","19 January 2013"," Overrated
","This film is about a shy high school misfit who becomes a cool guy after two seniors taking him under their wings.<br/><br/>""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" tells a story of a shy guy who blossoms socially as he develops friendships with two step-siblings. It involves the typical American high school life; with experimentation in sex and drugs, experiences with dating, fights and bullying. I can see how a lot of people can identify with the characters and events in the film, and hence ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" gets such a high rating. However, I think it is overrated. I thought it was a plain coming of age drama. It doesn't push that many boundaries, and there is nothing new. The story is not particularly captivating, and in fact the subtle subplots (involving flashbacks) can be confusing. My friends and I did not agree with the positive critics and the high ratings."
"zatch1710","2","49","110","2 October 2012"," So I don't know about all these good reviews.
","This may be somewhat disjointed, but there are significant problems with this film.<br/><br/>First off, I love how Emma Watson looks, but she is not organic. Her line delivery is terrible. How are we supposed to buy a 17 year old saying ""Welcome to the island of misfit toys""--really? She loses her accent only somewhat, and moves her head before every single line. And shows a complete lack of inhibition at all times, whereas Patrick and Charlie still have some moments of varied emotion. And if she's the second most important character, where is the depth of storyline and evidence of ""I'm a messed up kid"". She mentions that she had older gentleman boyfriends at 11 and got drunk in freshman year and was promiscuous. Then all of that totally disappears and she acts like a normal person throughout the film. Her other emotional opportunity is ""he said I was right to have broken up with him"". There is no anger or revenge shown, just a matter of fact thing statement. Emma Watson still has a lot of development to do.<br/><br/>Patrick was great, range of emotions was believable, his acting was brilliant, and his reactions were on cue. No qualms with him.<br/><br/>Problems: Why does everyone think Charlie is a great writer if he never really a) tells them, b) shows them, or c) demonstrates. He hands some essays to his English teacher and then they have this huge connection due to Charlie liking him and his teacher giving him books and only saying ""We accept the love we think we deserve"". So that makes him the best teacher ever and it also makes Charlie a great writer-though he never attempts a novel. The father and mother have about three lines, and in the book the Dad was a lot more stand-offish. You can't prove a father stand-offish if he's just not in a lot of shots. The mother has less lines than the repeated lines of Aunt Helen.<br/><br/>Charlie. Great acting, but there's a huge problem with the way the film is developed and how his role comes about. They only mention ""It is getting bad"" and then keep it vague. Who the hell says things like ""it's getting bad"" and then are you seeing things again. There is barely any mention of his stay in a hospital during middle school, and tell me what teenager with light suicidality stays in a hospital for a year? Or even 3 months after his ""breakdown"". Even if it's supposed to be in the '80s that seems off.<br/><br/>Mary Elizabeth is apparently a punk rock Buddhist, and then all of the sudden she calls at all hours of the day when they go out--does not seem consistent with her character.<br/><br/>Charlie--you're saying that a guy who doesn't work out has the ability to black out and beat up three football players, and that the football players are suddenly stunned and decide to just look stunned rather than fighting back? Really?<br/><br/>Then someone thinks it's a good idea for Charlie to have a pot brownie without telling him and he doesn't freak out? And of course they toast him. And there is no detail about his ""friend"" he writes to or his friendship with his best friend who just commit suicide. But about the pot brownie. He is completely fine, then decides voluntarily in the same month or two to try LSD, having never actually smoked. Who does that? Not to mention the absolute lack of supervision throughout the entire film. These kids are allowed to do whatever they want and have house parties seemingly every week with alcohol and drugs, and only once are almost caught (sadie Hawkins). Again, what teenager decides to do LSD after ingesting a pot brownie once, unknowingly?<br/><br/>Then there's the Rocky Horror Picture Show. The QB is fine to be in the crowd of people, but cannot be in the show itself because someone would see him. What? And how the hell do all these 17 and 18 year olds all have the leads to this production. You're telling me that anyone who had been at this theater for this production had decided to give up the reins to acting in RHPS to this band of teenagers who apparently know everything about it? And that Charlie has no memories of his Aunt when he's touching breasts of Sam in the show and Mary Elizabeth, but then suddenly has a revelation when Sam's hand slides to his nether regions?<br/><br/>And Sam is totally okay with them going to have sex as soon as Charlie says I wanted to ask her out, knowing Charlie? What happens at that point?<br/><br/>This film is absolutely illogical and does terrible justice to the book. Emma Watson is gorgeous but unconvincing, Logan could be good in the future, and Ezra has a brilliant career in front of him. But for god's sake, this is not a good movie."

","I went into watching 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' without reading the book 1st so I didn't know what sort of story to expect. The rating of the film was high but I was still a bit skeptical as to whether I would actually enjoy this, I'm glad to say I did like this film. <br/><br/>The story is well written and the acting is very impressive. Logan Lerman as Charlie was the main character, he had some problems and he played his role very well, he seemed like a completely believable character who you really feel for. The rest of the cast were also good, especially Emma Watson. Having seen a lot of her in the Harry Potter movies, this was the 1st time I've seen her in anything else. She made the change with ease and her American accent was believable I thought, she really did show just how good of an actress she is. <br/><br/>It has a serious side to it and some of the flashbacks are a little uncomfortable to watch. The way the friendships are developing is realistic and quite heartwarming. You really feel attached to the characters and maybe can relate a little to them, they are all extremely likable in their own way. I also liked the soundtrack for the film. <br/><br/>Overall it's a very enjoyable film that I would recommend to anyone who wants a good drama. <br/><br/>8/10."
"pompano","1","36","79","28 February 2013"," where is the drama?
","This should be a drama about young people lost in loneliness, their roles as outsiders & how they handle their difficult situation. But it turns out that the movie is actually about some spoiled kids born into wealth, feeling absolutely confident & comfortable in their dandy-role, doing cool stuff all the time, partying hard & even win the hearts of the ones they want to. I expected a little bit more than a 90min story without ANY problems & aggravated circumstances. The story has no climax & no turning point at all which makes it absolutely redundant telling it in movie-length. you might get bored after 30min, expecting a sweeping change in their lives & relationships but you are definitely disappointed after 90min when nothing of that happened. I have to ask: where is the drama & why these kids have no problems to speak about? American drama? American irrelevance."

","First world problems of rich suburban kids: The Movie.

It's also an enigma; it's a film that many teenagers pretend to identify with, even though its view of typical teenage American life is so hollow, vacuous and falsified...not to mention, very exploitative of real insecurities that teenagers feel, which are only used as superficial character 'defining' traits, never to be elaborated on, to gain audience sympathy. It also only touches on teenagers that live in wealthy suburban areas, making for a very narrow field of their target demographic to represent.

","I hadn't heard of The Perks of Being a Wallflower book before this film came out but apparently it's a big hit with people my age (albiet particularly girls). I wasn't interested until it started doing very well with audiences to the point where it entered IMDb's top 250, and is still in a solid position. I wasn't excited but I was intrigued. I was mostly intrigued at the prospect of the author of the original book writing the screenplay and directing the film himself. Can the author of the source material finally do justice and equal the book? Can this be a genuinely original and heartfelt high school movie? The answer is no. Not in Stephen Chbosky's hands anyway. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a self-pitying dead weight inhabited with paper thin characters whose personality is replaced with eccentricity, let alone lack of depth. To be fair, that is what high school feels like, but it's an awful unpleasant feeling I don't want to relive. Its lead character is a cardboard cutout whose interesting moments of change are so left field and bizarre that it's difficult to connect with him at all.<br/><br/>Emma Watson has a terribly inconsistent American accent and lacks any identity beyond a vague irritating Manic Pixie Dream Girl. Ezra Miller does have some welcome enthusiasm, given his restrained performance in We Need To Talk About Kevin, but his character is all over the place. It's a film that deals with a zillion things at once and all of them are clich√©s in and area I wouldn't be able to relate to even if I was in my equivalent of high school. But the most off- putting part is the horrible lighting and set design. The film might have been okay if it wasn't so poorly lit but that's a stretch. It hits a few interesting notes here and there but it's nothing redeeming and they're swiftly ruined by the next moment approached awkwardly. However, it does have an excellent taste in music and features a lot of my favourites, unfortunately it has no idea how to use them and frustrates me as it cuts before the good part. There's also the big gap in logic of Emma Watson having pretty great taste in music but having no clue what an incredibly famous David Bowie song is. But hey, if this film introduces a generation to this great music, fine. Not my preferred method.<br/><br/>3/10"

","The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>High school freshman Charlie (Logan Lerman) is having problems making friends but that all changes when he meets Sam (Emma Watson), Patrick (Ezra Miller) and their group. Soon Charlie finds himself experiencing all sorts of new adventures but the past is still there to haunt him as he tries to make sense of his world. This is based on Stephen Chbosky's best-selling novel and it's a rare case where the writer also gets to not only do the film's screenplay but also direct. I will admit right up front that I've never read the book and I never even heard of it until I saw the trailer for this movie. After viewing this film it really makes me want to read it because as a film this thing is actually very touching and rings very true to life. I thought the three leading characters were some of the best written and most memorable to come out of a teen film in a very long time and thankfully the screenplay pays just as much attention to the supporting characters like their friends to even Charlie's parents. The screenplay here is certainly one of the best of the year and I really liked how it could be dramatic one moment, sad the next and then funny all in the matter of seconds. I think this is why it rings true to real life and it also doesn't help that you get so many memorable performances. The three leads are certainly terrific with Watson coming off the best as the charmer. A lot of credit also has to go to Lerman for being able to handle such a wide range of emotions. Paul Rudd, Dylan McDermott, Kate Walsh and Joan Cusack all do great in their smaller roles as well. Horror fans will also get a kick out of seeing Tom Savini in his role as a shop teacher. THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER is certainly a clever, smart and well rounded picture that works on many levels. I can't say if it's better or worse than the book since I haven't read it but this film is clearly a winner."

","Frankly I didn't expect too much from this entry; I've never heard of the book let alone read it, I'm not really a Harry Potter buff so I had no interest in whether or not Emma Watson would not out to have discovered Life Beyond Harry Potter. At most I was hoping for a painlessly pleasant couple of hours in the dark. Having seen it I have no problem endorsing the positive reviews I have just been reading here on IMDb. Whilst I don't know how realistic it would be to have a freshman hanging out with Seniors for one whole Academic year the thought merely registered rather than nagged throughout the running time. There was one subtle touch I appreciated: Charley establishes an immediate rapport with his English teacher who is happy to suggest - and even supply - 'extra' reading for Charley, who laps it up. At one point the teacher makes Charley a present of his own 'personal' copy of 'The Catcher In The Rye'. This novel is narrated by a troubled teenager who reveals in the last chapter that he is writing from a hospital where he is being treated for a nervous breakdown; 'Wallflower' is also narrated by Charley who begins by telling us he has spent some time in hospital and we soon realize this his ailment wasn't physical. Nice touch. This is very much an ensemble piece, to say nothing of a labor of love, and it would be churlish to single out any one performance. My only reservation is that, like so many 'indie' movies that are so charming on a first viewing - Sideways, The Station Agent, Juno, etc - it may not hold up in a few years time. But for now it is slightly terrific."

The writing is clich√©d to the extreme, the acting wooden and unbelievable.<br/><br/>I'm sure the film isn't aimed at my demographic (male 40's) and more likely at teenage girls, but there are many coming of age films that do it so much better. Think of American Graffiti (7.5), Breakfast Club (7.9), Submarine (7.3), Fish Tank (7.3), Juno (7.7), La Haine (8.1) etc. How can this piece of garbage be better than any of these and a hundred more?<br/><br/>If you want to watch a great coming of age film then give this a wide berth and watch a real movie."
"rubensanchezgarcia","5","11","21","28 January 2013"," There are just two possible scenario for you to like this movie
","1) You are the author of the novel / writer of the screenplay / director of the film / real life teenage sufferer as described in the story.

It feels they have used the same pattern as in any other ""coming of age story"". The only thing which is not that predictable (all the mental issues plot which I won't discuss here to keep this spoiler free) is very overlooked by the main story, and when it gets into it, it gets a treatment very in a rush, as if the writer didn't think it's so important. <br/><br/>And by the way, the image of teenagers listening to ""The Smiths"" and stating how great taste in music they have, not listening to other mainstream garbage, is already a parody. In fact, when ""The Smiths"" name was said for the first time in this movie, I couldn't avoid laughing. <br/><br/>I will stay away from upcoming coming of age stories, unless they prove to be more original and don't use so many clich√©s.<br/><br/>And for the writers out there: Nobody cares about how much you suffered in high school... except people going through high school, so I guess you can understand how people outside high school is not very interested in what you have to say."
"terrellrobinson71","10","11","21","21 October 2012"," Prepare yourself for a extraordinary movie experience
","Has there ever been a moment in life when you look back at your high school life and reminisce on old memories whether they were good, bad, or embarrassing? I know I have. I guess that's how I felt this way about trying to survive high school and to find our hopes and dreams about who we'll be when we grow up, much like Charlie in ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"". I recently read the book and I can definitely relate to most of the situations that Charlie went through as well as anyone who has read it and seeing that the film has come to life thanks to Stephen Chbosky (the author of the book, as well the screenwriter and director), he discovers the human heart, the first chances you have in life and a chance to break away from all the pain, whether if you're an outcast or a popular kid. Set in Pittsburgh in the early 90's, both the movie and the book does follow Charlie (Logan Lerman), a 15-year-old kid starting high school for the first time. He is terrified about it after the loss of his two favorite people years ago and before high school started. Feeling lonely, depressed and ostracized by his peers in high school, he makes friends with Patrick (We Need to Talk About Kevin's Ezra Miller), the gay wild child and his stepsister Sam (Emma Watson, in her first major role outside the Harry Potter series) who welcomes Charlie into ""The Island of Misfit Toys"" and tells him that it's okay to be himself. As the movie goes on as well as the book, Charlie happens to write to his unnamed friend about his first experiences while hanging with his new friends, having a crush on a certain someone, getting some help from his English teacher, Bill (Paul Rudd) and gaining some perspective from his family, including his sister Candace (Nina Dobrev). But he has a dark secret that could possibly haunt him forever. It's amazing to me that ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is one of those rare movies that gets the tone, feel and look right. Chbosky does a great job of streamlining his 213-page book into a 103-minute movie, editing out certain moments but remains faithful to the story. And if you're a true fan of the book, some of the moments from Charlie's point of view, including the tunnel and Rocky Horror scenes are beautifully re-created on screen. And if you love the music in the book, one of the songs from the book (""Asleep"" by The Smiths) is actually in the movie, so, find a chance to listen closely when you see it. The performances in the movie are amazing. They felt very real to me. If you look at this movie and tell us that the performances are not real to you, you need to have your head examined. These would be people I would've loved to hang out with in high school. Lerman is remarkable as Charlie, experiencing a lot of joy and emotions in many ways, including a heartbreaking scene that's reminiscent of Timothy Hutton in ""Ordinary People"". Miller steals every scene he's in and he brings humor and heart to a kid who likes being who he is, but has a few wounds that needs to be healed. And for Emma Watson? Oh, yeah, she captures Sam beautifully in a way that people will understand that she is no longer Hermione Granger. She also carries a very good American accent and it's an incredible performance. This is one of the best films I've seen so far this year. It's a high-spirited drama that's funny as hell, enchanting, heartwrenching and breathtaking. Not to mention that it carries a lot of reality of what high school life is like and how you can just live in the moment when you get a chance. It captures all of that brilliantly. See it to believe it and spread the word, this is a movie that you won't forget. Prepare yourself for unwavering emotions, hilarious humor and a chance of finding hope with ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"", a true American teenage classic."
"DubhDoo","6","11","21","18 October 2012"," An affectionate and likable teen drama
","American high-school movies. Yes another one. In tackling the pitfalls and plateaus of adolescence, many films have fallen along the bad side of clich√©, however it's important to remember that like every genre (well, nearly) it has had its successes; for me, John Hughes seminal The Breakfast Club instantly springs to mind, along with others such as Pretty in Pink, Mean Girls and Clueless. Fortunately, The Perks of Being a Wallflower takes a decent stab at falling into the same category as these films; and while it doesn't scale to their heights, it's a surprisingly likable coming-of-age drama.<br/><br/>Based on Stephen Chbosky's 1999 bestseller on the same name (he also writes and directs here), the film concerns freshman Charlie (Logan Lerman) as he experiences difficulty at home and school. However, he falls in with a group of seniors, including Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson), who show him what is to be a ""wallflower"". He encounters depression, suicide, drugs, alcohol, homophobia, love, heartbreak, David Bowie and The Rocky Horror Picture Show.<br/><br/>I was sincerely taken aback by the fact that Charlie did not annoy me; too many high-school films and TV shows nowadays centre of smart- mouthed, wiser-than-their years teens, so it was refreshing to have one relatable and natural. This is mainly due to Lerman who delivers a sincere and engaging performance. While Emma Watson shows clear evidence of a career beyond Potter. However, it's Miller who's the standout; after holding his own with the brilliant Tilda Swinton in We Need to Talk About Kevin, he doesn't disappoint, despite being saddled with the 'flamboyant gay best friend' role.<br/><br/>Chbosky's direction is nothing to marvel at and the script not one of the year's best, but overall, to quote South Park's Deapartment of Interior Security Guy, it's ""fine, just fine"". A sweet, enjoyable and honest look at those years we'll never forget."
"James_Ernesto","6","7","12","26 July 2013"," Has its moments, but ultimately too clich√©d for me
","MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD.<br/><br/>I just got around to watching this movie. I was really looking forward to it - I had never heard of the book, but I really liked Emma Watson in the Harry Potter series and I generally like watching coming-of-age movies. And after the first 30 minutes, my pleasant anticipation seemed entirely justified. I really loved the first half an hour, it had so many great scenes in it: The innocent Charlie eating a hash brownie and being high for the first time, blabbering entertaining absurdities and demanding a milkshake, Emma Watson experiencing freedom while listening to David Bowie and of course my favorite, the awesome high school dance where Sam and Patrick do the 'living room dance'. So, after about 1/3 of its runtime, the movie looked really promising to me.<br/><br/>Sadly, it went all downhill from there for me. One reviewer here stated that he liked about this movie how it replaced 'tired clich√©s' and while I of course respect anyone's opinion, I actually felt a lot of clich√©s were merely repeated here. The shy, introverted guy with the good heart, who likes poems and reading, falls in love with the good-looking, upbeat girl whose only negative character trait seems to be constantly falling for douches. Her stepbrother, Patrick, is gay and dating one of the popular football playing kids, Brad, who is secretly gay, but obviously doesn't want to tell anybody and instead hides his relationship with Patrick. Eventually, Brad's father catches the two making out and punishes his son violently.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Charlie and Sam clearly have romantic feelings for each other, but Sam has a boyfriend and because of this, Charlie doesn't dare to ask her out. He gets in a distinctively unhappy relationship with one of their friends instead, Mary Elizabeth, but eventually has to confess he doesn't love her and only wants Sam. In the end, it is revealed that Sam's boyfriend has cheated on her the whole time, because, well, he's a douche, and before Sam leaves for university, she and Charlie finally get their big romantic moment they've been craving all along, confessing their love for each other and making out enthusiastically.<br/><br/>Doesn't that sound awfully familiar? To me, it does. It's the typical romance 'chick-flick' structure, just mixed with a coming-of-age tale here. I awarded six stars to this movie because, even though it's clich√©d, there's no denying it's well done - the acting is decent, the dialog is mostly good and the soundtrack is awesome. The little twist at the end regarding Charlie's aunt comes unexpected and makes kind of sense, but wasn't absolutely necessary to the story in my opinion. All in all, a decent movie with a lot of heart that really cares for its characters, but definitely no revelation and a little overrated here on IMDb, me thinks."

","""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is definitely a movie that almost every teen and adult can relate to. It can bring back the beloved and nostalgic teen-hood memories of an adult, and while at the same time, showing a realistic tale of the every-day life of a teenager in high school to those who can understand the hardships of being a teen. ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is definitely one of the best movies of the year. Logan Lerman, from ""Percy Jackson"" fame, delivers one of this year's most fantastic performances as Charlie, a shy and nervous young teen, with dreams of being a writer, while not having the greatest childhood, who's about to start his first day of high school. He sees himself as an outcast from the other kids, and he's afraid to make any friends, until he meets and befriends two seniors, Sam and Patrick, played respectively by Emma Watson of ""Harry Potter"" fame, and Ezra Miller of ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" fame. They accept Charlie as one of their own, and ask him to join their group of ""misfit toys"". We now get a heartwarming tale of teen-hood, friendship, surviving through high school, living your life, and growing up in this wonderful coming-of-age teen drama. Based on a critically acclaimed novel of the same name, the book's author, Stephen Chbosky, has both written and directed a film adaptation of his own novel, and it just pulls off beautifully. You can tell that all the hard work has to be credited towards the director. It was his responsibility that the movie just has a great look and style, and it has a great realistic tone, while it never falls to being dull. Delivering one of the best scripts in recent memory, this movie is just filled with clever and witty dialouge, while at the same time, giving the audience some intense realistic moments, some that can make you laugh, or some that can make you cry. Thanks to the hard work of the writer, ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" never feels as just a simple movie, while rather feels more like a realistic and truthful portrayal of teen life and behavior. As for the performances, all three young actors: Lerman, Watson, and Miller all delivering a fantastic chemistry that just shines on screen, and each actor delivers a great performance one after the other. The gorgeous Emma Watson is great playing the down-to-earth character of Sam, while Ezra Miller delivers stand-out comic relief as Patrick, the incredibly neurotic and charismatic step-brother to Sam. But, it's Logan Lerman who deserves a Best Actor nomination, for his performance as Charlie. As we learn in the film, he hasn't had a great childhood, from not communicating a lot with his family, and still trying to go through the death of a close relative. That makes Charlie seem the ultimate outcast at school. We actually feel the pain and hardships that the character goes through, and we as the audience, are always on his side, supporting him through the stages of his teen life. It's a golden performance that is truly one of the best I've seen all year. The unstoppable supporting cast also features some minor, but great performances from Paul Rudd as the English teacher with a heart of gold, and Melanie Lynskey, seen in flashbacks, as Charlie's deceased relative. This is a film that everybody, in almost every age, from adolescence to adult-hood, can find something to relate to. This is a film that will show audiences a beautiful coming-of-age tale of being yourself, staying with your friends, and trying to live in the world around us. Seeming perfectly similar to a John Hughes film, from ""The Breakfast Club"" to ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is a truly original and realistic teen flick that audiences all over will enjoy for sure! ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"", in my review, ""A beautifully original, and truly remarkable coming-of-age tale of adolescence""."

","I originally heard about the existence of ""Perks"" from news articles stating that Emma Watson would be in the movie (I'm a huge Harry Potter fan!) I read some of the book summaries and thought it sounded interesting, so I decided to read the book. I absolutely fell in love with it! Ever since, I had been wanting to see the movie, and had been upset at finding out it wasn't coming out near me in September. Finally, this past Friday it came out by me, so on Saturday a couple friends and I went to go see it. Overall, it was an incredible movie. They did leave out certain aspects from the book, but they were mostly parts that I could take or leave anyway. They kept the main parts in, as well as all of the best lines, which I greatly appreciated. The ending almost made me cry; it's just so powerful seeing these things I've read about come to life. Logan, Emma, and Ezra were amazing, as well as the supporting cast. Emma's accent was somewhat detectable in certain parts, but even so she portrayed Sam so well. And Ezra was by far the perfect Patrick, flamboyant, loud, and proud of it. Logan put so much emotion and heart into Charlie that I just wanted to reach through the screen and hug him. He truly was great. Anyone who loves the book as much as me will not be disappointed with the movie. In fact, if you're like me, you will want to see it again the second the credits roll! I know one thing's for sure, as soon as ""Perks"" comes on DVD, this girl is snatching a copy quicker than you can say ""Slut and the Falcon""!"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","7","12","1 October 2012"," A nostalgic, emotional crowd-pleaser for anyone who's gone to high school or ever felt alone
","""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" will be a relevant book for a long time, and consequently there's nothing dated about Stephen Chbosky's unique coming-of-age story now that it has finally hit the big screen so many years later. Anchored by strong performances from its leads and a powerful sense of poignancy, ""Wallflower"" is a thoroughly meaningful and enjoyable film.<br/><br/>To come clean I've never read the book, but when an author tackles his own work as both writer and director, it can sometimes spell disaster. When adapting their own work, the creators of original source material either fail or succeed beautifully; either they can't do what needs to be done to their baby in order to make it suitable for film or they completely understand how to translate their work. Chbosky appears to have hit upon the latter.<br/><br/>As a director, Chbosky's strength is capturing the nostalgia of his story, the emotions in particular from the unadulterated mirth to the sad, sad loneliness. With such talented blooming actors at his disposal, the film becomes all about them and we can't help but identify with them.<br/><br/>The world of ""Wallflower"" is stereotypical high school, but somehow, even though countless films do the same thing, ""Perks"" feels authentic. Maybe its the setting of Pittsburgh, the king of blue-collar cities, along with the early '90s setting. Regardless of when you went through this phase of your life, there's something so identifiable in the way this film presents it.<br/><br/>Charlie (Logan Lerman) is one of those protagonists that we all identify with too, and that's ultimately what makes this story powerful. We all have times when we feel like we didn't fit in, when we were ignored, when we felt like no one noticed us. And because Charlie wants to have friends, he isn't afraid to put himself in situations to succeed socially, we like him a lot. He's not the kind of loner who spurns the world around him.<br/><br/>We meet Charlie upon his first day of high school. It's rough to be a freshman and Charlie has no friends. None. Everyone he was friends with as a kid has spurned him in some way and his best friend took his own life the previous spring. He's afraid to do anything to stand out, to embrace what makes him special. Fortunately, he puts himself in position to meet Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson), two seniors who don't fall into any clique other than their self-described ""misfits"" label. They are sweet, genuine people (as characters and the actors playing them) and they embrace Charlie. We come to love them in a vicarious way, for reaching out to Charlie as we ourselves would like to.<br/><br/>Another part of what makes ""Wallflower"" a great story is that while we identify so strongly with Charlie at first, we eventually come to learn more and more about him and to the point that we can't even truly imagine what it's like to be him. We both pity him and come to admire him all the more for having a strength we're not sure we could ever have.<br/><br/>The bulk of the film showcases their adventures, along with Charlie's growing affection toward Sam and his relationship with other friends in their group. Every little scene evokes something keen, namely what we loved about being in high school. Drama and serious issues crop up too, but with them comes the implicit understanding that these were the problems we faced in high school and even if we would do things differently now, that's what we probably would've done then.<br/><br/>Not enough praise can be given to the trio of Lerman, Miller and Watson for bringing those feelings to life. Lerman is brilliant when it comes to portraying Charlie's introversion and communicating the mess in his head that we don't fully comprehend until the end. He should drop the Percy Jackson act and find more indie projects.<br/><br/>After seeing ""We Need to Talk About Kevin,"" I thought I would never like Miller, ever, and always associate him with that terrifying title role, but he nails the courageous and flamboyant gay best friend, embodying the stereotype and then subverting it. His line delivery cuts the tension at the most ideal moments and he's the most lovable part of the movie by far. <br/><br/>Sam is the weakest of the main characters, the girl next door with a troubled past that likes all the wrong guys. We're given her very much as Charlie sees her or any lonely teenager with a crush on the one he thinks he'll never get sees her. Watson, however, does a nice job keeping Sam's fragility with her at all times. When she's happy, it's an emotional breakthrough, and we get more of a sense of her character on the inside in spite of what the script gives us.<br/><br/>""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" doesn't break ground ground from a cinematic or storytelling perspective, but it does what it does ‚Äî chiefly appeal to the emotions ‚Äî as good as any movie out there.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","While this film might not be for everyone I think it's great for the time that we are in. For me the film excellently portrays a story about being socially disconnected. It touched me because I can relate and I'm sure (especially based on other reviews) that is has touched a lot of other people as well. <br/><br/>Acting was very good if not great. Emma Watson clearly has potential and put in a good shift. Ezriel Miller was the standout in my opinion and adds more depth to the film with his character contributing so the overall story line and message of the film.<br/><br/>Definitely a must watch film for anyone looking to see a good storyline and take a break from all the big budget movies."

","As someone over 21, I feel like an interloper reviewing this film. It didn't reflect my teenage experience back to me, but I was well past that phase in the early nineties. And yet, the American high school, such a tired, over-familiar arena for American cinema, seems not to have moved on at all. Jocks, Jewish-American princesses, closet gays and geeks all populate this film in fairly conventional representations. The lead character is in a state of fragile mental health, but no Holden Caulfield. He finds friends, has a loving family, and a teacher who looks out for him. The main issue he has is historical abuse, but the rendering of this is so 'lite' as to be unrealistic and totally lacking in emotional impact. I can buy that they did not know a Bowie classic in this part of the world in the early nineties, but I can't accept that they would ostracise a clearly fragile friend after one drunken party faux pas. The film does not explore the fallout of childhood abuse in meaningful terms, and it fails to capture the pain and euphoria of being a teenager. All in all, a bit flat and disappointing."

","Yet another movie that I am baffled by the rating and positive response. The acting is very awkward and forced. Logan does a pretty good job... he didn't talk a whole lot. He would just say his one line and looks would be exchanged and then end scene. Emma's accent was horrendous. I swear there were moments of actually pauses and silence in her scenes because the three actors must not have spent enough time together because their friendship didn't seem real at all. I hate when movies have to cram all these scenes from the book into a short movie, it hardly ever works out for the fans. I just wanted MORE from it! I didn't get that deep emotional feeling I got from reading the book."
"lavatch","Null","3","4","25 November 2019"," The Island of Misfit Toys
","The setting is Pittsburgh. The time is around the millennium. Young Charlie Kelmeckis is entering high school not with a chip on his shoulder but with a hole in his soul. But rather than explore the vacuum in his life, the film veers away from the realities faced by Charlie into a ridiculous coming-of-age story ridden with clich√©s.<br/><br/>Time and again, credibility is lost with an attractive group of students that bond unconvincingly as outsiders. They call themselves ""the island of misfit toys."" But they are all so intelligent, dynamic, and smartly dressed that they never fit the profile of genuine outsiders, let alone the concept of the wallflower of the film's title.<br/><br/>The crucial background in Charlie's past is only hinted at until the truth is revealed at the very end of the film. Growing up, the little boy had a special bond with his Auntie Helen. But one winter's night as she was driving home after a visit with her precious nephew, Auntie Helen was not concentrating on her driving, and she was clocked by a truck bearing down on her from the left. In the unformed mind of seven-year-old Charlie, he felt like he was the cause of his auntie's fatal accident. But is there more to the story? Indeed there is! Charlie and Auntie Helen had their ""own little secret.""<br/><br/>Too many of the scenes in this film did not ring true to life. Would Charlie really be able to take on a foursome of football players in the school cafeteria? Would a senior as gorgeous as Sam really take an interest in a withdrawn freshman like Charlie? Would young Charlie even be invited and would he even be interested in attending the parties thrown by upperclassmen that he loathes? Would Charlie's English teacher really hand him a copy of his favorite book, which turns out to be J. D. Salinger's ""The Catcher in the Rye""? Please!!!<br/><br/>The pacing of the film was laboriously slow with far too many subplots, miscellaneous characters, and under-developed relationships. Do we truly care about the relationship of Charlie's sister Candace with the abusive kid named ""Ponytail""? Does it ring true that Mary Elizabeth is a Buddhist, yet she yearns to live in a high-priced home on Cape Cod? Does it matter that the ""Goth"" Alice shoplifts her jeans from the mall? The dialogue rarely rang true, and the major shortcoming was that the characters were simply not very likable."

I have gotten to the annoying point where I know the lines before they happen, but I usually have the respect to only whisper them to myself. This movie swallows up what it feels like to be in high school and spits it into a mirror. When being nothing feels like everything. When you thought there was no one cool left to meet.

","In this film, Charlie, played by Logan Lerman, is an outsider who is coping with the suicide of his best friend, as well as with his own mental illness. He struggles to find friends, but soon finds them in Sam, played by Emma Watson, and Patrick, played by Ezra Miller. He is particularly smitten with Sam and they go on adventures, showing him what it's like to be a teenager.<br/><br/>This is such a beautiful film. It really is one of the greatest young adult films ever, and it's all sold in the main three actors' performances. Logan Lerman is perfect as the guy who nobody notices at a party, while Ezra Miller is great at playing the wild and unusual character. The one who really surprised me, though, was Emma Watson as Sam. It was going to be hard for her to come out of the shadows as Hermione Grainger, but she does it so effortlessly that I think that, although it will be her most famous role, she doesn't seem to have any problems branching out and trying new things.<br/><br/>What really got to me more than anything was the characters themselves. You really cared about these guys. You wanted them to just be there for each other through thick and thin, no matter what the cost was. This is a beautiful film about friendship and I just can't say enough about it. Go and watch it. You'll know what I'm talking about."
"SnoopyStyle","7","4","6","7 September 2013"," Young Cast has Heart
","Charlie Kelmeckis (Logan Lerman) is a loner high school freshman with dark secrets. Luckily, unusual seniors Sam (Emma Watson) and her gay stepbrother Patrick (Ezra Miller) adopt him into their circle of friends. Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman) takes a liking to him and English teacher Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd) takes an interest in his work.<br/><br/>The group of friends have amazing chemistry. They give a sense of true friendship off-camera, and it shows on camera. The only minor observation is that Logan Lerman seems a little too old to play a High School freshman. He is suppose to be 3 years younger than the rest. Logan Lerman gives a great performance but sometimes it's harder to see him as that much younger. Emma Watson also gives a credible performance as a sweetheart, but she's missing the damaged core that the story implies. Ezra Miller has wonderful charisma.<br/><br/>First time director Stephen Chbosky adapts his own book to the big screen. He does a surprisingly good job for a rookie. But at times, he seems to miss the big moments. Charlie suffers from blackouts, and sometimes the movie suffers from the same. Songs often ends abruptly, and some scenes are missing its big payoffs. There's a scene where the boys grab him into the bathroom, but he doesn't show any consequences. I get the sense that a more experienced director would be able to see the missing bits. Charlie goes nuts in a fight but the movie holds back the big money shots. The movie has really dark places to go. The tone starts off as a charming, cute coming of age movie. I think a brutal scene early on would set the movie off in a darker direction. If it wants to go there, it needs to start earlier. Overall, it's a heart breaker and a good effort for the first time director. The young cast gives an exceptional performance."

","I'm much aware people are going to hate me to death for my opinion about this picture, but I'm saying it anyway. From the get go I already knew it was gonna be a movie for a ""Juno"" audience-- mainly because of the irritating teenagers there were in my cinema session. Logan Lerman plays a typical nerd who nobody cares about, and as predictable as it could be, he becomes a nice guy after some while, whereas the nice guys become boring. That's been used in 26548761234 past American movies and I really don't understand HOW IMDb users miss that. Emma Watson is just boring as she is in every movie. The main couple is completely predictable, irritating, and when they had their first kiss was the catalyst for me to leave the cinema room-- something I've NEVER done in my entire life. Surely soundtrack is also horrible; be prepared to listen to strange rock-likely gangs-- if you like rock, you won't enjoy it. All in all, it's just another typical American teenage drama with nothing else to offer you."
"zkonedog","3","7","13","6 March 2017"," It Tries, But Has No Base
","I hate to see a movie like this. I really, really do. ""Perks of Being A Wallflower"" tries oh so hard to make itself emotionally relevant, but ultimately fails in that regard because it has no ""base"" to fall back on.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Charlie (Logan Lerman), a new high school freshman who epitomizes the word ""wallflower"". Soon upon his arrival into high school, however, Charlie is taken under the wings of Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson), who show him how to live it up and let go of some of his inhibitions.<br/><br/>The main trouble with this movie (minor spoilers ahead) is that I feel the storytelling is backwards and thus the narrative never really plays out in any meaningful way. It's almost like the character development comes at the very end of the movie, when the characters have already been on screen for a long, long time. Thus, when the ""big emotional payoff"" actually comes to fruition, it really doesn't because for so long the characters were just kind of floating along without a solid base.<br/><br/>This whole experience strikes me as a prime example of ""the book being better than the movie"". I haven't read the book, but I'd almost bet money that it does a much better job of conveying the adolescent message than this movie does. This is even despite the fact that I thought the acting was actually pretty good. That wasn't the problem....the problem was the overall tone and plot devices.<br/><br/>Thus, I couldn't get into ""Perks of Being A Wallflower"" whatsoever because I didn't feel for the characters until the very end, and by then it was just too late. My exact star rating would be more like 1.5, but I bump it up a little because I think there was a sincere effort here to create a good movie. It just didn't work for me."

Charlie the only one eating the hash brownie and taking the hit of acid? How could the fight scene go on so long in the school cafeteria without any teacher/monitor ever present? Even with the built-up rage Charlie had inside, how could this scrawny kid stop the gang beating underway?

","A lot of people try to pin Perks as a coming of age movie. It is very much that, but it's also a whole lot more as well. A lot of its themes, such as how the friends who get us through tough times are to be treasured, translate to any age.<br/><br/>Chbosky has very successfully translated his incredible novel onto the screen, preserving most of the critical elements loved by millions of fans. You can tell this movie was deeply personal for him, and it shows in his direction, locations and in his screenplay. Although Chbosky had limited directorial experience, I was impressed.<br/><br/>This was truly an actor's movie, and the casting was perfect all the way through. I thought the three leads all did equally well in their respective roles. They were all amazing. Many seem to think Ezra Miller did the best of the three; while he perfectly brought the lively, charismatic Patrick to life, and played a perfect balance between being outgoing and reflecting some deep inward hurt, I didn't think his performance was any better than the other two. He actually had the easiest role to play. Logan Lerman was absolutely brilliant as Charlie, an extremely difficult part to do well. Logan perfectly captured the deep awkwardness, uncertainty and thoughtfulness of his character, as well as the emotions raging within him, from his tortured memories to his aching crush on Sam. As a viewer, you form a deep bond with him.<br/><br/>I find it surprising that Emma Watson seems to get the least kudos. She had the most to prove, burdened with the doubts about acting ability (fair or not) that seem to go to actors from blockbuster franchises. There should be no more questions about whether she can act outside of Potter, as she did Sam spot on. I thought Sam was the most enigmatic character in the book, and Emma wonderfully captured all the deep nuances of her character. Just from her facial expressions and presence alone she hinted at Sam's internal conflicts and self doubts, and is believable as the girl Charlie would fall heavily for. All the cast seemed realistic as close friends, and there was some great on-screen chemistry , particularly between Emma and Logan, that will at times bring on the tears.<br/><br/>Regardless of your age, there's something here for everyone. It's just a plain good movie. The amazing thing is that Emma Watson apparently had to go from studio to studio begging for a few dollars to get this amazing book made into a movie. Even after turning out extremely well, it is still playing in far fewer theaters than some of the less than stellar ""mainstream"" Hollywood offerings."

","Warning spoilers!<br/><br/>The movie starts out with the main character making some outrageous claims about high school. You know the typical American whining ""school is prison"" ""I am stuck here"" ""It's the most horrible thing ever"" Really? There are people that are starving, there are wars in other countries, there are rampant diseases, severe poverty, high crime rates. Yet High School is the worst thing ever? Ugh, this is why from the get go I knew that this was a 8u11$#!t movie.<br/><br/>To have a good movie you have to have a BELIEVABLE introduction to base the movie on. When your premise is FALSE then the entire movie is (r@p. It all just fell apart from there.<br/><br/>So this guy goes to school. So far all I got from the movie is total lies. I am WAITING for some REAL, FACTUAL thing to go on. Something to connect to. Really ANYTHING!!!! I got nothing. Just more lies. A guy gets back from being sick and people MAKE FUN OF HIM!? WTF!? Omg, MORE LIES! People would FEEL SORRY FOR HIM! Wow, the girl that calls him names in his English class is totally unrealistic!<br/><br/>So now we are into the movie and absolutely NOTHING has happened. I have no clue who this kid is, who his family is, who his new friends are, or even what time period this is even supposed to be taking place in. I mean how unclear can one movie be!? Can't they have put some text stating the year at the start of the movie? More confusion and lies! Also if this is supposed to take place in the 80's or even 90's then they are dressed ALL WRONG! Their hair is ALL WRONG! Ugh, people DID NOT DRESS LIKE THAT! If you just want to dress people in the style of today then set the d@mn movie in the present! Except for the odd over sized sweaters here and there I did not see much authentic old fashion. Looks like you can buy all the stuff they are wearing at forever 21!<br/><br/>At this point the movie felt like it was 3, possibly 4 hours long. That's what happens when ABSOLUTELY NOTHING is happening! I was not even a half hour into this not even 2 hour movie! So basically at this point we are told that these people who became the main guy's friend are 'outcasts' WTF!? Umm, yeah tell their screaming fans that they are unattractive. If Logan Lerman walked down the street he would probably be chased by fans, the same with Emma Watson, and so on. Emma did a pretty bad job as usual. Her pointless head bobbing, wooden acting, and terrible accent were all present. Again the movie has not given me ANYTHING to grab onto as real. I have been lied to, and it's just continuing.<br/><br/>So to wrap things up we learn that BOTH Emma, and Logan's characters were molested/raped/abused/etc. as children. OK? So that is grounds for falling in love? So your abuse defines you? Wow what a horrible message this movie sends. Talking about messages; this movie is jam paced with every clich√© possible. I was wondering if they managed to fit them all in there! Here goes: life sucks, hs is the worst thing ever, we are infinite, we will become parents one day, no one can take hs experiences away from us, friends are forever, don't let men beat you, be yourself, don't dumb yourself down for a man, we are helpless to 'save' any one, enjoy the moment, etc.<br/><br/>I even forgot how the movie ended it was so pointless and meaningless. As for the entire movie I was lied to. I could not make heads nor tails of this movie. I just felt like I had to write this review to urge people not to watch the movie and bring the misleading rating down. This movie does not have enough 1 star reviews! It's bad in every way shape and form. There is no: realistic story, character development, time frame, truth. Ugh I'm getting a head ache. Avoid this movie. It seems like the only reason people saw this movie was because they were fans of the actors. Sad. This is the reason movie quality has steadily been going down. People don't care what the movie even is as long as they get to stare at some actor. That's why (r@p like this is even allowed to be made.

"CihanVercan","4","7","14","2 November 2013"," Rebel with a Cause - a very week social drama due to disregard of psychological science
","An author and a movie-maker are two totally different career personalities. It isn't always easy for an author to turn his own novel into a feature-length movie. Even though there are exceptions, in general the idea of writing a drama novel develops through emotions and thoughts, whereas writing a movie requires thinking in visuals and in character motives. <br/><br/>As a novel ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" has published by MTV in the year 1999 for Young Adult audiences. Examining social psychology as a subject matter is the leading concentration herein. This novel has several references from English Literature works and Western Philosophy movements. Author Stephen Chbosky reflects his opinions on struggles of an adolescent growing up to adulthood in a western society where the adolescent has to face isolation and alienation while delving deeply into individual freedom as it is the case in Nihilism, Absurdism, and in Existentialism. <br/><br/>The refusal of loneliness is the concealed and driven force of being a wallflower. Being a wallflower for an adolescent in this film stands for acting the cool guy, and acting the wanna-be-popular guy. According to Albert Camus, the French philosopher, this is the definition of being a ""rebel"". <br/><br/>But the promised concealed and driven force of being a wallflower isn't displayed in the film, which is the initial problem of the chain of other continued failures. The reasoning with choosing to be a wallflower is explained through shyness. If the Charlie character is made shy, how can he easily strip down his clothes in front of a hundred people on the Rocky Horror Picture Show night? The psychological trauma awaiting after committing such a ""rebel"" action for a shy person may be very severely grievous, or may be not. Let's hope it may not. <br/><br/>The ease of dialogues and interactions between Emma Watson's character(Sam) and Charlie are also improper with the given character motives. She types ""write about us"" to Charlie's typewriter. And what does Charlie do in return? He types ""I will"". This is just nonsense. Later on she goes to sit on her bed sort of inviting him to sex. The moment as a couple they were about to start making out, as Sam touches Charlie on his inner thighs, Charlie recalls his sister who is dead. How can you recall your late sister while your dream girlfriend makes love to you as she touches your thighs? Reality is that Charlie's character is not directed to be a shy character. He is just a cool but abnormally depressive character. And this has nothing to do with being a wallflower. <br/><br/>Charlie is the next James Dean. Everything he did to lure girls, so did James Dean the same way. For over 65 years in Hollywood, being the cool and rebel guy always created more impression on girls rather than being a nice popular guy. This is a huge and inexcusable directing inferiority. <br/><br/>Whoever loved this film, loved it because of the resolution at the end. Whereas also whoever hated this film, hated it because of the revelation at the end. The Perks of Being a Wallflower film has two main themes: <br/><br/>1/ Finding the love you deserve 2/ Finding the meaning of becoming an adult <br/><br/>Each theme is in contradiction with each other. This film offers us the resolution that seeking the love you deserve keeps you away from becoming an adult. And it offers us the revelation of finding the meaning of becoming an adult in Nihilist freedom of an understanding that you cannot run after love, love will come to you."

","Our 14-year-old KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Victoria Burns, found this film to be the ""best she has ever seen"" and noted that ""this movie can prepare teens to not keep emotions and experiences bottled up because school can be painful and stressful."" Below is her review.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that it was one of, if not the best movie that I have ever seen. It was so pivotal that it almost made me cry, and that says a lot because I almost never cry. It was great to see a movie that beautifully showed some of the struggles that real teenagers go through and not sugar coated. <br/><br/>This movie is very emotional and has great acting. I like the way the flashback scenes are shown, by alternating from the present to the past, then showing the aftermath after the flashbacks. I had never seen Emma Watson in anything but the Harry Potter series, and she is amazing playing Sam, I have never seen her play a character like this. <br/><br/>The movie is so good that no words can explain. I bought the book directly after I watched the movie. I also love how throughout the whole movie most of the story is told by Charlie (Logan Lerman) who writes letters anonymously to ""A Friend"" who doesn't exist. <br/><br/>This movie is about a severely depressed and lonely boy, Charlie, whose best friend killed himself before the school year starts. So now, Charlie has no friends and people think he is weird because he holds in and takes the pain of himself and all of the people he loves, sometimes it all wells up and he has anxiety attacks. This year he is determined to make friends and he meets the flamboyant Patrick (Ezra Miller), and his stepsister Sam (Emma Watson). They let him in and introduce him to a whole new world filled with fun, sadness, and just plain life. Plus, he falls in love with Sam along the way. All of Charlie's friends are seniors, and he makes a mistake that makes them go away for a while. But then he does something to make them love him even more than before. <br/><br/>I think that everyone should watch this movie. I like how, whenever something bad or slightly inappropriate happens in the flashbacks, the scene hints at what was happening without blatantly showing what happened. My favorite quote from the movie is when Charlie's English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd) tells him that, ""We accept the love we think we deserve."" I think it is so profound and absolutely true. I recommend this movie for eighth graders going into high school up to any adult. This movie can prepare teens to not keep emotions and experiences bottled up because school can be painful and stressful. I give it five out of five stars because this movie is amazing and will someday be a classic."
"elpresidente-4","2","5","9","5 March 2016"," A movie made by a fringe group within a fringe group
","Let me start by saying that I wanted to see this movie after watching an Emma Watson interview on some British radio. It was claimed that the movie is very moving and emotional, even made some people cry. I was curious what was so emotional about it. Well, I still don't know, because while I watched the movie my heart rate didn't change even a little bit. I felt like I've already seen this movie. Then I realized why I felt that way. The movie is very formulaic and full of modern Hollywood teen drama clich√©s. It's a product of detached from reality people living in already detached enough society. The main characters in the movie and their families are upper middle class suburban people, living in large spacious houses, on smoothly paved clean streets, with neat lush patches of grass in front of each house. They are teens without a single work day who drive huge pickup trucks, their goals in life are to get accepted in Harvard and become movie directors or writers. They recreate and enjoy movies about decadence and decay. They have it so easy in their life, that the only problems they face is their own budding sexuality and the fear that they will not fit within the massive rich-first-world-people clich√© that their entire life is. The movie's pretense for drama is forced upon the viewer by creating a hardly believable plot of sexual mismatch, sexual intolerance, sexual depravity, relationship abuse, teen drug experimenting, a suicide and a car accident thrown in for good measure. The only thing missing was someone getting cancer and beating it through sheer will (or tragically dying). I think they just replaced it with a nervous breakdown. I could've forgiven this movie and its pitiful attempt to deliver a meaningful message if it wasn't the fact that they hired a mainstream actress famous for being the unfulfilled wish of hundreds of millions of heterosexual young males just to make sure someone will get duped into watching it. The movie's message (if there even was one) falls flat, because it's fake and shallow just like the fake and shallow characters of the movie. Everything about this movie is predictable and a clich√© - from the title and poster to the last scene. It's a movie about the tragedy of being born in a rich family and having no one else to look up to besides other jaded, spoiled and detached from reality brats."

","The movie is written and directed by Stephen Chbosky, the very same person who wrote the amazing book of which the film is an adaptation of. It's a unique situation, given that it's entirely his vision and artistic integrity no matter how many changes there are between the two mediums. Not that there's anything to complain about between the two; the movie surprised me in just how heartfelt and genuine it came across and while it (of course) wasn't as powerful as the book, it still ended up being the most earnest and emotional coming of age film I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The beauty of it all is in just how well it captures the human state of becoming 'someone', no matter what we think we should be or what we're afraid of. In this case, it's more about what we're afraid of people learning about ourselves. In this case, our characters come from very dark, abused and broken places and somehow it manages to inspire and give hope to the audience.<br/><br/>While this is not a movie for the faint of heart, nor is it for the general 'popcorn crowd', it is absolutely a quintessential film experience that should be shared by those who want to grow, learn, and most importantly, understand others. <br/><br/>The film does a phenomenal job of capturing the positive and life defining influences of friends, literature, music and love. The cast could not have been better, although, I do feel like Emma Watson dropped the ball on having the inner turmoil that her character required. Something that may have been done better by someone with more acting experience but nevertheless I have no real complaints at all. The small roles by Paul Rudd, Tom Savini, Nicholas Braun, and Joan Cusack brought a tremendous amount of weight to the film; all were exquisite. <br/><br/>Don't be afraid of anything!<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and get your hands on this quick read.

","I first found out about this movie from my older sister who's name I won't reveal here. She knew I enjoyed The Breakfast Club and every other John Hughes movie and she also knew I had a massive crush on Emma Watson. So she told me that I would enjoy this film. We watched it together on a rainy Friday night when my parents went out to dinner. I went into this movie with the spirit of all of John Hughes movies in my mind. But I was wrong. As I'm watching this movie, I was shocked and disturbed by how horrible this movie was. This movie wasn't even remotely like any of John Hughes' movies. I rather watch those movies any day over this train wreck. This movie relies on massive dark and depressing clich√©s as seen in all teen movies such as abusive family members, underage drinking/drug use/partying, bullying, crying over how no one accepts you, etc. The some of those things actually triggered bad memories for me which I won't go into here. The partying scenes are so ridiculous. As I'm watching these scenes, I kept expecting Arnold Schwarzenegger from Kindergarten Cop to show up with a shotgun and shoot up the party and say ""I'm the party pooper"". The only thing that kept the movie going for me was Emma Watson. I just kept watching the movie for her scenes. But other than that, I could barely maintain my sanity while watching this garbage. The worst moment in this movie is Charlie's breakdown scene. This is literally the most overacted scene in any movie I have ever scene. It's almost to the point of unwatchable. I wanted to give up from here, but I didn't. Another big flaw I noticed with this movie was all the dark color tinting. This movie was supposed to be a teen dramedy not a horror movie. It makes The Breakfast Club look like Twilight. I'm not saying The Breakfast Club was hilarious. I'm saying that movie was more bright and colorful and had more humor in it than this. Anyway, after I finished this movie, I immediately did a Bill Murray marathon which consisted of Stripes, Ghostbusters, Ghostbusters II, Meatballs and Caddyshack as an attempt to cleanse myself from the filth of this movie. If you want to maintain your sanity and not bring back traumatic memories, do yourself a favor and stay as far away from this movie as you can. Don't waste your time on this big pile of feces that this movie is. You'll thank me for this one day. That is all."
"rockocs","3","6","12","26 July 2014"," Disingenuous
","Movies like this are a disservice to real life kids in actual high school today. No manic pixie dream girl (and her inclusive sidekick) really exist, certainly not in high school, and no unsuspecting nerd is going to be swept up into a whirlwind of acceptance and parties and love affairs. If this movie weren't about something people everywhere, throughout all time, ever didn't experience for themselves, maybe it would be entertaining. But they do. So it's just insultingly saccharine. This movie should be categorized under fantasy, it's certainly not relatable for kids, I think it only really serves as a guidebook for the MPDG wannabe's. IE: it's tripe. Thank goodness I didn't see this while I was actually in high school and actually struggling or this would have made me feel worse."

","Nirvana had it right. This film, set in the grunge heyday, was full of the teenage angst that sells films and albums, but that leaves a empty space when life moves on. Sure, it is an interesting coming of age story, but I am bored with it's redundancies. Not much has changed from then to now so there is not so much a kudos on it being a period piece, as many reviews had suggested, and in the places where it should have shown a difference in that age and this, it was not so accurate. Also, as much as I love Emma Watson, she seemed timid and her American accent was flimsy. The best part of this film was the character of Patrick, which is a given. The book seemed so much more profound when I read it in my teens, but I can't say if it is the story that had changed for the film, or just me changing with age."

"Robert_duder","9","4","7","13 February 2013"," Brilliant! A near perfect coming of age film!
","I think Perks of Being A Wallflower finds its magic in the fact that the original mind that created the best selling book also penned the screenplay and directed the film. No one knows a writer's world better than the writer himself. On top of that I think the cast was meticulously chosen and happen to have truly incredible chemistry. I don't know what I expected from the movie, I had only seen a few trailers for the movie and next thing I knew I was completely enthralled, touched and moved. I think Perks of a Wallflower is to anyone who was teenager in the 90's what American Graffitti was to its generation. Yes I am comparing it to that classic. It was so perfectly crafted and without being obvious or blatant in its references to the 90's. I went to High School in the 90's and I felt connected to the characters and the world they lived in and I was blown way by how many things I spotted that were the exact same items I owned (maybe a sheer coincidence but it was very cool.) The copies of the books the lead character had were identical to the ones I once owned (or still own) in High School. Each character was so unique and so well cast that everyone stands out in their performance.<br/><br/>I have always liked Logan Lerman but in a perfect world he would have gotten an Oscar nomination for his performance as the shy Charlie. Not only does Charlie struggle with fitting in but he suffers from having lost his best friend to suicide, sexual abuse as a child, and various mental health problems. His struggle truly strikes a chord and he is vibrant and just incredible on screen. Emma Watson shines as Sam. In her first major post Harry Potter role she is brilliant. I forgot all about her Hermoine days and she became Sam, Charlie's first love. Their chemistry is absolutely incredible and she is just perfect. Her role is subtle and yet her character captivating and struggling to find herself. Ezra Miller once again stunned me (he was brilliant in we Need To Talk About Kevin) as Sam's step-brother Patrick. He is also struggling to find his way in the world as a gay person. Now his character could have been incredibly clich√© and predictable but it was anything but. All three of these actors made their characters come to life. You weren't watching a movie but rather watching these three young people find their way and struggle with their own very distinct personalities, trials, and tribulations. Nina Dobrev really impressed me in a small supporting role as Charlie's sister. She was excellent. The supporting cast were a lot of very familiar faces and they all did such a great job. Some of the roles were barely more than cameos and yet they were so effective. Definite honourable mentions to Paul Rudd and Tom Savini, who were so effective in their roles as High School teachers that I could have swore I personally had them both for classes. Mae Whitman, Erin Wilhelmi and Adam Hagenbuch did a terrific job at rounding out their group of friends. Dylan McDermott and Kate Walsh were good as Charlie's parents but I would have liked to have seen more from them and more interaction with Charlie. Two great actors that go fairly underused.<br/><br/>I think writer and director Stephen Chbosky has created one of the most brilliant coming of age films I have ever seen. I think this film will likely go very under-rated and I hope one day it rises as a classic like many films do. The soundtrack is brilliant because it perfectly takes you back without shoving the time period in your face. There is so much content and characters in the film but it never feels overwhelming. Every single thing just falls into place and is held together perfectly. I even toyed with slapping a perfect 10 on this movie and the only reason I am not is because I'm just not sure it will stand up to the test of time quite yet. But I can't express enough how brilliant I thought the movie was and Chbosky should be heralded for crafting such a well made movie. On the other hand, success is sometimes sheer luck and it just so happens this film has chemistry written all over it and the cast was so brilliant. I look forward to watching this again and again and certainly if you were a teenager in the 90's...this is your movie!! 9/10"
"filmchaser","5","4","7","13 February 2013"," Too Cute to Be a Wallflower
","This film is full of attractive young actors portraying high school kids, seemingly from affluent families based on their ""secret Santa"" gifts. Charlie, played by Logan Lerman, is a freshman with a great deal of sadness in his life because he had a favorite aunt, played by Melanie Lynsky, whose life was a tragedy; and a best friend who committed suicide.<br/><br/>In fact, Charlie, while intelligent and loved by his family, seemed to be oddly normal for a kid with such a long history of mental problems, for example, ""seeing people."" I was confused as to why Charlie's sister, Candace, snubbed Charlie at school knowing how lonely he was, as compared to how loving and concerned she was at home. Also, the relationship between Sam and Patrick was not believable. How likely is it that two step-siblings would be equally quirky, empathetic, the same age, equally fashionable, compatible, and hang out together? Ezra Miller was amazing, and had too little screen time. In fact, I found myself unsympathetic to any of the characters because, other than Charlie and Patrick, all those kids seemed to have a good time all the time. The character of Mary Elizabeth just seemed like a different version of Sam, because the actresses playing those characters favor each other enough to be related.<br/><br/>The script seemed very dis-jointed, as if the writer didn't want to delve too deeply into any one subject. The flashbacks to Aunt Helen were distracting, and the little boy actor who played little Charlie wasn't as cute as the grown up Charlie. The parents all seemed very uninvolved with their kids, and didn't seem to have a purpose. The film did explore the issue of being a gay male teenager and being betrayed by the poser, but only briefly.<br/><br/>It seems like the theme of misfits finding each other has been done before and has been done better. And one lingering question I have is, if Charlie had been in therapy all those years, why did he only remember repressed memories when he entered his first year of high school? and then, why did he race for a kitchen knife the first time he's left alone at home, and if he's that unstable, why wasn't he locked up? It just seems like the writers thought they would just throw mud at a wall and see what sticks, but nothing too deep. And that whole issue about what song was playing as they drove through the tunnel drove me crazy.<br/><br/>Lightly entertaining. Great performances by Ezra Miller and Logan Lerman. Joan Cusack's 3 minutes of screen time was reassuring."

"The-Sarkologist","6","4","7","8 December 2012"," A rather gritty look at high school life
","I probably would not call this a high-school romantic comedy about how a geek learns how to survive high-school because the characters within this film are not your typical cookie-cutter Hollywood characters, and also that the film is actually a lot darker and grittier than many of the other films that I have seen. For instance, there is a lot more to Charlie than your typical Hollywood character, whose only flaw, if you actually want to call it a flaw, is their geekiness.<br/><br/>Charlie is a character with a lot of baggage, but as is true with many people who have suffered significant trauma in their younger years, much of this baggage has been blacked out, and in fact as we move through the film, we begin to learn that Charlie himself suffers a lot of blackouts. It is done in a way that we as the viewer are unsure as to what is going on, but in a way this helps us understand the character more because, while he knows that he does suffer from some undisclosed mental illness, he is as much in the dark as we are, and for much of the film we are simply told that it is 'his problem'.<br/><br/>The movie is not so dark as to create a bad home life for the character though, because it is clear that his parents and his siblings do actually support him, even if it is only at home. However, it does give a very good reflection of the nature of high school in the developing world, particularly since we see how difficult it can be to actually fit in when in reality you are an outcast, and in fact Charlie himself ends up becoming connected with the outcasts themselves.<br/><br/>Having experienced such a culture in my younger years, I must admit that many of us who were the introverts in high-school would end up connected with those of our kin, I know I did, and these groups would end up dulling their pain through the use of drugs. I still remember discovering at university that the group that I ended up connecting with ended up being made up of those very much like myself. It is interesting in a way that some groups that I interacted with would talk about how they were outcasts but I never really felt as if I were able to truly connect with those outcasts, but others than I knew I did have a way of connecting with them.<br/><br/>In a way it seems to reflect so much on how our society has evolved, or should I say de-evolved. In many ways our society is becoming more and more disconnected as we speak. These days it is rare for parents, even loving and supporting parents, to be able to connect with their children, and it is very common for them to have no idea on where they are when they are no longer in the house. It can reach a point, as it does in the movie, that the child is found lying flaked out in the snow, with no idea as to how the child arrived at this point, but a discovery is still made that the child has been using drugs. In many cases it is not discovered until it is too late."

","Stephen Chbosky's ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" may not be an original film dealing with high school ups and downs, but it could very well be a very strong addition to the genre. It marks a great directorial debut from Chbosky, who also wrote the screenplay which is based on his own novel. It is always a pleasure to see an author/novelist have the freedom to express his own material in a different medium, and do it so professionally.<br/><br/>The film centers around introvert Charlie and his struggles during freshman year in high school. Charlie is struggling with making new friends due to personal tragedies which affected him negatively. This may not be new, but in the hands of a lesser director, could make it worse. Chbosky knows what he is doing and fine-tunes his actors to fit his story the way he wants it - raw and real. True to introverts, this movie and Chbosky really get what they're thinking and how they can cope with friends, bullies and tragedies. Chbosky understood the themes and his actors understood the material very well, so this film is not the usual teen film. <br/><br/>The three main actors shape themselves around their characters perfectly. Logan Lerman is great as Charlie in a performance that is emotional, subtle, withdrawn and quirky in places. He really can get intense at moments too. Ezra Miller, who terrified us in ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"" last year, turns 180 degrees and delivers a likable, hilarious, often touching character in Patrick, who is half the key to Charlie's quest for friendship. The other half is the lovely Emma Watson as Sam, Patrick's stepsister and Charlie's first love. Watson, in her first attempt to shed off her ""Harry Potter"" image is witty, charming and cute, and still manages to give out a heartfelt performance. She's the kind of pretty girl that all boys like to see, and give guys like Charlie hopes and dreams - and possibly save them, too. Other actors in the movie of note are Mae Whitman as Charlie's first date, Kate Walsh and Dylan McDermott as Charlie's parents and Nina Dobrev and Zane Holtz as Charlie's siblings. They sort of fade into the background once Charlie gets with his friends, but they're there when Charlie has no one, like all families should be. Oh, and Paul Rudd as the likable literature teacher. Makes you want him to be in your class one day.<br/><br/>Chbosky does not stray from the roots of realism. Even though the film may tread familiar teen movie ground as desirable as it should, Chbosky firmly plants this movie's feet into the realistic ground. This film struck a personal chord with me, too. It really touched me as I am an introvert as well since high school, although not as serious and intense as Charlie, I feel him. Some scenes were pleasant to watch, some scenes were intense and brought back many unwanted/awkward memories, and other times it had me thinking even further.<br/><br/>The fact that this film contains mature themes of suicide, homosexuality, drug and sexual content, and still be given a PG-13 rating is nothing short of a miracle. Bottom line is, if you're a teen or an introverted young adult, make sure this movie is on the top of your watch list. This is a great teen film.<br/><br/>Overall: 84%"

","Every once in awhile a movie comes along that completely surprises you. After sifting through all the major blockbusters that come out every year there is always a movie like ""Perks of Being a Wallflower"", written and directed by Pittsburgh's own Stephen Chbosky, that surpasses everyone's expectations and ends up being one of the best films of the year, despite being an independent film. ""Perks"" does so many things right. Chbosky assembled a cast and then knocked this thing out of the park. He does something big blockbuster so often don't do, he makes you characters that genuinely care about which makes the film as powerful as any other you will see this year. I highly recommend ""Perks"", if for no other reason than that it's by far one of the most heartfelt and original films you will see this year."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","7","15","16 October 2012"," This is a film so smart about life that you find yourself nodding with recognition
","Few films really know anything about teenagers. These days we get vampires, mad slashers, and toilet humor, but we rarely ever get characters with hearts, minds, feelings and fears. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a rare and glorious joy, a movie that knows the fear and confusion of the years between childhood and adulthood, a time that is about growing up and discovering the mysteries of life, not about superpowers or American pies. Here is a movie so knowledgeable about how young people talk and think that it may someday earn a place alongside the best teenage movies ever made, films like Rebel Without a Cause, American Graffiti, The Breakfast Club, Say Anything . . ., and Juno. It's that good.<br/><br/>Like all of those great films, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is not about a plot, but about lives being lived. The story takes place within characters that are so well-defined that we find the story in their actions, not in a screenwriter's manipulation. The story takes place in the late-90s but the screenplay is so generous that almost any generation could recognize some of it in their own histories.<br/><br/>Based on the popular epistolary young adult novel by Stephen Chbosky, who also directs, The Perks of Being a Wallflower centers on a young high school kid named Charlie (Logan Lerman) who is a meek, unassuming tenant of this world, a kid so shy and unremarkable that you could probably spend four years attending the same school and never notice him. That, at least, is the way his fellow students see him. We meet him at home, with his mom and dad and a sister who is dating a loser. Charlie's heart is damaged because of a tragedy long ago. His aunt died in an accident on his birthday. Years have gone by but Charlie still nurses fresh wounds. His act of self-therapy is to write in a private journal to someone he calls ""My friend."" We meet him as he is entering high school, a place where he is both mocked and ignored. It isn't long before ‚Äì much to his amazement ‚Äì he makes some friends. One is a flamboyant gay kid named Patrick (Ezra Miller) who has a joke or a line for each and every occasion. He's the ever-present M.C. of his immediate surroundings. For a while, Patrick's overabundant personality seems one-note until late in the film when he begins to confide in Charlie some things about his own dark past that break his jolly facade. Miller is a good actor whose exuberant performance is a complete turnaround from the quiet, sullen killer that he played last year in We Need to Talk about Kevin.<br/><br/>The other is Patrick's half-sister Sam, played in a brilliant performance by Emma Watson whose presence still contains echoes of Hermione Granger. Once, Sam was the school slut, who got the attention of the boys by making herself an object of lust. Casting off that skin, she lives a cleaner life but now has to live with feelings of regret. She's not the typical Movie Girlfriend who has all the easy answers contained in a tender smile. She stirs the poetry in Charlie's soul, but she is afraid to move toward love. Sam is a particular human being, not a clich√©, the rare kind of teenager who seems to be waiting for something. She doesn't live in the moment but is always looking forward. She seems to be a victim of time itself, trapped in a body and an age that won't let her press forward fast enough. You can see the need in her eyes, a need to be somewhere else. That's probably why she is working so hard to get away from her past and into a good college. Watson's performance is a revelation. Her eyes and her body language speak the volumes. Sam is a fully realized soul, Watson deserves an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>The movie is not, however, completely somber and serious. It is also clever and funny, especially in a scene in which Charlie is pushed into a role at The Rocky Horror Picture show that puts him into the kind of contact with Sam's budding breasts of which he probably have few objections. Within his new circle of friends he finds himself attending an alarming number of high school parties, one of which has him sampling the host's fresh batch of brownies ‚Äì several in fact ‚Äì with predictable results. Charlie is nudged into experiences that few parents would agree with, but that Charlie will certainly never forget, no matter how hard he tries. The unique circle of friends also includes a sweet but cloying girl who will briefly become Charlie's first girlfriend. She is Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman) who has little interest in Charlie as a person, but more of an interest in just having a boyfriend. She quickly gets on his nerves and their relationship comes to a devastating conclusion that we don't expect.<br/><br/>The Perks of Being a Wallflower is unpredictable because it depends on the actions of the characters, both in the serious and the comic moments. They are written and acted with such specific detail that we can feel the even flow of their lives. There is drama, joy, heartbreaks, mistakes, misunderstandings, romance, laughter and revelations. It is a breath of fresh air to finally encounter a screenplay that lets the characters be human beings. It feels the joy and tragedy of the awkward passage of the teenage years. This is a film so smart about life that you find yourself nodding with recognition. It is one of the best films of the year."

","For years, ""Big Fish"" has been my favorite movie. Others have come close, I even had to make a pro and con list when I saw ""The Sandlot"" again a while back to compare the two. But none have matched Big Fish. I have read the book for Perks of Being a Wallflower years ago, and fell in love with it. Naturally, when the movie was announced I was a bit skeptical but when i Learned Mr. Chbosky, (the author) was writing and directing, I knew It would have to be something special. <br/><br/>I went to the midnight on the night of the 27th to see it after a year of heavy anticipation, and the moment it was over, I didn't even have to think about it, I knew that this was my new favorite movie. It embodied everything about the book perfectly, while only discarding a few things that I'm sure many will agree are fine being left out. The cast is by far the best part of the movie. When I learned Logan Lerman was attached I was annoyed because he didn't seem like someone who could maintain the frailty of Charlie. However, he created the most innocent, awkward, sad and adorable Charlie that i could have imagined. He was absolutely perfect, as were the scene stealing Ezra Miller as Patrick, and the absolutely beautiful Emma Watson as Sam.<br/><br/>I've seen it twice over the weekend, and plan on seeing it many times more, especially to continually re-watch the absolutely epic and nostalgic dance scene between Watson and Miller, (You'll know what I mean when you see it.) So I recommend this to anyone who has or has not read the book, and hope that it consumes your soul like it did mine."
"christophe92300","3","9","21","15 February 2013"," Badly clich√© movie
","Stephen Chbosky seemed to have wanted to distinguish himself with a more serious and reflective tone that one could have expected, but he ultimately delivers a sterilized and very linear feature that doesn't bother to rely on some of the worst teen movie clich√©s.<br/><br/>The script unfolds in a false rhythm for about an hour where every somewhat interesting scenes are followed by stereotyped and boring ones. Then, a profound boredom sets in for the last 30-35 minutes which turn out to be a real endless ordeal.<br/><br/>Moreover, Charlie's character, who can arouse empathy at the beginning, becomes more and more exasperating as the minutes go, not to downgrade Lerman's performance, impeccable in his role.

"Turfseer","3","18","50","22 September 2012"," Quirky high school student misfits placed on pedestal by film's misguided Writer/Director
","'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' is based on Writer/Director Steven Chbosky's 1999 novel of the same name. It actually would be better titled, 'The Perks of Being a Victim'. Set in 1991 Pittsburgh, 'Perks' is the coming of age story of 16 year old high school freshman 'Charlie', played by 20 year old actor, Logan Lerman.<br/><br/>Charlie the Wallflower is an introverted kid who feels ostracized on his first day of high school. It doesn't take long for Charlie to find a clique which he can fit into--a group of senior class 'Bohemian' types led by Patrick (Ezra Miller) and step-sister Sam (Emma Watson of Harry Potter fame). <br/><br/>Patrick is gay, carrying on a clandestine affair with one of the stars of the high school football team. When the shop teacher calls Patrick ""Patty"" and he responds, ""You can call me Patrick or nothing,"" the teacher pours coals on the fire by insulting him further by calling him ""nothing""(I had no idea that a school teacher would face no consequences for bullying a pupil in such a way--even in 1991!). <br/><br/>After all the baddies (mainly high school jocks) begin calling Patrick ""Nothing"", most of the rest of the kids in the school follow suit. 'Wallflower' Charlie, who also feels ostracized, ends up sticking up for perennial victim Patrick. Completely out of character (and with improbable superhuman strength), Charlie ends up knocking out half of the high school football team after they set upon Patrick in the school cafeteria (okay maybe I'm exaggerating--it wasn't half the team but notice that the awkward editing prevents us from actually seeing exactly how Charlie thwarts the entire assault on Patrick). <br/><br/>Chbosky's characters are no different than many other films that feature a coterie of quirky characters which Patrick refers to as the ""Island of Toy Misfits"". As is usual for these films involving a clique of quirky characters, they're pitted against an unsavory group of reactionaries (in this case, jocks, along with a bunch of young, belligerent allies). Of course you can count on the quirky kids to have some mild flaws, while the group that hates them, are all pretty unsavory and despicable. <br/><br/>What sets Chbosky's quirky misfits apart from other recent quirky characters of this ilk, is that their machinations are firmly ensconced in the era of the early 90s. If there is any charm in this heavy-handed film, it's all in the allusions to the pre-internet era. Do you remember 'Mixtapes'? The kids mix their favorite songs on cassette tapes and pass them around to each other. The quirky kids also have a penchant for the avant-garde--participating in live presentations during weekly screenings of 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show'.<br/><br/>Perhaps the central failing of 'Perks' is Chbosky's paper thin plot. Most of the film focuses on Charlie's puerile infatuation with Sam and all of that silly puppy love he has no desire to suppress. Why should we really care for Charlie's obsession with Sam, especially when her character is so poorly developed? Just about the only thing we learn about her is that she was molested as a child and raped by boys who get her drunk--events confirming her status as perennial victim).<br/><br/>There is also a comic sub-plot (few laughs!) involving Charlie's brief 'romance' with 'Mary Elizabeth', a Buddhist and vegan whose big mistake is to go out with a guy like Charlie, who is clearly obsessed with 'another woman' from the get go. Charlie's obsession is made clear during the 'truth or dare' scene where he kisses Sam on the lips in front of Mary Elizabeth (this elicited a gasp from the mostly teen-aged audience populating the theater I attended).<br/><br/>Obviously Charlie's one-note infatuation and the 'us vs. them' theme was not enough to carry an entire movie, so Chbosky had to throw in some cheap melodrama to tidy things up. I'm referring of course to Charlie's mental problems, stemming from the traumatic death of his aunt when he was a child and the purported sexual abuse he endured at the hands of said aunt before her said demise. After this 'setback' (where he joins hands as a full-fledged victim with his fellow sufferer, Patrick), he can now work his way 'back' to sanity and eventually pretentiously declare along with his fellow quirky misfits (with a straight face), ""we are infinite"" (as he stares up at the sky through the roof of Patrick and Sam's pickup, hurtling through a tunnel).<br/><br/>It's no accident that 'Perks' was produced by the very same people who gave us 'Juno', that revolting anti-abortion tearjerker. Nonetheless, 'Perks' is not a complete lost cause. Despite being acted by actors chronologically older than the high school students they portray, they uniformly do a pretty good job. Ezra Miller steals the show as the flamboyant Patrick and Paul Rudd is memorable as the sagacious and helpful English teacher. <br/><br/>I guarantee that all those who loved 'Perks' also loved 'Little Miss Sunshine'. Both promote the unhealthy idea of a coterie of quirky misfits who are superior to a group of stick-figure reactionaries pitted against them. By promoting this illusory dichotomy, Mr. Chbosky has done a disservice to true Bohemians everywhere--certainly such true libertarians do not perceive themselves as victims and would not like other misguided souls such as Mr. Chbosky, to impugn them with such a label."
"MaddieeA","3","6","13","14 August 2016"," Very disappointing adaptation
","Having just finished reading the book I thought I would buy the film as I absolutely loved it. I didn't realise I'd already caught the last 20 minutes about 6 weeks ago on TV. It's that different!!<br/><br/>I know when you're reading you make your own assumptions about what characters look and sound like, but the actors were nothing like how I pictured them in my head, even their speech. I imagined Charlie to be a heck of a lot more awkward than he really was. Emma Watson was definitely not my ""Sam"" and Patrick was so different, I really do agree with the people stating on here that he was too flamboyant in comparison to the book. I didn't find him (Patrick) as likable or approachable as a character as he was in the books, and I simply don't believe that Charlie would have felt as comfortable befriending him at the game in the book if he were the same way as in the film. <br/><br/>The whole film felt rushed and I thought certain pivotal scenes from the book were handled terribly, or missed altogether - EVERYTHING TO DO WITH HIS SISTER AND HER BOYFRIENDS?! The arguing in the car? Dad giving Charlie the sex talk? These would have made great viewing had it been done properly, if at all, and it's such a shame that these scenes weren't depicted in the film. <br/><br/>Stephen Chbosky said he turned down multiple offers for a film because he ""owed the fans a movie that was worthy of their love for the book."", but this certainly does not do it justice. It's not even the case that the film was set in the 90's and none of the characters are relatable because they're not walking around with headphones on and a phone taped to their hands (as with many teenagers the same age in this generation). It's small things, like the fact that they chose to have ""Heroes"" as the ""tunnel song"" instead of ""Landslide"" (which didn't work so wonderfully it was worth changing it in the first place).<br/><br/>Personally, I don't know how I'd feel about this film had I seen it first and then read the book, but I do know I can't be the only person thoroughly disappointed with how the film has turned out. I have given it a 3 because I love Paul Rudd as Mr Anderson."

The phrase that i mentioned in the title of my review, changed my life and my perception about all the things. Really did that!!
Like Charlie who felt a wallflower, i felt like this most part of my life and i regret of that. This film is much more than a simple high school movie, is real, is about how the people can be amazing with each other, the opposite also, unfortunately, and how to deal with this!!
Charlie, Sam and Patrick deliver such great performances and you related with that, you know? Is real problems, with real solutions. Is really impressive. 
In the end you feel as if you could face everything and everyone, accepted who you are and deal with the fear and the doubt of yourself. YOU FEEL INFINITE <3"
"pete-murphy97","3","3","5","25 January 2016"," The cons of being a wallflower
","Let's get right into the nitty-gritty. It has terribly wooden acting, a shallow and basic script that is wholly reliant on jump-cuts to fill in the gaping, disjointed gaps, and an agenda-pushing narrative that implies feminine men and dominant women in a relationship is a good thing: as biologically insane as that is. No doubt, 'liberal' people will be 'offended' by this; but the truth is unalterable, it's time to see this film for what it is; a facet of the big-money Rothschild-funded neo-feminist movement that is seriously damaging the congruity of organic society, it has the front-runner feminist Watson in it for Christ's sake. 'Charlie' (Logan Lermon, or something like that) develops rather barely as a character, by the end of the film he hasn't changed a notch, and to be quite honest I never resonated with him as a character. His buddy, whatnot, can't recall his name, ah yeah - Patrick, was nicely acted, and some other characters were decent as well. It had a basic plot that failed to captivate an audience that isn't new- wave millennial, pre-pubescent teenage girls. The end, avoid like the plague."
"TheSquiss","6","3","5","11 October 2012"," An imperfect but touching, thought-provoking film about discovery, sexuality, friendship and betrayal.
","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a strange little film that will likely divide audiences before they even reach the cinema. Writer/director Stephen Chbosky has a ready-made audience from his source novel and has credibility as the creator of TV series Jericho, but as a director he has just one previous big screen outing: 1995's little seen The Four Corners of Nowhere. In front of the camera there is little in the way of star power though both male leads have some impressive films on their CVs: Logan Lerman has ably supported bigger names in the likes of 3:10 to Yuma and starred in Percy Jackson and the Lightening Thief while Ezra Miller positively chilled the world as the titular sociopath in We Need to Talk About Kevin.<br/><br/>So it falls to the biggest name amongst the principal stars, Emma Watson, to woo the audiences. And therein lies the division. Watson has physically appeared on the big screen in nine films prior to this, eight of which were as Hermione Granger. If you've never watched a Harry Potter film, your only cinematic reference to date is a brief appearance in the fine My Week With Marilyn. If you're one of the countless millions who have watched the wizard series you'll either recall her acting ability evolved from 'not terribly good' to 'passable' or you're still under fourteen years of age.<br/><br/>The first thirty minutes of The Perks of Being a Wallflower verge on arduous, largely due to Watson, playing Sam, the older woman to Lerman's Charlie. She tries so damn hard to act, to be noticed, to be American, to earn our respect but succeeds only in looking like a child who has raided her mum's wardrobe but is ten years too young to carry it off and ten years too old to still look cute. For thirty minutes I watched a film that barely warranted two stars and I groaned inwardly at the thought I chose this over Anna Karenina.<br/><br/>Then something happened. Or rather, nothing in particular happened but Watson relaxed into Sam, The Perks of Being a Wallflower found its feet and I realized I was watching an imperfect but touching, thought-provoking film about discovery, sexuality, friendship and betrayal. And, shockingly, that Emma Watson has the makings of being a reasonably good actress. Once she relaxes, her performance is tender and Sam's desperation is palpable.<br/><br/>Charlie is an introverted freshman with little self-confidence who writes letters to his only friend: a friend who committed suicide. Faced with the challenge of college, Charlie begins his first day with desperate hope for change and concludes it counting down the days until graduation. Life sucks, the bullies spot him a mile away and his only escape is through the books his English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd), inspires him with until he is adopted by a group of misfits in their final year headed by Sam and her stepbrother, Patrick (Miller).<br/><br/>Miller stands out with a performance that is a world apart from Kevin. As Patrick he is a maelstrom of emotions in a fragile body that wears gregariousness like armour. He is judgmental, forgiving, joyful, depressed, delightful and as annoying as hell. Patrick is damaged goods. And that's why he and Sam are more than stepsiblings. And that's why Charlie fits right in. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a film for all of us who felt like we were on the outside trying desperately to make someone notice we were hammering on the door to be let in. It's also a film for all of those who were enjoying the party and decided to ignore the banging.<br/><br/>The trailer implies a sweet, humorous college flick but it doesn't portray the various shades of darkness within the characters. Everyone has a side they turn away from the crowd and Chbosky, after a faltering start, rotates every character so the dark side faces the camera, if only fleetingly. He writes and directs like a chess player (no, not a grandmaster, but that may come) lulling us into a false sense of security with something sweet or cheerfully twee and then he kicks us hard, square in the balls and we gasp at this new revelation.<br/><br/>For some viewers there are great twists and turns, but most will watch as the characters slowly unfurl and reveal more of what is hidden deep inside and not see each new disclosure as a shock but as another jigsaw piece to reveal the full picture.<br/><br/>There were no tears, no huge lumps in my throat and too much damage was done in the first 30 minutes to elevate The Perks of Being a Wallflower above six stars but it is a good film, particularly after the event as the story remains very much in mind.<br/><br/>I had intended to make it the first in a double bill with Sinister but such was the effect on me that I opted not to pollute my state of mind with something harsh and lacking in sensitivity, instead preferring a slow drive through dark country lanes home to a warm cottage to where I could let the story filter through in its own time.<br/><br/>Another film review from The Squiss.<br/><br/>Like the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG"

","Wow. This movie is terrible. They are acting like this is how every teenagers life is like. I am a teenager and I cannot relate to this movie one bit. I hated it. The main character is such a pushover. His ""friends"" tell him to drugs, and he just does it. Because he just wants to fit in. His guy best friend kisses him and he just acts like it's fine, but it's not. The main character is not gay, so another boy does not need to be kissing him. I hate this movie, and I always will.

"oneillconnor","9","4","8","24 May 2013"," Very surprising
","As I downloaded this film from iTunes, I didn't have great expectations for it but thought it would be a fun watch to pass some time. After only a few minutes I was drawn in and immersed in a rich cast and story.<br/><br/>The movie not only follows the main character through his social life, but also through his thoughts as he struggles with a problematic childhood memory which, for me, made the film. The flashbacks give an amazing view of the character and help to define his personality and make him very human to the point I could relate very well.<br/><br/>Through the highs and lows of the detailed times, the viewer is swept through emotions with the character. I, personally, finished the film on the verge of crying a mixture of tears of sadness and joy.<br/><br/>The casting is absolutely perfect and I cannot imagine anyone better to play the parts, which heavily supports the story and makes the characters more 'real'.<br/><br/>This is a must watch film for everyone out there."
"tqkproductions","3","4","8","17 April 2013"," The Perks of Being a Quirky White Dork
","Oh Brother. At the beginning of this movie the only thing I knew was that Perks is about a group of quirky white underdogs. Turns out, I didn't need to watch the entire 102 minute long film to find out that I have been right in my assumption the entire time. Perks has this way of throwing together tropes and clich√©s together in such a way that, if this movie was a pizza and the tropes were toppings then you would send this right back and whoever made it would have been fired (I'm afraid we have to let you go, Chbosky. Hand in your visor and apron by the end of the week).<br/><br/>I will say that Ezra Miller gives probably the best performance of the film. Logan Lerman is too busy slowly taking a soft bowel movement throughout the entire film to try giving a passable performance and Emma Watson is too focused on trying to not sound like a British person doing an offensively poor American accent. Ezra's character Patrick has probably the most interesting storyline out of the whole damn movie. Unfortunately, the small amount of screen time he gets is a testament to how little Chbosky really knows about how to craft a story or write about gay kids.<br/><br/>And then there's Emma. God help her, she's trying, but her American accent fluctuates from ""Passable"" to ""You're not even trying."" But I guess when you do eight movies where you have to talk in an over pronounced British accent trying to ditch it would be difficult. The character of Sam itself is rather plain. The character has a bit of a back story of being promiscuous, but we never really go into it. She worries about getting a good SAT score for a bit, but then she does. She finds out her boyfriend was cheating on her, but their break-up scene is mentioned to us and never seen. Yeah you know that rule of Tell don't Show, right? Sam is honestly a dull dull character that could have at least been a Manic Pixie Dream Girl, but unfortunately Chbosky couldn't even drum up enough excitement for that.<br/><br/>The supporting cast sure is... there. I won't even spend time on Charlie's family because spoiler: they're all boring. I will say that I feel bad for Mae Whitman. I think she's being typecast as ""boring white girl"" thanks to Arrested Development. Her character, Mary Elizabeth, is one of Sam & Patrick's friends. She ends up dating Charlie for about, let's say ten minutes. She ends up being a terrible girlfriend! At least, she's terrible enough so that you wouldn't feel bad for her when Charlie kisses Sam right in front of her! I still don't really know the point of Mary Elizabeth, although I did like her hair. Props to the Hair Department for doing an alright job. Other performances that actually stand out are Johnny Simmons as Closeted Gay Kid Brad and Paul Rudd as Cool English Teacher¬ô Mr. Anderson. The rest of the cast you could easily swap out for cardboard cut-outs and I would not be the wiser.<br/><br/>I focus on the characters and not the story because there is barely a story to begin with. Loser White Kid has no friends & repressed childhood. He meets quirky white individuals and fits in, deals with his repressed memories, falls in love. The end. Really this movie could have been an hour twenty minutes, tops. However, the story takes so many twists and turns and stretches the line in between Point A and Point B to the point where the line's almost about to snap. There's a large amount of scenes somewhere in the middle that we could easily do without, including any scene where Charlie takes drugs. Whoa! Charlie just took LSD and now he's... shoveling. And he said the tree was a dragon. Crazy stuff. Don't do drugs kids, or ya might shovel snow and then fall asleep! Scary stuff.<br/><br/>I'll wrap this up. ""Perks"" is a tired, boring mess of a film. The principal cast can barely force the boring lines about punk rock and cult movies out of their mouths while the supporting cast could be replaced by mannequins. The conflict of Charlie's repressed memories is overly dramatic to the point where it feels like I'm watching an After School Special at times.<br/><br/>Really, I can see how most people love this movie. It's about the white teen feeling at his most oppressed: Nobody understands him and they all laugh at him for reading books! Oh No! If it weren't for Cool English Teacher¬ô Paul Rudd I don't know what Charlie would have done. I kid you not, at one point one of Charlie's fellow classmates says ""Nice Trapper Keeper, f****t."" Of course I'd like to blame author Stephen Chbosky for this, since not only did he write the screen play but he also directed the movie. Good to know he got a lot of outside opinions then. Nah, I kid, Stephen Chbosky is great. I mean, who else could have written Rent as blandly as he could have? Well, Ryan Murphy I guess, but that's beside the point!<br/><br/>In conclusion, We accept the Infinite we think we swear in this moment. White People Rule."

","Imagine yourself on the eve of your first day of high school. If you'd prefer not to, I get it, believe me. What if you'd just been released from the hospital? Do you really think you could rebound from that?<br/><br/>Charlie (played by Logan Lerman), is a quiet, introspective teenager who has recently suffered a setback, the full nature of which we're not informed of, and is about to start his freshman year of high school. The only friend he makes on his first day is his English teacher, Bill Anderson (played by Paul Rudd). Rather than worry his parents, (played by Dylan McDermott and Kate Walsh) Charlie gives the typical, one-syllable description of his first day of high school. Time passes and Charlie becomes friends with step-siblings Sam and Patrick. Sam (played by former Harry Potter actress Emma Watson) is an outgoing senior dating a college guy and her step-brother Patrick (played by Ezra Miller) is a flamboyant underachiever with a great sense of humor. They attend a football game together and follow that with a visit to a diner before driving Charlie home. The next function they attend as a group is a party where Charlie, unknowingly, ingests a pot brownie. It is during this moment of drug-fueled confidence that Charlie reveals to Sam the fact that he lost a friend to suicide one year ago. After quietly relaying that fact to Patrick, he and Sam both decide then and there that Charlie should become a full-fledged member of their group. Moments later, Charlie bears witness to a romantic encounter between Patrick and his closeted boyfriend, star football player Brad (played by Johnny Simmons). They leave the party, go for a drive, and hear a song that inspires Sam to stand in the bed of the pickup truck and stretch out her arms as they drive through a tunnel. This is when Charlie first develops romantic feelings for Sam which she is completely unaware of. <br/><br/>There's a lot to like about this film. Miller and Watson's characters are both very endearing and their decision to adopt fellow outcast Charlie is a moment that brings hope for the character and life in general. There are elements I believe the film could do without. Examples include the one-sided relationship between two of the characters and the references to The Rocky Horror Picture Show, which never resonated with me the way it seems to with others. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it greatly and encourage others to see it at their earliest possible convenience."
"Ellison-shea","10","4","8","9 November 2012"," 3 reasons
","Emotional, well thought, and revolutionary are three words that describe the film based off the acclaimed novel by Stephen Chewbosky. The movie The Perks of Being A Wallflower is the most true based, realistic movie of this generation. Not only will this movie bring you to the edge of your seat, but it will also make you feel a personal connection to the characters. <br/><br/>Specifically, I think the perks of being a wallflower is worth the time and money to see is because of my own personal connection to Charlie (played by Logan Lerman). Throughout the story, Charlie deals with many hardships with his family, and newly found friends. For example, Charlies aunt was killed in a car accident on the way to buy his birthday present when he was a young boy. Throughout my own life, I have already dealt with situations that are unforgettable, such as my aunt getting cancer. Also, in the 8th grade, Charlie's good friend committed suicide. This affected Charlies personality deeply, and the way he acted around his peers.In the 7th grade, my friend was killed by bone marrow cancer, and the impact it had on me affected me as it did Charlie. The character of Sam (Emma Watson) also connected to my own life. Sam was on of the two seniors, the other being Patrick, who befriend Charlie when they meet at the homecoming football game? As soon as Charlie sees Sam, he falls in love with her. Sam believed that love never truly worked out for anyone, as did I. After breaking up with her boyfriend, Sam presents Charlie with a truly puzzling question. ""Why does I, and everyone, love the people who treat us like we're nothing?"" And Charlie answers ""we accept the love we think we deserve."" If we think low of ourselves, we are going to accept people who use us and don't love is for who we really are, but if we love ourselves, we can love others and treat them with higher regard. <br/><br/>In addition, the realism throughout the film is what contributes to the beauty of the storyline. The way that Charlie deals with everything he sees is very realistic. Some people, When they see things occurring, they don't know what to do, so they just stand by and observe. That's what Charlie had been doing for some while since his friend died. Then, when he found people who let him in, he began to open up. At a party Patrick gives a toast to Charlie. In it he states, ""He's a wallflower. You see things. You keep quiet about them. And you understand."" It is in this moment that Charlie feels noticed, and completely happy for having friends. This movie also shows the real importance it is to have friends. Before Patrick and Sam, Charlies door was closed, and he refuses to let anyone in. Then, when he gained them as friends, he began to open up to the world, and he enjoyed it. Additionally, this film shows the realisticness of how people judge each other. Charlie's group of friends is judged for being freaks because they are not popular. Charlie is also labeled as a freak because he does not participate in activities. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, people may oppose to see this movie. It is rated Pg-13, and many parents feel that they do not want their child to be exposed to the subjects the film discusses. I think that the film is appropriate for kids over 13, as it was rated. The film discusses things like death, personal relationships, teenagers being gay, and even rape. Although this film includes these topics, I think the film is worth seeing for teens. If parents try to hide their son or daughter from these things that occur everyday, they won't be prepared for real life on their own. <br/><br/>Moreover, this story is recognized for its great script. The literature Charlie's uses as he writes portrays exactly how he feels as he writes. As Charlie was discussing his earlier trip to go sleeping he writes ""And I thought that all those little kids are going to grow up someday. And all of those little kids are going to do the things that we do. And they will all kiss someone someday. But for now, sledding is enough. I think it would be great if sledding were always enough, but it isn't."" This excerpt shows the literature and choice of writing the author uses. The film is also portrayed almost exact from the novel. I think that is part of the reason why this film did very well. The film was directed by Stephen Chewbosky, who also wrote the novel. <br/><br/>Not only will this movie change the way you view life, but it will change the way you treat your own friends and family. Also, the people around you. You never know anyone story until they tell you, and you can't judge them until you walk a mile in their shoes. We could all use our own thoughts as an excuse to not participate, but we should choose not to. ""Because things change. Friends leave. And life doesn't stop for anybody."" We should be happy, and appreciate what we have and live for the moments that make us feel alive. As Charlie states in his own moment of pure happiness "" in that moment, I swear we were infinite."""
"axelrose587","10","4","8","8 November 2012"," Best film of 2012... In my opinion.
","Every decade has their coming-of-age story. People of the sixties had The Last Picture Show, seventies had American Graffiti, eighties had Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles, and the only thing I can think of that the nineties had was She's All That. And now my generation of teenagers has Perks of Being a Wallflower. Based on the coming-of-age novel, which I haven't read, the movie follows Charlie, played by the guy from Percy Jackson, and his trials and tribulations of being a freshman in high school. He then meets Patrick, who I swear is a gay version of me, and his sister in law, Sam, played by Emma Watson (Harry Potter). This is an interesting blend of a lighter beat era film mixed with The Last Picture Show. It shows just how naive Charlie is going into high school. Like eating pot brownies, feeling awkward in different environments, and just being a wallflower a lot of the time. He find someone he loves and doesn't really know how to handle it because he's never loved before. He knows he loves her but doesn't know how to tell her and doesn't really know how to react when he dates somebody who he doesn't love. All three of the characters go through the usual mishaps in high school. Patrick is in love with the school's quarterback and they have a secret relationship because they are afraid that the people they love will resent them. It's a sad thing to have to live with being gay and I understand what he's going through. Then Sam is very promiscuous, always getting drunk and sleeping with men. When she finds love and then have it ripped away at the end, you feel heart broken for her because you love these characters by the end and you want to see them lead a good life in college. There's a line in the movie that perfectly sums up this movie, and life in high school. ""Why do I, and everyone I love, pick people who treat us like we're nothing?"" And the answer is, ""We accept the love we think we deserve."" That speaks volumes because I actually know people who feels like this. It's amazing just how right this movie is. I do understand gays being shunned in school, and feeling awkward around a group of people, and having people treat you like we are nothing. I've never seen a movie where I feel a little bit like all of the characters. The performances are strong, the music is awesome, and you walk out of the theater knowing that no matter how bad life may feel in high school, it'll all be better in 1460 days."

Let me begin with the bad..<br/><br/>Cinematography: WTF?! The camera work is college student level at best. And apparently the focus on their camera was broken or Barbara Walters was controlling it. They couldn't make a more out of focus blurry movie without covering the lens in vaseline. <br/><br/>Directing: Was there a director? Shouldn't the director have caught the above mentioned camera issues? Or perhaps the indeterminate time-frame of the movie? Supposedly 91 or 92? Yet crackers ""low"" was released in 93.. and is in the movie. As a director he could have repaired A lot of the horrible writing on the fly. In the scene where brad says to Charlie ""thanks for stopping them"" And they left that hanging? They could have had Charlie just reply ""you should have stopped them, not me"" something along those lines.. a MUCH better ending to that. Moving on...<br/><br/>Writing: Boring bad dialog.. Emma Watson saying ""shag"" at the football game.. i have never heard one single American kid use shag in the context she did there.. it would have been screw or bang.. never shag. <br/><br/>Although there are some bright spots in the writing.. The ""i wish one of us had cancer so i wouldn't have to deal with this breakup"" (para- phrasing) Is awesome and i will be using it.. Oh.. and Emma Watson being a ""wallflower,outcast"" type kid.. please.. really? How bout stuck up snobby broad banging the football team. Bad casting, but thats just my opinion..<br/><br/>And WTF is with Charlie shoveling snow in a small circle? in reallllly poorly done fake snow.. Also. a house like that with a 6 car garage and hes using a hand shovel to clear the driveway? Um... NO... <br/><br/>By the end i was praying for Emma Watson to catch a low bridge when she was doing her titanic flying scene in the back of the truck... Nothing against her.. just would have made the movie much more interesting.<br/><br/>I Realize i am not near the demographic that this movie was made for, I am assuming its for 13 year old shut-ins with mental issues and IQ's hovering well below triple digits. <br/><br/>P.S. If they had ended the movie with Charlie eating a gun and the screen just goes black i would have liked this movie MUCH MUCH more.. but as every movie made now has to have all strings tied up and everyone lives happily ever after. we get what we get.<br/><br/>Sorry for rambling.. still reeling from this being in my brain for the rest of my life."

","You will hate this movie. There's no question about it. You will hate it because you will find it stupid and/or boring... or you will hate it because you relate to it so much. In the case of the second one, the hatred will be caused by the disconnection from reality as real life is rarely this perfect for an introvert. <br/><br/>If you're neither, then I find not point for you watching this. It's well made and rather well acted, however relating to this, adds so damn much that regular watching might just seem stupid. <br/><br/>I've watched it a couple of times and it's true on all levels... even the awkwardness. No complains from me, but then again, I am a light critic.<br/><br/>I have to give this movie one thing for sure... it does capture the mind quite perfectly. Our mind is the biggest source of our troubles and this movie shows it quite nicely."

","The Perks of being a Wallflower is about a teenage boy named Charlie that has had a rough life and writes letters to someone but doesn't tell us who there for. He is in high school and ready to make new friends. Through the past years he has experience harsh things like his best friend's and aunt's death. He meets great friends throughout high school. He falls in love with his friend Sam. But, things get bad. Somehow eventually he always overcomes this problems. At the end of the movie he found out something terrible, he had gotten rapped by his aunt. After going through therapy and with the help of this friends and family he got better.<br/><br/>There were five main characters to this story. The first character is named Charlie. He is the main character and the person writing the letters. Patrick is another main character he is Charlie's friend. He is gay and in a relationship with someone that hasn't came out yet about his sexuality. Patrick goes through rough times because of this relationship. The third main character is named Sam. She is Patrick's stepsister. Charlie falls in love with her, but she doesn't pay attention to him. She has a boyfriend who at the end of the story ends up cheating on her. The four character is Charlie sister. She is treated badly by her boyfriend, but never did anything about it. The last character is named Mary Elizabeth. She becomes Charlie's girlfriend, but Charlie never did like her. She is self centered and arrogant. I like the actors very much. They all had an important role in the story. They all had me engaged in the story and were all very much different from each other.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the film when Charlie gets better at the end. Charlie gets really bad and was about to hurt himself. He goes through therapy to help him get better from what his Aunt Helen did to him. I like how the story had a happy ending and the everything got better.<br/><br/>I liked the book more than the film. In the book it gave much more details on what's happening. Like when Charlie gets in a fight in the beginning of the story. Also when Charlie's sister gets pregnant and she gets an abortion. A something that happened in the movie and not the book was when Charlie and Sam kissed before Sam left for college.<br/><br/>In a scale from 1-5 stars I would give this movie a 4. I would because it could have had much more detail. Also the characters like Sam wasn't the same as described in the book. Other than that I thought this movie was really good and I really enjoyed watching it."

","I got this movie recommended by a girl in my media class and after seeing that it got a pretty good rating i decided to give it a chance. The movie takes on some pretty big issues/themes as sexual abuse, drug and how tough it is to be a teenager, but i feel like we don't get to reach through the surface and are only briefly introduced to these things which makes it kinda ""meh"" And i love ""me and earl and the dying girl"" but this movie just didn't get the same emotions through, it had great potential to be one of my all time favorites but it kinda slips several times. 6/10 because i liked the theme and it was slightly above average"
"kruash","6","2","3","3 November 2015"," I didn't find too many perks to being a wallflower
","Many who watch this movie are in love with this movie, judging by its ratings and reviews, however I did not find it very memorable. Perhaps this is because the main character annoys me. Looking back on high school I realise how difficult children and teens make it out to be however I think it is probably more difficult to not make any friends than it is to make friends. When he decides to bravely go and sit next to Patrick (played by Ezra Miller) he was easily accepted and Patrick welcomed him with open arms. I also find many of these characters very flamboyant and theatrical and the friendships seemed a little bit fake and only seen in movies.<br/><br/>On the alternative, I do feel this movie is capable of giving hope to many teenagers. Many feel alone and introverted at school and this movie shows that it is not difficult to make friends at school, however do not mess it up like he does at one point in the movie. Other lessons we gain from this film is to follow your heart, however the fact that movies always portray a happy ending to love stories is not always the case in real life and therefore need to be careful.<br/><br/>Even though I felt Patrick was very over the top and a very rare character to find in real life, I loved him. I loved the care free attitude he had, his confidence he had in himself and the advice he gives main actor Charlie. Patrick is a homosexual this movie portrays a stereotypical way gays act. I do feel that it was necessary to portray him this way as we love Patrick in this movie and perhaps society will subconsciously start accepting gays more into society."

","After reading the book and enjoying it, this movie was extremely disappointing and felt like a misrepresentation of the original work<br/><br/>First off the relationship between Charlie and his Aunt wasn't nearly showcased enough and every relating event up to the reveal at the ending was far to vague to awaken any emotion. Helen was his best friend, and that was one of the most important details. All the dark and troubling feelings, and the real anxiety that Charlie went through (like the lsd come down, the depression after the Mary Elizabeth breakup, and so on) were just left out or underplayed.<br/><br/>Charlie felt very distant and more of a generic boy rather than the intelligent but deeply troubled person he is portrayed as in the book.<br/><br/>The relationship between Bill and Charlie was oversimplified as well. the dialogue between them at bill's played a pretty big part in the revaluation at the end and that was completely cut. they were also just kinda awkward together in the movie.<br/><br/>The scene where Charlie and Patric laugh their asses off from the picnic story was cut as well, which is a shame.<br/><br/>Everything that made the book so interesting was sucked out until we're left with a skeleton in the shape of ""The perks of being a wallflower"" but the content being just words here and there and some of the pretty quotes.<br/><br/>Read the book!"

The cast in this film is so delightful and they are all equally unique and interesting will real problems and real emotion. Everyone has a story, a problem and a relationship which you just get sucked into caring about.<br/><br/>Cinematography:
The shots are all great and have plenty of meaningful scenes with foreshadowing and symbolism. A real joy watching some scenes.<br/><br/>Story:
This is obviously based on a book and similar to the Harry Potter books I believe this one is replicated well. I love all the characters and quirky scenes they have as well as the sweet/emotional scenes that leave you immersed in the story and relating from real life expierences you may of had.<br/><br/>Summary:
Overall I would highly recommend this film if you enjoy dramas or character driven stories. It's a real treat and in my opinion one of the most compelling movies out there."

So when it comes to films which appeal to the casual consumer, I am not always a big fan. Movies have to do a great job to please me. <br/><br/>Having said all that, this film BLEW ME AWAY!!!<br/><br/>I expected this film to be a very by-the-numbers kind of film and it was anything but. The acting was incredible. The lead actor in particular was stunning, as was the performance of the other actors. <br/><br/>The story was also surprising and contained a few twists which I did not see coming. Also the actors portrayed characters we've all seen in our schools. This air of familiarity gives this coming-of-age story a vibrancy very few movies have. I also think the fact that the film was directed by the author of the book it is based on did it huge favours.<br/><br/>The film was nostalgic, witty and, most of all, courageous in handling it's subject-matter. I loved every second of it and have seen the film at least 3 times since it was released. The film may seem like your average high school movie but it has layers and layers of depth.<br/><br/>I think this is a PERFECT FILM and definitely warrants a place in my top 10 films of all time.

","I just watched this movie for the first time. At first I thought it looked like some clich√© high school movie. Of course, twenty and nearly-30-yr-olds play teens, which is rather unrealistic. (I'm still in high school and NO ONE has that nice of a complexion!) I continued to watch as Charlie, played by Logan Lerman, struggles to find friends. I also thought that was silly because this guy is very handsome and he definitely WOULD have friends, even if they'd only use him for his looks. So far, it seems like I hated it. Well, Emma Watson and some other dude befriend Charlie and from then on, the story bursts with passion, confusion, secrets, lust, and a wonderfully brilliant message about ""misfit"" teens. I cried at least 3 times throughout this-- granted, I was very exhausted today--but it contained honest humor and emotional connections. I would have given this a 10/10, but ""White Chicks"" takes first place. Either way, this movie is incredible and I recommend to everyone."
"gradyharp","10","5","12","26 February 2013"," 'We accept the love we think we deserve.'
","Major question: why did this perfectly crafted, intelligently written and acted, touching little film not get nominated for an Oscar? It has all the ingredients of one of the finest films of the year - script based on the writer's own novel by the same name and directed by him, too - Stephen Chbosky - and a superb cast of young actors (and some excellent veteran actors such as Joan Cusack and Dylan McDermot and Paul Rudd, all playing against the slot roles into which others have stuck them), and makes many points about teenage angst and how the schism between teenagers and adults has become a chasm rarely navigable. But, as in current terminology, 'go figure!'<br/><br/>Very briefly, the story set in the early 1990s in Pittsburgh is about 15-year-old Charlie (20 year old Logan Lerman), an endearing and na√Øve outsider, coping with first love, the suicide of his best friend, and his own mental illness while struggling to find a group of people with whom he belongs. The introvert freshman is taken under the wings of two seniors, Sam (22 year old Emma Watson) and Patrick (19 year old Ezra Miller), who are step-siblings and welcome him to the real world. Into this m√©nage enter Brad (Johnny Simmons), the football hero who happens to be a deeply closeted gay boy in an affair with the openly gay Patrick, Charlie's sister Candace (Nina Dobrey) and her abusive boyfriend Ponytale Derek (Nicholas Braun), Charlie's parents (Dylan McDermott and Kate Walsh), the influential English teach Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd) and the psychiatrist Dr. Burton (Joan Cusack).<br/><br/>The story is complex as Charlie writes to his 'friend' and slowly reveals the secrets of his background that make him a loner 'who finds loneliness unbearable, a friend who feels his friends deserve better than they get but cannot bring himself to feel that he does too. He can rise fiercely to the occasion when his friends are threatened but is as fragile as glass when the secrets he carries buried deep inside threaten to overwhelm him.' The manner in which each of the characters change in the course of this story manages to be at once credible as well as entertaining. This is a deeply touching film that deserves a very wide audience. One of the finest films of 2012. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","Wow. I wait all year long for the release of movies like this one that are headed for the awards season.<br/><br/>The ""Perks of Being A Wallflower"" has so much about it that was right and excellent it is hard to know where to start. Steven Chbosky adapted his novel into the fine script. His direction was also excellent. Logan Lerman plays a 16-year-old turning 17. A freshman in high school who is recovering from some traumatic event which causes him to experience flashbacks.<br/><br/>The film takes us to high school in the 1980s, and the soundtrack revisits the music of the era. Music is integral to the characters as Logan's character, Charlie, creates mixes on cassettes for his friends. Charlie struggles to breathe in the claustrophobic world of high school, where he is alone, alienated and introverted. He finds two seniors who are odd ducks, and they form an immediate and intimate bond.<br/><br/>Charlie reminds us of Salinger's Holden Caulfiend, a sensitive, observant youth from the 1950s. The film cuts as deeply into the minds of these eighties kids, as did ""The Catcher in the Rye"" for an earlier generation.<br/><br/>Funny and sad. The acting is terrific.

You may think it's just another stupid teen romance- but think again. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a really moving and inspirational movie for teens; every person can get something different out of it. It really depicts many issues that teens face today and does it in such a stunning and wonderful way I just may have to see it again. The actors were astounding in playing their roles, and it really added to the overall effect that was put on the film. I'd definitely recommend this movie hands down, go out and see it!"

","""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" brings us back to the early 1990s, telling us the story of a smart but problematic high school freshman, Charlie (Logan Lerman). His spends his days simply avoiding everyone else, until he was accepted by seniors/half-siblings, Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson) into their circle of oddball friends.<br/><br/>With them, Charlie is drawn into the teen experience and actually gets to do things which up to then he had only been a viewer from the sidelines. With Sam, Charlie experiences his first love, but of course, as films like this go, it will not be as simple as that.<br/><br/>Logan Lerman does a redux of his role as Percy Jackson, a troubled teenager. However, this time he is a normal human being, not a son of Poseidon. This guy can really turn on the angst. He reminded me of a young John Cusack of the 80s or Paul Rudd of the 90s. In fact, since Paul Rudd plays Charlie's favorite teacher, their conversations looked like Paul talking to his younger self. Being some sort of a teenage wallflower myself back in the day, I can feel his pain. This is one very sensitive actor, and I look forward to more movies of this guy.<br/><br/>Emma Watson, we were all excited to see graduate from her days as Hermione Granger. And she certainly does here, playing a girl who had been taken advantage of by men and boys with she had relationships in the past and even the present. You can really feel why Charlie got attracted to her free spirit, yet unable to express how he really feels for her. Emma fulfills the promise she had as an actress who grew up in front of all of us. She will be a force to reckon with in awards seasons to come.<br/><br/>Watching this as an adult and a parent now, I wonder how the experience will be for my kids growing up into their own teen years. Watching Dylan McDermott and Kate Walsh play Charlie's parents, not knowing why their precious son behaved that way he did. It gives us pause to know our own kids more, and hope that they do not keep major life-altering secrets from us. <br/><br/>More than the scenes at school, I enjoyed the scenes about their togetherness as a family. I liked the scenes where siblings took time to talk and relate to each other, knowing when one needed help. There are many tiny lessons here and there in this film which viewers can get life lessons from. I can imagine so many people identify with this movie on various levels."

"seif-borgi","10","3","6","17 March 2013"," Beautiful drama behind its classic teen-movie looks
","The Perks of Being a Wallflower made the top list of my personal favorites for 2013. Even though the movie was preceded by rather favorable criticism, I didn't expect to be taken away as I was. I must say that while reading the synopsis, this is typically the kind of movies that you have the impression of having already seen dozens of times. Except that for once, it stands wonderfully unique. And this is mainly because the nostalgia of the transition to adulthood was beautifully transcribed on the screen. Everyone can easily relate to the main character, Charlie, whether today's teenagers living precisely these experiences or those of yesterday who wistfully remember these golden years. The movie was not exempt from flaws. Starting with the clich√©s that were still relatively high. However, unlike other movies of the same genre, these clich√©s did not really matter because of the high affecting realism of the story and the characters.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the story draws its strength from the characters. First we have Charlie who turns out to be much more complex than he looks like at the beginning, especially with his morbid emotional wounds. The character was beautifully played by Logan Lerman. His acting really moved me and he makes it hard to imagine someone else playing the role. This is by far his best performance.<br/><br/>Sam and Patrick then were the first to truly accept Charlie in their group. Emma Watson and Ezra Miller were perfect. After a small role in My Week With Marilyn, Emma Watson, without her English accent, succeeded to deliver an outstanding performance in her first major role after Harry Potter's lovely Hermione. Ezra Miller keeps setting the bar higher for himself in every one of his movies. This was obviously his best performance so far. He brought life to the picture. The chemistry between actors was clearly there and Stephen Chbosky did an amazing job in his first time directing a movie, adapting his own book.<br/><br/>Finally, I would like to say a word about the soundtrack. It enhanced the 80's and 90's atmosphere in the movie and added a profound emotional background to it.<br/><br/>Ultimately, The Perks of Being A Wallflower is a beautiful drama carried by a great trio of actors. Behind its classic teen-movie looks, the movie evokes emotions and intelligence with nostalgia. A real must-see!"

","Perks of Being a Wallflower has been getting rave reviews and lots of buzz since its release. The genre of youth trying to find themselves is tricky as it can be pretty generic, horribly bad or something great, but it depends on a great story and a cast to carry it in the right direction. This film sports a great cast with Logan Lerman of the Percy Jackson films, Ezra Miller of We Need To Talk About Kevin, and Emma Watson from the Harry Potter franchise, but does it live up to the hype? <br/><br/>The Perks of Being A Wallflower follows a young man coping with mental illness, first love, and personal tragedy while trying to step out of the shadows to find a group he can belong too. When he is taken under the wing two seniors his life makes a dramatic turn into the real world. Not only does this film live up to the hype it goes above and beyond it. Unlike most coming of age films, this one has depth to it that was really unexpected. This young cast delivers brilliant performances and has great chemistry together creating a memorable and emotionally charged film about real life instead of the normal up beat imaginary world of Hollywood. Watson steps out of the shadows of the Harry Potter films as not only a beautiful woman, but as a great actress that is sure to continue to light the industry on fire. Lerman and Miller take on their characters with the tortured personalities that push them to the forefront of this film giving it that dark yet sometime light tone that it needs. At first this film feels like your average teen drama, but takes some pretty unexpected dark twists and turns through these characters lives that will surely tug at your emotions on every level. In addition to the great story and brilliant performances all around, the visual style of this film adds to the overall ambiance of the characters themselves and the journey they are on.<br/><br/>Besides the great leads, this film also sports a great supporting cast including Paul Rudd, Tom Savini, Dylan McDermott, and Kate Walsh. This is one of those films that while it garnered well deserved praise, still didn't get the credit it deserved. This is one that should have gotten a wider release and recognition for everyone involved. If you haven't seen this film you need to check it out as soon as you can. There is something for every person here and a message of growth and struggle that needs to be heard."

","The movie has great performances. And anyone renting it is admittedly interested in seeing a coming of age movie - clich√©s and all. So, my problem? This movie is fine at being a modern adaptation of ""pretty in pink,"" but when it tries to proffer depth, it goes heavy, and, frankly, it does not do this well. (Serious spoilers ahead) the film broaches the suicide of his best friend, by a chance comment he makes while high on marijuana- this dominoes into everyone adopting him as a Freshman buddy. But that's all we ever hear of the death of his best friend. The narrative revolves around him writing to a friend, but a friend never identified. Then we move on to an incestuous sexual abuse. This topic, worthy of its own 2 hour movie, is dealt with in the last 12 minutes of the movie, as a psychologically debilitating secret. But what about his dead best friend mentioned 30 minutes earlier? How can we empathize with one emotionally crippling tragedy when the other is just casually tossed aside? It almost seemed inept to pile on one tragedy after another, artificial and postured. Maybe that's why pretty in pink was just better as a genre film: It knew when enough was enough."

","Weird. I love coming of age films, but I thought this one was a self-conscious embarrassment, riddled with eye-rolling clich√©s, platitudes, and cartoon characters with no depth. In an apparent attempt at ""seriousness"", every troubling subject known to man was thrown in -- suicide, mental illness, sexual abuse of children -- but just thrown in, superficially, with no understanding or depth. Grossly sentimental. This feels like a coming of age film made by a coming of age director. There are many fine coming of age films that are authentic: Rob Reiner's Stand By Me, or Running on Empty, two wonderful examples. I cannot understand the overly high ratings of the viewers on IMDb for this one -- usually anything over 8.0 is a winner. I give it a generous 6 for a few good scenes and occasional good acting. Don't bother."

But instead the movie misses out parts of the story that I found important. The characters Patrick and Sam in the book smoke all the time, and then slowly Charlie starts to smoke with them and then weed, not one cigarette is smoked in the movie. <br/><br/>Then the movie decides not to include to include any of his relationships he has with any other character other than Sam. A few things that weren't mention or disappointed me:<br/><br/>1. There is no mention of Charlie's relationship with his brother and how he taught him to fight and how the whole family admired him for being such a great football player.<br/><br/>2. His sister, he see's struck in the face by her boyfriend, no mention of this at all. Also the following repercussions of this which results in her not being able to see the boyfriend, but she did it anyway.<br/><br/>3. The rape he saw as a child, that for some reason he didn't think was wrong, which you later find out might have something to do with him being molested as a child.<br/><br/>4. Charlie's teacher played by Paul Rudd calling him special and how he thinks he'd make a good writer. <br/><br/>5. Charlie cried in the book nearly ever 2 pages, not once in the movie.The character of Charlie just wasn't the same in the movie. In the book you think, why is he crying so much? What must he have been through in the past? 6. Charlie's relationship with Patrick and how he let Patrick kiss him, showing how his character just does what ever he thinks will make other people happy.<br/><br/>7. His sisters abortion. <br/><br/>8.

"uhchilly","4","3","6","2 February 2013"," Typical teen story, clunky writing
","As a few other reviewers have said, this film has the typical storyline of the outcast teen with misfit friends going through high school. My biggest problems with it is the writing. The dialogue is really clunky and comes off totally inauthentic. The characters don't develop any real chemistry except for Patrick and Charlie, as the rest of them seem very cardboard - like all they are is a character synopsis.<br/><br/>Both Lerman and Watson were ineffectual in their roles adding nothing to the decidedly poor material they were given. Her delivery was deliberate and forced and the entire time I couldn't help but feel there was an over-instructive director guiding her every move. I think that is reflected in most of the performances - forced and limited at the same time. This goes for everyone and it seems to back to the writing again and again.<br/><br/>Much more reflective of made-for-TV writing, at least when it comes to the characters and their words.<br/><br/>Lastly the music. Even though I like the music (I grew up with it), it was completely wrong for the movie and only added to the inauthentic feel. This movie takes place, presumably, in the 2010s but the music they all listen to is from 20-30 years ago. The music is masquerading as the current play-list for this generation. It isn't background music, it is actually a big part of the movie with mixed tapes being exchanged etc. Yet I think it does a complete disservice to the characters to presume that they would identify so strongly with music that their parents would have listened too instead of something more contemporary. It just doesn't ring true.<br/><br/>I'm hearing these characters gush about the Smiths when none of them were even born when the band broke up; it just makes no sense (XTC,Cocteau Twins on their OMG I LOVE them! list????). I think the characters deserved more and the film's plausibility really suffers for it ."

I certainly don't remember any of that carry on. Sure, the were different people into different things at school but the way their outside school life was portrayed with lavish parties and well mannered kids was, for me, unrealistic. But then again I'm not American. And if there is any hint of realism in this movie then I'm pretty glad I ain't.<br/><br/>Check out weird science."
"lindasdfghjkl","4","3","6","22 January 2013"," This movie tried too hard to be clich√©
","I can appreciate a good movie but this one hurt to watch. Emma Watson seemed unable to assimilate herself into the American mindset, she seemed uncomfortable; as if she knew her lines were terrible. I expected so much more out of this movie but it was purely clich√© and a waste of time.<br/><br/>Logan Lerman did a great job, but the fake laughs and the terrible inside jokes the characters are involved in was just uncomfortable to watch. I love Emma Watson but I expected so much more. I think that the biggest problem had to be the script. It was crap. The book was quoted now and then but the overall script was highly disappointing.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't even begin to compare to the other movies rated this highly. <br/><br/>SEEMS LIKE THE PERK OF BEING A WALLFLOWER IS BEING ABLE TO CREEP UP THE RATINGS."

The actors all did an amazing job -- especially Logan Lerman who played the role of Charlie. I was speechless at how he made Charlie come to life and how believable his acting was. Emma Watson also did a good job, although I'm still unsure if she was the best pick for the role. Bottom line: The movie just makes you relive that experience of reading the book for the first time, and all the emotions that go along with it. All I can say is WATCH IT!"

I was never an outcast or somebody with the issues the main characters faced, but life in general has its way of throwing challenges that we all have to face at some time or another. <br/><br/>I felt the acting was very well done. Everybody seemed quite sincere in their presentation of their character, which really made me feel like I was watching somebody's life rather than a movie.<br/><br/>The movie left me very pensive even days after seeing it, which many movies don't seem to achieve (for me at least..) I think this movie really speaks a loud tone, especially in this country of gun violence by young children.

"meeza","9","3","6","29 December 2012"," This Wallflower blossoms!
","These are the perks of being a pseudo film critic. I can write about any movie, at any time. So therefore, I am going to provide you some perks that you can receive by watching the coming-of-age flick ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"". First perk- you will be vastly entertained with Writer-Director Stephen Chbosky's film about Charlie, an introverted high school freshman in Pittsburgh who is befriended by a group of eclectic seniors. They include Patrick, the popular vocal one who is gay; Sam, the pretty gal who has had a bad run with boyfriends in the past; and Mary Elizabeth, the punky Buddhist who takes a romantic liking to Charlie. However, Charlie has his sights on Sam. Charlie did have a traumatic event as a child which is not disclosed until the latter part of the movie; and eventually this situation led to psychological challenges for Charlie. Second perk- Chbosky, who adapted the screenplay from his novel, directs the picture in a method reminiscent of John Hughes classic 80's teen movies; which authenticate the ordeals and challenges that teens go through, and verify that it's not just about fun & games for them. Third perk- Chbosky's screenplay was immensely ingenious and endearing, and very worthy of a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar nomination. Fourth perk- Logan Lerman's astute performance as Charlie just might give him a Logan's run to more high-profile acting gigs in his career. Fifth perk- Ezra Miller's work as Charlie was probably the best performance by a young actor in a movie this year. This young actor keeps proving that it's about Miller time for him to move up the Hollywood thespian letter with premier starring performances. Sixth perk- Emma Watson proves that she does not need a Potter by her side to demonstrate her acting skills; she was debonair & articulate in her work as Sam. Seventh perk- the movie is set in the 80's, but it incorporates some of today's major teen issues transposed in that time. Eight perk- the killer soundtrack that includes great tunes especially the premier song of the film which would be the inspiring classic ""Heroes"" from David Bowie. Ninth perk- there is even a Paul Rudd sighting in the movie, his restrained and effective performance as Charlie's high school English teacher was an added plus to this unpretentious film. Tenth perk- after you see this movie, you will feel just as good as watching ""The Breakfast Club"" for the 200th time. The premier line of the movie is ""we are infinite"", and lucky for you this review isn't. Nevertheless, I hope I provided you enough selling perks to locate your perking space to check out ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"". ***** Excellent"
"estebangonzalez10","8","3","6","18 December 2012"," The Dead Poets Society meet The Wallflowers
","¬®We accept the love we think we deserve.¬® This was truly a wonderful and beautiful film. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of those rare teen movies that feels honest and authentic. We've seen similar stories told in other movies, but not in the same way that Stephen Chbosky tells it here with such a natural flow. This is Chbosky's first major film as a director and he does a brilliant job by giving us a heartfelt authentic teen drama with some very funny moments and a romantic love story. This film is based on Chbosky's novel which he also adapted for the movie, and his passion and love for this project really comes through in the film. I don't know if it could have worked as well as it did if it weren't for the three leading performances from Logan Lerman (Percy Jackson), Ezra Miller (We Need to Talk About Kevin), and Emma Watson (Harry Potter). They were perfectly cast in their roles and they had such great chemistry together. This film made me even more excited for Aronofsky's next movie, Noah, considering that Emma Watson and Logan Lerman were both cast in it. Watson and Lerman share some unique and emotional moments together on screen, but the true star of the film was Ezra Miller who delivered a very powerful performance as Patrick. His role was very different from the one in We Need to Talk About Kevin, and he was just so amazing. The film isn't afraid to tackle dark subject matters such as homosexuality, mental illness, and child abuse, but Chbosky manages to tackle these issues in an honest way while mixing these dark moments with some humor. Ezra Miller really facilitates those transitions with his performance. The Perks of Being a Wallflower reminded me of some other indie teen films that I liked such as The Art of Getting By and It's Kind of a Funny Story, but it also has a sort of late 80's vibe to it that reminded me a lot of Dead Poets Society (one of my all time favorites).<br/><br/>The film takes place during the 90's in Pittsburgh where we are introduced to Charlie (Logan Lerman) who is about to begin his freshman year in High School. His best friend killed himself a few months ago and he is going through some sort of mental illness as he experiences black outs and has flashbacks of his Aunt who passed away when he was little. He is quiet and nervous about his first day in school and finds it difficult to make new friends, but when he meets Patrick (Ezra Miller), an outgoing and friendly senior, his life changes completely. Patrick introduces him to his stepsister, Sam (Emma Watson), and the rest of his friends who call themselves The Wallflowers. In his first party with them he accidentally gets stoned after eating a brownie and everyone becomes amused with him and his honest remarks. Charlie feels accepted and begins to enjoy spending time with the group, especially with Sam. Sam begins dating a college boy, and Charlie ends up forcefully dating Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman) since he is too nice to say no. Charlie dreams of becoming a writer and he really enjoys his classes with his English teacher Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd) who sees a lot of potential in him. Despite being very smart, Charlie has trouble communicating his feelings to others, and after experiencing a setback with his friends he begins to suffer more black outs. The question remains whether or not he will find the courage to express his feelings towards Sam before the year is over, and if he can unlock the secrets from his past that he is restraining.<br/><br/>There are several things that reminded me of Dead Poets Society although this film doesn't focus as much with students bonding with their professor, Lerman does share some interesting scenes with Rudd, the professor. Lerman reminded me of the young and introvert Ethan Hawke, while there is also the issue of one of the students fearing what his father might think about him. Ezra Miller is sort of the Robert Sean Leonard character, although the fears he faces with his father are manifested in his boyfriend and not him, but he does have that sort of outgoing personality and also acts in a play honoring the Rocky Horror Picture Show. The Wallflowers do have some similarities with the Dead Poets Society, but this film does have a much more romantic side thanks to the chemistry between Lerman and Watson. We all saw how Emma Watson grew in the Harry Potter franchise, but here she delivers her best performance to date. I already had liked her in her small role in My Week with Marilyn, and here she gives a believable performance as an American girl. Her accent was just perfect and I really loved her performance. Lerman and Miller also have a great future ahead of them and they proved their talent here in this film. There are also some smaller performances from known faces such as Dylan McDermott and Kate Walsh who play Charlie's parents and Melanie Lynskey his aunt. Joan Cusack plays a doctor and Johnny Simmons is Miller's love interest. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is really a well crafted film worth checking out as one of the best teen movies of the year.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"
"joetufano719","9","3","6","28 October 2012"," A very touching and mature coming of age story
","My interest was raised after watching the trailer for this film, and after seeing it yesterday I'm happy to say that it is amazing. Now I've never read the book, so I can't say if the movie did the book justice but from a filmmaking standpoint I thought this was done so well. <br/><br/>The story, the acting, the writing and the humor was close to perfect as you can get. The story is simple enough (Spoiler free): High school freshman named Charlie (Logan Lerman) begins his high school days unsure of how he's going to fit in. Charlie didn't have the best childhood, and he's definitely the type of kid that wouldn't be respected by his peers. That all changes when he befriends Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson) who are high school seniors who introduce him to the real world.<br/><br/>Acting: This is the 2nd film I've seen Logan Lerman in since the 3:10 to Yuma remake where he played Christian Bale's oldest son. He was good in that one, but my God was he great in this film. He perfectly embodies the young troubled boy who must confront his demons, and inevitably grow into adulthood. He reminded me of myself in some ways he was awkward and shy among other people. I was definitely not the popular kid in school, and now that I look back on it I'm glad I wasn't because I would probably be a jackass. He was also very sympathetic and relatable that it reminded me of Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Peter Parker in the original Spider-Man trilogy. I know this sounds like an odd comparison to you, but to me the way Peter Parker was written like Charlie was made sympathetic and relatable that it made you care about the character, what's happening to him and how he's growing into manhood despite all the trials and tribulations he's been through. Anyway, great performance by Logan, and I'm interested in seeing what he does next. Emma Watson... oh my word, she is breathtaking. I've always liked her since Harry Potter, and it was nice to see her doing something different this time. There were a few times when her British accent slipped out, but it wasn't distracting and I thought she gave a great performance as Sam. Ezra Miller was also excellent as Patrick. Very funny and likable, and I wish I had more friends like him. Paul Rudd as Mr. Anderson played his part very well. It was a small part, but I thought he did a good job with it. The rest of the cast, including Nina Dobrev, Mae Whitman, Dylan McDermott, Kate Walsh and Joan Cusack were great also.<br/><br/>The writing was so beautifully written, and felt very natural throughout the film. The music was done very well, and themes presented here reminded me of a John Hughes movie but with a darker spin. Stephen Chbosky did such great work translating his book into a film adaption, which is not an easy thing to do with movies based on books. Again, I've never read the book but I think it was done very well.<br/><br/>I've seen my share of films where the actors look like they're phoning in most of the lines, and it seems like they just don't care about whether or not they're making a good movie or not. However, this is one of the many films I've seen where the interactions between the characters feels real and natural that you really buy that these guys are actually really good friends.<br/><br/>Final verdict: I give this film an A. The acting was fantastic, the music, the story and the direction were brilliant. This is one of those films that remind us all of the innocence of our youth and that feeling we have of learning new things in life, wondering what lies ahead for us in the future. I cannot compliment this film more, so go see it even if you haven't read the book."

All the young performers are superb in their roles. These are performances they will always be proud of. I got so involved with the main characters, I was gripping my seat a couple of times. I don't want to give away any of the main plot points. I'll just say that it is a heartwarming story very well told.

"moviexclusive","9","3","6","8 October 2012"," Witty, humorous and deeply poignant, this sincere and heartfelt portrait of a troubled teen's adolescent years will make you feel young again
","Countless stories have been told of growing pains, but few are as sincere and heartfelt as 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower'. Adapted by Stephen Chbosky from his own novel, it is the coming of age story of quiet and shy Charlie (Logan Lerman in a beautiful performance, but more on that later) as he embarks on his high school journey with two seniors ‚Äì Sam (Emma Watson) and her irreverent stepbrother Patrick (Ezra Miller) - that leads to his transformation of mind and heart.<br/><br/>Not often does a successful novelist get to translate his own book for the big screen, let alone direct it, but the creative liberties that have been accorded Chbowsky in this case truly pay off. Here, he has wisely retained the narrative device of his novel, introducing his audience to Charlie via the letters he writes to an unknown recipient, addressed only as 'Dear Friend' ‚Äì and it is through Charlie's voice-over that we learn Charlie has recently lost his best friend Michael to suicide while Michael's girlfriend Susan (Julia Garner) stridently avoids any association with him to blend in with the 'in' crowd.<br/><br/>It is also from his perspective that we learn he has been haunted by the death of his Aunt Helen ‚Äì whom he believes he is responsible for ‚Äì and how that traumatic memory has left him in bouts of crying fits. But the self-effacing teenager who keeps a low profile in the hallways and never volunteers the answers in class even though he has them gets a change of fortune when he meets Michael and Susan at a football match.<br/><br/>Quickly assimilating into their clique of friends ‚Äì which includes a vegan punk Buddhist Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman) and a chronic shoplifter Candace (Nina Dobrev), Charlie begins hanging out with them at high school parties, all the while falling even more deeply in love with Sam. In turn, they introduce Charlie to The Smiths (an English alternative rock band), ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" screenings and marijuana brownies ‚Äì and though the concoction of sex, drugs and rock n roll isn't new, it's depicted with so much fond nostalgia that you feel as if Charlie's discoveries were your own.<br/><br/>Yet Charlie's journey is somewhat different from the typical cautionary tale ‚Äì too precocious to live life in heady abandon, Charlie instead assumes the role of the titular wallflower, observing the goings-on of Patrick and Sam. In particular, Chbosky details Patrick's doomed relationship with closeted football quarterback Brad (Johnny Simmons), the consequences of that fallout significant not just for Patrick but also Charlie, who is forced to confront deeper and darker secrets from his past towards the end. Charlie also stumbles unknowingly into a relationship with Mary, watching helplessly as Sam gets attached to an older university student.<br/><br/>As expected, none of their relationships end well, and within their unfortunate encounters is a lesson that is deeply poignant. ""We accept the love we think we deserve,"" says Charlie, and it is such a heartbreakingly honest confession that you can't quite help but be profoundly moved. Yet the reason these words resonate is not only that they are true, but also that they have proved to be familiar when looking back at the anguish of one's own adolescent years ‚Äì and indeed, Chbosky hasn't just made a teen drama but a drama about adolescence that anyone who's been through that phase will be able to identify with.<br/><br/>Chbosky also trusts in the maturity of his audience to understand the emotional scars within Charlie, old wounds laid bare just as he begins to participate more fully in the lives of the people around him. This is as much a universal tale as it is an individual one, and Chbosky draws us into the very specific mind of a troubled teen who has over the years learnt to go through life by repressing his childhood insecurities. Rarely has a final scene touched us as much as this one, and we guarantee you that when Charlie finally learns to let go to the tune of David Bowie's 'Heroes', it is a transformative experience that will stay with you.<br/><br/>It's not easy to play such a complicated teen as Charlie, but Logan Lerman nails it on the head with a sensitive and empathetic performance that is among the best he has ever done. Watson also shines in her best post-Potter role yet, he radiant performance allowing her audience to fall in love with her character as Charlie does. And Miller is pure electricity in the supporting role of Patrick, bringing both warmth and woundedness to portray his character's wit and sensitivity.<br/><br/>With generous help from his committed teen cast, Chbosky smartly observes the all-too familiar pangs of adolescence in a film that has both heft and heart. There is a distinct sense one gets from watching the movie that it is also a deeply personal tale, and it is to Chbosky's credit that he has managed to distil his own feelings and experience into a story that anyone can relate to. Even if life hasn't always gone according to what we intended to, there is always this moment in our teenage years that we can proclaim as Charlie does ‚Äì ""and in that moment, I swear we were infinite"". Chbosky's film does the unthinkable ‚Äì it makes us feel infinite, and it makes us feel young again. <br/><br/><ul><li>www.moviexclusive.com</li></ul>"

","This stands with the best of the classic movies about growing up - The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, and Some Kind of Wonderful, while all the while being loads more real than any of those films. This is a funny (easily a dozen times where the audience laughed out loud), profoundly moving, and inspiring piece of film.<br/><br/>The performances are near-perfect - beautifully raw, genuine, and lacking in self-consciousness. Any doubt that Emma Watson can't be anything but Hermione goes out the window here; she's lovely, aching, alive, and spot-on. Logan Lerman has a palpable vulnerability that makes you root for him to become the creative being you know he can be. Ezra Miller has the sweetly manic energy, charisma and bright smile that gives his character a live-wire presence. <br/><br/>And kudos for touching on the importance that surroundings have on young lives: the city and it's features (tunnels, bridges, hillsides) become effective drivers of what these kids are going through as they emerge into fully emotional beings.

","i am an avid reader and i read this book a few years ago. i automatically fell in love with it.i soon found out they were making it into a film and i have always been sceptical of films which are based on books and i am quite often disappointed with the outcome. this film was no exception.<br/><br/>I had heard and read countless reviews about this film saying how amazing it was and i felt obliged to watch it. i tried my very best to put the book out of my head and just go with it and i shall give credit where credit is due... I think overall they did an excellent job of the film. The cast was excellent, especially Emma Watson who plays Sam. Not once throughout the film did i think of the harry potter films, which is what i have done throughout other features i have seen her, and other members of the harry potter cast, in.<br/><br/>Throughout the film I constantly felt like each scene ended so quickly! I would just start to enjoy it and then it would move on so suddenly and i would be left bewildered trying to soak up the last scene as well as the scene which was playing in front of me. I have constantly found this with films which have been based on books. With a book you can take your time, soak up all the details, use your imagination whereas with a film, everything is just put in front of you and all you do is just stare at a screen for a few hours. This isn't how i feel about all films, only films based on books.<br/><br/>*spoiler alert* whilst reading the book I found the scene which struck me the most and i found the most emotional was the scene with the poem. I found not only the poem emotional but the entire atmosphere which the author had created so moving. It was the one scene i pictured so vividly in my head being part of the film and when it didn't come around, i cant even begin to express my disappointment.<br/><br/>I also feel the books which were given to Charlie by his English teacher were a huge part of the story and also Charlie as a character and a person. I feel like there wasn't nearly enough attention on the books and how they uncovered Charlie as a person.<br/><br/>Overall I would definitely not recommend this film if you have read the book however if you dislike reading and are looking for a funny, meaningful, heart wrenching coming of age story then this is definitely the film for you."

","Alexander Rhodes clearly added an entirely new dimension to the dynamics of the film; a depth which simply cannot be achieved without an actor of outlandish quality and soul-crushing maturity such as himself. His portrayal of his character was taken straight out of the Shakespearean tradition, and was executed with the precision of a seasoned actor. At times, there was semi-sloppy camera work, and the shading was detectably off, but this, of course, cannot be blamed on Mr. Rhodes. He cannot be held accountable for the incompetence of the directors and camera crew. It is outrageous that he didn't receive more screen time: he essentially made the entire film! All in all a very respectable film, but this was in all honesty a product of Mr. Rhodes' ability to connect with the viewer, locking us into a trance of awe and wonder."
"jodenband21","10","4","10","5 January 2013"," ""I gave her my heart, she gave me a typewriter.""
","""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" wins the heart of many viewers seeking a film with genuine teen melodrama. Sure, the concept of the film may be hackneyed, but with a bolstered star-power from the casts, and a plausible script, it surpasses another coming-for-age substance on the silver screen. Filmed in the traditional John Hughes and Cameron Crowe style, it's probably nostalgic for some, but nevertheless overwhelming and heartfelt. I never been this instantly hooked for a teen drama film like this before, it's like everything about the genre is getting so much better as the year passes by. Though it's the last teen movie for 2012 to be a clever one, it's impossible to look for a film like this for another year or two.<br/><br/>Logan Lerman plays as Charlie, a young man who's pressured for his first day in high school. He's subtle but rather awkward in making friends. As any teen that has new doors to go in, Logan partakes a test in high school life. His first and the only closest friend on his earlier days where his English teacher Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd). They're both connected in the same page, and they're also indebted in reading the classics.<br/><br/>Not long after Charlie's melancholic episode, he befriends one of his classmates named Patrick during a football game. Patrick is a funny senior student with an offbeat humor. And then later on, his step-sister Sam (Emma Watson). The trio have made an intimate friendship ever since, and that's the obvious part. Charlie has had the impression that Patrick and Sam were a couple, but Sam explains that they weren't. So what unfolds is that Charlie will start to get in love with Sam. In addition, Patrick turns out to be gay and is in love with a football jock (Johnny Simmons). <br/><br/>Before Charlie starts getting the ideal attention, there were fleeting series of flashbacks about his aunt which died in a car accident. Charlie have been bearing the pain ever since, so he has been acting very differently. But all of this he can't forget. Instead, he relied on the support of being a wallflower among his friend. This has become immediately effective because of the sympathizing monument.<br/><br/>""Perks"" is a strong film about strong characters which thoroughly exists beyond our own self. Part of me tells that the narrative is impossible to resist. It's embedded with nuances and dramatization which we can recognize easily. It can make you cry, pitiful, and make you develop this longing which the characters feel to maintain their friendship together. There is one scene in the film where I consider really sweet and sublime: Where Charlie and Sam develop a sense of hesitation but turns out that Sam really wants to love him at their brief moment alone together. <br/><br/>I felt for the actors' persona on-screen. Logan Lerman, whom the last well known project to be the Percy Jackson film attains a fresh coming- for-age male breakthrough performance. He's quite funny and also quite the gentleman, but some of his stubborn dialogue is a downer. Emma Watson ignores the commotion that surrounds her about her Brit qualities. Instead, she perfected to be on an American shoes like how Meryl Streep mastered plenty of accents on many of her films. Lastly, Ezra Miller gave a great feel of being a profound alpha-male bravado. It's funny that the trio develop an unadulterated chemistry which is appealing in the eyes and ears. It's all in shape and form, there's no denying it.<br/><br/>The director, Steven Chbosky (based on his book) has written an incredible and profound story with believable materials and voice. He attributes Cameron Crowe with John Hughes into something less generic. The chosen setting for the film was 1990s, but to make it more alive, Chbosky hired Michael Brook to pump some great tunes including The Smiths and David Bowie. As a whole, the film has proved itself to be perhaps a Golden Globe nominee."

I will say that I did read the book beforehand, and I was amazed as to how well they transformed such an amazing novel into such an outstanding movie. Every important part in the book was included in the movie if not obviously then somehow portrayed on the final wrap up at the end. So of you loved the book like I did, go see this movie!<br/><br/>Those of you who did not read the book: Please, if you don't want to read the book, see this movie. It has something for everyone in it. This is not, I repeat NOT a chick flick. I don't want to be all dramatic and say that it was art, but really this was a masterpiece. The truth of the movie and the underlying secrets of the characters really show how the real world is. <br/><br/>On an acting standpoint, everyone played their parts perfectly, but the standouts for me were the three main characters Charlie, Sam, and Patrick, played by Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, and Ezra Miller, respectively. I had only seen Logan Lerman in two other movies, Percy Jackson (in my opinion, awful.) and Hoot (cute, but not really a hard movie to act in). So, for me, Lerman killed it in Perks, nailing his part as an awkward high school freshman. Emma Watson, breaking away from Harry Potter, did an absolutely wonderful job. I was not looking at her as Hermione Granger, but as Sam, a totally different character. This movie proved how good of an actress she is. Lastly, Ezra Miller. Miller gave his interpretation of a homosexual high school senior who just doesn't give a shoot what people say about him. This character adds comedy to the movie so it's not just a sob story. Miller was my favorite this time around. All the other sporting parts did a great job as well. This was actually a star-studded cast. <br/><br/>This is a great movie, and everyone should go and see it."

For Charlie (Logan Lerman), a deeply buried incident had caused the inevitable change of behaviour, with a constant worry that the real him may not be well liked by peers. So he's quite the aloof kid, and when introduced in the story, is seen writing a letter to an imaginary friend as therapy, confessing his loathe for soon becoming a freshman in high school, under which this story unfolds.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Stephen Chbosky, who adapted the screenplay from his own novel (which was made up of a series of the said letters to that imaginary friend), The Perks of Being a Wallflower plain works, and engages on multiple levels, especially if you had grown up in the 80s and 90s, and would instantly recognize some of the iconic pop culture references used in the books, music, and musicals referenced both in the book origins, and on screen. There's wonderful drama about friendship, and the growing pains in this coming of age tale that had series of episodes that would be easy to identify with, making it seem a little bit closer to our hearts, with an eagerness to embrace it, since it's such a whimsical, nostalgic trip down memory lane.<br/><br/>There are elements associated with school life that may likely mirror one's own experience, dealing with first loves and the things we do for them, or those whom we fall in love with out of convenience then find it hard to back out from, the formation of firm friendships, school life from mugging to examinations, inspirational teachers who leave an imprint and encouraging us to fulfill potential, the proms, secret santas, gifts, the silly parties and shenanigans we get into, the extra curricular activities, cheap thrills, vice and fights. And how about those mix tapes as well, where we put together a series of songs for that special someone. The Perks of Being a Wallflower succinctly captured them all with a narrative breeze, without making any seem like overstaying their welcome, and had just enough oomph in them to leave you wanting more.<br/><br/>Logan Lerman really shone as the protagonist Charlie, who has a degree of innocence that's ripe for the mild corruption, especially when he hooks up with the brother-sister team of seniors Patrick, aka Nothing (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson). Lerman vividly portrayed his role as the understated heart and soul of the trio, and in their wider clique of friends, who were perfunctory to allow small subplots on various school life experiences squeeze through. He is the emotional anchor in the film, while also grappling with his own inner demons, and shows a tinge of vulnerability, with major struggling with a condition that we'll be privy to in due course of the narrative. And this was a major step up from his Percy Jackson and The Three Musketeers days to showcase some genuine acting chops.<br/><br/>And the powerhouse performances continue with Emma Watson as Sam, in what would still be her first few roles in leaving Hermoine behind, adopting a shorter crop of hair to play a spunky lass whom Charlie nurses a crush on, and who has quite the reputation with a long string of ex-boyfriends. Ezra Miller plays her brother Patrick, who has plenty of flamboyance, and is almost nearly the scene stealer with some of the best lines in the movie, topped by a natural charisma for the character who harbours his own secret and pangs too. Chbosky's story has these protagonists painted with a degree of confidence on the exterior, before paring it all down to their core, to see exactly what they were made of. And it's no surprise that all of them were equally vulnerable, and through the course of the story, became reminders on the importance of the building of confidence and gaining of strength from each other's comradeship and company.<br/><br/>I suppose for any writer turned director and working on his own screenplay, there's a tremendous sense of ownership and thorough understanding enabling a very true interpretation of what he wants to show and tell. It doesn't get any more truer than this, and Chbosky crafted some incredible interaction and dialogue amongst characters that make them all seem so authentic and real. Besides the offbeat comedy now and then, he really knew when to hammer those deeper emotions in, since the story also deals with emotional damage suffered from the past, which slowly unravelled itself. And not forgetting his very keen musical taste, as can be told from the soundtrack, with David Bowie's Heroes being used as bookends to mark the major transitions in life.<br/><br/>There will be moments where you'll chuckle, and moments where you'll cry. There will be moments which will move, touch, hurt, and make you reminisce about an era gone by, all captured in a capsule that is this film. With a packed narrative that's solidly portrayed by its youthful cast, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is that rare coming of age tale that's plenty of heart and emotion, that it's now in my shortlist as one of the best this year has to offer. A definite recommendation!"
"TxMike","Null","3","7","22 May 2013"," A lot more serious than I expected, a good study of teen angst.
","Just from the title I expected this to be a somewhat usual teen high school movie, and hoped for some interesting story line. I was surprised to find it to be a quite hard-hitting teen drama. The kids are mostly basically good kids, but many of them have some serious developmental issues.<br/><br/>The titular character is 20-ish Logan Lerman as Pittsburgh area high school freshman Charlie. He is a bright but quiet person, seemingly going to significant lengths to not stand out. He sought the ""wallflower"" status. He has never had a real girlfriend, and he has never kissed a girl on the lips. <br/><br/>One of the upperclassmen befriends Charlie, in a good performance by Ezra Miller as Patrick . But Patrick has a secret of sorts, although his inner circle know and accept him, he is a homosexual. <br/><br/>But more significant is Patrick's step-sister, played well by Emma Watson (of 'Harry Potter' fame) as Sam, who has had her own set of issues growing up, and has come to be a 'loose' girl. But Sam is graduating at the end of the school year and hopes to attend Penn State. She worries because her SAT scores aren't very good.<br/><br/>Charlie takes a liking to Sam right away, even with the difference (Freshman vs Senior) in their ages. (In real life both are the same age.) He offers to help her study for her SATs, and she gladly accepts. She likes Charlie a lot, even though she has a boyfriend in college. <br/><br/>The teacher that influences Charlie is Paul Rudd as Mr. Anderson who teaches English. Charlie reads a lot, and Mr Anderson gives him books. <br/><br/>The other key character, with a small but important role, is Melanie Lynskey as Charlie's Aunt Helen .<br/><br/>SPOILERS: Charlie's aunt Helen had died in a car accident when Charlie was young, he seems to have blamed himself because she went to buy a present for him. After that he has occasionally had spells where he blacked out, and has had some professional treatment. When he and Sam finally were having a romantic encounter, and she began to rub his leg in an erotic manner , a flashback showed that his Aunt Helen also did that, she had abused him sexually and told him not to tell. He had repressed that memory but now it was coming out. In the end it seemed that perhaps he and Sam were going to remain a couple, even though she was off to college."

","... if the current high school system really is so traumatic to most of their citizens. The Perks of being a Wallflower is yet another movie about a traumatic period of American kids' life called ""high school"". As if we did not have enough of these already.<br/><br/>If you can get over this trope, the story itself is on the border of OK/boring. None of the characters are really that interesting and the events depicted in the movie are more or less meaningless: gay characters have troubles, kids experiment with drugs and endanger their lives in traffic, relationships fail... To be fair, the traumas are not all caused by high school, but have their roots in the earlier lives of some of the characters. But these seem rather tagged on to make the characters more dramatic and the cases are slightly too numerous to make them believable."
"tavm","9","3","7","23 April 2013"," The Perks of Being a Wallflower has perhaps the most realistic touching of teen relationships depicted on film
","When one watches a movie about high school life, one doesn't always expect realism especially if the characters are nothing but stereotypes of jocks, cheerleaders, and nerds, or geeks, to use the more current term. But The Perks of Being a Wallflower, based on a popular novel whose author also wrote the screenplay and directed the film, seems to accurately capture what it was like during the late '80s/early '90s to be offbeat and withdrawn and to still manage to have some fun despite troubles with family, social conventions, and the discovery of one's sexuality during the painful adolescent phase. The young people picked to play the main parts are all good at what they did here, but Emma Watson-previously best known as Hermione in the Harry Potter series-is really a standout as the troubled-but-determined Senior named Sam whose friendship with the lead Freshman character named Charlie (Logan Lerman) is perhaps the most touching of the relationships depicted here. I really loved the way things happened in this movie, so on that note, I highly recommend The Perks of Being a Wallflower."
"doug_park2001","8","3","7","31 March 2013"," ""Let's Go Be Psychos Together""
","THE PERKS of BEING a WALLFLOWER is extremely poignant, well-acted, and well-filmed. It begins, I think deliberately, with the usual clich√©s and stereotypes of high school existence: Charlie the shy little freshman getting his class copy of TO KILL a MOCKINGBIRD ripped up by a bullyish senior, Charlie sitting alone during the big prom, etc. It quickly evolves, however, into something much more realized. Emma Watson and Ezra Miller particularly shine as Charlie's new friends, found seemingly by accident (as they often are), and their entire weird artsy kids circle is SO immediately engrossing and believable.<br/><br/>Understandably, many comparisons have been made with THE BREAKFAST CLUB, and, though PERKS is also set in the age of cassette tapes and typewriters, it appeals to the heart in the same timeless way, making it another film that's likely to survive and be watched many years from now.<br/><br/>PERKS is not flawless. Some of the themes and details--e.g., elements such as sister Candace's tumultuous relationship with ""Ponytail Derek,"" Charlie's abuse as a child at the hands of his now-deceased aunt, Charlie's mental illness--don't always interrelate or play significant roles in the story. Various details--e.g., while this is supposedly set in 1991-2, computers are still apparently unknown--are also out of whack. Yet, these factors apparently don't bother many others, and PERKS is a good enough film that even the imperfections serve to humanize and perhaps even make it better. The more I think about it, everything that goes on here IS quite relevant in simply showing the complexities of growing up and being human."

","I completely loved this film, the cast was awesome, great acting and directing, actually this is easily one of the best book adaptations I've seen. I feel connected to the story in so many ways, and this movie gave me a similar feeling the book did, which is awesome. What bothers me is the low earnings of the movie, according to box office mojo 28 million dollars worldwide. I find this really unfair, considering all the awful films that are a grossing success and this amazing piece of art pass by without any glory,the writer an director as well as the actors deserve it if you haven't seen the film go watch it immediately."
"swan19990","8","3","7","19 December 2012"," Bad acting, fabulous acting.
","Just watched this movie, and through the entire movie i thought whether it was a 8/10 or 9/10. But I ended up giving it 7 be cause of Emma Watson and possible reasons that she's casted for this movie. She ruins the whole thing, haven't seen Harry Potter besides from the first two, and had forgot all about her facial mimics. She overplays too much, her eyebrows is uncontrollably and moves all over her face. And on top of that, she never make it feel like she's a ""The Smith's"" kinda girl. This movie scores a bit on pretentiousness since they could have chosen thousands of other actors to play that role, who would have done a much greater and a lot more true job. Though EW really pulls this movie down Logan Lerman really draws it up to be a top movie. His acting is fabulous and I had sympathy and reliability to his role the entire movie through. To me his performance really could have made it a 9/10-kinda movie. Ezra performs as I'd expect from him. He's a good actor, and always a energetic and reliable young man that I hope to see evolve into more movies. I love him. Watch ""Let's Talk About Kevin"" too if you like him as an actor.<br/><br/>Writing: 8,5/10 ‚â† Camera/clipping: 7/10 ‚â† Morale/story: 8/10<br/><br/>Emma: 4/10 ‚â† Ezra: 7,5/10 ‚â† Logan: 9/10 (feels weird to give so different characters for acting in same movie)<br/><br/>Overall: 7/10"

","This movie is great, if you know what you are watching. Meaning if you don't like emotional movies with disturbed people in it then don't watch but knowing what you're watching definitely helps. I saw this for my psychology class and it really hits hard the directing is great and retains that Indie feel, while not hitting you in the face with it. Yes it is depressing and yes it is dark but it is a beautiful story of a boy who is lost and is pulled back from the brink by his friends. Deeply moving and hit very close to home with me. Plus, there are worse things than having to look at Emma Watson. Just to let you know I did not read the book so if you have I have no idea how it stacks up, although the author did direct it and write the screenplay."
"ryanmegancameron","10","2","4","12 October 2016"," Perks of Being a Wallflower ‚Äì A Devastatingly Beautiful High School Story
","Perks of being a Wallflower is a 2012 comedy-drama film based off of the novel by the same title. The movie is directed by Stephen Chbosky, who is also the author of the book. The film stars include Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, and Ezra Miller. This adorably awkward film is about accepting who you are regardless of the circumstances and being content with your flaws. <br/><br/>The film focuses on the life of high school freshman Charlie Kelmeckis. Charlie is struggling to gain a social life while battling with depression, repressed memories of abuse, and his best friend's recent suicide. At home, he watches as his older sister's boyfriend abuses her, which takes a toll on him. He can't seem to find a social group that will accept him, so he keeps to himself. Eventually, he meets Patrick and Sam, two quirky step-siblings who help him find his way. He learns that they too are finding their way, even as seniors preparing to go to college. Sam allows guys to treat her terribly while Patrick copes with hiding his romantic relationship with the school's quarterback. Emma Watson perfectly balances both insecurity and flirtatiousness when playing the character of Sam. She does an amazing job of embodying Sam's fragility and undying need to be accepted by others. Ezra Miller makes Patrick shine, his ability to be humorous in almost every part of the movie is his best quality, along with his genuine love for all people. His resilience in the face of his bullies and critics is a trait to be admired. Logan Lerman is Charlie. Charlie's awkwardness and innocence makes him extremely lovable. He is always concerned for other people and is extremely humble. <br/><br/>The movie's strength lies in its message. The motif of embracing your imperfections is implemented throughout the whole film. The spotlight on mental health is prevalent. Showing how people with depression are able to put on a fa√ßade as if everything is fine. As a person who struggles with depression, this movie always hits home. It perfectly encapsulates what it is like to not be OK. The movie is filled with touching moments and focuses on what is, in my opinion, one of the best movie quotes of all time, ""We accept the love we think we deserve"".<br/><br/>The film's use of soft lightning and scenery aids in highlighting some of its best moments. The film is set in 1991, which the cinematographer makes very obvious by his use of a more dull color scheme through out the movie, almost as if the viewer is watching a home movie. The music throughout the movie is also perfectly utilized. Charlie and his companions during the movie. From David Bowie to Dexys Midnight Runners, it seems as though the teens were born into the wrong era, which further gives the movie a sort of nostalgic feel. <br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who wants a good laugh, or even a good cry. I get both every time I watch the film. Perks of Being a Wallflower is not only a great movie, but it brings awareness to the very serious issue that is mental health. It is real, and it affects even high school kids."

","I think this movie resonates with a lot of people for a lot of reasons. I think everyone relates to these moments, in one way or another. Maybe we see ourselves in these characters, maybe we relate to the importance of friendship and being loved at this time in our lives. I don't know if everyone feels the way I do about it, but I know that the movie has the ability to elicit strong emotions, good or bad.<br/><br/>I love how the author of the book adapted it for the screen. It feels more authentic,a true vision. He's able to craft a handful of really beautiful moments, and wrap them in a story that I find emotional and comforting. I love the actors in all the roles, they really brought these characters to life.<br/><br/>The final moments are just gorgeous, and it's the main reason for my David Bowie avatar."

","I didn't expect much when I picked The perks of being a wallflower to watch. Casting was unknown for me except for adorable Emma Watson, who really makes a really good performance in the movie. <br/><br/>For me the movie really reminded me of my high school years. First I thought that the movie was about a bullied kid and how he survives the American high school, but I was happily surprised how deep the movie really is. Its themes on sexuality, sex, social diversity and mental subjects gave me a real pleasure watching it. I could really see myself as Charlie bullying aside. This flick is an awesome, realistic, view on ones life. The movie sets on a short period, only one semester, but it really captures the viewers heart and focus. It was kind of a deep drama but I didn't feel sad during it, actually it made me kind of happy. It was nice to think back to my own high school years and my first love. I think many people can really identify themselves with the movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion the movie is a brilliant classical movie, the main point is the story and how it's shown. It was like being in a theater, acting was mesmerizing and the story is just superb. Also remember to check out Crowded House's Don't dream it's over after the movie, just some brilliant music from the movie."

Emma Watson (Harry Potter) is amazing and, in this movie, is the perfect partner for Logan Lerman. They both alone have that spark needed to be in front of a camera but together are an explosion of feelings. <br/><br/>Regarding the subject, when you start watching the movie, you feel that it will be another typical High-School movie but it is not. This movie will catch you every 5 minutes with different wonders. After watching the movie you will not be able to know how to feel."

He has to cope with struggles such as the suicide of his best friend, his difference compared to the others teenagers, problems with his family,... During the year, Charlie will get closer to Sam and her step-brother, Patrick played by Emma Watson and Ezra Miller. During the movie, you learn more about Charlie's life and that he has to cope with more than high school problems.

"tom_dep","10","2","4","12 October 2013"," Writer of the book + director of the movie = win
","Let's make it clear from the beginning: I'm a big fan of this movie so this review may be a little bit biased, but aren't them all? I have watched this movie twice, the first time was when it was still in theaters and the second time was 1 hour ago. I have experienced the same joy at both times, this is rare enough to underline it. This movie just amazes me.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned it has everything in it, well every good thing you could expect from a movie. It has, of course, a love story, a troubled main character, a high school as a decor, at the first sight it looks like another teen movie. I can assure you: it is not! It has so much to offer to you, I bet you're going to think about this movie for a while after you've watched it. I know I did. Well enough for an introduction, let's get into it.<br/><br/>You've surely read the summary already, if not go ahead and read it. This movie is about a boy who just entered high school. He had some problems in the past and he's hoping to get past it. His first days of school don't go too well until he meets Patrick and Sam, two peculiar people. Even though they're in last year and Charlie is still a freshman they accept him in their group of friends. I won't spoil you anymore.<br/><br/>This movie is based on a book that I read after the first time I saw it. The writer of the book is the director of the movie and this is so great I couldn't emphasize this more. The movie has almost everything from the book in it and it is all sheer marvel. It explains so truly how high school is without clich√© and the character of Charlie is really well written. I've also had some problems in life, I guess everybody had, and I've recognized myself so many times in Charlie it just makes the movie more grandiose. Then you've got Sam who is just beautiful and makes you want to kiss her all the time. This movie really brings me powerful emotions. I will not go through every single character, I hope this review has made you want to see this movie. Go and watch it then!<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

","This film was adapted from the cult-smash-novel of the same name and as a reviewer who read and loved the book before the seeing the film I can promise you, this lives up to any expectations and wishes you could have had. This is perhaps, of course, because the writer of the novel is also the writer and director of the film ‚Äì he saw this beautiful project through to the end and he didn't let anything ruin its vision. As you can tell, I love both the book and the film with an intense and bordering-on over-the-top passion, so I'm sorry, but be warned, I will review this film with absolute bias. In my opinion it deserves no less¬Ö<br/><br/>Let's start with its premise. We begin our story with 16-year old introvert Charlie played by the hugely talented upcoming-star Logan Lerman, who writes a letter to a stranger describing his fears and lamenting the torture of high school. He writes this letter in the hope that someone can exist that cares without judgement and fear of his past or his character. It's a hopeful idea and its charming naivete is a theme which is carried throughout the film. For much of the film these letters are shown through a voice-over provided by Lerman, who describes his efforts to live life, with the help and encouragement of his two friends and confidantes Patrick (Ezra Miller, who you may recognize from the critically acclaimed We Need to Talk about Kevin) and Sam (Emma Watson). This is where our story begins and the many rises and falls that can be expected from day-to-day high school life are recorded with a refreshing originality and zest that I haven't seen in a ""coming-of- age"" film for a very long time. Some of the highlights include an exploration of drugs, alcohol, sexual abuse, the minefield of first- relationships and love at first sight, homophobia, rejection and, above all, the fear that we haven't been noticed. Or, as Chbosky (writer, director and all-round genius) so eloquently and charmingly puts it, a wallflower.<br/><br/>If you would like to read the rest of my thoughts on this film then please go to this site (filmrambler.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/the-perks-of- being-wallflower.html)"

But ""The Perks of being a Wallflower"" just blew me away. <br/><br/>The movie just felt so honest, .. deep, and yet simple.

In a way, the movie downplayed some situations (i.e. ""Candace"" and ""Pony-Tail Derek""; Drug use; Charlie's former friends, among other things). Also, from reading the book enough, it really seems like the characters were awesomely picked. All in all, I got the same indescribable feeling from the movie that I got from the book.

As much as I dislike Logan Lerman, I have to say after watching this movie, my mind was changed, Lerman (in my opinion) established himself as a good actor in this movie. And Ezra Miller as Patrick, he had the most memorable one liners and quotes that I've seen in a movie since V for Vendetta, he totally owns the roll as Patrick.

","Everyone already knows or has heard of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, but to the people who have been labeled an outcast at least once in their life, this movie means a crap load. The movie is based on the book, in which Charlie, an anti-social, depressed and friendless teenager has come to his all time low. Right when he thought he could not handle life itself anymore, he meets two amazing people (Emma Watson and Ezra Miller). If you were ever out casted, you would know how much meeting two people means. As Charlie's bond with his friends got stronger, he finally felt as if he fit in. This particular main idea had an impact on me because it made me realize how little things, like two friends, can seriously change someones entire life forever. It made me realize how special your friends are, and how without them, you would not be the way you are. The Perks of Being a Wallflower not only brought joy to me, but also a sense of hope. If Charlie can make two friends in the emotional state he was in, anyone can do it. I would recommend The Perks of Being a Wallflower to anyone who is currently/has struggled with friendships, has been or is labeled as an outcast, or who loves movies based on best selling books. This movie, and I guarantee you, will change your life some way or another; It is just simply breathtaking."

Without any heavy parts, without lame drama scenes and gentle progression. I got surprised several time, by things I was predicting happening in a different way of the one I had in mind or by not happening at all. The main emotion I got during and at the end of the film is a unusual mixture of joy and sadness, which is kindly sweet and not bitter. We can easily understand and feel a little of what the characters feel, without necessarily having anything in common with them and not sharing their personality aspects."

","Watching ""The Perks of being a Wallflower"" is one of those films that takes you back to the days when you remember trying to fit in. As in high school you always wondered if you were in the right clique or not. Everyone had their own it was the snobs, the rich, the beautiful, the jocks and the nerds and brains. Here which was a great story it's set in Pennsylvania a high school freshman Charlie(Logan Lerman)is a guy who sits out on the bench away from the action, as maybe he's got a right due to past problems. Anyway in a surprise and a dream come true for any kid two free spirited seniors Sam(the sexy Emma Watson)and her open and blunt stepbrother Patrick(Erza Miller)take Charlie under their wing. And this flight is a discovery of friendship, first love, parties, and sexual feeling all while remembering a troubled past and on going rough present for Charlie's mind.

The glorious moments in the missed opportunities, and the mistakes made it all real for me. The heartache was genuine, the dreams were ideal and raw so yes i liked the perks of being a wild flower. Moreover, i liked that it was a coming of age movie. it was simple, not exaggerated, borderline real. The only thing i missed was the magic that connects me to the movies, just missed it barely but it just was not enough. I love movies but very few resonate with the romantic skeptic in me."

","I read and heard lots of reviews from writers and movie reviewers about the movie, even the scriptwriter himself, I don't know it doesn't seem to capture the whole essence of the movie for me. I watched Charlie grow out of hesitance to participate in LIFE and feeling small, and wishing everything would just pass smoothly without any troubles or memorable feelings. When he finally meets his new inspiring influential friends Sam and Patrick, they rock his world, they make him experience life more fully and be more accepting, his non-judgmental character helps him get along with the very rich and eccentric characters in this group, and expands his perspective on stuff he felt but didn't know what they meant , the memories he abandons so hard. And it's when he learns to grow out of the trauma by embracing it one more time to talk about it, that he finds enough room in his soul to feel infinite, to feel like the world is inside him, not the opposite."

And to top it off the casting was really well done with some good names in it, so there were expectations and they didn't disappoint.

","I wasn't ready for this, when this film was released i expected something like Juno and i didn't want to watch it. I was so wrong! This is not some bad junk like Twiligth. The cast is amazing:<br/><br/>Logan Lerman's performance as Charlie is outstanding, i believe that he got exactly what the character is supposed to represent, not a psycho, not a loser, just a kid with good taste, a nonconformist who wants to fit into society without changing his personality. Logan's facial expressions are impressive, he manages to play Charlie without falling into an apathetic character. A+<br/><br/>Ezra Miller, as Patrick, is even better, he plays a wonderful person, full of surprises, i think that he drowned himself in the role and that's what makes me even more amazed by his performance. A++<br/><br/>Emma Watson has proved with this film that she is not just a pretty face,that she is capable of more than Hermione, she was the weak link, but she did it.

"FourInTheFamily","4","2","4","15 February 2013"," Excellent friendships, tough topics, tough movie, sad
","Tough movie. Watched this with my 13 year old daughter and some of the subject matter was too much for her. I believe any movie should stand on its own and not be compared to the original book (which I have not read).<br/><br/>This is a good movie about friendship -- extraordinary young actors! Being a friend means accepting the whole person; that was the good message in the show. Some of the best laughs and warmest feelings come from this group of 'wallflowers' or misfits fitting in with each other.<br/><br/>But, some of the other topics made this too much for my early teen to take. Me, too. Couldn't anyone in the show not have tragedy in their lives current or past? So glad the friends were there for the main character at the end, the uplift was good. But overall, too sad.<br/><br/>I would only recommend this for very mature early teens or mid-teens. Be prepared for very troubled, deep, and dark themes, but the friendship made and saved this movie. It's not a happy movie.<br/><br/>SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Some of the other subjects were hard to take, too many in fact. My daughter missed some of the references to Sam's promiscuous past, an adult in her past who acted inappropriately to her, the deleted scenes about the sister's pregnancy situation missed out on seeing Charlie as someone who was there for his loved ones but still another sad situation, a friend with possible bulimia, a teen who can't face being gay and his father who beats the son for being gay, lots of drinking and some drug use, the aunt molesting the main character was not revealed until toward the end of the movie was just too much to take by then as you are weighted down by all the sadness surrounding and happening to Charlie. If you are questioning whether to have your child watch this movie, you should know about all the tough topics."
"vatsal569","10","2","4","8 February 2013"," It was brilliant!
","Rarely after watching a movie do i take the time out to write about it so that others could know what my opinion about that particular movie was. Because opinions may vary. Some people may agree to what i think or believe while others wont. But with this, i just had to. Because rarely has a movie had such an effect on me. Rarely have i connected with a character as much as i did with Charlie (Played wonderfully by Logan Lerman) or Sam (Emma Watson) or Patrick (Ezra Miller). When I had a look at the promos, i expected it to be a yet another clich√© where you're made to feel pity for the protagonist in the beginning, but all ends well with a feel-good theme throughout. I expected the cinematography to be brilliant, music to be good and all other technical aspects of the movie to be top notch, but did not expect too much of a story. But boy was I wrong! The way this movie handles various serious subjects and meshes them all together without having a feeling of the plots squeezed forcefully is brilliant. And the credit for that goes to the writer director Stephen Chbosky! Made from a book penned by himself, I believe no one understood all the characters better than he did. No one could visualize the book better than him. And that shows throughout the film. You know what the characters are thinking or the reason why they are doing the things they do every time. Its like you know the characters instantly after the first time you see them on screen. All of them. And the director never loses hold of the film. Nowhere does it feel like its dragging. You're into the movie the moment it starts, and manage to stay hooked up until the last frame. Especially the last 15 minutes! I watched the movie again immediately just go through those fifteen minutes again. They moved me. And it is not often that a movie manages to move me. Generally I watch them and i forget, almost immediately. But this one I didn't. All the pieces of acting are brilliant. Logan Lerman is to watch out for.The way he portrays his characters with all those developments is good. Some of the scenes, especially towards the end were breath taking. Emma Watson in her all American avatar was good too. So was Ezra Miller. Although Paul Rudd's character could have been explored more, he was good at what he got. All in all, this is not just another high school movie. No! There is so much more too it. And the way every one of the sub-plots are handled, with all its sensitivity, its good. No matter what age you are, you will connect with the characters. Just Watch it! And yes, Be Infinite! :)"
"georgioskarpouzas","7","2","4","24 December 2012"," Not just a movie about a shy schoolboy
","I was interested in a movie about a shy schoolboy because I have been one myself. But I have to admit that the movie went well beyond that. The hero was not just shy but had other deeper problems originating in the relationship he had had when very young with- a now departed- relative. The people with whom he associated with, to act as mentors and to provide an initiatory experience to the real world, were in many aspects even more problematic than he was. The trailer is misleading because you expect a movie about shyness and social awkwardness and you get a movie about homosexuality, drugs and entrance to adulthood. The case-studies of the characters are too special to be typical. Nevertheless I keep the appearance of Emma Watson of whom I am a fan. Since I am neither British or American I can not tell the difference between a British and an American accent about which so much was made by some reviewers- I just found her English intelligible and that is enough for me. The scene where she stands out of the car with spread hands reminded me of a similar scene of another much older movie about youthful rebellion ""If""."
"thesar-2","10","2","4","23 December 2012"," The Perks of Watching This
","are countless.<br/><br/>The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a powerful and wonderful film. The performances are top notch, the score great, the songs awesome and themes were heartbreakingly real and deep.<br/><br/>John Hughes cornered the high school market in the 1980s. Were they necessarily real visions of pre-real world youths? Sometimes, but for the most part, they were comical views. Perks physically transported me back years to my days there. Hell, it enhanced my eyes of the surroundings back then.<br/><br/>Introverted freshman Charlie is desperate for friendship in his new High School surroundings. Sure, he gets some from a remarkable teacher, but he's looking for someone his own age.<br/><br/>He does get that, sorta: 3 years older in the form of a great duo of Patrick and Sam. Anyone, including myself, would yearn for such great friends. Patrick's way more outgoing than I was, and that would've attracted me to him tremendously and Sam's so cool without even knowing it.<br/><br/>But, there are deeper messages here, clues to unravel on why Charlie's so quiet and distant. It's heartbreaking learning more about both his past and present.<br/><br/>It took me all year and within 9 days of the next year to find my first five star 2012 film. I loved this movie, from the absolute first shot to the last. I cried, I laughed, I enjoyed life while not even participating in the events in the film. I felt there, I was Charlie.<br/><br/>This movie is near perfection. The acting of all around was excellent with the notable performances of Logan Lerman who owned Charlie, Ezra Miller as flamboyant, funny and fantastic Patrick and Emma Watson who was so good as Sam, it made me completely forget she was ever in the Harry Potter films. (And that's a major positive to me.)<br/><br/>When you can see yourself in these eyes, when you can clinch your fist and want to fight like these characters, you know you have the highest quality of acting. In one scene, one character needs to get out there and defend his friend against punk kids. I would be dead inside, if I didn't put myself in his shoes and want to pound such evil.<br/><br/>Lerman's Charlie was so real, so incredible, it would be a crime not to just hand the Best Actor Oscar over to him.<br/><br/>Aside from the acting, the cinematography, editing and direction were supreme. And the soundtrack was one of the best I've ever heard and I will be buying it shortly. As I will the BluRay of the film once available.<br/><br/>I can't provide enough praise to give this film justice. Rarely will a movie impact me like this, and if no other 2012 films I have yet to see don't come close to this, I will sleep comfortably. This is a gem to appreciate and absorb."
"jburtroald95","9","2","4","23 December 2012"," Much more than you might expect
","This year's undoubtedly greatest and most noteworthy ""teen movie"", Stephen Chbosky's The Perks of Being a Wallflower, is a terrific example of the triumph of pure, uncompromised artistic integrity and fearless exploration of dark, deep, unconventional, and not necessarily marketable themes and characters. It's only resemblance to the typical slothful cash cows that are fed to bored adolescents through the Hollywood production line is the timing and screen time allocation of the usual exposition, positive change in circumstances, complication, and transitional pathos leading to a more upbeat resolution. Here, every single rung of the narrative ladder is laden with solid, challenging, meaningful material that remains sturdy during each tonal shift between comedic and tragic.<br/><br/>Taking total control of an adaptation of his own book as both screenwriter and director, Chbosky very maturely probes both the social dynamics of the Wallflowers, a group of close high school friends whose interests lie across the broad range of areas other than football, supermodels and pop music, and the incredibly painful life of it's incredibly likable, oddball protagonist, Charlie (Logan Lerman). The Indie, eccentric wallflower gang, the real life equivalent of the Hollywood ""nerds"", who more of us are or have been a part of than one might expected are depicted with a very endearing realism that celebrates their alternative coolness. <br/><br/>The two members who are most featured, Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson), proudly parade into Charlie's initially lonely life as a battered, frightened, intensely introverted, humbly intelligent freshman who expresses himself in letters to a friend who is non-existent and featureless, but feels he ought to have. They touchingly take them under his wing exerting an air of confident weirdness, despite their own deep- seated insecurities that might not be as troubling as Charlie's very unsettling issues with insanity, but present just as many problems. Chbosky and Lerman make Charlie, the sweetest, kindest, most sensitive and convincing shy underdog ever to open a film with snarky complaints about one's high school days, and because of Chbosky's very mature approach to crafting this story, his maddening torment from the many guilt-ridden tragedies of his past are instantly understood, and only endear us more to him. The same goes for Patrick, who is quickly revealed to be a closet homosexual desperately trying to quench his thirst in a half-hearted affair with a two-faced jock (budding heartthrob Johnny Simmons) who fears his father's homophobic rage, but still derives primal pleasure from their secret sessions.<br/><br/>Despite initially seeming incredibly self-confident with his effortless witticisms and relaxed banter with friends and Sam, his new step-sister, Patrick is soon revealed to be as internally unsteady as Charlie is internally intelligent. Charlie purposely quietens his impressive intellect at school in fear of some surprisingly realistic bullies, so his savvy and pleasingly unsentimental English teacher, Mr Anderson (Paul Rudd), discreetly slips him a string of extra novels to satisfy his voracious literary appetite.<br/><br/>This student-teacher relationship and all other potentially cloying aspects of the story are handled with much more subtlety and restraint than I'm sure many audience members will be respecting. Make no mistake, this is a quirky piece, but certainly not cute and ""heartwarming"" in the usual. It doesn't try to charm you with sickly sweet sentiment that is supposed to ""grow on you."" Instead, it's strategy is to bombard its audience with themes and events that are crippling harsh and confronting, but must be faced as a fact of life, and then allows us some relief by showing the lighter sides of these characters' lives, as well as the majestic beauty of the darkness residing in them.<br/><br/>I do fear that, perhaps, its publicity will deter an audience that will truly appreciate it. Many of those who seek it out are likely to be after an upbeat Indie teenage comedy like Jason Reitman's Juno (2007) and the surprise of a decidedly downbeat drama may not necessarily be well-received. During an intelligently-crafted scene between Charlie and Sam where the subject of love ‚Äì that is, love in the real world, not in the minds of Hollywood producers ‚Äì is delicately discussed as the two of them are currently locked separately in uncomfortable, third-rate romantic relationships, Charlie repeats a piece of resounding wisdom he has learned from Mr Andrews: ""sometimes we accept for the love we think we deserve."" It is an ingenious quote that relates to the plights of so many characters, yet, near the time it was uttered, the girl sitting next to me in the theatre muttered, ""Just f--king kiss already!"" I certainly hope those slightly saccharine posters aren't the product of the producers' lack of commercial confidence in this quality film, and that they haven't accepted the shallow of love of immature people like the person who was sitting beside me, instead of the full appreciation of art-house audiences.<br/><br/>I also hope that the previous work of its three stars, whose names have been generously given marquee acknowledgement, will not create too many misgivings or preconceptions, for all of them produce characterisations that are markedly different from those they may have been previously affiliated with. Emma Watson's new haircut, impressive American accent and much more mature manner successfully remove the Sam from Hermione Granger. Ezra Miller is just as intensely engaging here as he was in We Need to Talk About Kevin, but certainly not psychopathic and demonic. Most of all, Logan Lerman is much more raw, affecting and unassuming than his likable but very typical turn as Percy Jackson in 2010. The rest of the cast, most prominently Dylan McDermott and Kate Walsh as Charlie's parents, Nina Dobrev as his sister and Mae Whitman as the sweet but insufferable girlfriend he's too nice to get rid of. <br/><br/>Believe me when I say that this a must-see for anyone Charlie's age (15) or older."
"jakeeenator","9","2","4","17 December 2012"," A movie that everyone must watch!!!
","I don't usually review titles on IMDb, but this must be an exception. I personally have read the book (many times) and I can safely say that this movie is almost exactly like the book. This movie was outstanding; both the casting and acting were very well done. And the chemistry between Charlie and Sam make the movie almost seem real. Its movies like this that prove there is still a glimpse of hope in a time of mindless brain-dead scripts. The story is deep, emotional, and keeps you watching the whole time and not wanting it to end. I am very glad that Stephen Chbosky (author of the book) was able to direct/write this movie because of how accurate and amazing it was. If you have not seen The Perks of Being a Wallflower then you definitely should, soon. I hope it gets the popularity it deserves and wins best film next year at the Oscars."

","High school was a difficult time for many people, I think. This movie taps into that by telling the story of Charlie, and his attempt to fit in during his first year of high school in Pittsburgh in 1991. The movie is narrated, the story being told through Charlie's ""Dear Friend"" letters.<br/><br/>He eventually finds a group of seniors, and falls in love with one of them, Sam (played by Emma Watson). The movie tells the coming-of-age story of his first real group of friends, parties, romances and sexual encounters.<br/><br/>The movie does not have much of a plot. Its strengths are character development and showing us what first year at this high school was like for Charlie, especially the experience of finally fitting in, the fun things that his new group does and his budding interest in literature and writing. His family and other aspects of his life are shown to a lesser extent. Not all of the clich√©s of American high-school movies are dodged, but still I felt drawn in to this world.<br/><br/>We find out that pretty well everyone in Charlie's new group is struggling with problems of their own.<br/><br/>Charlie (played by Logan Lerman) is a highly likable, sociable, respectful, intelligent, articulate and attractive teenager coming from a loving and prosperous family (so for some viewers it may be hard to see what his problem is exactly). However, as the movie progresses we find out that he is dealing with a few serious issues, so this is not just a story of ordinary teenage angst.<br/><br/>This movie (thoughtful, despite its subject) made me think of my own high school experiences. It had a few profound and moving moments.<br/><br/>Worth seeing."

The acting is just perfect - Ezra Miller plays a gay senior in high school, close with his stepsister, Emma Watson, who is one of the most promising actresses of her generation, and Logan Lerman (despite of being a bit older for the part) gives a consistent and touching performance of the main character. The soundtrack is absolutely mind blowing.

","This movie has touched my heart. there were points in the film where I felt like laughing or crying, or could closely relate to the character. The movie is serious without being TOO serious and funny all the way through. The only other movie i could compare this to where i had the same feelings was 50/50 because one actually feels for the character at hand. The main character was so complex, yet so simple. He had many problems bottled up inside, yet felt for others more than himself. Quite a few twists and suspense kept me furthermore intrigued and it leaves you with questions unanswered, in a good way. I gave this movie a 10/10 because at the end I, as a man, cried and I've rarely done that, especially around my friends. Same as 50/50, that's the only other movie in which I've teared up in public. When i needed to go to the bathroom, I held it because I didn't want to miss a single second of this masterpiece. I was really weary of Logan Lerman after seeing Percy Jackson (complete disaster) but he really impressed me. All characters and people involved in this production have earned my respect. This will be only of the only movies I will actually buy!! Wonderful way to spend time, all in all. best with friends and family"

","I read this little masterpiece a few years ago; and fell in love with it. It appeals to a broad range and tells a wonderful story about a boy who feels left out; which many of us can identify with. I was excited to find out they were making a movie and even more thrilled when I knew the writer was adapting the screenplay AND directing. However; I feel as though he fell short in a few areas. He was targeting the audience who read the novel; when I think he should have done the opposite. Don't get me wrong- I was able to fully appreciate what he did here. But I saw the movie with folks who didn't read it; and sort of felt bad that they weren't getting the most out of this wonderful story. I was also a bit disappointed in Emma Watson's performance. Ezra Miller and Logan Lerman were brilliant; but Watson lacked the brilliance of her counterparts. And to me; this was disappointing. I felt she was cast for her ""star power"" rather than her talents. But hey; if I put myself in the writers shoes; I guess I can't blame him. I would have probably done the same- especially if a star like Watson came to me with the excitement they said she did. However; she lacked the acting ability and voracity that I think this character needed. Although she was very beautiful to look at; Sam could've been played by many other American actresses with much better ""chops"". I will say that the movie was still beautiful and captured the essence of this novel perfectly. I did enjoy it despite my few disappointments. And I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a ""slice-of-life"", heartfelt movie. And I still give it an 8/10."
"toqtaqiya2","8","2","4","22 October 2012"," Strong acting and an insightful approach make this teen drama memorable.
","The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is a neat teen drama which delves into some serious subject matter. It was written and directed by Stephen Chbosky as an adaptation of his 1999 novel, and the result is impressive. Logan Lerman does a good job playing Charlie, a smart but sensitive teen who goes through quite a bit during the film. Chbosky set the story during the mid-1990s. Topics such as homosexuality, drugs, obsession, suicide and death are raised, so this isn't quite a John Hughes sort of comedy-drama. Emma Watson and Ezra Miller sure do shine in their supporting roles. But there is commitment from every actor involved, and Chbosky's intelligent and insightful screenplay puts them into memorable and reality-filled scenes. Paul Rudd as Charlie's English teacher Mr. Anderson and Mae Whitman as Sam and Patrick's friend Mary Elizabeth are perfect here. As to be expected in this sort of film there are discussions about music, and the soundtrack plays a part in the film. It's comprised of songs from the 1980s. One memorable scene features Charlie, Sam and Patrick cruising through a freeway tunnel while listening to a tune by David Bowie. In conclusion, The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is a solid effort by Chbosky which delivers on all fronts. It's a difficult story but it's the best teen drama in years. It's worth seeing."

I am a hard person to please having ""seen it all"" but this movie truly touched me in a way I couldn't possibly describe in words. Others may believe the film can be a little vague at times, but I believe it gives the viewer the ability to place themselves in the plot. This made possible because there isn't a single person who can't say they don't know what Charlie is going through to some degree. Those who feel the need to put this film down are only doing so because they simply can't grasp the true meaning of what this film is trying to portray. I hope if you feel this film didn't quite do it for you then I urge you to watch it once more. Surely everything merits a second chance as I am sure this film does."

","'The Perks of being a wallflower' is beautiful and touching tale of adolescence and the trials and tribulations of high school as seen through the eyes of a misfit kid named Charlie.<br/><br/>At first glance this movie may seem like the dozens of other high school movies that do the rounds each year (weird kid hits high school, weird kid gets hard time, weird kid meets hot girl blah blah blah). Although there is some romance in this story it is by no means the focal point of this movie. It is a story about a troubled kid finding himself and on the way friends, drugs, music, passion and love. <br/><br/>The acting talents of the young stars in this movie are incredible. I personally had reservations about Emma Watson playing Sam (a character in the book I loved). However she certainly proved herself. Logan Lerman as Charlie was not quite what I expected but his interpretation of the character was an interesting one that seemed to work. <br/><br/>As much as I loved the film there was a few things that bothered me. In the novel Charlie writes letters to an anonymous person and yes, I know this was seen in the movie too. However I felt this was such an important aspect of the book that it should have been a more prominent part of the movie in seeing Charlie grow. <br/><br/>Apart from a few faults The Perks of Being a Wallflower was a beautiful movie punctuated with a killer soundtrack and wonderful cast. It's one of those movies that when it finishes you will want to sit wherever you are for a few brief moments and just...think."

","I just read this book about two weeks ago. I read it in less than a day. I found it to be heart wrenchingly honest with a fresh approach to mostly standard material. Afterwards I rewatched the trailer which although I thought looked good it felt very different from the book I read. So after a few weeks in limited in finally made its way around to my local theatre. Well I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Because the film really captures the material while enhancing it with a truly appreciated honesty rarely captured in films of these kinds. The book which featured letters written to an unknown person describes the life of it's main character Charlie loosely based on the author/writer/director himself has been visualized in a somewhat amateur but throughly engaging and unflinchingly honest portrayal of a struggling young man coming of age. The book which dealt with depression, suicide, drug use, abuse, molestation, bullying and a barrage of enhanced emotions are expanded upon and explored in the film. There are moments where I found myself forcing back the tears as my throat felt like it was closing. It's a film most if not all people if they are honest can relate to. Logan Lehrmans lead performance as Charlie is astounding and must be seen it's one of the best of the year. On the downside Emma Watson feels a little forced as Sam and Ezra Miller does a little too much over acting as Patrick. Still the book and movie creates a character in Charlie than we can love and appreciate. The complexities of his emotions and the way he deals with them are visualized in some truly brilliant sequences. The downside besides the supporting performances are the dreadful cinematography the film looks fudgey and way too low budget and a bit of a forced sense of the cool factor. Besides that the film is a truly unique experience and should take it's rightful place as one of the best teen movies ever made and one of the best of the year."
"nskanyal","9","2","4","13 October 2012"," not just a typical teen movie; its for everybody
","Standing in the line for tickets, with all these less-than-20-years ahead of me, I was a bit worried, but this movie goes beyond being just for a specific age group and might be one of the best in the last couple of years. I haven't been in an American high school but don't have to, in order to enjoy, understand and relate to this movie. Charlie is a more-than-typical introvert who while being extremely bright and sincere, has severe problems making friends, but ends being the best friend to two seniors (Sam and Patrick). Sam and Patrick are free liberal souls (with their own personal problems), who on the exterior are polarly different from Charlie and they want different things in life. But, they care for each other, they like each other's company, and I think like everybody else they are bound by one common aspiration - ""to be happy"". I think this is one of those movies where you want it to move really slow and you are not waiting for what next to happen, but instead you want to fully absorb what is happening in that scene. My most favorite scenes in the movie are when Sam and Charlie are alone in her bedroom, and when they tell about their feeling for each other. Entire cast is great, especially Emma Watson, who was extremely graceful in this movie. Director Stephen Chbosky has done an amazing job, and might have created his career's best work. I would expect this movie to be at least nominated for academy best picture."
"cgkull","9","2","4","11 October 2012"," These Are The Perks
","I went into this film not having read the book and not knowing anything about the plot. And while I do not condone anyone that read the book, I was so pleased with all of the surprises that opened up as the movie progressed. <br/><br/>'Perks' has it all. It pulls and twists at every awkward emotion teenagers have felt through the treacherous time that is high school. There are times of anguish, sadness, glory, revenge, love, depression, futility, etc. So many times you just wanted to jump in and tell poor Charlie that things would turn out alright. His relationship naivety and blatant honesty made him such an intriguing individual, that you could not help but root for him.<br/><br/>Most high school films are cheesy and the clich√©s are overpowering, but 'Perks' stayed truly original from the party scenes to the lunchroom antics. It paid dividends that the author, Stephen Chbosky, was able to take his vision in his novel and portray that on screen exactly how he wanted. The storyline was patient and the pace moved perfectly to keep me thoroughly entertained throughout.<br/><br/>Though Emma Watson may be the high-profile name in the cast, it was Logan Lerman stealing the show. Remember his name. He took the innocent- freshman-with-a-mysteriously-broken-past-just-trying-to-fit-in and ran with it so well, I forgot that he is actually 20 years old. Ezra Miller also played a great compliment as Charlie's confidante and best friend, and Watson added some enticing flair as the love interest. <br/><br/>I cannot wait to buy this DVD when it comes out and watch it for years to come, for as high school movies go, this one is as timeless and truthful as they come."
"ThePadraigMoista","8","2","4","10 October 2012"," A very good film, only held down by very small faults.
","The Perks of Being a Wallflower follows Charlie, a friendless freshman with a dark mind and an even darker past. He sits alone and has no one to talk to. Until a group of seniors invite him and let him join their group of outcasts.<br/><br/>The character of Charlie is portrayed by Logan Lerman, who does an extremely great performance as a shy, awkward teenager. Emma Watson and Ezra Miller also give a great performance. The film has quirky comedy elements and captures the essence and thoughts of being an adolescent growing up in a world inhabited by idiots. The music preferences, the friendless and shyness that comes along with being an adolescent is incorporated into the film. Also, the film includes some very serious themes that teenagers deal with. It is a very well portrayed and directed film, with a special nod to the writer and director who also wrote the book Steven Chbosky. I found that the character's all had something which we could relate to, it was accessible to all ages and had a very good ending which makes it situated at the top of the hill in terms of coming-of-age films.<br/><br/>However, with all that great, comes a few faults. A few of the jokes didn't land and a few scenes had a predictable outcome, which made the film feel predictable. I think it could've explored some it's themes a bit more. It felt like it stopped half-way onto something great and the reasoning behind that I'd imagine is that Steve wanted the film to be 15 or PG-13 at most. The performances lacked by the supporting cast, especially in comparison to the mains. A few scenes felt unnecessary and a few scenes also didn't make the transition from the book to film very well. But aside from that, it was a very good film, easily accessible and one of the best coming-of-age film I've ever seen."
"neil-476","8","2","4","10 October 2012"," Touching but soapy
","16 year old Charlie (Logan Lerman) is not looking forward to high school. He has no friends, and little idea of how to make them. But when he is friendly towards eccentric and camp loner senior Patrick (Ezra Miller), he gets introduced to Patrick's stepsister Sa (Emma Watson), and their circle of non-cool students - ""The Island of Misfit Toys"" as Sam puts it. An interesting year develops, as Charlie opens up and forges relationships, while all the main characters turn out to have areas of darkness behind locked doors.<br/><br/>This film, essentially a coming of age story, crossed with teen romance, and mixed in with a big chunk of soap opera, is very effective. It gives us three very sympathetic protagonists, a supporting cast of characters who are all fairly sympathetic, a simple story with enough mystery to keep us interested, and a damaged but beautiful heart, and three wonderful central performances. Watson and Miller are both excellent, but Lerman's central performance, necessarily understated through most of the movie, is ultimately heartbreaking and heartmending.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this."
"hanuman10356","10","2","4","7 October 2012"," A movie about friendship, high school, music, literature, and mental illness.
","Immediately ascends to the pantheon of high school movies, ahead of The Breakfast Club and Fast Times at Ridgemont High. I saw it at the Writer's Guild with mostly a sixty-plus audience and they all seemed to love it, so, clearly, this is a movie that transcends generational appeal. In other words, it dealt with universal themes with great dignity and beauty. <br/><br/>The actors were all excellent, especially Ezra Miller as the gay best friend of Charlie. He was alternately glib and poignant without seeming the creation of an eloquent writer.<br/><br/>The score was a great eclectic mix of the eighties with brilliant usage of Bowie's Heroes and The Smiths Asleep."
"LeoReich1","9","2","4","5 October 2012"," Very good, but frustrating
","Attracting attention for seeing Emma Watson take on her first major role since Hermione, Stephen Chbosky's adaptation of his own bestselling book isn't, although it may seem like it, your average coming of age film. The story revolves around Charlie (Logan Lerman), who we learn has suffered from some kind of mental disorder since his aunt passed away. Charlie is a 'loner/nerd' stereotype- no one to eat with at lunch, no friends who 'let him in'. He is, however, apparently a literary genius, writing extra curricular essays (as if) for his friendly English teacher, played by Paul Rudd. Starting high school, he befriends two half sibling 'social outcasts', Sam (Emma Watson) and Patrick (Ezra Miller), who introduce him to their artsy crowd- the sort of kids who would like to think of themselves as poetic, and who listen to The Smiths. Charlie's love for Sam is made painfully obvious from their first encounter, but the focus of the film isn't on their relationships as lovers, it's on Charlie's discovery of friendship (yes, it's all very sweet). <br/><br/>Although it tackles some very dark corners of teenage life- abuse, mental illness, drugs, suicide- it still manages to have moments of comedy, often brought about by Ezra Miller's perfect interpretation of the flamboyantly gay Patrick (a big step away from his disturbing performance in We Need To Talk About Kevin), also managing to express his frustration at dating a closeted football captain. Lerman plays the damaged 16 year old well, with believability and humour, and portrays his mental illness with sensitivity. Less can be said for Emma Watson, however, who is way off nailing the Pittsburgh accent, and doesn't quite keep up on an emotional level, but she serves her 'pretty first crush' purpose well.<br/><br/>At times, the film escalates into brilliance, with thoughtful dialogue and affecting scenes. But at other points it goes to the polar opposite, becoming so pretentious it's enough to make you want to throw something at the screen in a fit of rage- I found myself gawping at the fact that the writer managed to come up with a line so infuriatingly ridiculous for a 16 year old boy to say as 'I feel infinite'. It feels like the Chbosky decided that there should be at least three places where the characters just wallow around in their own self pity, throwing lines at each other that are practically begging to be mocked- 'I don't write poetry, poetry writes me', 'Welcome to the island of misfit toys', 'We accept the love we think we deserve' etc. Apart from anything else it's just unrealistic- I think you'd be hard pressed to find a schoolboy who would list 'infinite' as one of their common feelings.<br/><br/>Regardless, it carries emotional weight, and there will be many relatable aspects, even if you don't hang around with 'misfit toys', or own a typewriter, or make indie mixed tapes for your hipster friends. 'Perks' delivers a very watchable alternative to a normal teen movie, albeit a quite unrealistic one, but is worth watching, at least, just for the truly brilliant, and very moving ending.<br/><br/>Stars: 4/5 (written for school newspaper hence the strange format)"
"jlpjon","7","2","4","5 October 2012"," The Perks of Being a Wallflower
","Stephen Chbosky's cutesy coming-of-age tale maintains an excellent balance of emotion and entertainment. The film's characters are well-rounded and unpredictable, and its lovable high-school vibe provides moments of pleasant recognition without diving head-first into overfamiliar teen clich√©s. Logan Lerman is superb as intriguing introvert Charlie and unconvincing Americanisms aside, Emma Watson is radiant as Sam, proving she has what it takes to break free of typecasting. Chbosky's film tries a little too hard in its sentimentality to move and inspire viewers, yet its terrific soundtrack and earnest screenplay ensure that his character-driven drama both entertains and leaves its mark on the mind."
"theycallmemrglass","9","2","4","4 October 2012"," A wonderfully nostalgic coming of age drama
","So we have another coming of age drama, not exactly a starved genre but this is one of the best I have seen and is a wonderfully nostalgic throwback to the 80s in the way American Graffiti was to the 60s. The late 80s was a time when I loved watching teenage angst in movies like Some Kind of Wonderful or Risky Business followed by a horror movie where said protagonists are stabbed or slashed in inventive ways on Elm Street or the likes. Perfect double bills, ah miss those days!<br/><br/>I cannot convince any of you that the underlying formula of this film is significantly different to others in this genre but I promise this is nevertheless not a clich√©d run of the mill, trippy road movie (though there is a bit of tripping in this). The main characters have layers which are slowly peeled away as the film progresses. I was very warmed to the earnestness of these characters and their developing stories. The story being told from the point of view from a fresher year student who is an introvert trying to do the best he can to fit in, is as stereotypical of a protagonist you can get but thanks to Logan's sublime performance, his execution was exquisite, humorous and very realistic, not overdone as is the case with many other films in this genre. He is befriended by two slight eccentrics (Emma Watson and Ezra Miller), bringing him into their exclusive circle of ""misfits"".<br/><br/>What makes this film stand out for me then? I think its a combination of many elements. Immaculate direction by the director who is also the author of the book that this film is based on which is interesting, as the only one other example I can think of is Michael Crichton who also directed his own books into movies. The choice of delightfully eclectic 70s/80s soundtrack perfectly complements the variable moods. The smoothly flowing narrative plays out with a poetic grace, infusing heart and soul, intrigue and wonderful characters that some of us have met in one form or another during our college days. <br/><br/>To top it off, the three main protagonists are beautifully conveyed. Its great to see Emma Watson able to free herself from the shackles further away from the Hermione persona after her small transition role in My Week With Marilyn. She equips herself well with natural aplomb, giving an earnest and heartfelt performance. I hear negatives about her accent which frankly, I find preposterous. First of all, I didn't notice if she has a British or American accent because when you are in a college, students come from different backgrounds and accents are mixed anyway. Secondly, its the performance that enraptures me, not the accent. If we are supposed to criticise accents then we might as well lay it thick on Sean Connery's Oscar winning performance of an Irish cop who sounded very much like a Scotsman, yet he still got an Oscar...maybe it was because of his performance, huh? The stand out performer, however, was the other supporting character, Ezra Miller who oozes charisma and I think we'll be seeing a lot more of this lad in future. I cant say much more about his character though because as I said they have layers which are slowly peeled away.<br/><br/>There is a revelation at the end but to be honest, while its actually a good one and makes the film even more substantial, it didn't need to have it. I would have been completely satisfied with the movie without it. I also think it drives a somewhat misleading message about certain types of people. <br/><br/>Having said that, I had a wonderfully nostalgic time with this film which delivers an emotional journey of ups and downs, building to a both an uplifting and poignant crescendo, so it is for that experience I give this a 9/10. <br/><br/>I especially recommend this for those of you who like American Graffiti, Some Kind of Wonderful, Hugh Walter movies etc."
"LaurieMann","9","2","4","2 October 2012"," Home Run First Time for Stephen Chbosky
","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of the better teen flicks of recent times. While I wasn't familiar with male leads (Logan Lerman and Ezra Miller), they could match wits against the excellent Emma Watson in a movie about early '90s teenage angst. Set in the South Hills of Pittsburgh, novelist/screenwriter/director Stephen Chbosky did a fine job with his first book/script/movie.<br/><br/>One highlight of the movie is that most of the characters are fairly well-developed. Even without knowing everything about him, Sam (Watson) and Patrick (Miller) can tell our hero Charlie (Lerman) is another ""misfit toy,"" just as they are. All of the kids have had trouble in the past or in the present, and they're generally dealing with it. But Charlie, especially, has difficulties. Chbosky shows how Charlie's past problems can't always be hidden, and emerge in some unexpected ways.<br/><br/>The movie makes good use of its Pittsburgh location, particularly with some memorable trips over the Fort Pitt bridge. Any movie that can both cast Tom Savini and give Eide's a plug is good in my book! This movie might be a movie like American Graffiti in the future - a movie with an awful lot of young talent in one place at one time."

","PROS:The film unfolds a coming of age story and depicts exceptionally the themes of loneliness, depression and friendship. Logan Lerman is a revelation and manages to capture the sensitivity of his character. Through his eyes you see the effort of a teenager to adjust to a new reality and make new friends after the tragic events he has experienced in the past. It's an attempt to find a way to move on with his life and accept his tragedies. Emma Watson portrays a fragile character who makes all the wrong choices and it takes long for her to understand what is the best for her. But the highlight performance is given by Ezra Miller who hides many problems behind his funny attitude. In addition, it's worth mentioning the role of Paul Raud as the supportive teacher. The chemistry of the trio is perfect and the music choices are mesmerising.
CONS:The tragedy events of Watson's character are underdeveloped. It's kind of awkward that she mentions that she is abused as a child and later never discusses it again (sure,her choices indicate that she is clearly affected by her past but it should be explored further). Moreover, the sublot with Mae Whitman's character doesn't give something special to the story."

","Everything we experience is ours, and no one can change it. Some people say that the experience is good, but it may not be all right. Because we are a very magical animal, we always escape those painful memories and choose sweet ones.
You, me, or a friend of mine, or a passerby. It is such a person, speechless and melancholic. Write long letters to non-existing friends, with a heart that meets new friends. The life that was so bland like water was suppressed by itself, like a long tunnel with no end. Life at this time no longer greets any future, nor looks back at any past, it becomes a futile experience and self-consolation in vain In the emotions piled up day after day, he escaped everything but obeyed the time and kept moving forward.
So friends are so important. If the audience is the person who reads the letter, after listening to all this, they will think that this is just a young boy muttering, and then silently walk away. However, friends will not, so one person's story becomes the story of several people, the lives of several people are mixed with youth, and everything starts to change.

","This movie follows a freshman named Charlie throughout his first year of high school. He quickly becomes friends with step siblings Sam and Patrick and their friend group. This movie isn't your classic shy kid stories but steps up and covers thing like sexual abuse, mental Illness, and drugs, Although there are cheesy scenes of the high schoolers at homecoming or how they spend their free time, the film seems to be able to shade that and really give you the hear warming feeling it offers. Something that blew my mind is that the author, Stephen Chbosky actually directed this film. It is rare to see authors directing movies for their books let alone making it a great movie. The Perks of Being a Wallflower also had a pretty amazing cast in my opinion. There are too many people to name but a lot of actors in this movie you most likely have seen in other films, the acting made me really care for these characters and what was going on in their lives. My favorite character was Patrick played by Ezra Miller. He always put in 110% and you could tell, he did a phenomenal job on a difficult role to play. I love the movie but some things just kept me from giving it the big 10/10. The director knew how he wanted his scenes too look more than anybody and the indivsual scenes looked amazing but when it came to piecing the scenes together I seemed to get lost or confused at some parts on how they got from one place to another. Anotjher part that bugged me is that they really crammed a big part of the moive into about 10 minutes towards the end. The highschool year is ending and so would all their hangouts and relationships but it seemed to be quickly waved over.

It has moments of intimacy and sweet teen romance, also paired with great comedic moments brilliantly delivered. But the thing that stands out the most in this film is it's raw emotion and portrayal of serious, relevant problems in our world today. The author of the novel and screenwriter of this film understands that this movie would be sold short if it did not dive into the minds of these teens and deal with their issues, which is done confidently and very effectively.<br/><br/>The acting is great in this film, with Logan Lerman easily giving the best performance of his career. His character has struggles and issues, and Lerman does a phenomenal job portraying these and making the character so relatable. He embodies this shy boy that grows and changes throughout the film and makes it irresistible to root for him. Emma Watson is great as always, breathing life into a complicated and spirited character. She takes hold of every scene she's in and adds so much heart to this movie. And Ezra Miller delivers a performance that is guaranteed to stick with you. He is a scene-stealer with arguably the funniest lines of the film that are presented with great comedic timing. But he also portrays something that so many teens struggle with and are forced to deal with when going through their high school years, and he makes it feel so real and authentic. His performance cannot be overlooked.<br/><br/>The movie is directed and written by the author of the novel, Stephen Chbosky, and his witty script and confident direction allow the movie to flow seamlessly. There is no pacing issues, each scene being relevant and important to the overall narrative. The cinematography is great and adds to the films warm feeling, and has a soundtrack that fits perfectly with the film.<br/><br/>It is a very well crafted movie that understands what it is, and isn't scared to tell serious stories and provide deeper messages for audience members. It is a movie that grips you with it's characters and carries you with it's storytelling. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a film that stands tall in the high school/teen romance collection of movies."

In modern Hollywood, there are countless films that belong to the high school sub-genre and in most cases they are nothing but an entertaining mish-mash of stereotypical characters and generic love stories. In most cases though, they are still a great pleasure to watch, but something inside of me is still unsatisfied with it, as it yearns for a specific type of originality that just hasn't been there in most films I've watched so far. I knew I was in for something special when I felt that already within the first minutes of this romantic drama this feeling hasn't accompanied me in the slightest. Based on his own novel, writer-director Chbosky helmed the movie adaptation of his drama himself and who else but the one who invented the characters and their story around them is capable of bringing it to the big screen magnificently? That's probably a huge advantage, as he knows what's the core of his narration and how it needs to be brought to life. To be honest, he's done an impressive job. First of all, the cast is absolutely well chosen and it was a great decision to let newcomers play the protagonists (well, except for Ms. Watson, of course). The main trio consisting of Charlie, Sam and Patrick are some of the most well conceptualised characters I've seen recently and Lerman, Watson and Miller didn't just portray them magnificently - the made them come alive. They all are extremely likable with their weird natures and way of getting along in society. It felt like I knew them for my whole life as I followed them through the depicted ups and downs of being a teenager on the verge of graduation. The film's basically a coming of age story centered around the friendship of high school students, but even though it has a pinch of stereotypes in it, it manages to distance itself from them and immediately create something more outstanding and takes an absolutely original direction instead. What impressed me the most is how the film's characters are far away from being perfect and also have problems they struggle with. Although it's never named directly all of them obviously suffer from some sort of mental illness and/or trauma and I think that's a brave decision, as it's not just the bright side of school life, but the shadow side as well. In an equally insightful manner it also doesn't hesitate to depict the benefits and problems of sexuality. I take my hat off to the decision to make Ezra Miller's Patrick an openly gay character and I think it's an outstanding move to thus give people struggling with their sexual orientation a voice and telling them that it's all but a bad thing. Cause it simply isn't. Furthermore, it teaches an important message about growing up and the importance of friendship in general. The chemistry between the characters is simply genuine and thus the approach to say that good friends is all you need works out so well and shows outcasts, loners and wallflowers that there are others like them and that they are never alone in this world. Next to this, the film has a wonderful and sensitive pace that allows the viewer to experience all the emotions in a never boring way that could not have been any better. The film grabbed me from start to finish and I never lost my curiosity for it in any way. It's tremendously touching and heartwarming and heartbreaking all the same. Also, the twist in the end came out of nowhere and was as heartbreaking as it was beautifully elaborated, as it thus has given Charlie even more depth to his already struggling and troubled character. All in all, this romantic drama is equally heartwarming and heartbreaking and combines so many particular aspects that make it reach perfection. From outstanding character development to a fitting soundtrack it has it all. It's a magnificent drama that gives those a voice who struggle, who don't know how to deal with their lives and who go through so much and think they are alone and teaches them that whatever they go through, that they always have friends and that they are never really alone with it. It's a perfect drama. The final scene when they drive through the tunnel, with David Bowie's ""Heroes"" playing over the stereo during Charlie's monologue, with this incredibly touching camera work and inspiring words - that's when I knew that this film deserves nothing but a full score, as it has given me goosebumps and made me cry for it's sheer beauty. This film is one of a kind and one of the best of the last decade. Perfection!"

","""We choose the love we think we deserve,"" and until you find that one, sitting there suspended in time, it's a ton of trial and error. A wallflower is said to be a most interesting type of individual, but externally they are shy, and people take no notice of the brilliance within. For a time, this used to be me - Charlie. ""Sing me to sleep; I don't want to wake up on my own anymore... Deep in the cell of my heart, I would feel so glad to go.""<br/><br/>Life can be cruel and ruled by time. It seems that when we are young time drags along, however when we are old it hastens and never slows. The years we have in front of us, no matter the age, are all that we have. We can't choose where we come from but we can choose where we are going. ""And there are people who forget what it's like to be 16 when they turn 17. I know these will all be stories someday. And our pictures will become old photographs. We'll all become somebody's mom or dad.""<br/><br/>Stephen Chbosky translated the novel onto celluloid in such a dramatic and artistic way that it was as humble as it was boastful in its execution. Feeling the progression of each character's developmental growth, as an intended audience viewer, is where this film establishes response with the audience; thus the foundation for the overall attraction and gravitational pull, and flux of emotions becomes paramount.<br/><br/>There are specific moments in life that we desperately yearn to eclipse us in such a profound way that once they've occurred it will be better than what our minds dreamt up. Once that moment happens, we will no longer be writing alone but participating with those that we love, and that love us right back. ""I can see it...

","Ah yes this movie about privileged rich kids dealing with their meaningless shallow problems like the lingering trauma of childhhood sexual abuse, dealing with grief over your best friend's suicide, being openly gay and receiving brutal homophobia and dismissal from the man you love, being cheated on and abandoned in relationships and dealing with depression and crippling social anxieties by making connections and bonding with people, to find some form of solace and beauty in a world filled with such deep pain. this movie was the first time i ever saw someone that felt like me, and it's still one of the only ones. this movie has helped me through initial doubts over my diagnosis, over depressive periods throughout my entire life, through my intense self hatred and physically violent lapses. it has existed with me and grown with me and now as i approach the end of my adolescent self, i look back and imagine charlie and dream for him a world where his traumas healed and everything became okay. makes me believe that mine will too."

","I usually don't rewatch movies as to me the plot is usually one of the most important aspects of a movie. Well, of course, this is move is an exception.<br/><br/>I have never read the book, so I went into watching this movie with no particular expectation. And it touches me in so many ways. Each character has their own struggles, and however unique they may be, everyone can relate to in one way or another. But what is most important to me is that it teaches me to learn the importance of noticing. It is easy for us to focus on our own problems, and not realizing that others might go through something similar, or that they might need our help as well. That's what Charlie is throughout the whole movie - a wallflower. He notices everyone's struggle, desire, and becomes their friend. As yet, there is not much attention on Charlie, until the very end of the movie where we see the story unfolds. This movie will leave you both happy and sad at the same time - go figure."

","This is this generations' ""Breakfast Club"" as a group of western Pa. misfits come together and help each other deal with their issues.<br/><br/>Charlie (Logan Lerman imitating Jesse Eisenberg) is a loner who has issues with normal socializing. He is a freshman in high school and befriends Patrick (Ezra Miller) an in the closet senior who is also an outcast. Patrick introduces Charlie to his low self esteem step sister Sam (Emma Watson) who Charlie immediately takes to. Charlie ends up joining their circle of friends, one that includes the frequent use of drugs and alcohol. The drug and alcohol use is shown as being nonchalant, perhaps in a realistic sense, at least the one I grew up with.<br/><br/>The group has a number of colorful characters which add to the mix. The film has multiple themes including ""We accept the love we think we deserve."" The teens have heart and recognize the needs of each other and are able to give and accept. The weirdest thing of the film was the use of cassette tapes. Seriously?<br/><br/>The soundtrack reflected the feelings of Charlie. It starts out with an acoustical number that was sad, lame, and untalented. It picks up at the tunnel scene. At one point we listen to XTC ""Dear God"" a tune on my mix tape. There was a scene where I expected to hear J Geils chime in with ""Love Stinks"" but it didn't happen.<br/><br/>This is a film for older teens, which some parents would object to. Good acting. Decent plot, although the aunt thing wasn't that well developed.<br/><br/>Parental Guide: No sex or nudity. 1 f-bomb. Sexual themes including homosexuality. Another hit film from Pittsburgh."

The cast is glamorous, though Emma do look a bit old fashioned (but hey, the movies set in the 90s right? It's not like popular girls are always the same through out the years) Miller as Patrick is funny and has weight. The plot is great, even though I hear there were a lot of deletions from the books. Important characters arc are very well developed, and I have to say this is probably the furthest step a teenage film production has taken.<br/><br/>In many ways, The Perks Of Being a Wallflower succeeded.

Also the film shows bullying, mental illness even sexual assault, things that every person found/collided in his teen years.
And I'm fascinated by the dialogues in the movie. They didn't seem even a little forced. Everything was just done with attention to the detail. I still get goosebumps because of the last scene. So with so many positive things I can't rate the movie with anything than an 8 (maybe I even underrated it)."

","Returning to my own life after connecting myself to the tear-jerking story that is ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"" I knew I couldn't avoid writing this review if I wanted any closure for myself on what I'd seen. This comedic drama, or ""dramedy"" in the business, was something I was recommended to watch several years ago, but refused as it didn't seem interesting to me. Seeing it now so much later, I deeply regret avoiding such a relatable, heartwarming tale for as long as I did.
The movie follows Charlie Kelmeckis (Logan Lerman), an eccentric, kind-hearted young man, through his Freshman Year at Mill Grove High School in what seems to be the 80's or 90's, as there's no smart-technology to be found (which is fantastic). He quickly gets popular with the older crowd of Seniors, and grows particularly close with Sam (Emma Watson) and Patrick (Ezra Miller) in their debaucherous adventures and emotional pasts. All of this makes for a light-hearted drama that does everything you would expect it to in the best possible ways. Logan portrays Charlie in an incredibly personal way, allowing the audience to step into the protagonist's shoes with much more ease than one may expect. Ezra as Patrick was also objectively fantastic, and while Emma Watson's American accent definitely needs work, you still saw Sam in the film rather than Emma, a barrier that's difficult for exceptionally-famous actors to cross. These three amongst several other young talents are what made this movie what it is to me.
Aside from it being quite impressive from an acting standpoint, Perks was wonderfully shot and I especially loved the POVs of Charlie when his nights didn't go so well, especially when he was drugged without him knowing at some late-night parties with weed or ecstasy. The whole movie is sort of told in a way where you won't understand it if you look away for even a few seconds, which I think is logical for the story. But that's not to say it's not flawed. The story can easily get rather repetitive, as most of the characters appear to either want to get Charlie high or have sex with him, and this happens particularly with Mary Elizabeth, the girl he dates because he's too scared to turn her down. But through every character's pain and suffering, everything turned out just fine for everyone in the end. The ultimate lesson to be learned from this nostalgic look back for moviegoers to their own high school life, is that your teenage years are really difficult to get through, but once you do, nothing's stopping you from taking on the world at full force. I can only hope that's what others take form this movie, but it's a lesson that has stuck with me and personally helped me in a few instances of my life.
If you think this movie is interesting, go see it. You won't regret it. And even if you're on the fence, give it a shot. I did and I loved it. I'll be honest, if you think it sounds bad, chances are you won't be a fan, but if you're being dragged along by your partner to go see it, it won't be as much of a snoozefest as it seems, even with the PG-13 rating. This definitely isn't the most action-packed or super-dramatic movie-it's simple, emotional, and wonderful. If that sounds like a treat to you, go off and see life from a wallflower's perspective as soon as you can. I give this movie a 9 out of 10."

","The topic of mental health in films is a touchy one because either the film hits it on the nose and portrays the mental illness accurately or it is inaccurately depicts mental illness. However Stephen Chbosky who wrote and directed The Perks of Being a Wallflower does an exemplary job at depicting the effects mental illness has on people. This is shown through the dynamic characters, Charlie who's played by Logan Lerman, Sam by Emma Watson, and Patrick who is played by Ezra Miller. Another movies that does an amazing job at depicting mental health in a film is Silver Linings Playbook which also uses dynamic and relatable characters that accurately depict the effects mental illnesses have on the ones around them in their lives. This overall idea of how mental illness affects your actions and the effects it has on the people around them.
We first see this this in the character Charlie who is a freshman in high school who is trying to get a foothold in the new school. While in the meantime he trying to cope with his friends suicide and the death of his Aunt Helen, one solution to lessen the blow was to write things down in order to express the way he feels. Charlie soon befriends his English teacher Bill Anderson who's played by Paul Rudd, and they instantly connect for their love of literature and writing. We are later introduced to Patrick and Sam who Charlie meets at a football game and they instantly accept him into their little circle of friends. At the game we learn that Patrick and Sam are step siblings. After they accept him into their group Charlie becomes more comfortable with his new friends and opens up more with them. However all the emotional turmoil oil he's been through has a deep effect on him and his relationships with everyone. The first instance of this shown is when Charlie begins to form feelings for Sam but feels he can't express them because he isn't ready mentally for a relationship. This shows how the death of his Best friend Michael and the death of his Aunt Helen have had on him. It also makes Charlie to hesitant to open up to them right away however when he does it's about Michael's suicide and it shocks Sam and Patrick. But being the good friends they are they instantly are there to support him. Which demonstrates the effect friendships have on one's life, which is only one of the many ideas Chbosky highlights in this movie. We will later see how much of an impact this tight group of friends have on each other and how it evolves throughout the film. Whether it be supporting each other emotionally or defending their friends physically. However this new improved life of Charlie's where he has a mentor in Bill and his new found friends you can still see the effects his mental health has on him. Chbosky does this too accurately show the mourning process everyone has and how to affects the person whether it be there thought process or their overall emotional and mental stability. The feelings that Charlie portrays Meeks this character very relatable for the audience in order to empathize with him and allows more character depth. Charlie's isn't the only character that has a lot of depth and relatability, his friends all have stuff they are dealing with whether is be Patrick's struggles he's facing for being gay and his complicated relationship with Brad the Varsity quarterback who still hasn't came out. Which helps the LGBT audience relate to those circumstances whether it be coming out and being embarrassed for the possible repercussions or fully accepting their sexuality. Another character who is very relatable to the audience is Sam who was sexually abused while she was younger. This helps those who have also been sexually abused empathize with her and makes the audience connect more with her. Chbosky does an excellent job through his depth of characters whether it be the main characters or the side characters. For example Charlie's sister who is in a very abusive relationship and is too scared to leave, she makes her relatable in the sense that she is relatable to whoever is in a toxic relationship or used to be and can relate to the situations Charlie's sister is in. Chbosky's ability to have relatable characters throughout the entire film helps the audience connect to the characters and his ability to flesh out both main and side characters is a great achievement because some films often fall short of this feat. Chbosky also accurately depicts the effects addiction and mental health can go hand in hand. This is really shown through Charlie who as we've said is mentally in a dark place gets introduced to drugs becomes more and more attracted to weed because it helps him somewhat ignore the harshness of reality. This shows how one's mental health can affect the actions and thought process of people. Another film that does this really well and with similar depth of characters is in Silver Linings Playbook through the affects their mental illnesses have on they're relationships with family, friends, and Luther loved ones. In The Perk of Being Wallflower we see how Charlie's mental health affects his relationships in his life whether it be with his parents or his confidence to start a romantic relationship out of fear he might get hurt again and just lack of self esteem he has during his grieving process. Not only does Chbosky use dynamic characters to make this film so incredible he also uses a lot of popular music which is shown through mix tapes which play a big role in the movies tone. Each mix tape is used to portray the way characters are feeling. For example when Charlie is lonely and sad, quieter music is played but when he's having fun with Sam and Patrick upbeat and fast pace music is playing. This and relatable characters are aspects that make this movie such an incredible movie.
In conclusion Chbosky's movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower accurately and almost perfectly depicts mental health in a movie and common issues that face many people across the world. Whether it be the death of loved ones, coming to terms with their sexuality, physical and sexual abuse, and addiction and those are just the main social issues Chbosky tackles. What's even more incredible is that he doesn't this through different characters who exceed their role and really show the emotional toll it has on them through remarkable acting and the emotions the portray on screen. Finally all this is done smoothly and fleshes out all characters throughout the film making them relatable and also so real the audience can empathize with them. It also keeps the audience in suspense as to what each character will do next or what new thing we'll learn about their past or through their thought process."

","Do you want a film with Ezra Miller as Ezra Miller? You want to see Hermione doing a bad job doing an American accent? Do you want to see Ant man as Percy Jackson's mentor? If yes to any of these, that's a good reason to watch. What I loved most is how relatable the characters are, that's what made the movie. There's a kid with mental health issues trying to go through life like a normal kid, there's a gay guy dealing with the social negatives toward the gay community, and then there's are girl who's had a life of questionable decisions trying make it right. They may be in high school, but somehow, as someone who is in college, I found that I could still relate. They threw everything in here, not just LGBTQ & mental illness, they threw in bullying and even a hint of sexual assault. This was a lovely coming of age story of a kid who is surrounded by all of these issues, first hand or secondhand. This film is currently 6 years old and it's still relevant to what high school kids deal with today. Logan's performance was stellar, I think he has potential to do more meaningful roles like this and convey and emotional story. And Ezra, lol he's just Ezra, and he's a legend."

","""Everybody's going to hurt you. You just have to find the ones worth suffering for."" - Bob Marley<br/><br/>An adaptation of his own novel, director Stephen Chbosky's ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" stars Logan Lerman as Charlie, a shy, suicidal teenager. Ostracised at school, Charlie eventually bonds with a group of misfits, including Sam (Emma Watson) and Patrick (Ezra miller), a couple of free-spirits who, like Charlie, are hiding wounds and deep insecurities.<br/><br/>""We accept the love we think we deserve,"" a character states, the line encapsulating Chbosky's chief theme. Belittled by bigots, homophobes, rapists, abusive boyfriends and judgemental eyes, Chbosky's kids internalise persecution and so learn to hate themselves. Believing themselves incapable of being loved, they then embark on paths of self-destruction. All are eventually saved, however, Chbosky an optimist to the end. The future, art, love, friendship, even drugs and sex, have the power to rehabilitate at best, at worst provide good material for tortured artists; Charlie wants to be a writer.<br/><br/>""Wallflower's"" signature song is David Bowie's ""Heroes"", a ballad about beautiful losers who nevertheless occasionally taste victory. Life sucks, Chbosky says, but you can triumph in the face of adversity with a little help from your buddies, if only for a day. ""We are infinite!"" Sam screams after hearing Bowie for the first time, silhouetted against traffic lamps as she hurtles through a tunnel. It's a moment of ecstasy, possibility and emancipation, which our cast of kids hope to bottle and preserve and make last forever. But all tunnels end, and everyone's eventually spat back out into the black. The gang cope. They push past dog-eared copies of ""The Catcher In the Rye"" and moody tunes by The Smiths. They learn to survive, if only because they have few other alternatives.<br/><br/>""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" boasts some fine atmosphere, nice low-light photography and Chbosky's gang of hipsters are infectious. On the flip-side, Charlie and his friends are a giant writer's fantasy ‚Äì people like this don't quite exist in real life ‚Äì Emma Watson is miscast, Sam reeks of what Nathan Rabin infamous dubbed ""Manic Pixie Dream Girl"" clich√©s, a sexual abuse subplot oozes bad-taste and the film's last act overloads on sentimentality. The film costars the likable John Cusack and Paul Rudd. For contemporary kids, the film has become a minor classic.<br/><br/>8/10 ‚Äì See ""Ghost World"", ""The Spectacular Now"" and ""The Wackness""."

","Greatest movie I have ever seen. Could relate to Charlie on so many levels. Also, I would recommend Chbosky's book as well. The acting was terrific. I particularly enjoyed the love story between Emma and Logan's characters. I like the issues that it touched on. One of the only movies I am willing to re-watch. The movie makes you re-think the people around you. This is the only movie I have ever given a 10/10 out of over half a thousand as even its flaws can be viewed as purposeful and necessary to the work as a whole.

The acting is superb, especially of the three lead actors. <br/><br/>Logan Lerman of the Three Musketeers is incredible as the quiet shy and troubled teen. He shows his anxiety and nervousness with ease. Ezra Miller is one of the stars. His role as Patrick is one of the most memorable ones. Emma Watson, in her first major role post harry potter acts so convincingly that she manages to make everyone forget that she used to play a harry potter character...something which Daniel Radcliffe has not been able to successfully pull off yet.<br/><br/>Maybe this film shows what can happen if the author of the book which inspired it is also the director. Stephen Chbosky's semi autobiographical book of the same name is lovingly adapted in this film and in some places it feels as if you are reading a good book. The story is really touching and for many high-schoolers and college students they will relate to it. The music runs smoothly with the film and elevates or depresses the mood very effectively when required. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast gives a good performance and despite this being a high school movie, it does not succumb to clich√©s. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is a refreshing and heart touching film about love, loss and feeling infinite. See it if you want to see a drama which works on many levels."

","Having watched the ad for this movie on t.v., I was immediately drawn in by the impressive cast, including the likes of Emma Watson, Paul Rudd, Ezra Miller and of course the protagonist Logan Lerman. <br/><br/>Stephen Chbosky, the author of the book (by the same name) on which this movie is based wrote the screenplay for the film. He succeeded in creating a true masterpiece. Charlie, a shy teenager entering high school in the 1990's provides us with a narrative throughout the film. Isolated initially, we note his intriguing fascination with the observation of those around him. However, when Charlie is adopted by a small, alternative group of seniors, each with their own dark story to tell, he begins to come out of his shell.<br/><br/>Chbosky hit the nail on the head with his writing. The language Charlie narrates in is simple and encapsulates his changing state of mind, the very subtle book references not creating any confusion as many book to film do. Charlie is damaged by his past and we grasp as the film unfurls that he does not quite understand himself what holds him back. <br/><br/>Each relationship is true to its identity in the movie, doing the book a justice I believe nobody but Chbosky himself could have done. I enjoyed seeing Charlie develop with Sam, Patrick, and Mr. Anderson (among others) individually, shaping his character from multiple angles. <br/><br/>Although after reading the book and gaining a full understanding of the cause of Charlie's mental state, I think there was a message in the ambiguity of this particular topic in the film. Chbosky didn't want us to see it is a movie epitomizing the things which hold us back in life, he wanted it to symbolize coming of age, discovering yourself and exploring new things. An excellent movie, I would recommend it highly."

This movie amazed me it portrays the different types of best friends and basic teenage problems. This title is heartfelt while also being funny. Ezra Miller, Logan Lerman, and Emma Watson made an amazing performance. Some might find this movie dramatic or maybe cheesy, but it's not at all.

","'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' follows Charlie, a high school freshman with more psychological issues than friends. Don't feel too bad for him though, he is soon befriended by two seniors, one of which is played by Emma Watson (hubba hubba). His friendship helps him overcome some of his issues, for a time, but it seems that his real battle is with himself, and only he can be a part of the fight.<br/><br/>My brief synopsis aside, I can honestly say that this is what a John Hughes film would be if he would have been born twenty years later. I started this movie with every intention of not liking it, mission impossible. The character development is complex, and I actually find myself caring for these made up people, Charlie in particular, who is so awkward sometimes I had to pause the movie because well..I worried about the guy. The movie deals with all of the problems of a high schooler from not having friends to being gay, and it even covers more serious issues towards the end. The ability to create genuine characters that the viewer will not only like, but care about, seems to be a lost art in this generation, but in this case I think someone did their homework.<br/><br/>I think that having a writer who is also a director can be a double edged sword. It is good to take your vision and direct it without any interference from another person, but at times it is good to have a second opinion. Writing is like a child, you fall in love with it maternally, therefor even if it is sitting in a classroom covered in glitter, eating glue, it is still your perfect little ball of sunshine. Luckily, I do not think that director Stephen Chbosky let his emotions interfere with his project.<br/><br/>My only complaint is the ending, which seems rushed. Chbosky drops a bomb on us, then fifteen minutes later before we have even come to terms with it the credits are rolling. What happened? Oh well, nothing is perfect (Not even Emma Watson). We accept the movies that we think we deserve, and after some of the flops of the year, I think we deserved this one."
"snowspirit7","10","0","0","4 June 2014"," It was okay...but definitely not infinite
","Everyone goes on about this movie like it is legendary and life changing. I thought it was okay. The basic story is a teenager named Charlie (Logan Lerman) is having trouble fitting into a new school. Unlike a lot of teenage dramas, he actually has some real problems. He is mentally ill. I really applaud this story for tackling a topic like this, one that is ignored or over dramatised in films. I thought they dealt with it realistically and respectfully. Charlie is then taken under the wing of two seniors, Sam (Emma Watson) and Patrick (Ezra Miller), who show him the way of the world. The story itself has some really great aspects to it. Some scenes in the movie were also very unique and thought provoking. Some of the best include: the dance, the cafeteria fight, the scene where Sam and Charlie talk at the first party and of course, the famous car scene. Unfortunately, many of the other scenes are easily forgettable, some even uncomfortable to watch. Though the movie does tackle some unique issues, other aspects of the storyline were slightly clich√©d. I also found some parts of the story very unclear to follow. Having not read the book, my first time watching this movie I was downright confused during many of the scenes, especially those with flashbacks as I thought those were not clearly represented. The characters themselves were a bit bland. Charlie, Sam and Patrick all have fantastic back stories, but I found hearing about their stories much more interesting than actually watching the characters interact. There are some other (brief) characters such as their friends and family who frankly I cannot remember anything about as they were really looked over. I thought that Emma Watson and Ezra Miller did a good job at working with what they were given, as they made the characters more interesting (than they originally were anyway) but Logan Lerman, though excellent in some scenes, seemed slightly lacking in others. Overall, a good film. There's nothing terrible about it, and some aspects were really great. Others may have needed a little more thought. Based on some of the other reviews, this movie has changed people's lives and inspired them and that's great. But for me, I'm not sure if I'd watch it again. When I originally watched the trailer I thought it looked like an incredible film, so I was a little disappointed. It did not leave me feeling awed or 'infinite', but that I did get my money's worth out of it. So I suggest people give it a try, as you may just be that inspired by it."

You can connect with the characters so easily. The truth is I watched this film only for Emma watson, but the performance of Logar Lerman took my breath away. I have no words to describe how much I was impressed by his performance. Emma watson has also done an amazing job in this film. She is definitely growing as an actor in every film and you can feel that in her performance. <br/><br/>The introvert, shy boy who has an awful childhood meets a guy and a girl who change his life completely. They take him under their wing, become his friends, and shows him the true meaning of friendship. It's a very sweet story in which the boy fells in love with the girl but is too shy to tell her.

","Charlie is a 15 year-old freshman in high school that is shy and socially awkward. He counts down the days until he graduates and hopes that he will not turn bad again. On the first day of high school it is said that a student will make at least one friend that day. If a friend is made then the day was not so bad after all. Charlie did not make a friend on the first day of high school.<br/><br/>The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a 2012 film that was adapted from the 1999 paperback book. The director of the film, Stephen Chbosky, is also the screenplay writer and the books author. The film stars Logan Lerman as Charlie, Emma Watson as Sam, and Ezra Miller as Patrick portraying troubled teenagers. The film is a Mr. Mudd Productions movie that was distributed by Summit Entertainment.<br/><br/>Charlie, the main protagonist, narrates most of the movie. He often writes to a friend, whom is never revealed to be an actual person, about his daily complaints. The first friends he makes are Patrick and Sam at a football game. Patrick is a bubbly, homosexual senior that is the step-brother of Sam. Sam is also a senior and the step-sister of Patrick. These three characters become close throughout the movie as Charlie finds himself.<br/><br/>An event from the movie that I found important is the scene where Charlie is having trouble with the friends he made. It has been awhile since they have spoken to Charlie and he is reverting back to his bad habit of blacking out. During lunch, Patrick is being beat up by jocks and Charlie goes to help and blacks out forgetting what happened. At another point in the movie, Charlie blacks out again and has to be put in the hospital to figure out why this is happening again. At this point, Charlie, and the audience, starts to piece to together why he is the way he is.<br/><br/>This movie was a heartfelt one that I would recommend to teenagers and young adults (college students). Each character has a story that is being told and that at least one other person could relate too. Not every person has the same exact story, but there may be some similarities that need to be seen. Maybe the film can only be truly understood by people who weren't always in the ""in"" crowd. People on the outside relate to things on the outside. I liked the movie because it had a message that people can take home with them. The specific message I received was that everything in one person's life can affect another even if they do not realize it. A message another person receives could be completely different."

","I loved this film. I usually dislike teen movies and generally avoid them, as I find them too shallow, tedious, repetitive of so many other teen movies, and boringly uninspiring beyond belief. Most are either badly acted, or directed, or bad script writing, or a little of each. Usually the teens have no respect, too much say and authority over their parents and other adults, are narcissistic and cause havoc wherever they go. This teen movie was different. It was beautifully well written, and directed. Beautifully acted. I was astonished by Emma Watsons acting abilities as I was never a fan. She is someone to watch as she matures more. I believe she will make an even bigger impact. But what I liked so much about this movie is the way the relationships flowed and blended so well together. I kept analyzing and thinking about it to find the right words and all I could think of is that it was like a beautiful slow gentle waltz. They embraced each other, comforted, strengthened, and upheld one another thru their own personal teen trials and heartaches that they were trying to overcome, so that eventually, one day, they would become responsible mature adults and accountable for their lives. It was sad at times but not darkly depressing. Their enthusiasm and joy for life bought you out of that. It was inspiring in a gentle way that gave you hope. And I just loved their joy. They had struggles in all areas that I so related to from my own teen years that most parents and adults don't want to see or hear about¬Ö the drugs, sex, music, abuse, death, suicide, smoking, drinking, wanting and needing acceptance, times of loneliness, feelings of being an outcast and often a wallflower, and being misunderstood, making new friends, and enemies, which are usually bullies from inside and outside school life¬Ö. all very real in my teen days ~ and I'm now in my 50s! But I have to say again, it was beautifully put together, it flowed and blended so well. It said it all without going into dark, deep, graphic details. You could really feel their friendship. It was emotional without being sentimental. It wasn't shallow or demeaning. They had empathy, compassion, and a healthy, respectful love for one another. And it gave hope as each one healed and grew wings, finding their first steps on a journey to their future and adulthood. Yes, this teen movie was different. It held my attention from beginning to end. It touched my heart, moved my feelings, and reminded me of my own past teen-life. When it ended I sobbed. Not with sadness, but with hope! This is one movie I would recommend my teenagers to watch as I think its sensitive and inoffensive ~ if they are struggling to come thru their teens this movie could help to give some of them assurance and hope ~ a hopeful expectancy of good things for their future."
"l_rawjalaurence","8","0","0","16 February 2014"," A Lot More than Just a Teenage Angst Tale
","Superficially THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER is a tale of mental and physical growth, as introvert Charlie (Logan Lerman) has a torrid time during his first weeks at high school, but is eventually transformed by association with close friends Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson). As the action unfolds, however, so Stephen Chbosky's film - based on his own book - becomes a lot more complex in terms of content. We learn that Charlie and Sam's lives are intertwined in several ways, not all of them pleasant; they both had traumatic childhoods. Although ostensibly destined to be together, they cannot make that final step until the final reel. Likewise Patrick has to cope with the stress of having a relationship with Brad (Johnny Simmons) that is based on secrecy: Brad cannot admit his sexuality to himself, his friends or his father. THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER shows in meticulous detail just how difficult it can be to negotiate high school, especially in cultures that value conformity and find difference extremely hard to handle. The film has a shocking ending, where we discover the truth about Charlie's life, and why he has been so introverted in the past. No one, it seems, has been prepared to listen to him, least of all his family and friends. The three protagonists are excellent in their roles, showing a technical and emotional range, especially when it comes to depicting repressed emotion. The supporting cast are equally good, notably Paul Rudd as a bookish English teacher. Definitely worth watching more than once."

","The Perks of Being a Wallflower came recommended to me by a friend after I revelled in the watching of The Spectacular Now. My limited knowledge of the book led me to believe it would be the standard introvert kid turned popular high school socialite, like many a title before it. However, the film presented me with a tortured protagonist who finds his place amongst another bunch of misfits. It is the relationship of this band of friends, which is so expertly interwoven with the main storyline that captured my imagination. These relationships, coupled with an excellent soundtrack, helped me to reach a profound examination of society; a realisation that despite our own self-doubts, that we are part of a society where everyone has their own issues. It is in no way a life- changing film, but it is one that will leave you contemplating your own social decisions."

Emma gives a strong performance as Sam - you can tell that she really understands the character, however she does struggle a bit with the American accent. Not to worry Ezra is hilarious but not gimmicky, and can flip to a somber tone at a moment's notice and have everyone spellbound. Also great performances from Mae Whitman, Nina Dobrev and Johnny Simmons. The young cast is truly the heart of the film and are all really great.

First of all, the soundtrack was perfectly selected. It displayed Charlie's confused emotions throughout. Being a music student (and aiming to be a music soundtrack supervisor or work in the film music industry) I admired the choice of songs and felt it truly reflected Charlie's character. Secondly, I enjoyed how well the script was acted by all of the actors. They portrayed an honest awkwardness as young adults often have and yet their relationships and friendships were relatable and realistic. Thirdly, I feel obligated to mention my respect for Logan Lerman as an actor and must mention how greatly he played Charlie.

Most films would have the person being shy and then the other person would bring that person out of their shy-box, but in life it never really works like that, if you're shy or not, you usually have to take the initiative, and I like that also about this movie.

I have heard many people say that this movie deals with serious topics in an insensitive way. I do not think that is the case. I see Charlie and other characters react to situations the same way I think I would. With that said, I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone."
"OneRingToRuleThemAll13","10","0","0","3 December 2013"," One of the most beautiful and moving films I have ever seen. A masterpiece 10/10
","When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was totally sucker punched. It was almost like actors I admired were acting out the parts in my life that had been once horrible and are now better. Everything (well, almost) that happens in this movie has taken place in my life, and I love the idea of people finally acknowledging us wallflowers. <br/><br/>That's not the only reason the movie is amazing, of course. I mean, this could've still been badly executed and been a total bore with really cheesy acting and situations. Fortunately, it totally wasn't. Director Stephen Chbosky adapts his wonderful novel about an introvert high-schooler finally being accepted as a part of society by a handful of seniors with such a passion so flawlessly presented by these Triple-A actors that you can really feel the love for the subject matter in every scene. <br/><br/>First of all, the cinematography: it's beautiful. The scenes presented here are filmed with such a quiet fire that it never goes over-the-top, never making you cringe and landing every single emotion on you it intends. The snow, the streets, the dim lighting, everything almost reflects Charlie's psyche: he's a shy, warm but very dark person with lots of demons. Demons that are later revealed to be so much more than previously thought. <br/><br/>But of course, all of this couldn't be achieved without absolutely breathtaking actors playing these complex but at the same time deceptively simple people. Logan Lerman as Charlie is so perfect that you could almost think it's his twin brother or something. He has never tackled something so deep, and I applaud him thunderously for achieving balance between being both quiet and at the same time being always able to let you know what he's feeling through body language. Not everybody can do that, but he certainly can. Emma Watson is also once again amazing as the ''free spirit'' Sam, and Charlie's love interest. She's funny, warm and playful, and Ms. Watson also brings such a fire to the table that is just so deliciously awesome to watch. Ezra Miller and Paul Rudd were both also stellar in their roles of hilarious, homosexual Patrick and Charlie's understanding and wise teacher Mr. Anderson, respectively, among others.<br/><br/>The script... oh, the script!! It's amazing. Every powerful scene is powerful BECAUSE of the words being said, which are so touching and true you can't help but smile (heck, there are times when I even cried, whether for joy or feeling bad for Charlie) even if you can't relate. And even if you don't, there are plenty of awesome plot lines and witty humor to keep you interested throughout. Rest assured, fans of the book, Stephen's writing is intact in this adaptation. <br/><br/>The music is also one of the highlights of this film. It can be loud or soft, whimsical, whatever: it's still awesome. Every scene is complimented by it. Or, the ones that matter anyway. It's so good you'll find yourself with it stuck in your head or humming it if you rewatch. If you've seen the trailer, you will have the epic experience of listening to the bad@#% ''It's Time'' by Imagine Dragons in it. It's not in the actual movie, though, as this is a period piece. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie is awesome, whether you can relate or just looking for an excellent dramedy. If you give it a chance, I can pretty much guarantee you will love it. It's got everything: humor, drama, great acting, a very surprising reveal at the end... Heck, if you don't like it, I owe you $20!!"

","well, the movie is pretty good but for me personally the book was better, they took out some important things. *SPOILERRRRR.* for example i believe in the book his sister get pregnant, the boyfriend leaves her, she tells him it was a false alarm and he wants to get back together. in the movies that never happens which for me was a point in the book where Charlie and his sister really got along which was important to me. same for everything with his family, it wasn't in the movie and just little things just like that. if you haven't read the book have fun, but if you have then it's probably just like a regular book to movie adaptation."

","Pure genius, the way that the story is told is absolutely fantastic. The angles, time and script truly impressed me. You have absolutely no idea of several facts that are massive important to the history. The director chose to tell you something out of context, with a raw and shocking style, and that makes the story amazing. I'm really happy that I've watched this, even more after i thought it was a cheesy movie with no concept. I was really, really wrong. Thank you Stephen Chbosky. Another beautiful surprise, that made the movie even better, is the amazing soundtrack. I'm a big The Smiths fan. It's like the movie actually tells many stories that Morrissey tried to tell us all these years, ""Asleep"" was a perfect choice for this."

","I absolutely adore this movie. It contains the best message: Be yourself and never be ashamed of that. You are you so don't ever let anybody change that. The Perks of Being a Wallflower made me think about life in a whole other perspective. I may not have the most amazing life, but I do have at least of few people around me that love me. They care for me and comfort me and that's all I can ask for. Think about the Perks of Being a Wallflower if you ever feel like no one understands and you will find hope again. Perks is about how hard life truly is, but also how life can be so incredible in that littlest moment. Remember those little moments and life will be that much more amazing."

","'the perks of being a wallflower is great movie for emotional young teens especially those who are going through teenage drama. I was in year 8 when a first watched this film which was recommended by my teenaged friend. When I got home from school i viewed it on this site and the rating was well so yes i decided to watch it. During the film their were a lot of connections between me and the characters in the film. It seemed like we were going through the same teenaged drama faise. The ending also was great it reminded me of the ending of the classic 1985 'The Breakfast Club' but even better, there were so many quotes such as 'we are infinite' which was the last words of the main character in this film. Teenagers or not i recommend this film because it really connects with the viewer."

","This movie is amazing. From the beginning, to the end, the writing is well above average, and the musical accompaniment is great.<br/><br/>However, the one thing that stands out above all else is the acting. Perhaps the finest three performances I have ever seen in the industry propelled this movie to the top of my list for this decade so far. Logan Lerman is absolutely fantastic as Charlie, although he looks a bit old for the part. Emma Watson is perfect as Sam, and Ezra Miller is the perfect Patrick. The tension, and the coping, and the other underlying themes are all as fantastically portrayed as the characters themselves. You will feel everything that they do with the force of a train.<br/><br/>As with any film, there are differences between the book and the film, most notably the change of the tunnel song. However, the movie is still gorgeous, and the characters are so full and rich, that you can't help but feel with them.<br/><br/>I wanted to put in some comment about Slut and the Falcon, but I would probably just ruin the delivery, so I'll leave you to watch it instead."

","Charlie (Logan Lerman) is a shy, bookish, high-school freshman. He is so shy that he doesn't say a word in his first day of English class. Charlie is so shy that his English teacher, Mr. Anderson, (Paul Rudd) befriends him. Charlie finds another friend in high school senior, Patrick (Ezra Miller) in shop class. Patrick introduces Charlie to his half-sister, Sam, (Emma Watson) at a football game. Charlie immediately falls in love with Sam, even though Sam is in love with Craig (Reece Thompson) who is in college. At a party, Charlie eats funny brownies and makes more friends. Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman) is a bossy girl, who wants Charlie to go to a Sadie Hawkins day dance with her. Charlie and Mary Elizabeth go out for two weeks, but then Charlie kisses Sam during a game of truth or dare, and that one act puts their group of friends in danger. But then Charlie gets into a fight with Brad (Johnny Simmons) and his bully friends, they are bullying Patrick. During the fight Charlie blacks out. When he wakes up, the bullies are knocked out, and Charlie is still standing. Why is a football player and his goons bullying Patrick? Why is Charlie blacking out? <br/><br/>One word for this movie is overwrought. A lot of the experiences in this movie don't exactly ring true to the high school experience I remember. First Charlie is so shy, he can barely talk, but soon he has a bunch of high school senior friends, albeit outcast friends. Seniors never hang out with freshman, that just doesn't happen, seniors don't have intense feelings for freshmen, no matter how many funny brownies they eat. Everything in this movie is so intense and condensed that 4 years' worth of angst packed into one year. But then all of a sudden, the movie redeems itself through a reveal, I won't say what the reveal is, but it ties the movie together nicely. <br/><br/>The romance between Charlie and Sam is still unrealistic, but the story makes more sense and it's grounded in something besides the everyday high school angst. There's a lot of drug use portrayed in this film, not the usual pot smoking, but there's a scene where Charlie takes LSD, and so I don't think tweens should watch it, even though the movie is rated PG 13, older teens can watch it, and talk about it with your parents or an older sibling, because there are a lot of issues in this movie, and you will want to discuss these issues with someone older, if you are a teen. I don't necessarily agree with their point of view on peer pressure and drugs, but I will leave that to you, gentle reader.<br/><br/>The acting is quite good. Emma Watson struggles a bit with her American accent, but it holds up well enough and she gives a good, heartfelt performance. The real stars are the supporting cast. Logan Lerman plays Charlie with a sincerity and earnestness that is rare in these coming of age films. Ezra Miller is wonderful as Patrick, playing the serious and comedic scenes with equal aplomb. Mae Whitman is also very good as Mary Elizabeth, she handles the complexity of her role well. And it's nice to see Paul Rudd in a serious, contemplative, role, he acquits himself quite nicely. It's a refreshing change from his comedic roles. The actors that play the teens look a lot older than teens, but that's a minor detail.<br/><br/>It's a long movie, an hour and 45 minutes, but it's paced well, and there's a good story to be told, so watch it.<br/><br/>Find out about the perks of reading my blog.

Perks of being a wallflower doesn't just tell a story, this movie stands out from all those terrible lame boring high school movies who don't stick to their plots very well. I don't care if this movie isn't pleasantly rich enough to be listed on the top 250, it changes your life completely, go watch it. I saw it 30 times and counting with my friends and family and they said i had great taste in movies. Its because everyone can relate to this movie just like the breakfast club. This movie will be on my shelf for decades just like when my mom had the breakfast club on her shelf years ago and i will remember the great times watching it because it completed my life.<br/><br/>Download it on iTunes, Watch it on Netflix, Watch it online i don't care, its a must see.

","I just watched this movie because of Emma Watson who was a beloved character in Harry Potter. After I seen this movie, I was moved and I do think this is a great movie. In the real life, outgoing people are very self-confident and at the same time they pay little attention to 'wallflower' or someone who is very introversive. But Patrick and Sam were not like this. They met Charlie and invited Charlie to get into their world. At the very end, I was very impressed by the idea delivered in this movie - being an outsider is no good, only participation can really make you feel more and experience more, get love from others as well as make others feel your love."

","In my project of watching IMDb's Top 250 list (of August 9 2013) I have come to number 249, which is ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"". The movie is based on the novel of the same name by Stephen Chbosky.<br/><br/>In the movie you follow Charlie, who has just moved up in High School after being bullied for the last years, and if it wasn't bad enough his only friend has just committed suicide. In the beginning he feels lonely, but after becoming friends with Sam and Patrick his life becomes so much better. He isn't just a Wallflower anymore, but a social human being. I think that Logan Lerman and Emma Watson do good jobs portraying Charlie and Sam. However, I think Ezra Miller does the best job in his eccentric portray of Patrick. You really come to feel connected to these characters, which I think is important in the creating of a good movie. <br/><br/>I will give the movie a 9 out of 10 stars cause it is a very good movie and I highly recommend it. Prehaps I will take a look at the novel one of the days."

It can make you feel like you're on top of the world, one moment, and the next your eyes are pouring. <br/><br/>Let me just say that this film shows what it is like to have true friends, how it feels to be in love and simply, oh ever so simply, how it feels for you to be free in the world, and to not have a care about anything else in the world.

Nobody should have been abused like that even though it happens every day. It never happened to me.<br/><br/>Nobody can say that their life is hard after seeing this movie.

If it didn't have these interesting parts in the film I probably would have not watched it until the end. Even though I enjoyed this film, my parents fell asleep whilst watching it, so maybe it is not as interesting to the older viewer and is better for younger people as they can relate to things that go on in their life, to parts in the film."

The casting was not only perfect, but the plot was great as well. Though I personally haven't read the book, my cousin, who has, said it followed the book as far as she can recall (she read it quite a while back) my only real issue with it, is that as it gets closer to the end, he has flashbacks of some sort, which makes it hard to follow, and in the end there doesn't really seem to be a close, like there is less of a plot at the end. Outside that, I loved it and was trilled to have finally watched it, great job to the director and actors and even more so to the author of the book."

","Just seen this very good movie and I know its very late. Couldn't get it out of my head. IMO, a well scripted drama, inspired from novel. The movie features three main teen characters, but it isn't an ordinary teen movie. 'Charlie' character reminds me of the young man from 'ordinary people (1980)', which also features three main characters but not teens. The songs (OSTs) from the movie are cool too. A Special mention to 'Come on Eileen' (""OMG, they are playing good music... living room routine"") and 'heroes' make the viewers to enjoy the movie better. Sad thing that this movie didn't fall upon the eyes of the academy. STILL IT IS INFINITE!"

I was reading the book when I came across the movie ... but I think this is one of those rare cases where the movie turns out better than the book and that is because of the cast.<br/><br/>Logan Lerman is fantastic. You really feel all the uncertainty, the inner turmoil, the self-imposed guilt and the pain that weigh down Charlie. His performance is so good that it's easy to overlook those who play ""Nothing"" and Sam, and all the others, but everyone was exceptionally good, although some of the better known actors like Paul Rudd, Dylan McDermott were definitely outshone by the three central actors.<br/><br/>At no time did you feel any acting was going on or that the dialogue came from a script. They really were Charlie, Patrick and Sam. Fantastic."

","It looks like another lying and silly American teenager high-school drama. All the typical characters are there. The cheerleaders, the football players, the weirdos and the nerds.<br/><br/>But as it goes deep inside Charlie's (Logan Lerman) life, it gets more and more dark. I'm Brazilian and I really don't know how it is the life of young north-Americans, but that was the most realistic movie about the theme that I ever watched.<br/><br/>Along with the problematics Patrick and his friend Sam - Ezra Miller and Emma Watson - Charlie, who is introspective and has no friends, finds a safe haven and is forced to confront the reality of his life and his mental issues. The slow soundtrack that includes The Smiths enhances the melancholy and makes everything more plausible, pushing away the clich√©.<br/><br/>A great turnover on the script at the end of the movie connects all the points and makes you think about your own reality. After all, is it so cool to be normal?"

A great thing about this film is that it also manages to appeal to an impossibly wide audience as anyone can relate to at least one area of the film.

"Likes_Ninjas90","7","2","5","28 November 2012"," What will it take for a mainstream film to pull no punches when it comes to adolescents and how much they carry on their shoulders?
","Stephen Chbosky has chosen to adapt and direct his own epistolary novel The Perks of Being a Wallflower. It's the story of fresher student Charlie (Logan Lerman), a lonely kid starting high school who is in need of some company. His sister Candace is busy with her abusive boyfriend and his brother is rarely seen. Charlie admires his English teacher Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd), who supplies him with extra work, but he still needs a real friend. He finds company in two older students: Sam (Emma Watson) and the flamboyant Patrick (Ezra Miller), who are step brother and sister. They invite Charlie into their circle of friends where they party and involve themselves in stage performances. Charlie is also introduced to Buddhist-Punk Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman), who develops feelings for him. However, the group becomes aware of Charlie's insecurities, including traumatic memories of his aunt and a friend who killed himself. <br/><br/>It's hard growing up. It's even more problematic writing about those experiences with candour. Stephen Chbosky says that his novel, published in 1999, isn't autobiographical but he relates to the experiences. Many others would also testify to that because according to the New York Times, over 700,000 copies of the novel were sold by 2007. Why then has it taken so long for a film adaptation? Until now the political climate has been unsettled. After its popular release, the novel was banned in places like Massachusetts and Long Island because of its frank depiction of sexuality and drug use. This censorship movement coincided with a bill in 2004 that was proposed by Alabama legislator Gerald Allen, who argued that all public libraries should be banned from purchasing books that ""promote homosexuality"", by containing gay characters or written by gay authors. As to how close the bill came to passing, Allen met with George W. Bush five times. <br/><br/>Since then, Hollywood has been increasingly liberal about sex so it's easier for films to explore the subject. However, studios still demand mainstream appeal, which means that compromises are made in exchange for financial support. Perks was developed by John Malkovich's Mr. Mudd studio but distributed by Summit Entertainment, who produced the Twilight films. This accounts for the timid approach to the subject matter. The film settles for being relatable and nostalgic, rather than insightful or upfront. It's a missed opportunity. I haven't read the novel, but I am told it cuts even deeper, dealing with issues like date rape, pregnancy and abortion. Those threads have been omitted from the film, which means there are still social barriers that aren't being crossed. Simultaneously, Chbosky's film seems bloated and distant. It has a checklist of confronting teenage issues, which could sadly be referred to as clich√©s. Suicide, hallucinations, gay bashings, drug use and child abuse, are some of the major concerns here. Why include these though if you're only going to address them at arm's length? <br/><br/>At least tonally the depiction of high school is handled with more maturity than many similar films. The sense of isolation and the desire for friendship are Chboksy's most resonant and successful themes. A long shot of Charlie sitting by himself reflects his dislocation from the rest of the school. Quiet moments like this have a reality to them, as does the bonding between misfits, which the film depends on. High school clich√©s about jocks and outcasts are subverted with a refreshing dose of optimism and humour. Charlie and his friends are not typical high school losers seen in other films. They happily live in their own private circle. ""Welcome to the island of misfit toys"", Sam announces. They go to parties and social gatherings together and even participate in performances of The Rocky Horror Picture Show on stage. This in turn helps Charlie become a less introverted student in class too, which shines a more positive light on high school itself. <br/><br/>A more complex notion is that Charlie's circle of friends is bound by a lack of self-worth. In each other's company Chbosky's characters are not unhappy but each possesses some internal damage from either a past or perpetually flawed relationship: ""We accept the love that we think we deserve"", Charlie notes. Some of this material is very involving and powerful. A subplot involving Charlie's forced relationship with Mary- Elizabeth is one of the film's best threads. It shows deep flaws in Charlie's character but also provides the film with a dramatic motor and explosive conflict within the group. Mae Whitman's work here, the impulsiveness to jump into a relationship and the inevitable hurt, is impacting and believable. Ezra Miller (We Need To Talk about Kevin, 2011) shows a different side to himself with great energy and a surprisingly acute feel for comic timing. But limiting the film to Charlie's perspective, like the novel, means that Patrick's gay relationship with Brad is kept at bay, until a melodramatic climax. Emma Watson also isn't quite gritty enough to play a girl who is meant to have slept around, though her bond with Charlie is still fun to watch unfold. <br/><br/>As for Charlie, there's uncertainty about how to translate the darker psychological material surrounding his character. His relationship with his aunt for example is presented through poorly realised flashbacks that obscure the issue instead of providing true insight. This is included in a deficient final quarter, which falters under clich√© coming of age ramblings like: ""We can't choose where we come from, but where we go from there"". Overall, the film is relatable, funny and true, but it would have benefited from a defter touch. There are too many slow-motion scenes and montages that detract from the important issues that this sometimes palpable drama tries to face. What will it take for a mainstream film to pull no punches when it comes to adolescents and how much they carry on their shoulders?"

"evankatsogiannis","10","1","2","9 March 2019"," ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"": The Pinnacle of YA Films
","""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is a 2012 film, written and directed by first-timer Stephen Chbosky based off his own book. It's very rare when you see a novelist adapt his own book on the big screen, but in this circumstance, there was nobody better to do the job, not even John Hughes, who was working on it before his unfortunate passing in 2009. This film just blew me away, as it was way more than I expected it to be.<br/><br/>This film stars Logan Lerman as Charlie, a shy freshman who is an introvert. At school he meets Patrick and Sam, played by Ezra Miller and Emma Watson respectively, two seniors who introduce Charlie to the 'real world'.<br/><br/>First of all, let's start with the performances. After watching the Percy Jackson films, which were mediocre, I didn't think Lerman was the best choice for the lead role. Coming out of it, I realised that he was cast perfectly. Logan gives a realistic and heartfelt performance as Charlie and really adds depth to the character that might not have been there if somebody else was in the role. Ezra Miller and Emma Watson also both give convincing performances as well, which really helped the movie be more believable. Stephen Chbosky's directorial performance was really surprising, considering this was his debut film and he was a novelist prior to the film's release. His performance behind the camera was immaculate. He really assured that this film wasn't another young adult adaptation flop, like Eragon, Stormbreaker or, as I mentioned earlier, Percy Jackson. He puts so much heart into the film, that by the end you are definitely in tears.<br/><br/>Great performances, a moving script and a practically flawless directorial performance by an overlooked genius behind the camera helped ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" become undoubtedly the pinnacle of young adult films.<br/><br/>Rating: 9.5/10<br/><br/>Grade: A+"

","This film was so endearing and the characters were totally relatable. The screenplay flows so seamlessly intertwining the monologues and the narrative beautifully that neither seemed out of place. And for once the monologues felt necessary and had an important role to play, a role which expositions the state of Charlie's mind and his inexpressive self. Logan Lerman is just a perfect fit for the role. His twitchy eyebrows, pensive hands, the reticence shackling him from merging with the world were perfectly believable and more importantly struck a chord with me, which in turn, I think, is the most important thing which must happen in order to love this film. I cannot shower enough praise on him. A film which was perfectly cast and not easily forgettable"

"lesleyharris30","6","1","2","15 November 2018"," Not the Teen Dramedy I Had Hoped For,
","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a talented cast. The highlight of the film is certainly the chemistry between Emma Watson and Ezra Miller, the back and forth between them was phenomenal, and looked absolutely effortless.<br/><br/>However, I did find that the film was falsely advertised as being a feel good teen comedy drama that it made me go in to it expecting something else. In reality, it is a very bleak film that teaches bad lessons about your teen life and paints a very pessimistic picture.<br/><br/>As well as that, if I am being honest, I found Lerman very uneffective in the lead role, Charlie was a very bland character that he did not bring much to make him more intriguing, this suffered especially when Sam and Patrick are far more interesting, but we do not get to see them half as much.<br/><br/>Has its moments, but was not for me. I am aware many love this film, but The Perks of Being a Wallflower never made me feel too hard or laugh too much, and for that I could not recommend it.<br/><br/>An outsider in his first year of high school finds friendship with two older students.<br/><br/>

","3.5/4<br/><br/>I must admit up front, I was very surprised that I liked The Perks Of Being A Wallflower as much as I did. I walked in with pre-set expectations, and while most of them were indeed met, this movie soared high above them in many ways. It's more than a typical, plastic, and fake teen movie. While some may praise The Perks for its image of rebellion, it's raw, unflinching truth and depth would make it appeal to a wider audience of teens and adults as well.<br/><br/>The director, Stephen Chbosky, also wrote the screenplay for this movie, AND the book that the movie is adapting. John Hughes was originally slated to direct this, but when he died, Chbosky assumes full creative control. I am glad this happened, because the story is his vision, and he's getting to realize it through a whole new medium. He evidently knows how to work a character, and they all seem worked to perfection.<br/><br/>The story follows a wallflower named Charlie who has trouble connecting with peers, as well as a traumatic event from his childhood (revealed at the end of the movie) hold him back. This movie chronicles his freshman year of high-school, which entails gaining and losing relationships, and ultimately finding his place I The middle of teenage angst. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower never fails to be brutally honest about Charlie's emotions and problems in his life.<br/><br/>Everyone of Charlie's friends is a senior in high-school. While they have problems in their own minds, there is a separating factor between theirs and Charlie's. Charlie's problems are purely based on unfortunate circumstances, while his friends problems are for the most part brought on by themselves. The way it's subtlely conveyed: Charlie is from middle-class roots while his friends are from the elite wealthy. They offer Charlie support, and they think they can relate to his feelings. It turns out that they have was each other's solutions. Charlie needs someone to take interest in him, and his good friends need someone who's willing to listen to them. This rings true to a teen culture, that everyone experiences at some point, which is filled with both self-indulged and personal real-life issues. Everything is so confusing, especially when depression, love, and need-for-acceptance all want to take the front seat.<br/><br/>As far as the acting, Charlie (Logan Lerman) and Patrick (Ezra Miller) totally steal the show. Patrick is the class-clown and helps keep the heavy-handed plot fairly light-hearted and fun, while Charlie is just a great all-around guy, just with a past that was horrible to him and a boatload of anxiety. The actors keep the characters relatable for the full effect of their preformances.<br/><br/>If you haven't had the pleasure of getting to see this gem, take advantage. It will resonate with anyone who is currently in, or who has ever been through adolescence. All in all, it's a great coming-of-age tale and phenomenal among the ranks of ""teen movies""."

","A good sound track in a film in my opinion can make a good movie great and this film takes it a step further making a great movie near perfect. the film does a poor job of making it completely clear what year it takes place in and I had to google it to check after a famous David Bowie song came on and none of the characters had heard it before or knew who it was. <br/><br/>I can't say if its the direction or the acting or a combination of both, but i felt as the characters did in every major plot point. Few films have made me feel this many emotions in a hour and forty-five minutes. <br/><br/>I have never felt compelled to write a review about a film before and perhaps its simply to do with the fact that i went into this film with low exceptions and came out singing its praises but I was truly blown away. <br/><br/>My only compliant is that i was taken out of the film every once and a while because I kept having to pause the film to google the cast as i kept recognising a lot of the cast but couldn't say from where. this includes the main actor being Percy Jackson in the film of the same name ""Patrick"" being the flash in justice league and of course Emma Watson and Paul Rudd among others.<br/><br/>In conclusion this is a must see.

"classicsoncall","7","1","2","22 February 2018"," ""We accept the love we think we deserve.""
","Watching this movie some six years after it was originally released, I think it's somewhat similar to 2017's ""Lady Bird"" which I also saw recently. These types of films are geared toward a teenage and young adult audience that can relate to the angst of going to high school and trying to find one's own way in the world. Nothing wrong with that, but as another reviewer on this board mentioned, the film will probably not resonate with a wider viewing audience. That's among the reasons why this former Top 250 film on IMDb no longer appears in that esteemed line-up, having a limited popular life span to be eventually replaced by newer films that may or may not be as topical when they're released.<br/><br/>With that, I thought the film was okay for what it was, and the principal players all did a fine job. I'm not sure that the title was all that appropriate, because the main character Charlie (Logan Lerman) wasn't much of a wallflower very long, having been accepted by a group of senior class 'misfits' who found him to be like minded in things like musical preferences and partying. I think more could have been done with Charlie's ambiguous background and abusive relationship with his Aunt Helen, though the story line was already crammed with coming of age issues like dating, first kiss, sexual identity and a lot of those things that keep teenagers up at night.<br/><br/>So let me not rain on anyone's parade here. The movie will appeal to an appreciative young audience and that's fine. It's just that as one grows older and matures beyond films of this scope, it will be viewed from an entirely different perspective. At some point, all that teenage angst tends to diminish in the rear view mirror of life."

","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is the best contemporary teen movie I've seen. The fact that it's about teens who overcome hard times in life makes the plot's drama universal ‚Äì in Charlie's case, dealing with sexual abuse and depression. All of these issues surround us, but we regularly don't give a damn about it, and that's why this movie is so important. In the book, it is really explicit that Charlie was abused when he was a kid and that was his trauma, but in the movie, this is only a subtle reference. Since my mom works with children who were victims of abuse and we watched it together, she pointed that out for me, because I didn't get it at first. Maybe that's the only flaw of the movie: not being so clear about that. <br/><br/>Charlie also has a thing for this girl, Sam, and as their relationship evolves we can see how young romance is just awful and difficult. That's a good thing as well, it's not one of those perfect high school romances that we're used to watching in movies. Oh, Emma Watson plays Sam and she did great as an American girl.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is fabulous, impeccable, brilliant! Couldn't love more. OK, not to drop spoilers, but in the end, when they're riding Patrick's van with Heroes by David Bowie on the radio, all the lines and the dialogue are perfect ‚Äì everything works. Probably one of the best movie endings that I've ever seen. Just amazing."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","1","2","18 September 2017"," A beautifully blossomed wallflower
","Stephen Chbosky's 1990s-set very young adult-oriented book is brilliant, being funny, touching, insightful, thought-provoking and relatable. Hearing that Chbosky also directed and screenplay-adapted, as well as being attracted by the involvement of Paul Rudd and Joan Cusack, expectations were high...and although the book has more depth to the characters and situations those expectations were met.<br/><br/>'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' may not break new ground and it may be clich√©d, which may be reasons enough for people to hate it, but considering the main target audience and being based around coming-of-age, teenage angst and high school life these were inevitable. Nonetheless, 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' did a great job making an emotionally varied film that will resonate with most people of all ages and gender.<br/><br/>It is much more than just another high school/teenage angst film, and is a believable depiction of coming-of-age, friendship and hidden torment that makes one nostalgic and remember the fun and difficulties of school life. It's not flawless, some scenes and transitions like the blackouts end rather abruptly, it occasionally descends into schmaltz like with the past flashbacks and the Charlie and Mary Elizabeth relationship while charming is rushed and makes Mary Elizabeth less likable compared to the rest of the film.<br/><br/>However, 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' is beautifully shot and clearly loves the scenery. The music is suitably melancholic and the choice of songs infectious and nostalgia-inducing especially David Bowie and an excerpt of 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' in one of 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower's' most entertaining scenes, that made me love that film all over again and captured the immense fun, wildness and danger of seeing it in theatres with an audience.<br/><br/>Chbosky adapts his book admirably, not everything is included which is not unexpected due to it being an adaptation and not every detail can translate to a just over an hour and a half film. The spirit however is there, there are funny moments, thoughtful moments, insightful moments, inspirational moments and poignant moments balanced beautifully. For a film director debut, he also does a more than competent job, actually very impressive and puts directors who did it for years to wildly variable success to shame.<br/><br/>When it comes to the story, it is not perfect in execution but made me care for the characters and their situations and made me laugh, smile, cry and inspired in equal measure. The daring ending is shocking and brought tears to my eyes and credit is due tackling such mature themes with sensitivity and never preaching. The characters are compelling.<br/><br/>Logan Lerman has never been better and being a fellow shy introvert in school it was easy for me to relate to him, while Emma Watson (even with the variable accent) gives one of her better non-Hermione Granger performances and overall. Mae Whitman shows strong comedic chops and Ezra Miller is a real standout on a flamboyant and hilarious role.<br/><br/>Not that the adults are less good. A long way from that, even with less screen time. Paul Rudd is particularly great as the teacher that inspires Charlie the most, again having had an inspirational teacher in school and an even more inspirational head of department at music college that also resonated with me. Joan Cusack only appears at the end but she is very good at being sympathetic yet firm. Again Melanie Lynskey has very short screen time, but she also excels at making us hate her for being the catalyst for Charlie's torment. Kate Walsh and Dylan McDermott have very little to do but fare well too.<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent film that blossoms beautifully despite its faults. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

At best scenes in movies! The film also features Julia Warner from Grandma even though she had no lines through out the film although's personality is revealed through Charlie narrating. The film had a disturbing ending where Sam and Patrick left Charlie after he kissed Sam then his girlfriend and was left by Patrick after being told to wait a while and everything while be back but when it doesn't,he thinks that his crazy aunt's death was his fault when she rammed in to the back of a truck after thinking about what she's doing and he threatens to kill himself but is put in a home after fainting before he can and gets better and goes home to where Sam and Patrick visit once every month and then Sam and Charlie then spawn a relationship as they ride off through the tunnel.

It is great in showing real problems in life such as love, loss, friendship and growing up. Perks doesn't just focus on one teen either. It shows different problems with all the characters. It deals with depression, a haunting past and follows the troubles of a gay relationship. The role of friendship plays a big part in how all of the characters come to accept most things about themselves. I also liked that this was a successful movie where the director was also the author of the book. So that means that the movie was close to what the actual book was like.<br/><br/>Summary<br/><br/>The Perks of Being a Wallflower is about a 15-year-old boy named Charlie. Charlie is dealing with the suicide of his friend. He also deals with things such as shyness and anxiety. Throughout the movie Charlie overcomes some of his shyness and meets his two best friends, Patrick and Sam. By meeting them he becomes a totally different person that he was. He experiences a lot of firsts in his life. His family life is stable, but they do have their problems. At the end we learn of a past action that affected Charlie and made him who he was. It changed the way everyone saw and perceived him. At the end of the movie Charlie learns new things about his mental health and how to deal with it. He also leaves us with a new sense of hope about his future and those around him. Scoring System<br/><br/>The scoring system for this review will be 1-6 stars. 1 being the worst and 6 being the best. I will be scoring each category individually and then at the end I will give it an overall score.<br/><br/>Music: 6<br/><br/>Music played a big part in this movie because it was how Charlie and a lot of the other characters would express themselves. It was really popular to show how they were feeling using mixtapes. The music that was chosen was relevant and was known to most people so they could relate to it while watching the movie. Also there was a point in the movie where there was a song that was connected with one of the relationships in the movie so it was important to them too.<br/><br/>Actors: 5<br/><br/>The actors chosen for the movie I think was good for the most part. The three main ones who were portrayed by Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller played their parts perfectly. Emma Watson played Sam with so much emotion throughout the whole performance that it could be said that it has been her best so far. Within the first few minutes of the movie we could see that Lerman was perfect for the part of Charlie. I rated it only a 5 because there were a few actors and actresses that I felt weren't right for the part. The role such as Mary Elizabeth who was played by Mae Whitman could have been better. But overall I think that it was a great cast.<br/><br/>Characters: 4 The characters in the movie could be compared to the ones in the book. Even though the author of the book was also the director I feel as if the characters were different in each one. The book I felt was more detailed about them and their problems. The movie could have gone a little deeper with them all and gave them a little something more. Even though they were a little vague as far as what the character could have been they were still good and all had a great message to show. Plot: 6<br/><br/>The plot for this movie was great. It gave everyone a sense of what goes on through a teenager's life: spoken and unspoken. It gave insight on different types of problems that a young adult could have and how to deal with them. It's hard to find a movie that discusses these problems and still seem interesting. At the end is when it gets interesting with a plot twist that shocks everyone involved. The movie keeps us on our toes with everything that the characters have to go through. We get to see how it effects each of them and how they deal with their problems and also keeping up with friends and school.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>Overall I would give this movie a 5.5 out of 6. This movie is one of the best ones I have seen so far. It really touches everyone who watches in a good way. It teaches everyone a lesson by the end on how to cope with their problems and also how to help. Even with the ""bad"" things in it I would still recommend this movie to anyone who will listen."

","This film has changed my life, if I could compare myself with a movie it was this. Sometimes you feel bad, sometimes good,but when I watch this film gives me a sense of relief again. Every time I cry at different times. I help myself with it to let go emotionally. I really loved the book, but the characters were so perfect for each roll. Sometimes i wish i could have friends or even someone that share the mind of me. ( with this movie and the feeling i got when i watch it. and also why i watch it ( and so much ) it really hits me every time. it makes me feel so much at once. my favorite movie.<br/><br/>I am proud to be a wallflower."
"amirheydari","10","1","2","13 August 2016"," my opinion about actors and the story
","I think it is one of the bests.I saw this movie because I like Logan Lerman a lot.But I don't know why all his films should have a bad end and I should cry every time |: . If i want to recommend a movie to a girl actually I recommend this. Bur if I want recommend to a boy I will show him Fury. It is as nice as this of course. Emma Watson was good too but better than Mr.Lerman But there is some mistakes.In theater we can see some Ideas that advertises Sexual promiscuity.Or having freedom in everything. It cant be true and I disagree.But I learned a lot of lessons of this movie.Being happy...showing my feeling without fear or anything else.Thank you to read"
"wickedying","9","1","2","27 July 2016"," Worth watching!
","Not your average coming-of-age teen movie!<br/><br/>Stephen Chbosky's novel ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" marks malls and search engine results even before it was released. The trailer alone is already making a buzz in and around the media. Emma Watson's face caught my attention at first glance on it aside from the apple green background.<br/><br/>Since it is an adaptation, I find it quite rare to hear good reviews from people who have read the novel. It is about 15-year-old Charlie, an endearing and naive outsider, coping with first love Sam, the suicide of his best friend, and his own mental illness while struggling to find a group of people with whom he belongs. The introvert freshman is taken under the wings of two seniors, Sam and her step-brother Patrick who welcome him to the real world ‚Äìnew experiences, new friends, music, and drugs."
"amanique","8","1","2","16 May 2016"," Self-discovery therapy
","Directed by Stephen Chbosky, based on his own bestseller, ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" tells the story of a group of young ""Wallflowers"" a term for people extremely introvert, shy, that avoids being part of or rather exclude themselves from most common social circles and therefore feel a hard time making friends. In this film ,in particular, the origin of these disorders is often of sexual nature, although this is not the central aspect of the story. In the same line of ""Dead Poets Society"" (1989 ), this film reminds the adolescence and the unforgettable friends who pass through our lives and make us ""feel infinite."" Almost like Remy's cooks in ""Ratatouille"" (2007 ), this film arouses feelings and memories that are not always present, but are deeply rooted in the depths of our souls. A love story, a story of fears and insecurities, but most of all a self-discovery therapy."
"chyannegrady","10","1","2","13 February 2016"," Teen life
","This movie accurately can describe to teens how they can be both happy and sad. It will help them understand their feelings and mentality much easier than any counselor. They will no longer feel alone. They will learn the struggles of their peers. Also it will teach kids that being gay is not easy so why pick on those who are? It will help them understand why they may have bad relationships. You accept the love you think you deserve. And you can only start being happy when you learn to accept your past for what it is. So if you are a high school student that has gone through a lot this movie might be for you. If you are both happy and sad then this movie is definitely for you."
"alexisdoggy","10","1","2","13 February 2016"," Favorite Movie Ever
","This is my all time favorite movie!! The plot is so relatable and I respect that. I have watched this so many times and every time I watch it I get the same enjoyable experience as the first time I watched it :) I cannot rave about how much I love this enough!! It is an emotional roller coaster and it is like you are going through it along with Charlie. I always recommend it to my friends if they have not seen it and make them watch it with me so I can experience it with them. It is very similar to the book and I enjoy that because a lot of movies in the past have ruined the books. This movie kept me captivated and interested the entire time. Best 102 minutes of my life and for that I give it a 10/10!!"
"AlexanderExtazy","Null","1","2","15 January 2016"," Very touching and realistic
","One of the very few movies I have given a 10 score.. this one truly deserved it.<br/><br/>I must admit this is the only movie ever made tears drip on my cheeks; especially in the end.<br/><br/>All characters played their part perfectly; and Emma's Sam character was well played.. she did a good acting in the portrayal of a girl who's heart is open to someone who really needs it.<br/><br/>Charlie's character of someone gone through his best friend's suicide was intense... and the whole movie plot of these 2 siblings opening their hearts to someone who really needed someone to be with.. it was very touching; and when they had to leave end of the year it was very upsetting.<br/><br/>Overall, the move director knew exactly how to direct this movie."
"spmact","9","1","2","12 November 2015"," This film came out of nowhere and slapped me in the face - while also stealing my heart at the same time
","There are few films that I can say that I truly got lost in. Ones where I was so engrossed that I felt like I was actually living the story and along with the emotional roller coaster 100%. This was one of those films.<br/><br/>I have to say that I normally don't watch a lot of films like this. I mostly go for action/comedy/adventure/fantasy type films. Yup, I like popcorn flicks. But I decided to give this a shot because I recently watched the Harry Potter films for the first time (yes, I know) and kind of became infatuated with Emma Watson.<br/><br/>Wow, this film was memorizing. I got so attached to the characters, and cared about their lives and wanted them to be happy. I also did not expect all the heavy themes. This not your typical teen/high school relationship flick but that's a good thing. I actually cried multiple times throughout the film, and I think that is a token to how well the story was weaved and how genuine the characters were - and also how good the acting was.<br/><br/>In the end I'm sure my review won't make a difference among the 500 other reviews, but I feel like I had to leave one anyway because it touched me so much and I'm sure I'll still be affected by it long after viewing."
"anaconda-40658","9","1","2","24 September 2015"," The Perks of Being Emma Watson.
","The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012): Dir: Stephen Chbosky / Cast: Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, Ezra Miller, Mae Whitman, Paul Rudd: Extremely dark yet deep teen flick about surviving the conflicts of life. It stars Logan Lerman as Charlie who is starting high school. He addresses a journal as his only friend, and suffers blackouts due to a severe trauma that stemmed from his childhood that he cannot quite piece together. He eventually encounters step-siblings Patrick and Sam who may be more intimate than necessary but at any rate Charlie strikes up a friendship with them. Patrick is gay and secretly courting someone from the football team. Charlie develops feelings for Sam that becomes one of the more complicated elements he faces. In the conclusion it becomes one odyssey of overcoming trauma with the aid of close relationships. Director Stephen Chbosky gives insight into the struggles of teenage identity and from various perspectives. The screenplay is well written with superb performances by Lerman and company. Lerman brings out Charlie's confusion as he searches for answers as well as companionship. Emma Watson plays Sam who is confused with her feelings towards Charlie as she awaits a scholarship. Ezra Miller plays Patrick who jokes in class while in tune with his sexuality. Mae Whitman plays one of the click whom Charlie has a fruitless relationship with that untangles at a game of truth or dare. Paul Rudd delivers a fine dramatic performance as an encouraging English teacher who shares literature with Lerman. It is a teenage desire to live, dream and flourish beyond trials. Score: 9 / 10"
"Fluke_Skywalker","8","1","2","30 July 2015"," This wallflower blooms
","If John Hughes and Cameron Crowe had made a movie together it would probably have been very similar to 'The Perks Of Being A Wallflower'.<br/><br/>The older I get, the more these kinds of teenage melodramas grate on my nerves, but I was gob smacked by how emotionally invested I became here. The bulk of the credit goes to the cast (particularly the three young leads; Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller), who at first seem too poised and too pretty to play these broken characters, but once the story begins to peel back the layers they really shine, and consequently so does the movie.<br/><br/>For teenagers this is required viewing. For adults your mileage may vary."
"saieash","9","1","2","28 July 2014"," Extremely underrated - solid movie
","To be honest, I initially didn't expect much from this film - I had just finished watching the Harry Potter movies and I was just craving some extra Watson so I picked up this film and I absolutely loved it. And while I am being honest, there is something missing from the film, I don't know what exactly it is, maybe it was a second too long or needed a bit more music, maybe the plot was just a tiny bit thin, I don't know. All I know is, if it did have that extra bit, it would be extremely difficult not to give it a 10/10. All the actors were extremely solid especially the two leads - Watson did exceptionally well in my opinion. You always fear when a actor you have known to play one character acts in something different, you will always see them as the old character - but that didn't happen here at all. She perfectly slipped into this new role and does a great American accent. It is great to see her playing other roles and being able to act in other roles without playing a character with the same personality as your old character like other actors do. Overall this is a solid movie and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a high school romantic comedy type movie."
"Sheamcauleyrocks","6","1","2","5 May 2014"," Hipster movie of the year
","I'm writing this review to so that the little tick box of things I've done with my account that says ""Written a review"" will be ticked. This movie is for the largely female teenage masses yearning for another cute and misanthropic and oh-so-relatable film to sink their fangs into,dripping of tumblr giffyness. The writer knows their FRICKing market, though, and panders to it accordingly. For example, the protagonist. Teenager? Check. Quiet? Check. Feels a disconnect from those around him? Check. Reads a lot and wants to be a writer? Check. There is literally a part where it's his birthday and they get him a typewriter. A FRICKING TYPEWRITER. This movie oozes ""hipster flick"" from every crevice, and it's actually critically acclaimed. FRICK this movie.<br/><br/>IMDb is lame and doesn't let you write ""prohibited words"" but I'm sure you can imagine what I wanted to write instead of ""frick""."
"g-bodyl","10","1","2","31 March 2014"," A Modern Teen-Angst Masterpiece!
","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is the greatest film about growing up/high school in recent years and it wouldn't be a stretch to say of all time. It's so heartfelt and earnest which is rare to find in films these days. The abstract characterization is what makes this film and I'm sure all of us can relate to at least one character here. This film will make you happy and sad and will make you want to relive these years again despite the thought that high school is utter hell.<br/><br/>Stephen Chbosky, who actually wrote the book the film is based on, expertly directs this coming-of-age tale. This movie is about a guy named Charlie who is a freshman at his high school and is haunted by past events. He also has trouble making friends, but that changes when he meets these two seniors named Patrick and Sam. With some friends, he is able to experience the notions of friendship and love.<br/><br/>This film has a talented young cast. Logan Lerman is a good young actor and seems to get better as he gets older. His performance here is very powerful and provocative. People seem to hate on Emma Watson, but she does a great job in shedding her Harry Potter image here. Ezra Miller does fantastic as the flamboyant Patrick.<br/><br/>Overall, the Perks of Being a Wallflower is an amazing coming-of-age film and perhaps the greatest one ever made. I have made connections with many of these films, but never like this film. This is a beautiful indie that talks about the hell that is high school and the notions of love and friendship and how it can change a life. It's a powerful, emotionally-driven film with strong performances and a great script. I rate this film 10/10."
"brycefiona","10","1","2","23 March 2014"," A beautiful construction about the feelings of growing up, rather than just what happens.
","I avoided this at the movies as I - a) had not read the book, b) thought from the title it would about high school proms, mean girls and a Cinderella make-over. So here was The Perks of Being a Wallflower, on PayTv. A tale of three people in High School, with the main character, Charlie battling through a long hard back story.There I was at the end of this absorbing, beautiful film in gratitude for the combined talents that brought this to the screen.<br/><br/>Where Stephen Chbosky and his team succeed is the refreshing presumption that not everything has to be explained. Scenes move on quickly, words are spare.The audience has to think its way through - just as the characters need to do in their confusing corridors of life.<br/><br/>Every character cast provides such a solid acting framework, which meant there was never a moment when the film loses its pace. For example, short scene psychiatrists are often portrayed by an anonymous name, stereo sympathy and a low key performance in a white coat. But Joan Cusack's performance leaps out to allow the suffering Charlie onto a hefty key point platform which keeps the film strong. Elegant acting and artistic direction bring us parents who let us imagine their suffering, rather than the usual high drama scenes of wringing hands and sobbing mothers.And Paul Rudd's performance as an English teacher could have fallen straight into an overdrawn caricature. Thankfully, like all the cast, he acts with refined restraint.<br/><br/>This is a sophisticated film with incredible subtlety, that shows not all teenage films have to have shrieking, long haired blondes or dumbed down story-lines. And by using actors who can really act, suspension of disbelief is easy. It also brings home that successful books, which authors have spent time and care in getting right, make the best translation to film when Hollywood doesn't decide to put a 'spin' on them!"
"freire_christopher","7","1","2","8 February 2014"," A O.K Movie
","The Perks of Being A Wallflower the film that everyone says it's a great movie, that is was so amazing for it's fantastic characters and having the director being the guy who made the book was an excellent idea. Weeeellllllllll, I don't think so I think the movie is O.K just that, I don't really understand why so many people really like this movie. I mean I understand it had great morals and the acting was good it's just there are many problems in this movie. I saw this movie twice and I still see the problems it has. The first one being that it feels a bit unbelievable like the high school that the main character is in is filled with really mean people. That is not real to me. I have been to high school before and I have seen few but never so many in just one school. Yes I know there are bullies in school and people who have conditions, but this school feels like still unreal to me. Yes I also know this movie takes place in 90's but still it doesn't feel real. The second problems I have in the movie is that I felt uncomfortable when watching a few scenes in the movie. There is a few parts where charlie and his friends are doing a dance on stage for a celebration of the rocky horror picture show, I just said to myself ""Movie have you have no shame"" I know that the characters are having fun but I still feel uncomfortable. I also felt frustrated on how charlie was trying to break up with his girlfriend and he does it by kissing Sam right in front of her,OUCH! That hurt from here not only that but there were better solutions even at that time. Now your probably think I hate this movie but I don't I think it's O.K and that the actors was did amazing performances and the lessons in the movies are great. If you want a better film like this I say check out The Silver Linings Playbook"

","I'm only fourteen, still in high school. But I really wanted to see this movie. I finally got around to doing so and I have to say it is one of my new favorites. I struggle with friendships and fall in and out of depression like Charlie. I just feel that this movie just relates to me. I cried the rest of the night because it just hit me. The story is about a freshman who has problems and doesn't have any friends. He finally finds himself among upperclassmen. Him finally fitting in and feeling alive really brings Charlie to life. And I just felt a connection to that. It might just be me, but I absolutely loved this movie. This will be one to go down in the history books for all the misfit toys, including myself. I strongly recommend this movie. I just... can't really put it in words I guess. Everything's perfection. It is how life is for some. Real life; reality. I'm happy a movie finally shows that."

","Finally! The Perks of Being a Wallflower was on my hit list of movies to watch but likely put on the back burner due to the predictability of coming of age films that aren't always very enticing. How can Stephen Chbosky remix the classic plot of the protagonist having to introduce his external world with his internal complexities? He doesn't but he confirms that it's not always necessary to reinvent the wheel. <br/><br/>The writing was impressive from the outset of the movie. Chbosky does a phenomenal job at juxtaposing Charlie's best self narration to his awkward social executions. It wasn't cringe worthy but it was difficult listening to and understanding Charlie's intentions and then watch him struggle with expression. Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, and Ezra Miller deliver natural performances and never let us get too confident in Charlie and his abilities to adapt. The movie evolves true to the title in that there remains incomplete advantages to being a non-participant."
"piskaralopise","9","1","2","18 September 2013"," See the wallflower... It sees you...
","I can't really say why I delayed seeing this movie for so long... Maybe I just expected another coming of age drama with an ambition to avoid appearing like another teenage movie. And I am certainly not sure why people feel like you need to relate in order to like the movie. <br/><br/>I'm not a teenager. My high school years were nothing like characters' and I still think it's a little masterpiece. Forgive me if I'm wrong but trying to find connection to the movie by relating to Charlie's or Sam's or Patrick's story( like some people here said is the only way you could like this movie ) doesn't seem like the right approach. If anything, this movie is a learning experience. It's all there. From being accepted to accepting; from wanting to protect to being protected, trusting and being trusted, loving and being loved... And it doesn't focus on just one of those aspects. It combines them and creates this beautifully terrifying mess you have to fight through. <br/><br/>For me, this story is an ode to love - every possible kind of it there is. <br/><br/>And in the end - I was blown away by Logan Lerman's performance. Ezra Miller is an established young star and there was no surprise there, while Emma was the perfect fit for the character of Sam. The only thing I could name as something I didn't like were flashbacks - sometimes too confusing, although I'm sure book gives much more information ( I intent to read it ). Ending was great, circled everything perfectly. <br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to everyone. As I said before it's a little masterpiece."
"siddharthpillai99","10","1","2","16 July 2013"," A great movie! Very funny, romantic and emotional. Overall- awesome!
","Since I was also a ""coming of age"" at guy at one point in my life, I could relate to ""The Perks of Being A Wallflower""'s story, and even if you are older or younger, you will still feel that you are part of this movie. Filled with hilarious moments with plenty of emotional drama as well, this movie has certainly balanced the scale well and the talented Chbosky (who wrote the book, and also directed AND wrote the script) deserves a standing ovation. The casting officials (Venus Kanani and Mary Vernieu) have done a great job including Logan Lerman- a very talented young actor- and Watson, who's American accent I thought was quite good for a British born woman who spent half her life doing a very British series- Harry Potter. Also, Ezra Miller was, in my opinion, the best actor in the movie. He added that little spark to it which gave it a rich and unique taste. I had never heard of Miller before, and I'm sure he will go on to do other great movies in his career. The music used throughout the movie was just fantastic. I sometimes say that the right background music and soundtrack can sometimes MAKE the movie what it is, and including David Bowie's ""Heroes"" truly did so. Overall- A fun and enjoying movie to watch :)"
"digitalbeachbum","10","1","2","3 July 2013"," It makes my top ten list of all time
","The problem with movies today is that the makers want you to shut off your belief system to believe their movie. They throw in super heroes, special effects, sex, violence and shock & awe in order to cover up a poor story. These movies could never be real because they are filled with falsehoods.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't try to trick you. It shows every thing as it is with no masking of emotions. It is ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Dazed and Confused"", along with ""10 Things I Hate About You"" but with a darker feel to it. There aren't as many laughs, there are a few, but you get the same vibe.<br/><br/>High school is tough and a lot of young adults deal with stuff which they hide away. They form their clicks and then judge people by what they are ""in to"" or ""how they look"". This movie exposes those from the view point of one young man and his new ""outsider"" friends.<br/><br/>The casting was perfect for the movie. The script was very well written. The attention to detail was excellent. This movie is instantly a top ten winner on my lists. Now I want to read the book, which excites me.<br/><br/>Acting - 4 Directing - 4 Script - 4 Believability - 4<br/><br/>12 out of 4. Awesome!"
"Taxiridefan","3","1","2","27 June 2013"," Not for me
","I have to say with all the hype this film was given I thought it was going to be a whole lot better than it actually was. The most interesting parts of the movie were what was shown in the previews and everything else just seemed to fill the spaces in-between. <br/><br/>Emma Watson was great and it showed that she is diverse in her acting roles and that she could break away from forever being Hermione, but the movie as a whole was kind of boring and long-winded. It was just so disappointing overall. Yet another film where it never actually lives up to the hype.<br/><br/>Watch it and make your own opinion but for me, this just wasn't the best"

","I am a male ,and usually watch movies like the dark knight or Pineapple Express , but I watched this today and I almost cried at the end when Charlie was about to kill him self and I m not one of those guys that usually does that.Just this movie just spoke to me so much and I really was hoping Charlie would die so I would know what happens with him till the end of his life.I really want to know what happens after this movie ,so much that I made a IMDb account just to rate this movie.I just want people out there to know how touching this movie ends it deals with watching someone you love love someone else and it shows what people go through when family isn't good as Charlie 's aunt molested him and his best friend committed suicide.then for him to find someone so perfectly fit for him and everything is going great until she has to go away and it tore me apart a few years dropped from my eyes.Logan Lerman really shows you he s a great actor as everyone else. watch this movie especially if you are in high school."
"mrfabulous1025","9","1","2","17 June 2013"," A sweet wonderful tearjerker.
","Whether a person likes this movie or not says more about the reviewer than the movie itself. I haven't seen too many movies lately that have gotten me this emotionally involved and I enjoyed that very much. Like early reviews of the classic movie Blade Runner by Siskel and Ebert, the negative reviewers are as clueless as a fundamentalist minister reviewing Torch Song Trilogy. This movie with its accurate, sensitive and perfectly pitched performances is one of those gems that doesn't seem to come along often enough. I am an old person who has seen an enormous amount of film, who might know something about the art form and I can recommend this one highly. It reminds me of a lot of situations in life I have observed personally. The emotions and romance in the film have true resonance. It was also nice to see the Christian parents not portrayed as foolish Bible thumping maniacs. The ambiguities of each character's subjective morality was handled nicely. The only real complaint I have is the film may be a little too muted in color and a little too grainy in certain scenes. If you need a good cry or want to see something a bit more real and inspiring than Ironman 2, here is a beautiful little movie for you."
"sebastiengagn761","10","1","2","6 April 2013"," A must see
","Usually, when I watch a movie, I always skip some parts because I find them boring. In this one, the exact opposite happened. I found myself going back and back again to watch the same scenes. I would also come back to other random scenes while watching the movie. I was so absorbed by it, so emotionally involved that I needed to watch some scenes many times.<br/><br/>I think it took me around 3h30 hour to watch it. Excellent. Incredible. I almost didn't want to watch it as the preview and the summary of the movie was ordinary, but now, I regret not having watched it earlier. The soundtrack, the actors, the way the scenes were filmed. Everything was perfect. I'm sill feeling the aftershock of the movie while writing. I'm just sad because I don't think I'll ever find such a good movie again."
"four-reverse-four","10","1","2","3 April 2013"," More than just a story
","I can count on one hand the number of movies I've wanted to immediately watch again after the first viewing.<br/><br/>That's the difference between a story being told and an emotional connection being made.<br/><br/>I had the good luck of watching this film with zero expectations. I hadn't read the book. I couldn't identify any of the actors straightaway save Paul Rudd. That's fortunate because some actors carry baggage with them that exists only in your mind - I feel like I already know things about a character played by Rudd simply because his archetypes haven't been very diverse, but he wasn't important enough to the story to have that affect my perception. I didn't know who Emma Watson was because I've only ever seen the first Harry Potter film, and she looks absolutely nothing like she did ten years ago. Erza Miller was vaguely familiar but I couldn't pinpoint him from ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" until after I checked out his IMDb page.<br/><br/>The journey this film takes you through - first day of high school, first party, first kiss, first date - is something so many people can connect with. But oddly, people who are about the same age of the characters will have a harder time relating because of the setting of the movie. I'm just barely old enough to remember making mix tapes and not always having a cell phone as a teen, which makes my generation possibly the last generation in Middle America to experience those things. But despite being born about ten years too late to fully put myself in the context of the movie, I really could connect with the characters in a way I don't feel younger people would these days. Doing all of those ""firsts"" outside the context of Facebook, smart phones, and the generally over-socialized loneliness of today just seems silly.<br/><br/>The connection that's made with the characters is merely the primer for the heartbreak, devastation, and happiness they all go through. If the movie merely made you have empathy for the characters but didn't challenge you, or if it put characters through turmoil without making you feel for them, it just wouldn't have the same effect. Both things have to happen in order for that emotional connection to be made, in order to make the film more than just a story that you never care to hear again."

","The longer this movie goes on, the more you are drawn into the characters. I have never felt something so strong from a movie before. It was fun, awkward, exhilarating, dark at times, and completely overwhelming. The main character Charlie(Logan Lerman) is shy, but completely likable. Even though the film is sometimes awkward, it works and flows seamlessly into the next part of the film. Charlie is very articulate and a phenomenal actor. Same goes for Emma Watson and Ezra Miller. I have not read the book, but I felt they played their parts perfectly. The dynamic friendship between Charlie, Patrick, and Sam was pure. I just watched it, and am considering watching it again.

"KineticSeoul","8","1","2","12 March 2013"," One of the best high school/coming in terms movie I seen
","One of my favorite coming of age movie or a teen overcoming certain obstacles in his life while dealing with high school stuff. I think I like this movie more since I can actually relate with the protagonist of this movie. I sort of shunned this movie because I thought it was just a movie with Emma Watson trying to keep her career since the ""Harry Potter"" franchise is over. But after giving it a watch to my surprise this movie is actually really good. Emma Watson plays Same a free-spirited girl. What I especially like about this film is how it doesn't try too hard, but has enough to be a great movie. Logan Lerman is good as Charlie the main protagonist that is going through struggles during his freshman year in high school. Basically dealing with the fact that he wants to be accepted instead of being ostracized. Which is completely understandable, especially how it plays out. Although Logan Lerman sort of seemed like he was copying Christian Bale a bit when it comes to his acting. The movie is basically about a boy named Charlie who has past scars dealing with high school issues and his love and affection for a certain someone. But the direction it goes brings out quite a bit of emotion without trying too hard. When it comes to actors and actresses the real show stealer is Ezra Miller, at a young age he is a really good actor and really gets into his role and is daring. He plays Patrick, Sam's stepbrother and he owns his role. I was impressed with his acting chops in ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"". Although I liked this movie a lot because it's relatable. It has other great elements to hold it's own. It's a great coming of age movie, although there is way more trials for Charlie to face since this movie covers only his freshman year. It even has some great quotes that stands out even if few are clich√©.<br/><br/>8.4/10"

","I watched this movie the other night on DVD after hearing some positive reviews about it in the media.<br/><br/>First of all let me say that Ezra Miller (the gay half brother and life of the party), delivered an Oscar worthy performance and I am encouraged to watch ""We need to talk about Kevin"", now as a result.<br/><br/>As for Emma Watson, she is an absolute darling and a complete heart breaker for our poor hero.<br/><br/>I am very pleased with the high school scenes and the lead actor's behavior was very believable.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was superb, but probably wasted on anyone under 35. It sure was a nicer and simpler time when you made mix-tapes for your girlfriend full of love songs or the Smiths, whichever was more miserable at the time. There were no computers, no mobile phones, but still these people managed to lead exciting extra-curricular lives, as we all did back in the day.<br/><br/>My only criticism is the abuse and mental illness all came as a bit of a surprise from a plot perspective. This was glossed over perhaps too much, and rushed through too quickly at the end.<br/><br/>All in all, an excellent and profound picture. The chemistry between half brother and sister, their dance routines and the party sequences in general were just brilliant. I could watch this again soon, it is that good."

The feelings, emotions, fun, music story line and everything was so over the top. One of the best I've seen in a long time. I'll say just this, I don't usually like something but when I do it's one of a kind and ""I don't have enough words to explain how amazingly this movie touched to my heart.""

The only reason I liked the movie was because I had read and loved the book. You do need to have an open mind about certain things if you truly want to enjoy the movie. This is the story of Charlie and his adventures and misadventures.

","I read the novel in high school and as of now, I am in my freshman year of college. Having loved it when I read the book, I felt some trepidation about the movie but went to see it all the same. The film is incredible; all of the actors did a wonderful job with Ezra Miller as a highlight. Patrick is one of the most believable gay characters ever created and being a gay teenager about his age, it was wonderful for there to finally be a character out there for me to really connect with. Miller nails his performance. Lehrman was also wonderful as Charlie paired with an even better Emma Watson as his damaged heart-throb. The whole movie was wonderful, if not wholly perfect, and I definitely recommend it. There can probably also be something gained by watching it not long after high school. No one really likes high school, but this movie set me to viewing high school memories through rose colored glasses."
"StevePulaski","10","1","2","13 February 2013"," Were my bonds really infinite? Am I a wallflower?
","I have sat through more droning, idiotic, ridiculous teen comedies in my day than some of you can imagine. I've seen films with kids attempting to get their entire school high on marijuana, one about a girl modeling herself after coming of age dramas, one about three kids throwing a party that gets a little out of hand, one showing kids stealing the ACT answer-sheet, another about a group of skaters pioneering their bold techniques, and the list goes on and on redundantly. Seeing all of those films, individually, at a point in my life, I took away nothing of significance and assumed that the genre was predominately dead and in search of a new voice.<br/><br/>Dear reader, Stephen Chbosky is that voice and his gospel is shown in The Perks of Being a Wallflower, an uplifting, engaging, and entirely complete picture, but even that isn't doing it proper justice. No matter what I say, I can't help but feel I'm oversimplifying its inherent greatness. It's terrifically compelling because of its direct approach to the ups and downs of high schools, and features exuberant characters who are anything but quirky caricatures we see as humans rather than archetypes. Chbosky may be an adult, but he hasn't lost sight of the true fluctuating nature of American high schools, which sometimes seem to be more a competitive battleground than a learning facility.<br/><br/>It's difficult for me to dub The Hurt Locker a realistic film, fore I have not been in combat and do not have close connection with those who have. As an active high school student, this film is heavily realistic, right down to the reading material the English teacher gives the students. The plot concerns Charlie (newcomer Logan Lerman), an introverted freshman about to slog through 1385 days of high school with no friends and no true life direction. He's had his run-ins with mental illness, frequently blaming himself for the death of his aunt, who was killed in a car accident on her way to get him a present. To illustrate his fears and internal thoughts, he pens a letter to an unknown friend, so as not to concerns his parents.<br/><br/>Soon, he meets the class-clown Patrick (Ezra Miller) and the artsy Sam (Emma Watson), two Seniors, who are step-siblings, that spend their time listening to indie music, making mixtapes, or attending low-key parties. The three strike a notable bond based on their taste in music and unique view on the world, often considering themselves ""infinite.""<br/><br/>Wallflower predominately centers on the relationship between Charlie, Patrick, and Sam, showing them at their most confident and most vulnerable. Writer/director Chbosky, who also penned the novel this film is based on giving him almost entire creative control (nobody has any right to say the irrelevant and meaning phrase ""the book was better than the movie"" here), tackles a wide variety of topics. Topics that include mental illness, homosexuality, introverted behavior, relationships, loose friendships, erratic relationships, mixed signals, depression, etc. One must not forget that this is a teen film, so many of the problems had by characters in other films are repeated here, yet that is perfectly with me. Very, very rarely do they play these issues for laughs, and Chobosky's firm grip on the characters and their personalities, allowing the audience to connect with them on a very intimate level make this a picture to simply treasure. And besides, I'd rather watch a serious film about real, but common issues had by teens rather than a comedic film about a niche problem that doesn't take itself as seriously as it wants its audience to.<br/><br/>The performances should be unanimously cherished for their authenticity and power that bring this material together. Logan Lerman does terrific work as Charlie, bringing emotion to his character not in a way that feels manipulated and robotic. Ezra Miller, who accentuated pure evil and remorseless malice in We Need to Talk About Kevin, is spontaneous comedic relief, but so darkly serious and honest at times in his portrayal it's physically crippling. And, as expected, Emma Watson is fantastic as the leading female role, especially because she forgoes the anticipated idea of her being the pretty longer with no friends but a big heart. She is a brave, enigmatic soul who is simply trying to discard the past in search of a brighter, more opportunistic future. The side characters are great, as well, including horror-makeup icon Tom Savini as the shop teacher, Paul Rudd as the English teacher, Mr. Anderson, who begins to form a relationship with Charlie (one I would've liked to see explored more), and Joan Cusack, although do not expect a performance of more than two minutes.<br/><br/>This is beautiful filmmaking in every sense of the phrase, sure to register with the crowd who recall their high school days and those who are simply sympathetic and empathetic to the current generations' wallflowers. The hardest emotion to achieve or communicate in cinema, in my opinion, is empathy. It's easy to recognize a similar situation you've been in while the character goes about his routine in the same way you did, but do you genuinely feel bad for him or truly feel for his problems? Do you remind yourself he is entirely fictitious, therefore, no real emotions should be felt? I sat in awe as I was presented with raw and unpredictable brutal honest about the labyrinth of high school and regarded my previous years deeply, contemplating decisions, friendships, and the ""unbreakable"" bonds I formed. Were they so infinite? Am I a wallflower? Such questions should be considered for much longer after the closing credits end. This is the smartest teen movie of the new decade."
"groktalo","9","1","2","10 February 2013"," Fairly realistic
","The initial set-up of the storyline resembles a usual teen chick flick. Much to my surprise, the rest of it is not like that at all.<br/><br/>The time-frame for the story seems to be the one when I was a high school fresher, so I was quite curious to see if I can relate to anything I see in this movie. Granted, there are some elements of the plot that are inevitable in any high-school movie that is based on trials and tribulations of social misfits.<br/><br/>However, the characters are certainly not portrayed as childishly egoistic as they appear in most teen movies. In fact, the level of maturity of the main characters, the types of issues that they are forced to deal with, as well as the outcomes of typical conflicts in a high-school setting all look fairly realistic.<br/><br/>The acting is quite good, in my layman view.<br/><br/>The only reason why I would not give it a ten out of ten is the absence of humour. It appears as if there is too much effort being placed on avoidance of cheesy scenes. However, funny is not necessarily a synonym for cheap. That aside, this is a highly recommendable film."

","So, yeah...wow! Excellent movie! I was expecting another Juno but I got something totally different. I mean, don't get me wrong; i absolutely loved Juno but this movie is so much more; filled with humor and emotional depth. When I started watching, I thought that it's just another teenage movie but I immediately changed my mind. It's not just a love story, but a story of being an outcast and, accepting yourself and dealing with your past. I think that The Perks of Being a Wallflower casts true light on how hard it is being a teenager.<br/><br/>""We accept the love we think we deserve""...Oh, my God! I'm totally in love with this quote. I never thought of it that way but after seeing this movie, I think that this sentence explains everything there is to know about love. And it's not even a love story!<br/><br/>The cast is amazing! They couldn't have picked better actors for this movie. Logan Lerman was amazing but I already knew that before I started watching the movie. Hermione with American accent! Well Emma did great and it was a pleasure watching her again. I mean, she already proved herself with Harry Potter but with The Perks of Being Wallflower she proved that she can embody other people too. She was absolutely amazing and I think she has a successful career ahead of her. Being in love with Ezra Miller, I've seen practically every movie that he's made and this is by far one of his best. Make no mistake; he was brilliant in ""We need to talk about Kevin"" and ""City Island"" but he had competition there. In ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" he just stood out. Mae Whitman, Nina Dobrev, Johnny Simmons and others were great just as well.<br/><br/>I mustn't forget the soundtrack. It was brilliant but I guess it had to be so good since the music played a big role in this movie.<br/><br/>I think the message was pretty clear. It was about accepting yourself, picking up the pieces and starting over. The message can also be that quote I mentioned before; ""We accept the love we think we deserve"". You can pick whichever message you want but I guess it depends on a mood you're currently in.<br/><br/>So, yeah...I highly recommend this movie since it's now one of my favorite. I think you'll enjoy it the most if you watch it with your friends, but I guess that's up to you. Enjoy!"

But, if you want a nice evening with your buttered popcorn and an amazing sound track in the background, go for it! The story line did not blow me away, but the acting, I must say was brilliant. My favourite actor in the movie would have to be Ezna Miller, followed closely by Emma Watson. One would find oneself to be too busy appreciating just how gorgeous she looks and not have to pay too much attention to her acting. All in all, a mediocre story line, with great fresh faces and a very endearing soundtrack!

I am actually quite surprised that it didn't get nominated for any of the prestigious awards now that the lists are out.<br/><br/>This movie is enhanced by the terrific performances of its lead players which only adds to the beautiful story that chbosky has to offer.

Emma watson, the reason i decided to watch the movie in the first place, provides so much credibility to her character and delivers a performance i would rate as the best of her career. Ezra Miller as patrick brings comic relief in the scenes and displays a certain vulnerability that his character demands. Rest of the supporting cast is well chosen and adds to the overall strength in the acting department. Chobosky's screenplay and direction is simply awesome, with never a dull moment in between. The story is beautiful and heart breaking at the same time and unfolds in such a surprising manner. At every situation in the movie i was expecting a certain clich√©d form of response to the situation by the characters but i wasn't right about it even for a single such situation and hence the surprise.

"napierslogs","7","1","2","14 January 2013"," Uplifting teenage drama with humour, heart and soul
","""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is self-adapted from Steven Chbosky's novel of the same name. While I frequently like reading the novel first to gain more insight into the art of the adaptation, and also to read good books, I stayed clear from this one since it was written as a series of letters. The protagonist writes one letter after another and such works can seem choppy at best. As a film, letter writing can be a useful tool to understand the inner turmoil of characters and here Perks feels very fluid.<br/><br/>Charlie (Logan Lerman) suffers from mental illness resulting from the death of his best friend and a childhood incident with his aunt that is purposely left ambiguous until the very end. Entering high school, Charlie is an outsider until he makes friends with Sam (Emma Watson) and Patrick (Ezra Miller), examples of the titular ""Wallflower"". Sam is definitely too pretty and Patrick is likely too funny and charismatic to not be the most popular kids in school, but it really is a good movie, so we let that go.<br/><br/>The best part (and I will eventually start sounding like a broken record if he keeps acting and I keep reviewing) went to Ezra Miller. First he gets his name changed to ""Nothing"" and then he takes our mentally- damaged hero under his wing and then his flamboyant homosexuality gets him in love and trouble. Lerman's Charlie might be the eyes to the movie but Miller's Patrick is the heart and soul and humour to everything that ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is.<br/><br/>""Perks"" is a dramedy. Superficially, Patrick provides the comedy and Charlie and Sam provide the drama. But the movie works on both a superficial level and multiple layers deep. The quickest way to one's heart is generally through humour, so that's mostly how the movie starts. Patrick gets us laughing, and then Sam gets us falling in love and before we know it, we're emotionally invested in Charlie and realize that he is more disturbed than the rest of us outsiders are. The childhood incident with the aunt is one such instance that could remove us from Charlie but they only give us hints to what occurred up until the very end, and by then we're all best friends. The multiple layers works well with this incident. Those who dig deep into ambiguous hints can guess early on, while those who are visually adept at understanding the meaning that editing can add to a movie will figure it out next, while the rest will eventually be told. This is just one such example of using editing, flashbacks, and music to enliven all elements of the story.<br/><br/>The dialogue can get a little too clever for the ages of the characters. I always get frustrated when teenage smart-alecks start philosophizing about what combination of religions best represent them. Mae Whitman is left to fend for herself as her character is described as ""a really nice person underneath the parts of her that hate everybody"". I only saw the hate. The rest of the main characters are all very lovely and are getting their deserved accolades.<br/><br/>""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is a touching and dramatic people- pleaser. It appears to be a hit with all audiences. So much so, that my theatre shortened the name on the marquee to ""Being a Wall"" and the movie was still sold out."

It also features supporting turns from Paul Rudd, Dylan McDermott, Joan Cusack, Kate Walsh, Mae Whitman, Johnny Simmons and Tom Savini. The book is considered a modern classic and has developed a big cult following. Now the film has developed cult status as well and I'd say deservingly so. <br/><br/>Lerman stars as Charlie, a fifteen-year-old beginning high school who recently lost his best friend to suicide. He has mental problems of his own that stem back to his relationship with his aunt (Melanie Lynskey), who died when he was still very young. Charlie is extremely shy and afraid to meet new people but quickly takes a liking to his English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Rudd), as he also admires him. He then befriends a quirky senior named Patrick (Miller) and his stepsister Sam (Watson). Patrick and Sam introduce him to their friends, a group of offbeat high school misfits and Charlie finds happiness for the first time. He also develops romantic feelings for Sam, who is of course sadly taken. <br/><br/>I knew little about the book (although I had heard the name before) prior to seeing the movie and the adds didn't really sell the film that well to me. So my expectations were very minimal but I have to say I loved it. The acting is all exceptional, especially by it's three leads. It's nice to see Emma Watson growing from her 'Hermione' role, Ezra Miller is a memorable scene stealer and Logan Lerman packs an emotional wallop as the powerful heart of the film (Paul Rudd shines in his brief part as well). Stephen Chbosky is a brilliant writer and director and he really has made a classic teen coming of age film. The soundtrack is uplifting and the perfect touch to the film and although some of the subject matter is very depressing it's ultimately an inspiring and heartfelt film. I found the lead character very relatable (in his introverted loner ways) so perhaps the film moved me a little more than it might some others but I think it's a wonderful film for everyone!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcoZRlVFMzA"
"kip_russell","9","1","2","10 January 2013"," Truly excellent acting in a Peoples Choice Favorite Dramatic Film
","I've seen this film 4 times now (as well as having read the book after the first time). Let me caution you that this is not a film for everyone. If you were in the ""popular"" crowd in high school, you may not be able to relate to the story. Since ""Wallflower"" won Favorite Dramatic Film in the Peoples Choice Awards on January 9, 2013, a substantial (mostly young) fan base cares enough for this film to go and vote for it. The acting by the 3 main leads (Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, Ezra Miller) is really excellent, but Logan's acting is particularly outstanding. (Note that Emma also won Favorite Dramatic Movie Actress - partly based, I feel sure - on her role in the Harry Potter series.) Logan did not make the cut for Favorite Dramatic Movie Actor - which was won by Zac Efron. Logan has had much experience - see the IMDb list - including holding his own against Renee Zellweger in ""My One and Only"". It's a pity that Lionsgate/Summit did not support well the theatrical release of ""Wallflower"". Logan Lerman's acting is truly Oscar quality. His performance as Percy Jackson (""Lightning Thief"") gave no hint that he could be capable of such great acting. Emma Watson tirelessly promoted the film, and praised Lerman's acting professionalism. Of course, there are echoes of John Hughes and many others in this film. However, this is no light-weight teen drama, but an emotionally draining experience for those who can relate to the damaged teens so vividly presented in ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower."""

","Beautiful movie, well directed, acted and great music. There are two stories, one about high school stuff and another about a trauma of the main character, that make this movie both compelling and interesting. <br/><br/>This is definitely not a typical high school love story, even though you hope throughout the movie that the main chars will hook up. It tells the story about love between people based on personality, acceptance and supporting each other's dreams. It has a surprising twist at the end that made me realize that this story has even deeper layers. This movie has a place on the shelve of the great classic 'The breakfast club'."

","In the other reviews I have read more or less everything I liked about this incredible movie. So I'll go straight to the points. The casting is perfect. There's chemistry in every relationship among the characters. Acting is great. Emma Watson, with all due respect, is just stunning. The main characters are multifaceted and very seldom you are going to predict what they'll do in a given situation. Finally, above all, I liked the wonderful courage of these 3 guys that differentiates them from all the other characters. Despite whatever happened to them, the forgiveness, the understanding and love they still manage to keep in themselves is what makes them great.<br/><br/>Now the spoiler part. The scene I loved the most is when the kid asks his father about the Penguins at the dinner table. Amazing.<br/><br/>I loved this movie. It's a great movie. It's like ""Ordinary people"" but with humor and guts. No self pity, no judging. Great."

I'm just sad that Emma is getting all the attention when he is the MAIN actor of this movie. <br/><br/>Anyways, I loved how Chbosky directed the movie.

","What would any story be without conflict? ""Wallflower"" is a powerful yet simple story that takes inside the hearts and minds of young people dealing with their own crisis. At the center is Charlie, a shy young man who is dealing with some very dark demons in his past. He has the support of his family, but there are those who can't see beyond a perception of impending doom. Luckily, Charlie meets Patrick and Sam, two other ""misfits"" who help him survive his freshman year in school. There is also a sympathetic English teacher who manages to support Charlie through academics.<br/><br/>However there is something bothering Charlie, and it threatens to destroy whatever fragile peace Charlie manages to have. The story takes Charlie through a series of ups and downs, exposing him to a culture he has been isolated from. There are some hilarious scenes involving him and the acts of rebelliousness typical of this age group. Yet Charlie's nature is that of a sweet, caring, and somewhat very naive young man. He states it repeatedly that it matters that others feel good. He seems incapable and/or unwilling to see the evil in others. It is at these moments that Sam's and Patrick's friendship saves him from self-destruction.<br/><br/>The film has many exhilarating moments celebrating love, youth, hope, and the power of youth. Most of these involve Sam's effervescent and radiating smile. A smile that might be a mask for her own sadness and frustration, but Emma Watson does a wonderful job bringing this marvelous character to life. She shines here in ways that were hinted at in the ""Potter"" series. She is radiant.<br/><br/>Ezra Miller continues to prove he's going to be around for a very long time, showing the many dimensions of Patrick, a brave soul that must face the fact that it is just too hard for him to achieve happiness, but not because of his lack of trying. It's just the way society has put all these hurdles in front of him, but he has a disarming sense of humor and charm to burn.<br/><br/>Unlike ""Silver Linings"" and ""The Master"", two films that try to hard to show you how good they are, sometimes leaving you in awe of their excellent craftsmanship; ""Wallflower"" has a strong beating heart and plenty of soul to relate to all of us. The fact is that the darkness which resides in Charlie's soul is as devastating as that of the main characters in the other films, but this one feels more real and honest. We have no trouble smiling when they are happy and feeling their heartbreak and frustration when things are not going well.<br/><br/>This is one of the best films of 2012, like ""Ordinary People"" which came out about 30 years ago, it will be hard to forget Charlie and Sam's relationship, and Patrick's never ending willingness to always be there for them. Treat yourself to a good film and see this under-appreciated gem."
"chris-142-910981","8","1","2","26 December 2012"," Nice, funny, little bit of teen romance and discovering one's self.. reminded me of Gardenstate
","This was a cute, fun to watch movie. It reminded me a lot of Gardenstate where a teenager who was a freshmen in high school discovered who he was with the help of two friends who took him in under their wings. Has romance, comedy and is a pretty good movie in my opinion.<br/><br/>Excellent Film! The story is very simple yet complicated because of how much goes on. But the way it unfolds is beautiful and sad, sometimes all at once. While it has its funny moments, it also manages to go through dark topics as well such as homosexuality, drugs and death. Stephen Chbosky handles his story very well, never feeling like it's being forced but rather it flowed nicely and carefully. Directing wise, it was shot very well. The cinematography is gorgeous, especially the scenes where the camera overlooks the skyline of Pittsburgh and during intimate scenes between the characters. You could not get anyone better to direct it other than the author himself because this is his book. This is his vision so he knows exactly how it goes in his head and we can see throughout the film, just how much his vision has truly come alive. The result is both engaging and satisfying. Emma Watson did a great job playing as Sam. She is very beautiful and charming. As for her American accent, I thought she did an okay job. There were times where you can kind of hear her British accent slip in and even though you notice it, it's nothing distracting and it didn't really bother me. But you have to give her credit for trying her best and she truly did. I enjoyed her performance very much. What makes the cast so special is the chemistry. Everyone got along so well and you can tell that they're very comfortable with each other and you feel convinced that these people are really friends. It was absolutely perfect. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is best if you can actually relate to the lead character or have experienced the struggles of being an adolescent. When it's not depressing, the film goes to those blissful moments that make us remember the good times in high school. Overall, it's a great film. It's a film adaptation that replaces the clich√© mainstream swagger with some painful realities and simply let the audience understand the whole point of it. In the end, it's quite a remarkable film. <br/><br/>Based on the novel written by Stephen Chbosky, this is about 15-year-old Charlie (Logan Lerman), an endearing and naive outsider, coping with first love (Emma Watson), the suicide of his best friend, and his own mental illness while struggling to find a group of people with whom he belongs. The introvert freshman is taken under the wings of two seniors, Sam and Patrick, who welcome him to the real world."
"ajl41994","9","1","2","25 December 2012"," Completely Blew My Mind
","I just got the book for Christmas and since seeing the movie, can absolutely not wait to read it. <br/><br/>The film centers around a freshman named Charlie (Logan Lerman) who is recently trying to move forward from his best friend's suicide. Upon starting high school, step-siblings Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson) introduce Charlie to a whole new world full of people, relationships and adventures while on a journey to discover who he really is. <br/><br/>I knew this movie was going to be good, but I didn't expect it to be THIS good. The screenplay is brilliant and all of the performances are terrific, particularly Ezra Miller's. Stephen Chbosky appears to have adapted his novel brilliantly and the soundtrack is magnificent too (you'll know what I'm talking about once you watch the tunnel scene). <br/><br/>If you haven't seen Perks yet, definitely add it to your list. You won't be disappointed."
"shane08-552-829654","9","1","2","19 December 2012"," A real surprise. 2 thumbs up.
","Before I saw this film I knew nothing about it so I had no expectations, I left with a huge smile on my face. I don't need to go into what the film is about (just watch the trailer) but I can say the acting in this is top notch. The young cast is brilliant and direction well done. Logan Lerman - Charlie is a likable quiet boy who struggles for his acceptance at the time of battling his mental health and plays the role to perfection. Emma Watson - Sam is of course beautiful but her acting just grows in leaps and bounds. The the extroverted gay boy Pat who is played by Ezra Miller and he dominates every scene he is in, a performance IMO worthy of award recognition. Overall a stellar casting job and a well written script (Book) is just well worth story to go see. Directing wise its good but you do not get full closure on Charlies mental health problems, not sure if this was done intentionally or it was by choice, or maybe I need to give it another watch to fill in what I may have missed, but if I missed it IMO no my fault it means the story should have been told better."
"tomrowse","9","1","2","17 December 2012"," Truly Outstanding
","To say this movie was great would be selling it short. It became increasingly hard for me to find faults in such a deeply moving yet charming tale of a junior and his battle with starting a new era in his schooling life, and thats not to say I didn't look for some. I was more than ready to put it down as yet another lame high school film that will halt the progress of up and coming star Logan Lerman, yet was pleasantly surprised to see him absolutely smash the role out of the park, his performance was gripping, disturbing and as convincing as you could possibly ask from your lead actor. Probably my biggest surprise was to see Emma Watson really step up to the plate in what I would say is a career defining role, obviously Harry Potter put her on the map, but her portrayal of Sam, a scarred hipster trying to find her way, will really set her free of her image as ""that girl from harry potter"" something I can't imagine Daniel Radcliff will be doing any time soon.<br/><br/>As all good movies manage to do, The Perks Of Being A Wallflower manages to take you in and for 100 minutes you actually forget your watching a movie and feel like your on this journey with the characters. It sounds clich√© but any film that can take you on this sought of emotional roller coaster is a winner in my books. 4.5/5 stars"
"nielsmeyer1","10","1","2","14 December 2012"," The perfect adaptation of an everyday growing teenager with a grownup touch.
","The best movies are the kind that catch you in a point of your life were you need it, at a point where you need to be remembered of how things were, how they are and how they could be. As corny as that may sound, I think the majority of people will know and understand what I mean by that. This movies is without a doubt one of them. For all it's grown up subjects and rather complex strain of thought it seems to succeed to show what kind of chaos a teenager is going true. Not the Hollywood kind of teenager where the majority of her/his problems lie in a ""complex"" relationship with the parents, but the real everyday teenager who's real trouble is finding out who he/she is amongst a avalanche of confusing adolescent emotions. Trow in the other topics this movie brings to the table and you have yourself a movie that will remind you why exactly it is you love movies... I can honestly say that this is by far the best movie I have ever seen and probably will see for a while! It literally made me feel the butterfly's in my stomach again, literally...! And if a movie can do that, it's a 10 out of 10 in my book<br/><br/>As far as the actors go, I really haven't got much to say about them other then that every single one of them fills in the character exactly as they should. Just to say it in other words, every character feels completely natural and none of them feel like they don't belong in the movie.<br/><br/>I'm not a professional review writer (not that I have to be so it seems) but the fact alone that I felt I had to take the time to wright one for this movies says enough on it's own.

"themovement1229","9","1","2","13 December 2012"," A captivating motion picture with hints of cheesiness that are covered up by supreme acting skills.
","Wow, what an incredible film. With a rhythmic depth, The Perks of Being A Wallflower exceeded my expectations for how powerful it was going to be. It entices you with a subtle, yet hypnotic beginning. As the story unfolds, the pieces of the puzzle start to connect, all the while the viewer is watching a young romance blossom as well. This movie is about understanding that everyone has an intense and deep amount of experiences that, one after another, build up to create the action you're witnessing in the present moment. It is about appreciating that dynamic, even when people seem ""gay"" or ""introverted."" Perks consumed my attention, and demonstrated that even in the most lonely circumstances, when we may feel we have nothing left, there can still be love present, enough to bring us back. But this love is temporary and contributes to our life experience, and we must acknowledge that we can't hold onto it forever, because it is too powerful. The Perks of Being a Wallflower displays this dynamic flawlessly, from mind-blowing acting skills of the beautiful and talented Emma Watson, to the extraneous and compassionate character played by Ezra Miller. However, the inhibited and pain-ridden teen played by Logan Lerman is what shines in this film. Truly a film not to be missed."
"YaumingYMC","7","1","2","11 December 2012"," Wallflower movie
","""Wallflower"" was set in the 1980s. In many ways it reminded me of the old John Hughes' movies, ""Somekind of Wonderful"", Breakfast Club"", ""Pretty in Pink"" etc. Its about a group of misfits in High School. Yup. The main character goes to a new school and makes new friends with cool people - ie. the class clown played by the charismatic Ezra Miller (who could have been played by Jon Cryer aka ""Duckie"" if he was 20 years younger) and of course the pretty Emma Watson.<br/><br/>For Wallflowers they all have ""colorful"" backgrounds which I felt was a lazy way by the writers' to spark interest in the story. Its as if I'm watching Marvel's New Mutants.<br/><br/><ul><li>spoiler alert - don't read any further.</li></ul><br/><br/>I didn't feel the childhood abuse background story of Charlie really did justice to the story. First off - I felt that the suggestion that Charlie's childhood abuse problems makes him freak out (and someone who doesn't work out or do any form of martial arts and) can suddenly turn into the Incredible Hulk and beat up three school jocks in the cafeteria who were twice his size as too fantastical. OK, if he had swung a chair and cracked them on the head and run off maybe I'd buy it.<br/><br/>It got to a point when midway through the film I was seriously wondering whether Charlie wasn't stuck in a mental asylum dreaming the entire fantastic story all up. I mean he goes to school - finds a teacher who encourages him and tell him he's going to become a big time writer - he makes friends with the coolest kids in the school - and he eventually has hawt sex with the girl of his dreams. ... and he also gets to bash up the school bullies - Three of them in one go. I think it would have been funnier if they had camped it up a bit and got him to do a Bruce Lee stance.<br/><br/>The friendship between Charlie and Patrick (Nothing) was I felt one of the more interesting developments of the story - but the writers didn't seem to have the ability to expand it more than a WTF side-issue. Instead we have this childhood abuse trauma story being back scattered all the way through the film before it strikes the plot like the iceberg hitting the Titanic.<br/><br/>Was it a plot device that was suppose to help make the character more sympathetic or to explain his supernatural powers? Or are broken things more interesting? The story had a great question and answer - ""Why do I and everyone I love pick people who treat us like we're nothing?"" (answer) ""We accept the love we think we deserve."" They could have and should have run the theme of the story on just that eternal question, rather than branch off into Charlie's childhood trauma. I'm not belittling childhood victims but this sidestory didn't seem to help push the main story along.<br/><br/>I wanted to see more on Charlie's anguish and turmoil with Sam. That Sam's relationship with the University photographer ends just nicely for him to have a one-night stand with her came across as rather manufactured - almost fitting in with a school boy's fantasy.<br/><br/>So what's it all about? A Pleasant but muddled tale of clich√©d characters. I liked the music though and the film had its moments. I liked the dance scene when Charlie meekly walked over to the dance floor to join and be accepted by Patrick and Sam. Come on Eileen - Lyrics by the Dexys Midnight Runners. Awesome song.<br/><br/>I liked the moment Charlie gazed in wonderment at Sam (Emma Watson). Haven't we all dreamed such dreams?"
"stephypop212","10","1","2","11 December 2012"," It's a must see movie!!!
","As someone who read the book and was hesitant to see how the movie would come out, I am extremely pleased with the Stephen Chbosky film; The Perks of being a Wallflower.<br/><br/>Some parts of the book that would've been great to see in the movie were skipped and that is a shame but all in all the film was definitely a great watch either way. The themes of mental illness, sexual abuse, drugs and alcohol are covered as they are in the book and show a darker side to the characters very well.<br/><br/>The casting of the film was done exceptionally well with Ezra Miller and Logan Lerman in particular, who do an amazing job at capturing their characters. Charlies emotions and expressions are exactly how you would picture them to be and Ezra Miller does a great job at being heartfelt yet hilarious through his portrayal of Patrick."
"jdesando","Null","1","2","3 December 2012"," Cool, sentimental, and melodramatic
","In The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Charlie (Logan Lerman) is sixteen and an introvert in a central-casting high school with babes and bullies and a post modern touch of gay. In addition, pot-filled brownies, Rocky Horror sing alongs, and child abuse dot the dramatic landscape, eluding the extreme realism accusation with a semi-sweet nostalgic look at high school.<br/><br/>The charm of Perks is in writer/director Stephen Chbosky's cool and sentimental notions about coming of age, emphasized by Charlie's voice over and his low-key but at times disturbed recollections on his way to maturity. It lacks the more mature disappointments in (500) Days of Summer, the silliness of Sixteen Candles, the humor of Ferris Bueller, and the out-there of Napoleon Dynamite. <br/><br/>On its own merits, it has nothing like those to make it memorable except an appealing Charlie whose arc is not overdone‚Äîhe just gets a bit wiser as anyone in those years would be if he's aware enough and has the good fortune to fall in love with Emma Watson (playing elusive girl friend, Sam). Throw in some serious childhood trauma , and you still have a melodrama of no great import, just the story of a boyish introvert who happens to be a boyishly good looking actor, Logan Lerman, and his new, eccentric friends, headed by lovable Sam.<br/><br/>Is it formulaic? Yes, but in the service of known teenage behaviors not too far from a serviceable Hollywood reality. Do bullies harass him? Yes, but less than in other clich√©d films. Does he fall in love with an unattainable girl? Yes, but he doesn't madly pursue her because his mind has other more substantial demons. Is he the brightest but quietest student in his English class, Yes, but we all know the price to pay if you answer English teacher's questions right, so his reticence is strategically acceptable although he is so reserved you might initially question him as the protagonist of any film. Is his English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd), tuned into him? Yes, but in one of the most realistic ways I have seen. <br/><br/>This is not the hip Breakfast Club or Risky Business. Yet, it does have its charming perks."
"Argemaluco","8","1","2","29 November 2012"," A very interesting juvenile drama
","In this century, there has been a fracture in the juvenile cinema, dividing it into two different cinematographic styles: on the one hand, we have cheap vulgar comedies made straight-to-DVD, dedicated to the classic ""teenagers looking for sex"" formula. And, on the other hand, we have ""indie"" melodramas which take the emotional turbulence provoked by the end of childhood and the beginning of adult age seriously (such as It's Kind of a Funny Story and The Art of Getting By). I personally prefer the juvenile films from the '80s and '90s, in which both aspects were combined (Weird Science, Clueless); but anyway...if I have to decide, I definitely prefer the ""indie"" side because those movies tend to be better written, acted and directed. What takes me to The Perks of Being a Wallflower, a very good juvenile drama which offers us realistic characters trapped into an internal and external fight expressed with honesty and a solid emotional impact.<br/><br/>It's risky to let a novelist write the screenplay and direct the film based on his novel, but in the case of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, novelist/screenwriter/director Stephen Chbosky made a good work in every aspect, starting by the selection of actors. I hadn't swallowed Logan Lerman in some previous occasions (The Three Musketeers -2011-, Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief), but his work in The Perks of Being a Wallflower is extraordinary, carefully modulating his character's multiple facets in order not to make him look like a stereotype; what takes me to one of biggest pros of the film (and from the novel, I guess): the characters are complex and possess an own voice, rejecting the habitual labels of the genre, and as a consequence, we won't find the typical villain sportsman, virginal girlfriend, ""mean girls"" or buffoon friends.<br/><br/>Ezra Miller brings an excellent performance as a sensitive and very friendly young man despite not fitting into the obligatory school niches, while Emma Watson brings a perfect melancholic sensibility to her character. Nina Dobrev is totally credible as the main character's older sister, occupied into her romantic drama but still vigilant over her younger brother; despite having few scenes together, Lerman and Dobrev perfectly evoke the fraternal love/irritation dynamic. The adult characters are a bit generically written (starting by the anonymous paternal figures who only exist as a complement of the domestic environment), but I liked the performances from Paul Rudd and Melanie Lynskey.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the best element of The Perks of Being a Wallflower is the screenplay, unpredictable enough in order to keep our attention, but respecting the ""coming of age"" structure which invites us to revive that complicated period in human life. On the negative side, I would mention the last 10 or 15 minutes, when the drama is suddenly incremented in order to bring us a dose of forced psychological conflict which wasn't necessary to complement the well raised narrative. Some people are saying that The Perks of Being a Wallflower is ""21st century's The Breakfast Club"", and even though I wouldn't agree on that, I appreciated its ability to portray the transition to maturity on a credible way, examining the fears and insecurity of getting into that unknown territory. In summary, I liked this movie pretty much and I consider it worthy of a recommendation, but I wouldn't put it into my ""hall of fame"" of juvenile cinema."

","To all shy freshman out there: You're certainly better off being introverted, especially after you see this rather odd film.<br/><br/>Taken under the wing of two seniors in high school, our hero is a withdrawn young lad who craves for attention and is involved with his friend, better commonly known as his diary.<br/><br/>This is certainly not your coming of age film. Dylan McDermott, as the father, and Ms. Cusack, who portrays the mother, have relatively little to do in the film.<br/><br/>A wallflower would not have this kind of life. At least, our hero develops somewhat of a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship, though it is quite weird, which best describes the entire film.<br/><br/>After the other two graduate and go off to college, our hero breaks down and we soon can guess what really happened to his aunt and what she had down to him.<br/><br/>His course of therapy in the film is minimized. It would have been better to focus on the problem that drove him to an institution and to see his cure develop. Instead, he is cured too quickly."

","I saw the lead actress, famous as Hermoine Granger in the Harry Potter film series, on a chat show about this film, and obviously I was keen to see if, like Daniel Radcliffe in The Woman in Black and Rupert Grint in Driving School, she could escape into other projects, directed by Stephen Chbosky, based on his own book. Basically nervous and shy Charlie Kelmeckis (Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief's Logan Lerman) is a new freshman student in his high school; he makes no attempt to get to know many people, and in class doesn't want to come across as a teacher's pet with his good knowledge. He does befriend Patrick (We Need to Talk about Kevin's Ezra Miller) and his beautiful stepsister Sam (Emma Watson), they take him to a football game, a high school dance and a house party, and unwittingly eating a brownie filled with cannabis he gets intoxicated and admits that his best friend committed suicide a year ago. Sam realises he has no other friends, so he becomes part of the group, and he agrees to help her achieve the results she needs to enter Pennsylvania State University, helping her prepare for her SAT exams, and he confirms his feelings for her seeing her standing in the back of the pickup tunnel while they do through a tunnel listening to a song (""Heroes"" by David Bowie) that they call ""The Tunnel Song"". Christmas comes and Secret Santa night is organised by the group, though he is not her secret Sam gives Charlie a vintage typewriter, and alone in her bedroom they talk more intimately about relationships, he reveals he has never been kissed, and she reveals kissing her father's boss at the age of eleven, but she wants her first real kiss to be with someone she loves, and she kisses Charlie. While he watches in the audience, Sam, Patrick and their friends perform regularly at screenings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, acting out the film, one night Sam's college boyfriend Craig (Reece Thompson) is unavailable, so Charlie takes his place, and following the Sadie Hawkins dance as well Mary Elizabeth (Independence Day's Mae Whitman) take him to her house and they kiss, she assumes he is now her boyfriend. Although growing irritated by her, with her dominating, constant phone calls and not allowing him to speak much, Charlie doesn't want to break up and hurt her feelings, but during a game of Truth or Dare, without thinking, a dare to kiss the most beautiful girl in the room goes awry when he kisses Sam, Mary Elizabeth says it is over and Sam is also furious with him. While Charlie is in isolation, allowing things to cool down and staying away, he has flashbacks of his Aunt Helen (Heavenly Creatures' Melanie Lynskey) being killed in a car accident when he was seven years old, Patrick and his secret love Brad (Johnny Simmons) break up after being caught by Brad's father together, and after he calls Patrick a ""fag"" to stop friends thinking they are friend a fight breaks out between them. Charlie intervenes in this fight, but black out and has no memory of the moment just before the fight stopped, only seeing his bruised knuckles and Brad's friends in pain on the floor, and he helps up Patricks giving Brad a cold warning, they reconcile, and outside he gets the chance to make up with Sam as well, there is a moment when Patrick kisses him as well, but this is forgotten about. A letter comes to Sam from Pennsylvania State University, they have accepted her and she must go to a summer introductory program, meaning she must leave immediately, so she breaks up with Craig, as he was cheating on her, and the night before she leaves she and Charlie go into her room, they confess things and kiss each other, but he pulls away when she touches his thigh. The next morning, following his goodbyes to Sam and Patrick he goes empty and has severe flashbacks of his Aunt Helen and her death, he calls her sister to talk about it, blaming himself for what happened, she thinks he is suicidal and calls the police, and after passing out he wakes in hospital. It is revealed by psychiatrist Dr. Burton (Joan Cusack) to his parents that as a child his aunt sexually abused him, he repressed the memories because he loved her, and she was driving to get something meant for him, so he undergoes therapy, and eventually recovers and is allowed to return home. Charlie is visited by Sam and Patrick, she explains about her new college life, and she plays ""The Tunnel Song"" which she has found and put onto a cassette, and they revisit the same tunnel, where Charlie and Sam kiss, and he is the one who stands in the back of the truck, he acknowledges feeling more alive than ever. Also starring Kate Walsh as Mother, Miracle on 34th Street's Dylan McDermott as Father, Paul Rudd as Mr. Anderson and Nina Dobrev as Candace. I should start by saying that the word ""wallflower"" means: person who, because of shyness, unpopularity, or lack of a partner, remains at the side at a party or dance; a clever word, a flower on a wall is something you wouldn't look twice at, so that sums up the lead character. Lerner is terrific as the quiet and troubled teenager given a taste of what it is like to really live, Miller gets his moments as the secretly gay friend, and Rudd as the inspirational teacher is likable, but Watson does almost steal the show as the beautiful, quirky and fun-loving girl who the lead character blossoms love with. The characters are all well put together, the sentimentality, small moments of comedy and ultimately the love story mix well, it really is convincing as being like from the perspective of a young person, a worthwhile coming-of-age romantic drama. Good!"

"ninja-15290","5","1","3","28 March 2017"," Book Review For The Perks Of Being A Wallflower
","What was the movie about? The movie was about the boy named Charlie. The movie was about his life. It was about Charlie's family members and his friends Sam and Patrick. This movie also talked about another person who is Charlie's, Aunt Helen.<br/><br/>Who were the main characters/ How did you like the actors? Logan Lerman- (Charlie), Emma Watson- (Sam), Johnny Simmons- (Brad), Paul Rudd- (Mr. Anderson), Ezra Miller- (Patrick). I like the actors by their activeness, responsibilities. Also their trustworthy, helpful, caring, confident, and also hopeful.<br/><br/>What was your favorite part of the film? My favorite part of the film was when the teacher Mr. Anderson said, ""We accept the love that we deserve"" to Charlie. Also when Charlie and Sam became a really good friend. Also when Sam passed the SAT test!<br/><br/>Compare it to the book. Did you like the film or the book more/ Explain. I think I would like the book because it mostly talked about the real things about all characters in the book. But in the film, some of the things are just faked up. They are just made that up.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1-5 stars, what rating would you give the movie? Why? I would rate this movie 3 because some of the things about in this movie are really match with the book. But some of them are not. For example, in this movie, it doesn't really talk about Mr. Bill.<br/><br/>Finally, I can say that this movie is good but less than the real book The Perks of being a Wallflower. The characters names are still same, nothing changed! The book and this movie actually talked about the character's actions or their works. They both actually shows us the all character's characteristics traits."
"robert-85923","8","1","3","1 June 2016"," A surprisingly engaging film
","It doesn't sound like a promising title but it turns out that it's a surprisingly engaging and charming film. <br/><br/>The film occasionally lapses into narration which is probably the only minor irritation. I understand that the original book of the same name use a letter writing device and I suspect that the film makers were rather too fond of the idea. <br/><br/>The three central characters play their characters very well and deserve the cabinet full of awards they have won between them. Emma Watson, being the best know, probably has a harder job but pulls it off with the aplomb of a true professional. <br/><br/>It's nice to see the gay character of Patrick (Ezra Miller) being portrayed in a positive light and challenging issues of mental health and suicide being handled in a direct but sensitive way. <br/><br/>A quality production definitely worth multiple views."
"nmholland","9","1","3","16 March 2016"," One of the Greatest Coming of Age Stories Ever Put To Film
","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is directed by Stephen Chbosky and is based on his best selling book of the same title. The story follows Charlie (Logan Lerman), a wallflower, or someone who always watches his life take place all while on the sidelines, as he enters his freshmen year of high school. He's always been socially awkward, having no friends and nobody that really cares about him besides his family. That is, before he meets two seniors, Sam (Emma Watson), a cool, rock and roll loving girl, and her stepbrother Patrick (Ezra Miller), a funny guy that makes fun of teachers rather than the freshmen. These two seniors take him in, and this is when Charlie finally begins to live his life for himself, rather than just watching it happen.<br/><br/>This film is very underrated in my opinion. Most critics liked it, but it doesn't seem to get the attention that I feel it deserves. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is truly one of the best coming of age movies of all time. I would even go as far as to compare it to films such as The Breakfast Club (1985) or Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986). This film covers all types of people, from shy, to outgoing, to smart, to ""cool,"" to just about everything. Anybody, I feel, can relate to this movie in one way or another. Whether it be family issues, social issues, or just not having too many friends, anybody can make a personal connection.<br/><br/>Stephen Chbosky is an author, yet his work with the camera is very impressive. Although it's nothing to fanboy over, it's very far from bad. No camera angle looks sketchy, and all of the wide shots, mostly of the city scape, is directed very well. Although there's no action involved with Perks, there's a couple upbeat scenes, and the camera captures the enthusiasm very well. I was rather impressed seeing better directing coming from an author than many famous directors can achieve (cough, Michael Bay).<br/><br/>The acting is also very nice. Logan Lerman does great as Charlie, especially with the dark background he comes from. Without spoiling anything, there are things in Charlie's childhood that he's not fond of, and he has a hard time dealing with them. Lerman portrays this character amazingly, and it surprises me that this guy hasn't gotten more roles. Seriously, Logan Lerman is a very underrated actor, and that may be due to some of his past films, such as The Lightning Thief (2010). Ezra Miller did fine. He didn't really bring anything too exciting to his role, but it's not like he did bad. He definitely embodied his character, Patrick, pretty well. Emma Watson did amazing as Sam, showing that she's not just the little girl from the Harry Potter franchise. She can really own other roles, much like she did this one. Her casting choice was absolutely a good one.<br/><br/>The last positive I'd like to mention with The Perks of Being a Wallflower is the overall theme. The theme, simply stated, is that anybody can be anything. No matter where you come from, or who you are, you can be whoever you want to be. Many other films have given off this same tone, and are considered some of the greats. Perks also realizes this theme, and pulls it off magnificently, thanks to its characters, directing, and amazing plot. Although this movie is based off of a book, it feels very original, and that's probably due to the author of the book directing the film. That's one big thing this movie has in its corner.<br/><br/>Now, the only bad quality identifiable throughout this movie is how the film skips around a bit. There are multiple subplots in Perks, but that's not where my issue lies. My problem is how the movie will focus on one of said subplots for a while, and then just jump to a different one, without warning or too smooth of a transition. This could've been fixed easily, just by grinding out the edges of the transitional scenes, and making the switch to the next subject not so jumpy. Like I mentioned, very nitpicky, but it's there.<br/><br/>Overall, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of the greatest coming of age films of all time, and really deserves more credit than it usually receives. I'm going to give The Perks of Being a Wallflower an A-, or a 9 out of 10."

Although the movie doesn't completely cover the book but it was arranged amazingly, the cast, direction and everything. I must admit the first time I've watched this I was in tears throughout the entire film, not sure why but after re-watching it several times it turned into my go to feel good movie. It doesn't have the clich√© everyone gets what they want ending nor does it have the everyone is miserable in the end thing either, the ending is one of my favorite parts of the movie and I recommend this movie to anyone interested in the whole ""not okay teenagers"" cause it takes the matter somewhat realistically."

The book will obviously have more to bring that wasn't brought into the film and i would recommend reading it even if you're not much of a reader.

","If you don't get the title, what I mean by it is: This movie is okay. It has good moments (mostly all of them containing Erza Miller) and some bad moments (mostly containing the other actors).<br/><br/>While I did enjoy some characters and some of the takes on high school stereotypes, I though the movie was very bland. It didn't develop the characters very well and I found myself not caring when something good happened to a rather unfortunate main character.<br/><br/>Erza Miller and Mae Whitman do a pretty good job at playing their characters, who are actually relatively interesting and fun. Then there's Emma Watson, who I'm a big fan of, but I found myself stumbling over her fluctuating accent and she was a bit of a flat line.<br/><br/>Logan Lerman, who I also kind of like as an actor, is kind of boring and quiet. That is what his character kind of is, so he works to a certain degree, but in the end, I really didn't get attached to any of the character's, with the exception of Erza Miller.<br/><br/>The main problem stems from the fact that it's supposed a character driven story, but the movie gives his flat, generic characters to connect with. Their characteristic's are too plain and their goals are too simple that when they accomplish them, we don't really care. None of the character's really grow to any extent.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is nowhere near terrible, but it's very mediocre. Give it a pass."

","I loved perks. Chbosky did an amazing job and he couldn't have chosen a better cast list. Logan Lerman and Emma Watson are perfect, Ezra miller is fabulous. Logan Lerman played his character extremely well, and Emma Watson did amazing, you wouldn't even suspect she was British at all! Ezra Miller played my favorite character Patrick and he was perfect. Reading the book, I was picturing who would be good for him and Ezra miller was picture perfect for the part. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it turned out to be, it's not your typical coming to age high school movie, unlike most it is so easy to relate to not only teens but adults the same. I'm so glad he did the movie adaptation rather than some other producer because I really don't think anyone could have done a more beautiful job. Kudos to you Stephen Chbosky."

","I haven't read the book so the only expectations I had for this movie was my excitement to see Emma Watson since the Harry Potters ended. I'd heard from people that it was 'pretty good', so I saved it for one of those rare days where I was home alone with no boyfriend to protest while knocking some chores off my list of things to do. <br/><br/>I'll give it this: it might be one of those movies where you really have to sit down and pay attention to it...because I was bored to death. I ended up turning it off halfway through because I just needed something more interesting and uplifting. It was so monotonous and well, dull...and honestly felt like it had some slightly dark tones. I just found myself being able to walk away, come back, and have not missed anything. <br/><br/>All in all, there are a lot more movies on my list to catch up on and maybe one day I will get back around to it and give it another try, or maybe read the book first."
"jematticusxe","8","1","3","7 June 2013"," Best high school movie since Hughes?
","There is a time that every American teenager must go through: high school, the great empire of cliques, bullies, mean teachers. If your high school experience was similar to mine in anyway, you probably felt like the one watching on the sidelines, your presence dominated by the more popular, well-off kids that hosted the parties you went to. And then, there were those special friends that helped you feel awesome. In a world where the high school film is, much thanks to movies like ""American Pie"" or ""Superbad,"" seen as lowbrow raunchy messes about losing virginity. ""Perks"" seems to take the book its based on and create a teen film that carries the charm we haven't seen in the genre since the John Hughes era. Issues explored such as family tension and homophobia make it as touching as ""Breakfast Club,"" while Miller's whimsical performance and the ""stay young while you can"" message hearkens back to ""Ferris Bueller."" If you miss movies that truly capture what it means to be a teenager."

Typical ""drunken"" teenage girl and shamefaced teenage boy who thing about her all the time.<br/><br/>Especially party lovers and drama lovers will appreciate this movie. I thought then this story is written very well.<br/><br/>There's a mention about psycho things what happened to Charlie. It was a little bit confusing. But after all we can see the whole story and what happened to Charlie.<br/><br/>Getting friends between graduates can be sad... because you lose them all after one year and if you not it will be very difficult when everybody goes on the college. I've got one friend between graduates too when I was freshman. It's not easy when they move away... we will lose a lot of fun and jokes with them.<br/><br/>This movie tells a real story which you lived through or someone of your friends.

"cynthia-ostrich","8","1","3","23 May 2013"," A movie for all the ""wallflowers"" out there
","I think that every adult has that moment in their teenage years when they feel infinite; a moment they wish could stand forever. I think director and author Stephen Chbosky has created a film that allows the teenager inside all of us to recall that moment in our lives, and thankfully relive it.<br/><br/>I understand that this type of movie isn't for everyone, but I really connected with the main character Charlie. On his first day of high school he comes to the harsh reality that he has no friends. The movie follows Charlie in his attempts to fit in somehow to the emotional chaos that is high school. Unlike other teeny bopper types of films this one tackled some more sensitive and serious issues. Sure it does center on the protagonist trying to get the girl of his dreams to like him, but first he must overcome his own shyness, fears and more deeply seated demons.<br/><br/>What really spoke to me was the contrast of emotions that the film portrays. You are taken on a journey into the ever changing almost bipolar mind of a teenager. The highs are great and the lows are difficult to get through. However they are common things that most American teenagers have to deal with in some capacity. I also thoroughly enjoyed the underlying theme of music being something that molds us. I think those formidable years of adolescence are the time we develop our musical tastes and realistically that tastes develops into a central part of the adults we become."

"abe87","9","1","3","16 April 2013"," An infinite movie.
","""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" was my second favorite movie of the year after the epic, ""Lincoln."" If that is not enough praise, it is the best teen coming-of-age/high school movie I have seen. Think of all the great ones ‚Äì Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Dazed and Confused, The Breakfast Club, etc. ‚Äì and this movie is as good, if not better, than all of them. That's how much I loved this movie. It is based off of Stephen Chbosky's 1999 best-selling novel with the same name. Chbosky wrote and directed this movie himself. What a joy it must be to adapt your own work to film. I honestly couldn't have told you it was his directorial debut based on what I saw. Other than a couple of heavy-handed scenes, this was solid direction with almost perfect tone. After seeing the deleted scenes on blu-ray, I was impressed by how judicious he was with his own material. He made all the right moves. With any movie based off a novel, we always hear people say, ""the book was better."" At least, in this case, you can be sure the movie stayed true to the author's vision.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in the early 1990s near Pittsburgh, PA. There are only a few things that tie it to that era: lack of cell phones, kids making mixtapes with cassettes, and having to do real work to figure out the name of a song you heard on the radio. My friends will know that it doesn't take much to make me nostalgic for the 90s ‚Äì the decade of my childhood. But I quickly thanked my lucky stars for YouTube, Google, and Shazam. Still, regardless of era, the dynamics of high school have not and will never change. Anyone can feel nostalgic watching this movie. High school will always be about cliques, social structures, uncertainty, self-discovery, and the desire to be liked. And that's where we meet our protagonist, on the dreaded first day of freshman year.<br/><br/>His name is Charlie, played by the promising young actor Logan Lerman. He arrives to high school, without friends or self- confidence, and just wants to sit with someone ‚Äì anyone ‚Äì at lunch. His English teacher (Paul Rudd) finds potential in him, but that just makes Charlie even more uncool. He eventually makes friends with a group of seniors: Patrick (Ezra Miller), Sam (Emma Watson), and Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman). We all remember this group from high school ‚Äì the artsy, non-conformists. They are like Charlie, but have accepted and embraced their outsider status. They remind me of what my senior year of high school was like. After 3+ years, you increasingly stop caring about what people outside your circle of friends think - to a certain extent. Charlie, a freshman, has not yet reached that point.<br/><br/>These characters have their own distinct personalities, which are all very well developed; they aren't the typical high school movie caricatures. Charlie has an instant attraction to Sam. She is a kind, gentle soul dealing with a dark past that Charlie can relate to. Patrick is a confident, openly gay teen who is easy to root for. He first welcomes Charlie to the group ‚Äì ""the island of misfit toys."" Mary Elizabeth is the smart, artistic one. She is like the quasi-punks I hung out with during high school. The young actors in this movie totally own their roles. There is real emotional depth to these characters in treacherous and heartfelt situations, and the actors rise to the occasion. Lerman delivers a controlled but vulnerable performance with the hint of something lurking just underneath. Emma Watson steps out of her childhood role as Harry Potter's Hermione Granger and shows her potential as a serious adult actress. She has a long, promising career ahead of her. Lastly, Ezra Miller steals the show in so many scenes. You always notice when he's on screen, and he's worthy of that attention. They should all be proud of their work. Chbosky waited over a decade to make this film. If he was waiting for the right cast, he certainly found it.<br/><br/>Charlie's newfound friends are his impetus for change. He is recovering from the tragic deaths of his best friend and Aunt Helen (Melanie Lynskey). I won't give up the details, but these events have left enduring emotional scars. Chbosky edits present-day action with hints of this past. Sam and Patrick get him out of his shell of self-doubt and depression. He begins to experience life and appreciate real friendship. They do drugs, enjoy music, take joy rides, and perform the Rocky Horror Picture Show at the local theatre. Sam also presents Charlie with his first chance at love. They are romantics, perfect for each other but too inexperienced and scarred to know it at first. I will leave the rest of the story for you to see and take witness. Let me just say, I totally bought into what was happening. I love when that happens and you just accept the characters on screen as real people, worthy of empathy.<br/><br/>This movie made me long for my high school days, which is something I don't normally do. It may portray a romanticized account of high school, but we all experience some sort of self-discovery during those years. I wish my high school life were half as interesting as this movie. It probably was but it didn't always feel like it at the time. I find only real good works of art elicit that sort of introspective thought. You know a movie is good when it resonates personally. I just didn't want my time with these characters to end. Needless to say, it is a film I would heavily recommend, and I look forward to revisiting it for years to come. It is 'infinite.'"

","A solid coming of age film about a misfit high school freshman who finds his niche in a clique of alternative seniors.<br/><br/>The version of high school portrayed in this film does not remotely resemble anything I personally experienced in high school, and the film does push the boundaries of credibility a bit in having us believe that these sophisticated martini drinkers are 17 and 18 year olds. And are there that many places in the country where high schoolers are allowed to perform live to the local movie theatre's showings of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show?"" (Or at least allowed to perform it wearing that little clothing?) But I could forgive the film much because it's clearly an adult's ruminations on high school filtered through the lens of adulthood, and as we've all experienced, our memories of things do not always closely match the facts of the things we're remembering.<br/><br/>The three young actors at the film's center -- Logan Lerman, Ezra Miller and Emma Watson (of Harry Potter fame) -- give very good performances, but it's Lerman in particular who's the stand out.

","One night, I thought ""Hey why don't I buy a quick film on the TV, one that I've already seen will do fine"" and then I saw a trailer for ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" and I thought, ""Oh why not, it looks average and I might as well give it a shot""... THE TRAILER DOES NOT DO IT JUSTICE! As soon as it began, I was sucked into another world and I felt as though I was going through a journey with Sam, Charlie and Patrick. I could not take my eyes off the screen for the whole length of the movie. Although it seems a rather light hearted film, it deals with issues such as Homosexuality and mental health very maturely which just makes the film all that much more better. The acting was superb and Erza Miller, Emma Watson and Logan Lerman had such a great on screen chemistry which was beautifully complimented by the actors with less screen time.

","I think this movie shows life is not perfect and we all have lots of problems but It's not important.....the important thing is how you deal with them....you want to give up or fight with all odds I thinks this show different aspects of teenager's life with different problems and how they may react to these problems. the best thing of this movie is when you're watching this movie you're feeling(pains) exactly as they're feeling in movie in different scenes and I think the worst thing is when they were happy....I didn't feel happy as strong as their feeling....what I mean is this movie transported their sadness to me very well but It wasn't true for happiness overall this movie refreshed all my pains that I had suffered for all my life....on the other hand It reminded me always there is a hope and a reason that we live because of it....!"

Set in the 1960's, it has Thee Smiths and Rocky Horror crowd-participation shows. It shows all the awkward things that happen in high school- but the depth is so much more. Many inspiring quotes that'll make you think about your life and how you're living it. It was great how the author was also the director of this piece, and it was just so perfect.

"jfgibson73","5","1","3","5 January 2013"," Coming of Age Drama
","This movie is about a character named Charlie, who seems to be based on the author of the novel it's based on. It details his freshman year in high school and how his personal issues add to the difficulty of fitting in. He makes friends with some older kids and starts to feel like he belongs. For about 45 minutes, the movie seemed to build very well. Emma Watson's character, Sam, is established as the love interest that is not yet attainable. Emma's performance, along with the script, portray her as the kind of girlfriend who could also be your best friend. The focus seems to be on her importance to the main character. During this time, it feels like the film is giving Watson the chance to show that she can carry a film as its main star. Towards the end, however, we see more of Charlie dealing with his depression and sexual abuse, and the interesting group of friends all go off to college. Then the movie ends. I wasn't sure what to take away from this; just when we were going to find out what kind of relationship Charlie and Sam would now have, they are separated, and then the story finishes. Ezra Miller is probably the one who will benefit the most from being in this movie, because he is very memorable. I will definitely look forward to whatever Emma does next, because I enjoyed her in this movie, but it felt like her arc got cut short. Five out of ten."
"Ryan_MYeah","9","1","3","28 December 2012"," This affecting teen drama is surprisingly very honest.
","I'll confess, that when this movie ended, I wasn't entirely sure what I wanted to say about it. All I knew is that I loved it. The Perks of Being a Wallflower, based on the beloved book by Stephen Chbosky (who actually wrote and directed the movie), really seems to resonate with a lot of people, and I can see why. I can also see why others might not like it.<br/><br/>We open up with our main character Charlie (Logan Lerman), who is beginning his first year of high school. He's an outsider at first, but soon finds unlikely friends with two seniors. the flamboyant and energetic Patrick (Ezra Miller), and his step sister Sam (Emma Watson), and he's then later accepted into their larger group of friends. Sam refers to them as the island of misfit toys. Everything is not all a bowl of cherries, though. Problems arise in several areas between each of the characters, Charlie having the most focus of them.<br/><br/>Charlie may just look and act like a typical teenager on the surface at first, but that's something that Stephen Chbosky transcends. Charlie, and the other friends he makes, are all complexly written characters with believable problems, their own charms, and unique personalities. All of the cast help with this as well. Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, Mae Whitman, and especially the terrific Ezra Miller, keep their characters from feeling like one note stereotypes, serving as appropriate embodiments of real problems teenagers face.<br/><br/>You can especially thank Chbosky for balancing out all of these characters so well, for this is such a rich, character driven experience. But on top of that, he also takes time to properly examine themes. He brings up issues of depression, social outsidership, bullying, childhood trauma, failed relationships, closeted homosexuality, and even suicide without dancing around them. In fact, he confronts them head on.<br/><br/>I do understand why people would think all of this artificial, arguing of how things like this have been dealt with before. As for that, I do agree that there are moments of artificiality, but not too much to destroy it for me. Is it perfect? No, but for me, it always depends on execution, and something about this just feels very honest.<br/><br/>****1/2 / *****"
"akash_sebastian","8","1","3","26 December 2012"," Beautiful and Heartfelt adaptation of a coming-of-age tale!
","It's a beautiful and heartfelt adaptation, of a coming-of-age tale of an introverted teenager, by the author Stephen Chbosky himself. It's an affecting tale dealing with acceptance, friendship, love, loss, abuse, adolescence, confusion... and hope. No matter what you went through high school, I think most people will like it. I, in fact, loved it. Adolescence is a time everyone tries to fit in, try to figure out who they are and where they are going.<br/><br/>The brilliant young cast makes the movie what it is, and Chbosky so admirable brings out the desired emotions and chemistry out of the actors. Logan Lerman plays the lead amazingly, showing all the right emotions. But, Ezra Miller and Emma Watson are the ones who steal the show, as the exuberant but witty gay quipster and his cheerful music-lover sister. Miller takes such an appealing turn from his previous character as a teenage psychopath in 'We Need To Talk About Kevin', and Watson charmingly plays the character 'Sam', which is much different from her role in Harry Potter series; it was good to see her in a different hue.The side characters played by Paul Rudd, Melanie Lynskey and Kate Walsh are also quite artful. <br/><br/>I loved how they enacted two scenes from 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' (one of my favourite musicals); it was hilarious. <br/><br/>Few memorable quotes: -""Why do I and everyone I love pick people who treat us like we're nothing?"" ""We accept the love we think we deserve."" <br/><br/>-""Do you ever think, that if people knew how crazy you really were that no one would ever talk to you?""

Chbosky doesn't have the best director status, but his passion for his craft makes this an astounding adaptation. Strong performances across the boards from the three leads (Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, and Ezra Miller), and it's supporting cast members (Mae Whitman, Nina Dobrev, Dylan McDermott, Joan Cusak, and Paul Rudd.) If you haven't read this book, the movie captures the feeling of high school, finding yourself, and finding friends.

I tend to hate when books become movies (who doesn't?) and I thought this would have been no different. I found out that Chbosky was going to be involved (although I didn't know to what extent) and my fear lessened, but not by all that much. I knew I liked the actors for the most part, and some even fit the picture I had in my head. I was still worried. I had no reason to be, the movie was great, did it skip out on some parts I loved? yes, but the feeling of the book remained. I always felt outside of myself after reading that book and I walked out of the movie feeling the same. Logan Lerman made a pretty good Charlie, Emma Watson was great as Sam, Ezra Miller was perfect as was Paul Rudd. Bottom Line: go see it, even if (maybe especially if) you've read the book."

","It's been sometimes since movies have done novels justice; and I am grateful this one, is.<br/><br/>Last night, I went to watch this movie. 8 months ago, I was browsing through a bookshop and I found this book with a very creative cover: The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Very intrigued by the title of the book, I decided to try my luck and read it.<br/><br/>One of the best books I've ever read, I was immediately stoked when I found out Stephen Chbosky himself decided to adapt his own book into a movie! What!!! This to me is pretty unprecedented because it also means that the movie wouldn't be butchered by some stupid director! I was again very excited when I found out so many of my favorite actors are going to star in this movie!<br/><br/>Okay, sorry for the irrelevant introduction. Anyway, the whole movie was very amazing, it almost stuck 90% to the plot, with the omission of certain parts of the book's storyline, because of time constraints. During the interval of 120 minutes, I never yawned once!<br/><br/>This movie tells on this guy, Charlie (Logan Lerman), who is a socially awkward introvert and how his life progresses as he meets a senior, Patrick (Ezra Miller) and his sister, Sam (Emma Watson).<br/><br/>1) Charlie (Logan Lerman) - Logan immediately portrays Charlie to near-perfection, as I saw for myself, Charlie coming alive from the book. And Logan just transformed from the charismatic Percy Lightning to this boy who is so awkward around people, it's just unbelievable. He's a great actor, that's for sure. There was this scene towards the end that was so powerful to me because it seemed so surreal; Logan acted exceptionally phenomenal at that part of the movie.<br/><br/>2) Sam (Emma Watson) - Hermione is no more Hermione. Emma acted out of that role, she became Sam in this movie. She is as she is from the book, just feisty enough, frivolous, loving, caring and beautiful inside out. I loved how she portrayed Sam, she did not give the character a perfect image, it was like a beautiful painting tainted by forgivable negative traits! One thing for sure though, you wouldn't believe that she's played that smart witch at Harry Potter.<br/><br/>3) Patrick (Ezra Miller) - I was excited for this guy because I watched ""Honey, We Have To Talk About Kevin"" and he played this sick-minded guy in this respective movie but in The Perks of Being a Wallflower, he transformed completely! I couldn't believe it when I saw how Patrick come to live! Ezra definitely came close to stealing the show. You should just watch the movie for the sake of this guy.<br/><br/>4) Kate Walsh, Nina Dobrev - These guys were incredibly good too, they did their roles justice without, however, much screen time. Still, the few minutes given to them were enough as their presence was felt.<br/><br/>Overall, I can't tell you how great this movie is. You just have to watch this movie to believe it. Don't worry if you haven't read the book, it's equally good, TRUST ME!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>I'm having several catharsis right now, the movie is just too fantastic. Not to mention, the soundtrack makes you wanna believe the movie is real and the characters are out there, somewhere."

","""Perks shows how being in High school can be hard even if you have some friends to help you get through"" <br/><br/>Back in the 90's Steven Chbosky wrote a book about called ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" which was based in the early 1990's before people used their phones all the time and people hung out all the time. So when the film version was going to be made Chbosky has spent all this time trying to convince people that he should direct/write the film himself. The story is about a boy named Charlie (Logan Lerman) who starts High School with no real friends and no one to talk to, during his time alone he runs into Patrick (Ezra Miller) and his half-sister Sam (Emma Watson) who take him into their group of misfits which include Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman), Alice (Erin Wilhelmi) and more who take him in straight away. Charlie also has some underline problems which include a dead aunt, a problem with seeing things which in the end lead to his final breakdown.<br/><br/>The film is mainly about the developing relationship between the main three (Charlie, Patrick and Sam) who go through drugs, love and performing. The characters in this film fit so well together as they have created a bond about the differences they share and how they come together. The film balancing so much plot lines did not feel rushed to me presenting fascinating character studies as well as showing that when you go to the lowest lows you will always have support from your friends whether it helps or not.<br/><br/>Performance wise I was surprised of how much I liked Lerman in the role because the only other major performance I saw him in was the Percey Jackson films which do not show his talents. He made the character very believable especially in his final breakdown which is the point where I felt that living with this character for the whole film made me feel affected by him compared to other films that would rush it. Ezra Miller is a still a rising star in my mind and this film will help him become more known as he truly steals every scene he is in adding up to taking the film from the bigger known stars. His character can be over the top but Miller has tried to tone down the over the top Patrick by giving him a more human side. Emma Watson is the weakest of the three because I felt that she was trying her best but because the other got the more meatier material she was less then impressive. Over the years I have been a non believer in her talents as an actress but her performance in this film makes me believe more in her. The rest of the ensemble were just as good and added to the story making every actor on screen strong.<br/><br/>This film was a delightful surprise to me as I was not really excited to see it in the beginning. The story and film feel very much of the time it is trying to portray. With fantastic performances by Lerman and Miller, also a great script to boot this film is one of the best I've seen this year.<br/><br/>MOVIE GRADE: B (MVP: Ezra Miller)"
"vijcode","8","1","3","13 October 2012"," Surprisingly brilliant, poetic with a powerful ending.
","Having not read the novel & knowing very little about this movie other than the trailers & positive rotten tomatoes rating I took a punt on this movie. At first it appears like a typical coming of age teenage angst college drama. You know about the bullied kid who learnt how to confront his bullies & win the day. Forget it its nothing like that. Its a carefully crafted grown up movie about 3 teenagers, & how their lives have been affected by their different experiences. Its a performance centred movie with affecting performances,comedy that is befitting of the characters & some very touching moments. Its a movie that as you watch are unsure where its leading to or whether it is actually going to lead to anything of any meaning. I have to admit I didn't see the ending coming but when it does all that seemed insignificant & just part of filling the movie preceding the climax becomes of major significance & hits you with an emotional wallop. Without giving the ending away be prepared to be emotionally torn up. Even the peripheral characters in this movie in those final scenes take on greater importance & only add to the emotional climax. There's some wonderfully poetically moving voice-over from the Story's main character which is stirring spine tinglingly memorable stuff. It stirrs you from within & completes the movie in befitting fullfiling way. Surprisingly better than you may expect. Do yourself a favour & go see this movie."

","There is a touching teen drama with romance, some humor and good acting. I'm not familiar with the novel but as a movie I think it is quite a good story. The different themes are quite varied for one movie: first love, drug use, homosexuality, sexual abuse and friendship. They are not new to movies about teens but the way it's put together is fresh, realistic and entertaining while avoiding clich√©s or melodrama. Logan Lerman is well cast as the wallflower Charlie who starts high school with some emotional baggage, makes new friends and falls in love. He is likable enough to be the central character and his crush is quite sweet to watch. Emma Watson acts as the object of his affection Sam. She brought attention to the movie but I think she is a bit too androgynous and lacking romantic appeal. Also her diction was too well articulated which made her sound like a fine British actress rather than a troubled Pennsylvania girl. Mae Whitman was suitably repulsive as Mary Elizabeth the unattractive friend. Nina Dobrev as the sister Candace didn't get enough screen time - maybe because she is prettier than the lead Emma Watson. Ezra Miller as the gay friend is quirky enough while not acting too flamboyant. The adults have supporting roles from Dylan Mcdermott as Charlie's father and Paul Rudd as a sympathetic English teacher.<br/><br/>Overall this is a surprisingly moving and well worth a watch."

","Out of the three leads of the Potter movies, Emma Watson might be the most talented. Actually she not only might be, she is! Proof can be found in this movie right here. She doesn't take the easy way out, that is for sure. But every actor in this elevates this. Even some of the scenes that are borderline to clich√© do work here, because the acting and the writing make them work.<br/><br/>The coming of age story, is really well told. As a drama it unfolds very well and there is always something that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's a great story and a movie that you have to watch, if you like a good/well written drama.

It failed to charm me because when I am looking for something new, out-of-the-box, groovy, miraculous plot, TPOBAW gives you the expected cup of coffee (or latte).

","I agree with the other reviewers who have said that this is in no way an average high school movie. While others tend to apply a more rose tinted view or even a version of how adults perceive it to be this film has a feel of being authentic about it.<br/><br/>The cast are all pretty much unknowns to me but play their roles very strongly, they capture all the heart and warmth of the subject matter while dealing equally with some very heavy issues. Emma Watson of Harry Potter fame is the big name going in though and once you get used to her American accent you realise what a talent she is.<br/><br/>My only negative point is that the film should be higher than a 12 certificate. The blurb on the DVD box makes it sound much more cheery but be warned that there are some pretty dark and disturbing moments within the running time. I think a 15 certificate would be more suitable."

I lived in Pittsburgh in the 80s through the 90s, was friends with the other misfits in high school and college and even performed in the cast of The Rocky Horror Picture Show for a couple of years. This movie is pretty much about me and my friends.<br/><br/>The cast all did marvelous work, particularly the three leads who all turn in rich, understated performances. There is some wonderful dialog, even a few lines that I would go so far as to call brilliant (e.g. ""we accept the love we think we deserve"" and ""I feel infinite"") and the movie is shot in a creative and cinematic way without ever getting flashy.<br/><br/>And yet I found myself oddly unmoved and disconnected from the characters and their plight. Moments that were supposed to be emotional and poignant came off as trite and tedious to me. Maybe it was because it was really nothing I had not already seen or that I didn't quite believe it. Maybe it's because as an adult I am kind of embarrassed at what a slacker I was at the time and the movie brings back bad memories of that period in my life.<br/><br/>I'm not sure, but whatever it is the movie just never clicked with me. I'm disappointed about that, because I was expecting a really profound experience watching it. Maybe that's it. Maybe I am too close to it to objectively experience it.<br/><br/>Perks of Being a Wallflower has some great things going for it. I really, really wanted to like it, but unfortunately I didn't.

"Blooner","5","1","6","21 January 2013"," Rather bland, albeit somewhat original take on a known story
","Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com - The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a coming of age story where introverted, shy, 15-year-old Charlie (Logan Lerman) enters high-school, and meets some new friends.<br/><br/>Truthfully, there's a whole bunch of movies like this out already, and this one doesn't seem to be adding that much originality to the table. All the standard high-school-based movie scenes come by: Boy is bullied, boy meets friends, boy meets girl, boy goes to high-school dance, boy tries drugs, boy has first kiss, boy has relationship trouble, boy has serious mental issues. Oh OK, so the last one is sort of different.<br/><br/>Without spoiling any of the plot, Charlie has some psychological difficulties, and we learn about their origins in flashbacks (how original¬Ö). The whole set-up is rather bland. Truthfully, the entire plot is rather bland. There seems to be almost no character development within the story at all. Aside from Charlie none of the other characters change in any significant way from the initial impressions we get of them at the start of the movie. And yes, Charlie finds some friends, and perhaps becomes less of a recluse, but he reverts back to his old self by the end of the movie, making the entire ordeal feel somewhat aimless.<br/><br/>There is no purpose to the plot. There is a beginning, a middle, and an end, but nothing truly noteworthy happens anywhere within that time. This is just a story of a kid, and his first year of high- school. Thing is, we all know this story, because we have all been there ourselves.<br/><br/>Admittedly, there are definite strong points within the plot. Some earnestly serious issues are touched upon, such as suicide, abuse, homophobia, bullying, and the aforementioned mental health problems. But it is all just thrown together to produce an angsty stew of ‚Äì perhaps slightly above averagely ‚Äì damaged teens and their shenanigans.<br/><br/>The Perks of Being a Wallflower is set in the '90s, and this is established very nicely with the correct technology, attire and especially musical references, including whole scenes dedicated to the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Now, Rocky Horror was a bit before my time (thankfully?), but I'm glad to know it was already a somewhat nerdy thing to like back in the early '90s.<br/><br/>In the end, walking out of the cinema, all I was left with were lingering feelings of melancholy and confusion. Melancholy, as I was thinking about the main characters' damaged pasts; and confusion about why this rather bland story was ever made into a movie in the first place.<br/><br/>All reviews are inherently subjective, but given the widely varying reviews of this movie, I suspect you probably have to see for yourself whether this is a movie you'll enjoy. - Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com"

","""Di Perks ah Being ah Wallflower: Belizean Edition""<br/><br/>If you were to lookup the definition of the word perfection in the dictionary it would say The Perks of Being a Wallflower. You laugh, hurt, cry and fall in love in one movie. Stephen Chbosky writer and director of the book and movie is truly extraordinary. If you were or still are part of the ""in crowd"" this isn't the movie for you. Like Patrick (Ezra Miller) said ""You see things and you understand. You're a wallflower."" We all once thought we were outsider in high school. Chbosky wrote this thinking of the people at the fringes of what is mainstream. Unlike movies like Mean Girls, who focus on the popular, The Perks of Being a Wallflower focuses on the different. The awkwardness, the loneliness, and the unusual fellowship that accompany being on the outside looking in (Nutshell). Basically what high school really is about? Not the things they pretend it to be in the movie. Being a wallflower myself and being able to see people who also listen and understand made this my number one movie of all time. It's not only the narration that was spot on but the 90's music and the beautiful scenery of Pittsburg The book wasn't even necessary with how the movie was produced. Stephen basically used the book as the script. Anyone who has read the book and watched the movie can attest to how faithful they are to each other. Of course there were minor changes due to time but the heart of the book was present every step of the way. Not telling the entire movie as a letter did in a sense did defeat the idea of story but it by beginning and ending the movie with voice overs taken from the ""Dear Friend"" letters written by Charlie (Logan Lerman), the movie was salvaged. For a first time watcher the flashbacks do confuse you but in a way add curiosity to what truly is the cause of Charlie's mental illness. The Perks of Being a Wallflower unfolds in a traditional, chronological fashion. As in the book, there are numerous cultural references. Charlie's English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd), gives him a list of ""outside reading"" options. The Rocky Horror Picture Show has a major role in Charlie's development in the course of making friends. And there's plenty of music from the '80s and early '90s. ""Come on Eileen"" and David Bowie's ""Heroes"" end up in the spotlight. Mr. Chbosky did a great job of translating a book into a film which is not an easy task. The musical score for the movie is to die for. It feels like someone turned back time to the 90's. The playlist emotionally resonates with the scene it is fitting. We can say that it was more of a mix tape than a soundtrack the way each some was in sync with the scene. One of the most memorable and my favorite is the tunnel scene when David Bowie's ""Heroes"" songs plays and Sam's hair is in the wind while the camera is focused on her and blurred out the lights. Charlie's last words at the end of the ride were ""And in this moment I swear, we are infinite."" Such words after such a breathtaking scene seeps into the hearts of the audience making one truly feel infinite. This movie goes down as my favorite of all time. Whoever is a fan of the book will not be disappointed with the movie. If you're too lazy to read the book just watch the movie; you won't be disappointed. The movie is both intelligent and emotional about a part of our some of our lives which some of us still live by today. To all the wallflowers this movie is dedicated to you. To see that there are other that understand what you have been through. That you're not alone and to prove this a movie was made for all the wallflowers out there still simply listening and understanding."
"dsalouk","7","0","1","11 February 2017"," Cute and understandably ""nice""
","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a great screen adaptation by an incredibly gifted author, screenwriter, and director; Stephen Chbosky. He has masterfully brought enjoyment, and a feeble attempt of depth, to a story of a teenager coming to terms with himself. Played by Logan Lerman, the main story driver, the audience is exposed to a wild ride of emotions, and vulnerable situations. Emma Watson, the star capture of the movie, brings little to the plate, and seems replaceable. Regardless, it tries very hard to make sense of life's hard lessons, and is willing to breach the taboo lines. The Perks of being a Wallflower is a dramatically cute story."
"CinematicInceptions","7","0","1","5 February 2017"," Slow at times, but still insightful
","This is by no means the definitive high school movie, but it is pretty good at hitting on some major aspects of it. The major conflicts of the movie stem from two universal truths about high school: 1. Having a social life is nice, and 2. Social life in high school is a tangled web of problems. Charlie wants to be accepted into the community that his new friends have provided him, but eventually things get in the way. <br/><br/>The movie's identity as a drama definitely lends it more credibility than most high school movies. Most of the best known high school movies (John Hughes' movies, Mean Girls, 10 Things I Hate About You, Easy A, 21 Jump Street) are comedies. While many of those are good and fun movies, their comedic identity tends to make their portrayal of high school life less realistic. Wallflower shows that everybody is insecure when they are a teenager and that there are a lot of things about being in high school that really suck, but that there is still hope for everyone to find and maintain true friends. In this way, I think it is good that Charlie's mental problems are not touched upon that much, because it makes the more universal themes of the movie stand out more. <br/><br/>The execution was nothing special at all, but I think it still deserves recognition. This was a human story, so there was no reason to have any fantastically crafted scenes or deep acting performances. The dialogue and the performances felt organic, that is they gave the sense that the characters were people like the ones sitting next to you. The movie's lack of Oscar nominations is warranted, but that does not take away from the fact that it was done well.<br/><br/>I did not actually enjoy the movie that much while I was watching it. But most of my issues with it were personal, and do not point to its true quality. For instance, I might have appreciated the ending more if I didn't already hate the tunnel song ""Heroes"". Also, the ending just felt a little clich√©d and happy. The only two things that I think could have been done better were the script should have been paced faster and the director of photography could have done a better job at making the shots engaging instead of just static. Still, as I went back through it, I realized that there is a lot of good stuff in this movie. I particularly liked when Charlie said that his doctor's advice was not the ultimate answer, but was a good place to start. Also the line ""we accept the love we think we deserve"" has a lot of truth to it, even if it does sound trite.<br/><br/>I would recommend watching this movie in either 8th or 9th grade, but you should definitely see it before graduating high school. For parents, this is a borderline R movie, but it's probably more responsible to expose your young teenager to something like this before high school rather than try to shelter them. Loss of innocence is a dreadful thing, but it's not as bad as entering a world of social pressures without knowing a little about what's in it. For anyone well out of school, you might not enjoy this that much except to maybe reminisce about your own years in school. Overall Rating: 7.1/10."

","""The perks of being a wallflower"" is a warm movie through all its cold and bitter moments and truths. It tells the story of Charlie, fresh to High School, who didn't have much luck with friends so far and who suddenly finds himself in a group of people he seems to belong to, yet it also causes him some trouble to really take a stand for himself.<br/><br/>Of course you could argue that in some point the movie seems a bit like the typical Hollywood Popcorn cinema but I do believe that it carries on an important message. Maybe it can give hope to some lonely hearts out there and show them that wherever there are bad people, there are also some good around.<br/><br/>As you can already see from my description, the film moves along a thin line between beauty and clich√© but I have to say that for me it stayed on the beautiful side more often and so, all in all, I do recommend to give it a try and see if you can draw something out of it."

","There were times when i thought it would be a little cringy and clich√É¬©d. This fear was *almost* entirely unwarranted. The lead actors delivered a convincing performance of some very interesting and multi dimensional characters. I engaged well with the story even though American high school movies aren't usually my cup of tea. Special credit to Emma Watson for shaking of Hemionie as she will probably always be remembered for harry potter. Even the coldest heart will feel a tear forming in some places although you have to watch the whole film to understand what i mean. It is no good watching it in small parts as it is very much a film which provokes a strong emotional response in the audience since everyone can identify with someone/something in the film over a slowly moving, but none the less compelling plot."

","This is a beautiful movie and was so very candid. There are movies made around the high school theme which give you a feeling that its just another grind of a teen flick formula. But then something like this comes and blows out your mind - imagine characters as fleshed out as the one in Archies comics coming together in the 80s and you have actors like Ema watson - Perks of being a wallflower is of this kind. The movie was so captivating that the audience will become those teenagers from the 80s-90s and if you have lived long back during those years, the movie is very relatable and plaudible. It brings back your high school romances or would have beens ;) - friendships, ..everything with minute glimpses but still keeping an underlying story element till the end. Must watch for fans of this genre and kind. Cheers!"
"derziverse","9","0","1","20 November 2016"," Great coming of age movie!!
","I absolutely loved this movie and it's characters, but some aspects of it were odd. Such as the dead friend of Charlie sure he writes to him sometimes in the movie and he mentions him when he is high. Other than that we only get flashbacks of his Aunt Helen which I get must be tragic. But if one of your best friends shoots himself and your left alone in high school wouldn't we see some sort of flashbacks or other mentions of it other than when he's high on pot and when he's writing to him? We never get to know the friend. Besides that it's a really touching movie and I would definitely recommend watching it if you're in high school. It also shows the many types of people you will meet in high school along with appealing to romance lovers such as myself. Very good watch."

Charlie meets a wonderful group of friends who take him under their wing and show him the perks of being a wallflower.<br/><br/>Stephen Chbosky handles his story delicately from the set designs, camera shots, music, caste and costumes. The Rocky horror picture stage production was a blast capturing the essence of the Broadway play and fits into the characters lives as they ride the high life in high school. Never once feeling over the top or bogus, but genuine emotion and heart.<br/><br/>The revelations of Patrick and Head's relationship, his aunt Helen's sick deeds and Sam's dark past are counterweight by good natured humor lighting up all the depressing moments making it a high school special that works.<br/><br/>Logan Lerman and Emma Watson have great chemistry as star crossed lovers. You can feel the mutual attraction and heat between them. <br/><br/>Perks will always hold a special place in my heart as a special time in your life when you grow into an adult and make life long friends you love like family.

","The story of the film centers on Charlie, a freshman that returns to attend his first year of high school after being admitted into a hospital having suffered from depression. Charlie is played by Logan Lerman who is best known for his role in the 'Percy Jackson' films, as well as 'The Three Musketeers', '3:10 to Yuma', 'Noah', and 'Fury'. After struggling to make new friends, as many of those he knew before he entered the hospital won't speak to him, Charlie attends a football game and says hello to classmate Patrick, played by Ezra Miller. Patrick introduces Charlie to his stepsister Sam, played by Emma Watson.<br/><br/>Like Lerman, both Miller and Watson are terrific young actors and are among the very best of their generation. I remember first seeing Ezra Miller in 2011's, 'We Need To Talk About Kevin', a powerful family drama that everyone really this must see. His standout performance in that film has been burned into my memory ever since. Of course, many of us know Emma Watson for playing Hermoine Granger in the 'Harry Potter' franchise, but she also did a terrific job beside Eddie Redmayne in the indie darling My Week With Marilyn.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is quite stellar and absolutely worth mentioning as well. Nina Dobrev, from the television show 'The Vampire Diaries', stars as Charlie's sister Candace, a popular girl who is in an abusive relationship. Kate Walsh, from 'Grey's Anatomy', plays Charlie's mother and his father is played by Dylan McDermott, best known for starring in 'The Practice'. Mae Whitman, from 'Arrested Development' and 'Parenthood', plays a school student named Mary Elizabeth and Johnny Simmons plays the high school quarterback, Brad. Both of those young actors appeared in 'Scott Pilgrim Versus The World'. Other supporting actors and cameo appearances are made by Tom Savini, Paul Rudd, Joan Cusack, and Melanie Lynskey.<br/><br/>Charlie's life and high school experience take off after he attends a senior's party where he is accepted by Sam and Patrick's clique, called the Wallflowers. Thus, Charlie begins to not only find himself but is quickly able to find who his people are; the misfit, artsy, theater crowd that some of us probably knew and/or hung out with in high school.<br/><br/>One of the reasons I love this film so much is that it's more than just a simple coming-of-age tale about an outsider who finds out where he/she belongs. No, 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' is so much more that just your typical high school film. It's emotionally gripping from beginning to end with engaging performances and a powerful story. In particular, there's an unsettling reveal that Charlie makes about one of his family members, which is both disturbing and yet it's what Charlie needed in order to move on with his life and to overcome his depression.<br/><br/>Another reason why 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' isn't a typical high school movie is that we don't really know what year the story takes place. Therefore, the distractions of fashion and technology don't play a major role. While there are some vague references made to the late 1980's/early 1990's, the soundtrack then becomes one of the stars of this film. From everything that era had to offer, including David Bowie, New Order, Dexys Midnight Runners and one of my favorite bands, The Smiths, the filmmakers certainly knew exactly how to set up both the light- hearted, coming-of-age moments with the emotionally powerfully tone of the story.<br/><br/>If I did have one problem with the film, it would be the ending. It shows Charlie and Sam starting a relationship with each other. It bugs me personally because, in the book, it was stated that they would be better off as friends, but maybe they could be in a relationship one day. I thought that was a better message because it showed the progression of characters that Charlie and Sam go through Charlie realizing that Sam's friendship is more important than sleeping with her and Sam being OK with his decision of not sleeping with each other. However, the film's ending states that both are in a relationship, and it botches up the message. <br/><br/>Overall, 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' happens to be a personal favorite because it's not your typical high school film. Sure, there are parties and cafeteria cliques, but the story delves deep into the most serious issues that young people face. Love, homosexuality, acceptance, religion, family, drug abuse, partying, popularity, sex, and mental health are themes that not every movie about teenagers goes into. Remember, this isn't about a group of horny guys who want to lose their virginity at prom. Rather, 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' is a realistic take on the emotional reality that young people go through all over the world. And for that, I more than respect this indie gem that also has the rare honor of being directed by the same person who authored its novel.<br/><br/>So, please see this film if you haven't before. There are many characters one can relate to and I'm sure you'll find something about it to love."

","I wasn't sure if I should write a review on this movie, ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" because it hit me so deep. I lived through this movie long before I watched it.<br/><br/>This movie brought me so many emotions as I watched Charlie (Logan Lerman) walk with his head down and being / feeling alone, walking through school without a friend, expecting the same every day. But don't get me wrong, this movie was showing people how I felt. <br/><br/>As I watched the movie I was reminiscing, as if I was watching myself trudge through school, there were the lights who noticed Charlie, Sam (Emma Watson) and Patric (Ezra Miller), who brought acceptance and fun into Charlie's life and to the movie as well.<br/><br/>This movie never leaves a real sort of feel to what life is for Charlie, without making it seem forever depressing, or unrealistically silly. The conversations they have are all likely. The fight in the school cafeteria probable, and I think a person going through so much pain is fighting without fear of harm; the harm is already been done.<br/><br/>So watch this movie, if you know a person who is a survivor of child abuse, use your judgment, but it might be a very good thing for them to see this movie, especially if they were friendless in school. <br/><br/>There is a really sad part when Charlie hates the intimate relationship he is in, and the breakup is a sudden shocking experience, and all his friends turn away from him. I still think they shouldn't have done that to Charlie, but they didn't understand what he was going through. I saw the scene as acceptable for a movie, but perhaps someone will see the possible damage they had the power to harm a person such as Charlie with, and take that scene as a cautionary tale. Charlie and people like him, are very likely to hate themselves to death in such a predicament."

Haunted by the past, Charlie falls in love with Sam eventually. And the story goes on with an unexpected twist. A well made teen flick and i was very happy to recall my memories of my yesteryear mainly the late 90s where the friends chats each other (not through mobile phones), compile the songs through Audio Tapes, writing letters, reading books. wow.. that was really a call from the past. Emma Watson, she was the main attraction.. She was really cute and mesmerizing. Logan Lerman who portrayed the central character was absolute delight, he totally acted out as a good, troubled teenager who thinks that he can never mingle with the society especially the school. But he was not a kisser :P Patrick played by Ezra Miller (googled to find the name) also did his part in a good way. All the other supporting characters portrayed by the famous actors like Paul Rudd, Mae Whitman, etc was adequate. The slow mellowed background score was nice with some good soothing songs here and there also added the garnish.

I also really liked how Logan Lerman played Charlie. I think he's a really talented actor and he should play more often in YA-movies (I mean, both Percy Jackson movies were crap, but you have to say he was perfect for the role of Percy) and also Ezra Miller was perfect! He plays a lot LGBT+ roles and he's just brilliant with his work. It's like he was born for the role of Patrick. Also Emma Watson played Sam so good!

","The Perks of Being a Wallflower cast had such chemistry together, which is what made this movie work so well.<br/><br/>Logan Lerman played the part of an awkward outcast very well, actually made me sorry for the guy and want to be his friend. Especially when befriends Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson) you can see how happy he becomes.<br/><br/>Emma Watson, such a great actress, but with this movie I feel she wasn't as good, that's because she was doing an American accent which took me out of the movie. As the movie went on either I got use to the accent or she got better.<br/><br/>Ezra Miller was by far the stand out of the movie he looked like he had so much energy so it was always fun when he came on screen. When Ezra was acting alongside Emma and Logan I felt it brought more out of those two also."

","This movie could have gone into the pretentious dark style that film artists creates to entertain themselves if not for Stephen Chbosky, the writer of the original book and director of the film. He intentionally hide Charlie's dark hallucinations from the film, like the scenes depicted in Black Swan. Although Charlie is a little melancholy and psychologically deranged, we get to witness all those brightness and merriness in his life. The film uses little contrast, light and warm hues and fluent changes between camera angles to shape the film into a beautiful and sentimental recollection. This is a teenage movie for teenagers, and adults that remember what it is like to be teenagers.<br/><br/>I can't tell you how glad I am to see Emma Watson casted as Samantha Dutton, Ezra Miiler as Patrick and Logan Lerman as Charlie. These three leading actors, along with all other side roles, are all gorgeous looking. They have the mature, sensational atmosphere that fits right into the film. Their performances convince me that they really deserves better spouses, and they totally deserve each other. It broke my heart when Sam said her first kiss was taken away by her dad's boss. I wonder what Sam's dad's reaction will be if he knows this molest. It traumatizes Sam and forces her always to give up the guys of her rank and search for jerks to dissipate her loneliness. I am constantly furiously thumping my chest when she kisses Bob, whose mustaches and sluggish figure make him look like a loser.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is the the dining hall brawl. That sadness is well depicted through Patrick's quivering voice and Brad's equivalent expression. He had to start the fight to prove to the school that he is not a ""faggot"", that he is different from Patrick. But poor Patrick loves Brad from the bottom of his heart. Eventually, they can't be a couple anymore until the United States declared it legal in 2014. But it brings out the most loyal part of Charlie. This part of storyboarding is classic, the background noises gradually climbs to climax with the starting of the chaos and violence, and is retracted to silence when the camera turns to the shocked crowd, the bullies on the floor, and Charlie's red knuckles. The emotional tension is even bigger than directly showing Charlie hitting the bullies(which was shown in the end). The wallflower walks off the wall and flings his fist onto the jerks that bully his friend, this is so cool. <br/><br/>I learned from the trivia column that Stephen originally shot a lot of scenes containing teenage sex and violence scenes. I doubt the version I saw cut some more of them, so I don't understand what Aunt Helen ever did to Charlie to pause him while he is making out with Sam. The line said ""Let's keep it a secret between us."" suggests sex, which logically explains why Charlie's parents are so shocked and pained when the therapist informed them of Charlie's past, but he said to Sam that Aunt Helen was his ""favorite person"". Candace signals her friend to call the police because Charlie has suicide intentions? But suicide intentions suggest depression, and depressed people don't see horrifying images, which is categorized under schizophrenia. This inconsistency bugs me whenever I am reminded of the film.<br/><br/>But anyway, this is the best teenage movie I see after Breakfast Club and Mean Girls. Thanks, Stephen."

","This movie is such a spectacular depiction of what it's like to be alone and have social anxiety. I have seen so many reviews praise Ezra Miller for his performance and while it is flawless, I find Logan Lerman's performance much more compelling. Every scene he was in, I saw him as Charlie and every subtle movement he made with his hands, face, arms, etc added to and displayed Charlie's nervous charm. Lerman encapsulated what it's like to be anxious and introverted. I could go on about his performance all day but in the end the acting is just one small piece in a grand picture that was fully realized in this masterpiece of a film. While I give the movie a 10, my only problem with it is some of the dialogue seemed a little cheesy in an otherwise genuine film."

","I have watched this movie twice. First in 2013 and the second was just yesterday. And in between I read the book which was great but a little confusing for my brain. Haha. But right after I watched it yesterday, I got the answers that I've been asking for and even for something I didn't ask before. Like Charlie's sister's and brother's name. There are of course some differences between the book and the movie and I'm not going to spill them here. Cause I know it's a normal thing to have differences between books and movies. I just feel bad that the relationship between Charlie and his English teacher, Andersen (named Bill in the book) is not really exposed. Yet I'm glad that finally I can understand what Aunt Helen do to Charlie. Thanks a lot. I like most of the casts, especially for Charlie and Patrick, they're both awesome. Emma Watson was actually great, but I don't know, she always reminds me of Hermione. So I expect someone else, like Kirsten Dunts, perhaps, which was actually the first choice before Stephen takes over the director's position. But wait, I love her when she and Charlie do the show in the ROcky Horror Show. I barely see Hermione there. But don't worry. It's just my personal opinion. The soundtracks was all good. I like to have 'em all. And too bad, that the part where Charlie found naked as written in the book doesn't appear in the movie. Not that I want to see Logan naked. I just want to know why he is found naked."

","The Perks of Being A Wallflower - I stumbled upon the movie when searching for something mild, soft to watch for the Sunday afternoon's procrastination from work. The movie totally blew me away and left me in awe while following the protagonist's incredible journey of transformation from a quiet, shy, introvert outcast to a strong and sociable teenage student who can stick up for himself and his besties. (Well, he got Emma Watson's character at the end, that explains a lot.) This is definitely a movie for my students as the high school life depicted in this movie is somewhat similar to theirs: the countdowns of the days left in high school (more than 1,000 days), the exams, the parties, and most of all, the friendship. Watching this movie and seeing how the young people are bond with each other makes you appreciate your friends and those around you so much more. Set in mid 1990s, the movie struck me big time due to the nostalgic feeling it brought to me. I can feel I was brought back to the good old days in the 90s when I spent all the care-free days with my best friends in high school. Time has flown at a ghost-riding speed and when you look back, you'll be sad to find out what's left of you and what you have lost. Totally a decent movie. Highly recommend to those who haven't seen it. Though it also contains some dark elements like homophobia, sexual abuse, drugs, the movie is still a perfect choice for teenagers."

Boy I got to say that this movie brought me the most amount of joy I've experienced in a long time. I've never felt happiness through a movie, especially when someone like Emma Watson - My childhood crush- is in it, and she get kissed by another handsome actor XD; surprisingly enough, I felt extreme joy when they both kissed the first time, and then I almost teared up the second time. Logan's acting in this movie can't be any better, the dude is just fitting in every single aspect to fulfill the role of an emotionally destroyed kid. Emma Watson shines because you can see from her acting that she is into the role.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is an absolute must watch and can't be criticized in any way.

To begin with, he has no one to talk to, to pour his heart out to. This is a problem which Charlie addresses by keeping a sort of diary where he writes down his thoughts, feelings and experiences in letters which he sends to an unknown person. This person doesn't know Charlie but Charlie has seen him around and feels that he would be understanding. This also made me wonder what said person thought when he received these letters and if he even read all of them.<br/><br/>Charlie has gone through a lot: his aunt, whom he was very fond of, died, his older brother is away at university, his sister hardly spends any time with him and he has no friends. <br/><br/>However, the fact that he has no friends allows him the opportunity of meeting and befriending a rather unusual group of teenagers at his school - all of them are in a way, misfits. Through this friendship he gains more confidence which is delightful to see, as well as his first kiss and other sorts of mishaps.<br/><br/>The Perks of being a Wallflower is truly worth watching as it allows one to identify with high school experiences as well as reflect on how friendship and family are valuable to our growth and development. It may be emotional in some places but still great."

","The Perks of Being a Wallflower truly is a coming-of-age story. It shows how harsh life can be, but also how beautiful it can be if you have a little hope.

It also reminds us that we should find happiness in little things and that a good friend can light up the darkest tunnel.

","I loved this movie. Throughout this movie I always felt happy-ish, but at the same time sorta sad. I think I felt connected to the main character Charlie (played by Logan Lerman). Logan portrayed Charlie perfectly.<br/><br/>All of the characters came with a background, making all of them interesting, and very different. Each character brings something new and fresh to the table, and all important to the story. <br/><br/>The Perks of being a Wallflower takes you into the life of a freshman whose best friend had just killed himself. Already before that he had quite a nasty past. His past has affected him tremendously, and he really struggles in social situations. Needless to say, he is very nervous about his first day of high school. Eventually he makes friends with two seniors, Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson) who change his life.<br/><br/>This movie would be classified as a Drama and Romance. What I like is that it isn't the type of drama that leaves you feeling depressed for the rest of the day, and the romance isn't the icky sort of romance where they are making out all the time. The romance is on a deeper level. You can see the connection between Charlie and Sam.<br/><br/>I thought this was a really good movie, with a strong storyline and brilliant characters. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!"

""Why do I and everyone I love pick people who treat us like we're nothing? We accept the love we think we deserve."" It might seem an easy explanation, but in fact it's a deep saying, hard do understand. As I got used to doing so, I have divided my vote in other 6 smaller ones. For the image/cinematography, I gave it an 8, as it doesn't impress with any particular techniques. For the music/sound, I have to offer it a 10, since it has so many old and great track, filling any gaps remaining. For the script, a 9 is just, it is interesting and complex. For the directing an 8, there are scenes which impress a lot (e.g. the scene where David Bowie's song is played in the car, and the character portrayed by Emma raises her hands and enjoys the moment) For the acting, 9, everybody doing a great work, and expressing very well the feelings they were supposed to show. For the whole movie, a 9. I think Ezra Miller acted topside, having a unattainable exuberance.

As a Logan Lerman fan, I wanted to see him pull off a character more complex than his previous ones, and he manages to get Charlie through, without overdoing it. The rest of the cast were excellent as well. The soundtrack was a reason of it's own to make someone watch the film, as well as the story. The only problem was the story line.

","The high school genre has faced many ups and downs over the past few decades, with some films delivering an honest depictions of what its like to be a teenager in high school while some have come off as cheesy, uninspiring sex comedies that barred from reality. Rarely has Hollywood managed to generate a film so deeply honest in it's portrayal of the understandably complicated world of high school and adolescent angst. That is where this charming dramedy based on Stephen Chbosky's 1999 coming-of-age novel comes in. With author Chbosky pulling off an exceptionally feat of directing the film based on his own literary source material, Perks of Being a Wallflower comes almost nothing short of triumph in it's emotional journey through the eyes of a young high school adolescent. This film follows Charlie (played by Logan Lerman), a lonely young man entering his freshman year of high school, and is stuck in his own lonely world facing the dark memories of his late aunt who was killed in a car accident. When he meets seniors Sam (played by Emma Watson) and Patrick (played by Ezra Miller), they take him under their wing to where he learns the meanings friendship, love, and hope through a series of ventures through high school including prom, midnight showings of 'Rocky Horror Picture Show', and experimenting with relationships. Though the year in which the story takes place is not specified; the prominent soundtracks by David Bowie, and absence of the characters' cellphone usage and other advanced technology suggest the early 1990s.<br/><br/>Stephen Chbosky proves himself as a mastermind behind establishing an authentic world of teenagers navigating through the tribulations and uncertainties of high school. In the process of translating his novel to the silver screen, Chbosky abandons his epistolary style incorporated in the novel in favor of traditional storytelling, and by many he knows how it make it work. The film dives into a deep character study of the lead character, and takes on us on an emotional journey of him struggling to find his place in the seemingly hopeless world of high school. Though teen-oriented films have prominent to following a basic storyline like this its almost a clich√©, this one exercises it a beautifully constructed manner that feels more inspiring. From there on, we come to know a wide range of interesting characters who each have face a problem of their own that many teens around the world can easily relate to. One of which is Ezra Miller's character Patrick who struggles with his relentless need to hide his homosexual relationship with Johnny Simmons, which is interesting enough to provoke some important discussions. As the story proceeds, Chbosky grants us with a truly emotional ride as it navigates through Charlie and his mental trauma that threatens his tear apart his inner beings, and his friends who deal with common adolescent tribulations like dating abuse. But at the same time, he brings a certain charm to the story that results in a blissful experience without coming off emotionally contrived. Don't get me wrong, there are also some funny moments sprinkled throughout to let audiences breath from its primarily mature subject matter. <br/><br/>The cast serves as not only one of the biggest driving mechanisms of the film, but also the emotional core of the film. Lead character Charlie is granted with a thoughtful performance by Logan Lerman hits the ball out of the park with his genuine emotional resonance and pure honesty. Emma Watson, fresh out of her role as Hermonie in the highly successful 'Harry Potter' franchise, provides a reasonable amount of substance and emotion in the role of Sam who comes a close friend of Charlie in the midst of his loneliness. Ezra Miller is quite absorbing in his role of Sam's stepbrother Patrick who must contend with his homosexuality, a performance more relaxed than his sinister portrayal as the psychologically disturbed child in 'We Need To Talk About Kevin'. Mae Whitman also treats us with a nifty little performance as Mary Elizabeth, a preppy girl who unexpectedly gets involved in a complicated relationship with Charlie. One of the biggest surprises that comes to the table however, is Paul Rudd who established a sense of ingenuity as Charlie's English teacher who becomes a faithful guiding hand for him.<br/><br/>The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a smart and pleasing coming-of-age dramedy that boasts an astonishingly realistic portrayal of high school adolescents as well as some incredible performances by a team of inspiring young actors. This film is certainly not like many other teen-target flicks, its one that is brutally honest and profoundly easy for many teenagers to relate to."
"robsta23","8","0","1","12 July 2015"," Delightful Tale, Made me Uncomfortable Towards the End
","This is the last film I had to watch for a class on young adult literature adaptation this summer. It might be safe to say this was my favorite film out of the three works we had to study this summer, the other two being ""The Fault in Our Stars"" and ""My Sister's Keeper.""<br/><br/>I know I shouldn't really compare a film adaptation to its predecessor very often, but I am going to for a few aspects. While the letter-writing idea seemed to work for the novel, to be honest we probably could have gotten the same idea if Charlie simply narrated this film. The letter-writing in this film does not make too much sense since a film is a visual representation, so we see the experiences. Plus, how does writing a letter to the audience work in a film in general?<br/><br/>I liked how there was more interaction between Charlie and his teacher (played by Paul Rudd) in the film than in the novel. We get to see why the teacher becomes friends with Charlie when everyone in Charlie's class looks at him as an outcast - by the way, people in real life aren't as bullied as Charlie is in this film, even if they are ""nerdy"" or whatever stereotypes bullies tend to go after.<br/><br/>The film doesn't really address this, but the story takes place in 1991 and 1992, which explains the lack of technology in the film that I bet people didn't even notice. The story is relevant to this time period (being released in 2012) while touching on a completely different decade - and the beginning of that decade for that matter.<br/><br/>As for technical aspects of the film, I thought the acting was pretty mediocre for the most part. The camera-work was pretty standard as far as cinematography goes in this day and age, and the same goes for the editing. I think the strongest part of the film is Charlie's internal thoughts and the brief flashbacks we get to read into his life with more insight. A more dramatic coming-of-age tale, and a decent film. Though the cast isn't loaded with talent, more of the cast should have been recognized. I feel like the big selling point of this movie is that Emma Watson is the female lead."

We never had gay drama, and I am not big on Rocky Horror (though many are), but I can see this.<br/><br/>Not a bad story overall, and it is really driven by having Emma Watson play Sam. With or without her, it would be a good film, but I think she provides the star power and the emotional vulnerability that really sell the character. She is really the only big star in the film, other than those who were left to be little more than cameos (Paul Rudd, Joan Cusack).

The Perks of Being a Wallpower does an ideal job of doing that; it also creates this incredibly real representation of important supreme teenage characters. I will say this that this movie did not feel like typical teenager/high school movie where it is mostly focused on partying and going completely wild (Euro Trip, Super-Bad). The focus of this movie is seeing high school students struggle and going through a tough teenage time, which bring in the realism to this movie. This movie is an adaptation of the novel with same name written by Stephen Chbosky. <br/><br/>A quick little of summary of this film without giving too much detail because it is movie that I consider to a must see. Charlie (Logan Lerman) is entering high school as a freshman but there is something strange about this young man. He's shy, socially awkward, and has a hard time making new friends. He's not a bad student; as a matter of fact he's a great student. He connects well with his English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd). A little along the road Charlie meets with two characters Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson). The two take Charlie under their wing and begin a new set of adventures. How does Charlie react to his new set of friends? Does Charlie become different from whom he was in the beginning of this film? Those questions will all be answered until you see the movie yourself. <br/><br/>In terms of acting I must say the three main performers gave an excellent performances. There's this instant likable connection with each of these characters. The acting is what made that happen. The rest of the cast did a great job too.

The film is perfectly directed and has amazing performances by the main actors, especially from Ezra Miller who brought such personality to a character who could be so easily ruined by some other actor.<br/><br/>It shows a group of friends and their adventures without being totally predictable, lame or clich√© which nowadays it something really rare. I've watched the movie a hundred times and I never get tired because the movie is different, not like another teenage movie that shows teens with problems with their parents because they can't go to a party or problems with their girlfriend/boyfriend because they cheated on them, and stuff like that. I also love how the characters are developed during the movie. The perk of being a wallflower it's not just another movie, it's a remarkable movie that deserves all the credits."

","I loved the book, I read it almost two years ago now and I think that is generally a good amount of time to leave between reading a book and watching the movie. It is a wonderful movie, in every way. As it has been a while since I read it I wasn't annoyed by the details or story lines the filmmakers have left out. Although, I don't think it would have bothered me even if I had finished the book two weeks ago. The script is great, flows naturally, it is shot beautifully, the soundtrack is perfect, the acting is good and the casting is spot on. Logan Lerman IS Charlie. The only thing that bothered me a bit was Emma Watsons acting, but hey that's probably just me and I got over it. Also the thought of what high school in the states must be like if it is in any way like it is portrayed in movies stresses me out a lot..<br/><br/>I think I have been feeling a little lost without noticing lately but this movie helped me get back to myself. For gods sake, this is the first movie my lazy ass has bothered to write a review about! Ever! And I been on IMDb for at least a decade! It's not my favourite movie in the world (I have a tendency to love sci-fi or fantasy or anything with lots of crazy props) but its up there, among other movies close to my heart.<br/><br/>More people should be like Charlie. Kindness is a underrated trait."

","In the 2013 film rendition of the 1999 novel by Stephen Chbosky, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a coming of age story narrated by main character Charlie, a fifteen year old, introverted teenager nervous about making new friends when entering his first year of high school. With a lot to overcome in his past, Charlie has reservations towards building trustworthy relationships with new people. On his first day of school once sent off by his older sister, Charlie shortly becomes overwhelmed with the new experience that is high school. After a not so pleasant morning, he settles down at lunch with two senior step siblings, Sam and Patrick. Hanging around an older crowd, Charlie begins to experiment with the party scene causing him to start to lose control of his depression. As the three begin to grow closer, Patrick shares that he is gay, Sam admits to being sexually assaulted as a young girl, while Charlie bluntly blurts out the story of his best friend's suicide at a party one night when they were all high. The night before Sam is to leave for college Charlie proclaims his love for her, while Sam regrets why he didn't mention anything sooner. That same night Charlie becomes very aggressive with his sister due to his distraught state finally reaching its boiling point. Charlie is taken to a psych ward where through treatment his parents discover that Charlie's aunt sexually abused him as a child. Two months later, Sam and Patrick return from college to visit Charlie in the hospital. The movie ends with the three friends riding through a lit tunnel with empowering music playing loudly as the audience begins to see Charlie finally overcome his fears. <br/><br/>Many novel to film combinations have the possibility of going horribly wrong. While trying to translate from off screen to on, plot structure can be rearranged or completely lost, relationships may come across as lackluster, or themes can be skewed. With many of the former disappointments an audience of readers is left feeling much left to be desired from their favorite book turned movie portrayal. It is extremely easy for direction of a film to quickly fall to the wrath of poor execution. All confusion regarding structure could be avoided though, if miscommunication between screen director and novelist was unapparent leading to a more cohesive plan for overall development. Although there are plenty of books that are excellently implemented into record breaking money making movies due to the phenomenal amount of fans, no movie, in my opinion, has ever come close to perfected development from paper to screen like The Perks of Being a Wallflower did. Not only was the plot brilliantly executed, it was the realness of the film's cast that portrayed Chbosky's characters better on the screen than how most readers of the novel would have to agree the way they imagined them in their minds. The ultimate goal of a successful director is to recreate the world that readers have set in their minds of how the story takes place. Directors want those that have read the book prior to seeing the film to be satisfied with the cast's interactions and expand their feelings and inclusivity of the friendships built while sharing more aspects of the plot through dramatic irony which is more difficult and achieved differently in a book than it can be in the depiction of the movie. This was more than successfully accomplished in The Perks of Being a Wallflower since Chbosky, the author of the novel, was also the director of the film. No better way to match the portrayal of characters and plot structure from a novel to a film than to have the man himself who first created them expand and essentially recreate their representation in a different dimension. There's always an extra additive of emotion and realness when seeing what you've conjured in your mind from reading come to life on the screen. Personally after leaving the theater in awe of what I had just witnessed, I found myself still thinking about the movie weeks and weeks after I had seen it, which I would have to say in assumption that, that is a special rarity for most people when viewing cinematic events. After reading the novel, I felt accomplished and enjoyed getting to know the characters ultimately getting to watch them grow through their relationships and into their own persons. Although I didn't feel as personally engaged in the novel as I did while seeing the film. For most it seems easier to relate when you are seeing the actions literally unfold in front of you and not just having to imagine them in your head. When characters are not developed in their entirety in a movie interpretation, readers are left disappointed and essentially did not gain any new experience from seeing the movie than they did from reading the book. In The Perks of Being a Wallflower film, no disappointment is felt. The characters the Chbosky recreates for the screen increase the amount of vulnerability and unknown innocence that the author was trying to bring to life in the novel in the first place. To be able to see this coming of age story grow and flourish on the screen was a beautiful experience. I've heard the same coming of age story before with the childhood abuse, suicide, and abusive relationships, but Chbosky's telling completely reimaged my thoughts regarding those situations based solely on how well he was able to translate the relationships from just words on a piece of paper to a real time emotional encounter. A story both on screen and off has never felt so relatable and honest. I would highly recommend both the novel and the film to anyone interested in experiencing the beautiful gift of infinite friendship and love."

","Charlie is just starting high school and things aren't going well and it looks as if he is going to have a lonely three years. Then he becomes friends with Patrick, a senior who is in one of Charlie's classes, and his step sister Sam. He is soon hanging out with them and joins their circle of friends¬Ö he is also rapidly falling in love with Sam but has no idea how to tell her just how he feels and to make it even harder she is dating somebody else. Things are still going well though, until another friend invites him to a dance; she takes his acceptance to mean they are now a couple and he can't think of a nice way to say he doesn't feel the same way. Inevitably he eventually does it in the worst possible way and it looks as if he has lost his group of friends. While this is going on we learn that both Sam and Charlie have had troubled pasts and in Charlie's case it appears he isn't over those events.<br/><br/>Growing up in the eighties I enjoyed high school films like 'The Breakfast Club' and found this to be in the same league; indeed it felt as though it could have been made in the late eighties or early nineties¬Ö and not just because it is set then. The film skilfully captures Charlie's feeling of being alone; indeed the opening scenes are quite painful to watch. Logan Lerman does a fine job as Charlie; the bookish teenager who feels totally alone, Ezra Miller is entertaining as Patrick and Emma Watson is a delight as Sam. Writer/director Stephen Chbosky does a great job bringing his story to the screen although I occasionally wanted a bit more detail. Overall I'd say this is a very enjoyable coming of age film but be warned it does have a few dark moments before we get a happy ending."
"Culpritsfear","Null","0","2","24 January 2015"," Simply brilliant!
","I decided to watch this film more or less out of boredom. I have never really heard of it before and my expectations were accordingly not very high. I expected to see a typical high school romance drama or something in similar. I wasn't prepared to see the one of the best casted movies with a fascinating and twisting storyline I have seen in a long time. The story was not only very deep and emotional but also -and this is in my opinion super important- extremely believable and honest. The fact that Chbosky is both author and director of the movie and book results in a storyline very near to the one in the novel. The acting performances of the main actors are outstanding and make the characters pretty likable. The phases that Charlie goes through during his freshman year invite the viewer to relive one's own experiences during high school and help developing a sympathy for Charlie and his friends. Also the movie deals with problems like homosexuality and drugs without trying to judge. This movie is a special teen story with believable characters and storyline that you can watch more than once without a doubt."
"brunettewarrior","Null","0","1","16 January 2015"," Felt too adult
","I give this 6 out of 10 stars because I like the intentions of this film, but am unsure about the subject matter. I feel as if it was a bit pretentious at times- a whole lot of preaching life lessons- and not a whole lot of learning them the way most people learn them (the HARD way).<br/><br/>I may not agree with the way the story is told in film, but I do like the cast of Watson, Miller, and Lerman. Lerman gives us a lovable protagonist that many can empathize with. He's entering high school and going about the ""having a life"" bit that the adults all tell their kids to have, and in many cases, force them to have. The parents are rather distant in this story though. <br/><br/>Miller is my standout performer in this film. I adore Patrick, and I didn't know a thing about him, yet I felt like I knew him from my days in high school. Watson is stunning as Sam. I wanted to know her even more after learning her freshman year was a mess. <br/><br/>I wish the film covered Charlie's relationship with his aunt better than it did. Additionally wish his best friend was at least shown in flashbacks so I could connect even better with Charlie. <br/><br/>Overall, I liked this film for it's great music and good intentions."

I felt a bit skeptical to watch it, however, the way that all of the characters feelings are portrayed in this movie is just excellent. The 3 main characters played their roles really well and I really enjoyed it. To be honest, I thought it was going to be a stereotypical high school drama with all the key factors such as fitting in, making friends, having fun, and essentially, that is a big part of this movie, however the way it was directed and acted out by the characters was, in my opinion, really good."

","I have never connected to a group of characters in a film like I have with the Wallflowers. As a person living with social anxiety, I can place myself in the shoes of Charlie in almost every event in this film, from the first school dance to saying goodbye to the seniors after they graduate, Logan Lerman gives, in my opinion, one of the greatest performances of the 21st century. This film's screenplay, it's direction, and the performances of Lerman, Emma Watson, and Ezra Miller were all Oscar worthy. Unfortunately, before you even have a chance to experience the film, it is lumped in with the typical, half-assed, campy coming-of-age comedy-dramas. This film catches the raw emotion, sarcasm and fears associated with the first year of high school. If you see one more film in your adult life, I urge you to view The Perks of Being a Wallflower."
"nintendosegasonyguy","10","0","2","14 December 2014"," The greatest high school movie of all time - idiosyncratic characters done well.
","I think I can speak for a lot of people when I say that I am utterly sick of the ""idiosyncratic."" You know what I mean - modern movies that actively try to be different from mainstream cinema by employing characters and/or camera angles with countless quirks and odd behaviors. ""Be different!"" now translates to don't act like a normal human being. As far as I'm concerned, it's every bit of a horrendous clich√© by this point as the comedic pause or the loud noise in a movie trailer.<br/><br/>So in comes ""Perks of Being a Wallflower,"" originally a Stephen Chbosky a book (which I read long before the movie was announced at the recommendation of my older siblings) which he adapted into a film in 2012. I loved the book, but felt it was needlessly cruel or slightly lacking in some areas (although the ending, which I shall not elaborate on here, mostly made up for those minor problems). I was very excited when I saw the film trailer, and soon after saw it with my sisters and my mother.<br/><br/>I came out of the theater shaking, completely numb. I cannot express in words how blown away I was. Anything I say from this point on is really just a formality. It's really a movie you should go into knowing the most bare bones of information.<br/><br/>Stephen Chbosky knows how to writer idiosyncratic characters, plain and simple. Everyone, especially the main protagonist Charlie, is likable. The growth these characters go through is satisfying to watch and well warranted by the end. I won't go into individual scenes - any mention of such would dampen the actual experience somewhat. Just know that any scenes with music by The Smiths or any scenes that take place in a cafeteria will stick out to you for days after you watch the film. Even the deleted scenes on the DVD would've been perfect for inclusion in the actual movie, which is NOT something I can say for Endless Love or The Spectacular Now.<br/><br/>The ending is brilliant. One of the few movies I've ever seen that actually has an ending.<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite movies, and I can safely say that after watching it three times. Highly recommended. All high schoolers and college students NEED to watch this, but really, anyone who appreciates character driven stories and heartbreaking writing will enjoy it. Go out and watch it. Now. No, really. Right now."

","How ironic is it that the mad girl from two and a half men plays a mad Aunt who causes almost irreparable damage to her nephew although what exactly she did do is a little sketchy. Not that it really matters, you kind of get the gist of the effect this has on the main character (Logan Lerman) as he struggles to make friends and find love. And love is what he does find - with Sam (the most superbly beautiful Emma Watson). Some may say that Logan bears a stunning resemblance to Amanda Bynes in her guise as a young man from that teen movie ""She's the man"". This is a wildly crafty movie that will hold you till the end. A little bit of the old college geek bully syndrome done to death but not enough to give this movie a thumbs down. Well worth a look and even worthy of any home movie collection with just the right mix of know actors and fresh new-comers.Yes we can be heroes. don't forget to see my 3D games reviews as the only 3D nVision reviewer on IMDb!"

","This film treats the life of teenagers at the beginning of high school. I can see myself in the character portrayed by Logan Lerman(which is, by the way, a very promising actor, you should check him out in Fury as well). The movie deals problems like friendship, taboo subjects and bullies from an interesting perspective. At first I thought that this is another semi-comedy with some teenagers getting drunk and fooling around. I was wrong, this is totally different. And I must say that I liked this movie even though I am a foreigner and in my country things aren't really how they are in the movie, but not the location, or the ceremonies are important. What moved me were the character's feelings towards each others, feelings which don't depend whether you're born in a small country from Europe, or in the US."
"obeirnemadison21","10","0","1","29 September 2014"," Book brilliantly brought to life
","In my opinion this movie is the best movie that was originally a book of all time. Mostly you go to see your fav book turned into a movie, and you're hella excited and can't wait to see what type of beautiful work has been re-created, but you're usually all disappointed cause they couldn't manage to fit every part, and it's all rushed and not what you were hoping for... BUT with this movie it accurately depicts almost every part in the book, and the parts in the book you tried visualizing in you're head, are exactly if not even better on the screen. The director does a wonderful job of making the famous quote ""welcome to the lane of misfits"" by telling the story of each teenager and how different they are. The movie covers homophobia, depression, incest, and suicide. He makes it all feel so real too. Also, in the book never does it tell you that the main character was sexually abused by his aunt. Maybe it was assumed? but i and most others never caught on to that. The director ties all of the main character Charlie's past events together by revealing his aunt was sexual with him as a child. Which is why in the movie he felt suicidal,and blamed himself for his aunts death. He believed he loved his aunt with all his heart, when really he hated her so much on the inside it drove him mad. The director brought that twist into the movie, and it brought tears to your eyes which the book did not do for me.I also really enjoyed that throughout the whole movie you really never knew what time period it was. It was honestly so timeless, focusing on the important issues teenagers face in high school. The constant inner dialogue that the main character has with himself towards the ends really brings the urgency that he is having a break down to life. All the fast shots and fading in and out of memories. It makes you feel what Charlie is feeling throughout the whole scene. You can feel your pulse getting quicker and the final scene when the police kick in the door, and then cuts straight into Charlie waking up at a mental institute gives me infinite chills. I think this is one of the best movies of all time, and i find any generation can relate to it in some way or another."

","From book to big screen, Perk of Being a Wallflower is another classic example of producers and directors perfectly capturing a plot and bringing it to life. With so much emotion throughout the movie, there is never a dull moment. Whether you're laughing, crying, or on the edge of your seat, you will not regret seeing this coming of age movie that is sure to become a classic. <br/><br/>The main character in this film is named Charlie, who is played by Logan Lerman. This in itself may be considered a difficult task, because Logan must play a freshman in high school, who is depressed, suicidal, and love struck by a fellow student‚Äîa senior‚Äînamed Sam. Lerman perfectly captures this portrayal, not only with his facial expressions, but with his tone as well. He goes from the sad and depressing voice we hear when he is by himself or writing a letter to his 'friend', to the shy and nervous voice we hear when he is around Sam and his other friends. <br/><br/>A lot of it is not just the acting, but also what the actors are saying. There are so many deep thoughts and conversations captured in this film, and I felt as though I was included in many of these conversations. The actors not only made me believe what they were saying, but they made me feel it‚Äîlike when Charlie so nonchalantly comments about his best friend who committed suicide‚Äîit felt real. Although some people may see him as the crazy freshman who spent time in a mental institute, we know from his conversations with his 'friend' that he is very intellectual and he is trying to get better. <br/><br/>Charlie has more emotions than anyone in this whole movie, and I can tell this just by what he says and how he says it. There is a scene where Charlie is in the school cafeteria when he suddenly spots his friend Patrick being beat up. We see a short clip of Charlie raising his fist to punch a guy in the face, then it cuts to everyone staring at Charlie, who now has a bruised hand. Before he walks away, Charlie calmly and firmly says 'If you touch my friends again, I'll blind you'. Even though he has not spoken to them in weeks, this may be one of the most powerful moments in the film. <br/><br/>There aren't very many places that we see the characters multiple times in the movie, except Charlie in his bedroom. Otherwise we can see our stars either at a restaurant, at a house party, in the cafeteria, wood shop class, football stadium, etc¬Ö There are so many different sets, but each one contributes something new to the movie. As far as originality goes, the only movies I have ever seen about typical high schoolers‚Äîdoing drugs, going to parties, having sex‚Äîhave all just done nothing but criticize it. This movie is able to accurately capture the real struggles and pressures of a stereotypical high school experience. We know that not every student goes through these problems, but through this film we are almost able to experience that without feeling like we are being lectured that it is such a bad thing, and that we will go to hell if any of that stuff happens in our life. <br/><br/>We must not let the fear of mainstream high school sitcoms cloud our willingness to see this one. As quoted by Urban Dictionary, 'wallflower' is defined as ""A type of loner. Often a very interesting person if someone talks to them."" So just from the title of the movie, you can tell that Charlie will not just be bandwagoning his way through freshman year, and the rest of high school."

","It is not quite often a book author can direct a film adapted from his own novel, but Stephen Chbosky did it with this partially autobiographic story about a high school freshman Charlie (Lerman), gains love and friendship during the first year with his soon-to-be-graduated senior schoolmates. <br/><br/>Charlie is from a conventional Catholic family (McDermott and Walsh as his parents), ever since the beginning, Chbosky never cease to cue us that there are some lurking secrets of his past experience, and during the middle point, we knows his best friend committed suicide one year ago, yet, it is not the whole story, there is something more insidious and unspeakable hidden beneath, up till the very end, viewers will promptly get the truth out of the patchwork of its flashback sequences and it is a subdued strategy to present the truth in a way does not feel out of the place with the main plot line. <br/><br/>Instead of exploiting the shock value, Chbosky exerts his great effort to explore the heartfelt emotional pizazz of Charlie's blossoming first love with his senior schoolmate Sam (Watson), and how he acquire not only true love but also genuine friendship in the coterie lead by Sam and her step-brother Patrick (Miller). In a slow-burning but invigorating narrative, the film tread the same water of a high-schooler's bittersweet life, but thanks to the superb cast, namely the three main young actors, their candid feelings are immensely palpable, Lerman is definitely too cute to be overlooked as a wallflower, but his intent gaze and compelling sensibility is heart-meltingly inviting us to Charlie's wounded heart. <br/><br/>Her first acting role after HARRY POTTER franchise, Emma Watson builds a fetching character as the pretty girl with a puzzled mind for her future, convincingly acts on her American accent, she never lose the spotlight whenever she in on the screen, even though her character's flair possibly is undermined by her supportive function both as a girl with poor taste in men and a kindred spirit Charlie can wholeheartedly relate with due to his own dark secret. Ezra Miller, afresh from WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN (2011, 8/10), imbues an utterly contrasted performance here, idiosyncratic but full of sincerity, briskly jolly and playful, although his miserable gay relationship drains off his effervescence to some degree, his THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW (1975, 8/10) lip-syncing impersonation is pungently enthralling and the two faces of Patrick's plight stand up as a cogent subplot which concretes the POV of our modern day relationship, we are confidently blinded by our own perception of love, in a pathological masochism. <br/><br/>The mix-tapes gambits are really welcoming and put into a better use here as a teen spirit for youngsters in the 90s, and the film is a beacon of an examination of the mindset of adolescence in USA, really well done with its unforced delivery and all the bells and whistles never drag the main theme out of the sight, the family is united in the end, even the adults are all more realistically portrayed without any default vice to sabotage the authentic tonality, save one key plot device, the underused Melanie Lynskey. THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER almost cracks into my top 10 films of the year, and Stephen Chbosky is very skillful in transform his subject matter onto another media, but for the three brilliant young players, they deserve more kudos because their performances are all in Oscar caliber!"

It is very emotional, didactic and catchy as well. The direction was good, with nice cinematography and music, but the movie had an abrupt ending, and a few facts were not clearly explained. Since the characters of the movie liked a certain kind of music, you are sure to fall in love with it! Especially the tunnel song (Heroes). The picturization of the exact experiences of the protagonists were very good, and the mood of the movie is so perfect that you will actually feel the movie even though you don't actually understand it."

","It is the first time I review a movie but I thought his one deserved my public appraisal. After reading the book, I was a bit skeptical but in my opinion, this has been one of the best adaptations I have ever seen. I guess having the author so deeply involved might be one of the reasons. Although I am certainly not a teenage anymore, I felt it again for a little while. Many wonderful memories from my youth came back. I shared with Charlie many of his emotions of happiness, loneliness, sadness, love, etc. Although some people might not see this movie as too realistic, the emotions in it and the ones that provokes in the audience certainly are. I won't go into details but I will just say that this is a very nice movie to watch regardless of your age but I would recommend to read the book first to get a deeper understanding of the three main characters."

","This film is excellent, I was crying at the end of it. Logan Lerman performs Charlie really well and gives that edge of being the character. All the characters were brilliant and the film is definitely a must watch. However, I would advise you to read the book first as the film glances over some detail. Parents ought to watch the film first as they may deem it to 'grown up' for their child. The director being the author of the book really helps, Chbosky did a great job with both film and book. Not as good as Harry Potter though, despite Emma Watson's brilliant portrayal of Sam. I especially enjoyed Patrick. Great Film. You must buy it on Amazon üòÅ. Don't use Amazon Prime of you do."

","I believe quite firmly that this movie was made for chicks to sit down and ooh, ahhh, and cry over, but I enjoyed it immensely. I was a freshman just like Charlie when I saw it, and it chronicles this suicidal kid's life quite nicely, showing that sometimes a group of kids is willing to take in a stray despite any age differences, and that sometimes a girl with a different guy that she's in love with is willing to help out a guy that has feelings for her.<br/><br/>The movie also deals with gay romances and drugs as well as bullying. The director has handled these things very well, almost with a finesse.<br/><br/>It's a chronicle of teen romance. I'd recommend it more for girls than guys, but see if you think you should."

","I completely underestimated this movie! I had absolutely no idea what it was about going into it. I actually decided to watch it because it was the only thing available on TV that particular day. This movie was released in 2012, the same year I graduated high school and after I watched The Perks of Being a Wall Flower, I had such an optimistic outlook. This amazing movie made me a so much more thankful for the fact that everyone is different, everyone comes from a different background, and everyone has their own beliefs because of situations they've lived through. People should be who they truly are and shouldn't feel the need to live up to standards of not only others but, society as a whole. I recall a few friends in high school that went out of their way to make it in with the ""cool kids"" and ended up embarrassing themselves trying to impress the wrong people and pushing actual friends aside. I was one of those friends pushed aside and honestly, I'm glad because when they realized who was who, I was still there for them. I believe that's what counts in a friendship. I seen this situation in The Perks of Being a Wall Flower and seeing it displayed made me so grateful for this movie! The Perks of Being a Wall Flower depicts the story of a boy coming of age, if you will. The main characters, with a few not mentioned, come together and help each other to conquer heartaches and headaches. The main character Charlie, played by Logan Lerman, is going into his freshman year of high school. He strives to find peace due to a tragedy that happened to him as a child. Someone that would assume the role as a protector betrayed him in one of the worst ways. Charlie keeps this confusing secret to himself and it causes him to act out without really realizing. His whole family undergoes what seems like problems until Charlie reveals the truth. The character Sam, played by Emma Watson, is going into her senior year as Charlie begins high school. Charlie helps Sam improve in her schooling and Sam provides encouragement and shows Charlie happiness. Sam encountered some drama that many girls face going through their high school career. Sam takes her situation and makes the best out of it and I personally think many girls should look up to her - not for the acts she's committed ‚Äì but, to her attitude after overcoming. Another big character is played by Ezra Miller, Patrick, who is also a senior and Sam's step-brother. Patrick has a secret that shouldn't really be a secret. His over spoken, outgoing, and over jolly personality distracts you, but makes complete sense when the whole story is laid out.<br/><br/>In the movie there is a scene where Charlie is taken to his first high school party and ends up eating a brownie, little did he know it wasn't your average brownie¬Ö he ends up pretty high and speaks his opinions about school, letterman jackets and how the marching band isn't really a sport.., even tells his soon to be girlfriend that she will grow up and regret her current hair-do. On this night Charlie also shares with Sam that he lost his best friend. Sam and her step-brother, Patrick, then welcome Charlie into their circle of friends¬Ö ""Welcome to the island of misfit toys"" and they toast to him. Charlie is now a wall flower ‚Äì he see's things and understands. I'm such a fan of Logan Lerman (Charlie) because his acting during this scene really shows how touched his character was that not only did people notice him, but accepted and liked him! I think a lot of people, not just teens in high school can relate to at least one of these characters in one way or another. I think this movie brings light to a lot of controversial issues that are often not spoken of due to the seriousness of the acts, it makes this movie that much more brilliant. It reaches thousands of people through a story of a couple of high school kids. Some may see the cover or read the summary on the back of the DVD case and think, ""Meh... just another high school drama movie like The Lizzie McGuire Movie."" This movie offers so much more than ridiculous and over-rated chick drama or a love story that everyone knows the end too. I think every youngster should watch this movie to see how compassion, love, and understanding can affect someone. Over all, I give this movie 10 stars and I highly doubt any disappointment if you watch it."

","Beautiful, wonderful, thought-provoking, bittersweet and moving movie. Plot is intriguing, but it is more a character-based movie. The characters are well-developed and you feel an empathy for all of them. The lighter side of the characters is wonderful, the darker sides harrowing, giving a sense of real lives. <br/><br/>Think of the movie as a darker, less Hollywood, version of an 80s John Hughes movie. If nothing else, the yearning back towards ones own teen years should be the main take-away from this movie.<br/><br/>Excellent performances all round, especially from Logan Lerman in the lead role. Good support from Emma Watson and Ezra Miller.

Stephen Chbosky's direction (from his own book of the same name) is certainly not ostentatious, and this is probably wise. Too much camera tomfoolery would probably distract attention from what is really quite a personal, everyday drama.

"TravelingRose","9","0","1","30 August 2013"," One of the Best Movies of the Year
","I loved so much about this movie its hard to know where to begin. High-school students are frequently portrayed as either nasty (like those who would lock someone in a locker or strip them of their clothes so they have to walk home naked), or they're simply portrayed as so stupid you can't figure out how they ever advanced to high school. But NOT IN THIS MOVIE. <br/><br/>This came across as real life high-school to me - a mother of two: One a high school kid; one a high-school graduate. These are young adults (not young idiots like in most high-school themed movies). They have real life events going on, and real-life feelings and reactions to them. The writing was outstanding and believable in every respect. Outstanding job by Stephen Chbosky. The acting - particularly that of the primary 2 characters was of such a calibre that I truly hope they both continue to get lots of acting roles in the future. And a special shout-out to Emma Watson who did an American accent flawlessly.<br/><br/>Everyone I recommended the movie to thought it was excellent. Another Mom saw it with her husband, and then went back later that week with her two children.<br/><br/>My only beef: I feel as this movie either lacked adequate promotion, or was simply snubbed at every awards show for no apparent reason. Something of an injustice for such an outstanding movie."

"jwsg-554-45231","9","0","1","9 August 2013"," The Perks of Being ""Inifinite""
","The overall premise to the movie is growing up with a unique outlook on the world. In a lot of ways I feel that many people can relate to the character of Charlie in the movie as being a social outcast. Whether they are currently in the early stages of their life experiencing that awkward phase, or simply remember that time in their life. Everyone at one point or another has strived to be a ""wallflower"" (and in most cases still are). The term ""wallflower"" simply defines standing out amongst the crowd, while one of the main perks to being a wallflower is just that; being able to distinguish yourself by exploring your own unique talents and traits. <br/><br/>The film deals with the many complexities that not just encompass what a typical teenager goes through, but what many people have to go through at some point in their life (death, loneliness, social anxiety). One of the most recognizable words from the film is being described as ""infinite"". In a moment of true happiness and satisfaction we feel infinite, as if we could take on the world and accomplish anything. That feeling then stays with you as one of the main perks of being a wallflower. A unique asset to the world around you. In that moment, you come to the realization of your true potential and the legacy you will leave behind. It is then, when you truly feel ""infinite"". <br/><br/>Charlie ~ ""And in that moment, I swear we were infinite""."
"robert-temple-1","10","0","1","8 August 2013"," 'We accept the love we think we deserve.'
","This is one of the most emotional films I have seen in years. The casting of the three main characters is so perfect that you cannot imagine anyone else playing any of those parts. The power and truth and nakedness of the main performances is heart-rending. It is rare to see anyone reveal so much in front of a camera, and it reminds me of Marilu Parolini baring her soul so totally in the documentary CHRONICLE OF A SUMMER (1961, see my review). The most astounding performance of all is from Ezra Miller, and perhaps the reason why he is able to convey the torment of his character as a gay boy so well is that he had publicly admitted that he is himself gay, so presumably he had some unfortunate experiences of his own to draw upon. As for Emma Watson, who'd've thunkit? One minute she's a cute child doing magic tricks with witches and before you can blink, there she is, a young woman with all kinds of complex feelings and torments. She is most extraordinary in her role, and she will doubtless have a long and brilliant career in front of her for the next, shall we say sixty, years? For who will ever tire of her? And then there is Logan Lerman, who has his own problems being shy, a wallflower (hence the title), inarticulate, and lacking in confidence. He too is marvellous in his part. The three characters all suffer from extreme early traumas, especially Lerman and Watson, and suffer every day quietly behind their facades, or in the cases of Watson and Miller, perhaps not so quietly, as they are superficially wild extroverts attempting to mask their isolation and desperation behind extremes of bravado. All three actors had early experience in front of the camera and are able to ignore its presence, so one can say the casting was as perfect as it gets. The three and their immediate friends all consider themselves the misfits in the local high school in Pennsylvania, where this film is set. Lerman at first is too shy to speak, and hides in corners, but Miller and Watson 'discover' and adopt him, so he opens up and begins living. Lerman is in his first year and the others are in their last year, so in the latter part of the film where Lerman is left alone at the beginning of his second year and feels abandoned certainly rang bells with me, as a similar thing happened to me after my first year at university, most of my friends having been several years older than myself and then they suddenly vanished like the mist. The film was so evocative that I had some very sad moments indeed remembering that same sense of abandonment which Lerman goes through, and which I had long ago suppressed from my own experience. To be 'the only one left' anywhere is a devastating thing to go through. A friend of mine who lived to be 105 brought it all home to me most powerfully by saying to me wistfully when he was only in his 90s that everyone who had been a 'lifelong' close friend of his had died at least 25 years before, including his wife, and there had not been any 'old friend' of his alive to talk to for more than a quarter of a century. So I guess that's worse than Logan Lerman's predicament. This film is based on a novel and screenplay by Stephen Chbosky (I suppose that's Polish and was originally Chboski, since Polish names don't end in 'y'; the 'ch' would be breathed at the back of the palate and not pronounced hard). Chbosky directs the film himself, and it is so intense and 'real' that it is clear that no one else could have done it with the necessary authenticity. And he is a really brilliant director in any case. He is presumably the basis for Lerman's character, and Chbosky himself comes from Pennsylvania. One wonders and dreads to think what became of 'his' Watson and Miller, the real ones he must have known, and whether they made it or not. Deep underneath all the manufactured merriment, these characters are really suffering. The way this is portrayed is a genuine contribution to showing real and true psychological dilemmas on the screen for a mass audience, which normally sees wholly artificial character situations in contrived stories. This film is so real you can step right through the screen and hold their hands, and they need it. I take all my hats off to Stephen Chbosky. He is really one of the best American filmmakers now. What a delight, and what a heartache. And the last scene is perfect."

Another thing is, some movies are way too long and could be summed up in about half the amount of time it took to watch it but this movie isn't like that at all. It wasn't too short and it wasn't too long. It has about an accurate take on average high school lives and didn't exaggerate anything to the point where it would be considered annoying.

","When I first heard of this movie, I discarded it like many watching movie trailers on TV would. I thought to myself, this is just another low graded under-budget movie that someone is trying to pass off for a top-charts block-buster, and as a result later on when the movie was released into theaters I thought I was right. No one was fan- girl/boy the next day like people were for the hunger games, I didn't see people in the streets wearing shirts that had the movie title on the front, there was absolutely nothing the represent the existence of that movie. Now i'm the type of old school kind of person who likes words rather than people acting on a movie screen, that's why whenever a movie based on a book comes out I make a point of reading the book before I watch the movie so I could get all the true details from the book first, now one day in my English class we had have been giving a reading list assignment, and the assignment was to read one of the books on that list. The first book I saw on the list was The perks of being a wall flower and I thought the movie didn't look so great why would the book be any different but like I said before I like words, so I read the book. I read that entire book in less than 5 hours, it just kept sucking me in, every word every sentence I ate up until there was nothing left to read and i was sitting there in my room dumbfounded. That book had been the greatest thing i had ever read in my life, its such a soulful, rich, beautiful and truly magnificent read every thing about it was genius right down the last period. After reading the book I drove to the movie theater to watch the movie as well, and the film was also just as amazing as the book, it was all so promising with the right actors the right music the right everything. The perks of being a wallflower honestly is the best book and movie to ever come out in a long long time, sometimes I wish I could be whoever reading this review deciding whether or not to peruse this movie just so I could experience the excitement of it all once again. If you are still deciding whether or not to watch this film I highly encourage you to if your looking for something truly amazing and then if you want more the book would also be just as good for you as well."

But I think the movie was great, simple but interesting and meaningful. At first it reminds me about the novel ""Speak"". Same kind of story, same structure, same kind of story telling. And I love ""Speak"", so apparently I fell in love with this movie right away.<br/><br/>I know that many people consider the film as something messy, not clear about where and when it set, and the character seems to be too confident and rich, with drugs abuse, drinking, smoking, sex¬Ö But these are actually the thing I love about the movie. You have got to be persist watching a film with such an unclear opening, you collect information about the characters a bit at a time, their names, their life, their tragedy¬Ö At first, Charlie seems to be a guy who is broken and Sam and Patrick are characters who will help him to change his mind and keep moving forward ‚Äì if you think so, yes, it's typical and labored. But it turns out much better than that. Every minute passes, you see them showing a little bit of their soul and their wound, and you know that even the people who make jokes and smile all the time have deep secrets and sadness in their soul. And at last you completely fall in love with these characters, how they are deeply insecure and flamboyant at the same time. <br/><br/>Especially I love Patrick. After watching the movie, I went online and read character analysis about him, but I didn't agree with it. It says that Patrick has never a real friend to Charlie. I think, that was at first. Patrick is a character built with many contradictions, he pretends to be happy all the time while having a secret and inhibited relationship with Brad and being called 'Nothing'. He scares to believe in others, scares of taking risk expressing his feelings. So he put on an optimistic image, and be stuck in it. But when Charlie fights with other students to protect him, he starts to believe in Charlie, that's why he chooses Charlie to go out with at night. He still can't express his sadness, but at least he understands that there is someone listening to him and staying by his side. Ezra Miller has touched my heart with this character.<br/><br/>I don't really care about when and where the scene is set. It can be anytime, anywhere, but what matters here is that the characters make me feel real and connected. Love this movie and I will definitely see this again!"

But something is missed , to be unforgiven , there is not a semiotic/ semantic repartition,instantaneousness of time that author is living in isn't admit , characters aren't well done , like they were daguerreotypes of a paint who pretends to be a photograph. There's not a minimal perception. The adaptation starts quite good but it's always more lighted and shaded to the last minutes of the movie. It's not gold all that glitters but even the bigotry makes his part."

","It's always interesting when someone writes, adapts, directs, and produces their own film. You get a real chance to see someone's artistic vision portrayed on screen with very little outside influence.<br/><br/>This film moves alone okay, Logan Lerman is good as Charlie, but Emma Watson and Ezra Miller as siblings Sam and Patrick are the real stars here. Everything moves along nicely as a standard teen drama about the new/awkward kid at school with some fun (if clich√©) party and dance scenes.<br/><br/>Then the movie takes a serious turn as it delves into the pasts of the main characters and becomes depressing and drawn out until the conclusion.<br/><br/>In the end I would say it's worth watching, and the actors clearly had a great time filming it."

","So I decided to watch this film and I've only just finished watching, so my opinion on this movie is fresh. <br/><br/>Emma Watson does an American accent in this film and at first its annoying. But eventually you get used to it. <br/><br/>Apart from that this movie was amazing. The acting was superb by all the cast. The story was brilliant also(I've never read the book). This was just such a feel good movie but at the same time, being very serious, easy to relate to. The directing was also great.<br/><br/>The reason I liked this film so much is that you almost forget your watching a film. The characters are just so believable and acted well that you forget your watching a movie. And when a film does that, you know it was a great movie. <br/><br/>So my final rating is. 5/5 Stars."

","The Perks of Being a Wallflower- *** (out of 4): Is the film based off the popular '90s novel a brilliant or distinctive movie? Not really. Is it an interesting, sweet, engaging film? Absolutely. Of course this film is full of clich√©s at almost every turn: the introvert finding acceptance and love with a group of counter-cultural oddballs. Yes. It is quite a clich√©. However, I found the film's depiction of adolescence and its love for its teenage characters enjoyable and sweet. Lerman may be a bit too handsome and smooth for Charley, but once we get started, we don't care. The movie of course would not be half as good without Ezra Miller and Paul Rudd. Both of these actors make this film worthwhile. Anybody who had trouble with high school will like it. Anybody with a heart worth its weight will connect with it. Despite its clich√©s. Go watch it."

","Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller make this one of the best movies of 2012. There is so much more to the movie than the basic plot: a high school freshman (Charlie, played by Logan Lerman) who is dealing with the suicide of his best friend starts high school with no friends, and no social skills. At a school dance, where he stands against the wall watching, he forces himself to go out on to the dance floor when he sees an unconventional couple (Sam played by Emma Watson and Patrick played by Ezra Miller) dancing to their own beat, and joins them. From this brave step to join life around him, Charlie meets Sam and Patrick's friends, all of who are high school seniors and in their own social clique of ""wallflowers"". The other all-too-familiar high school cliques play a part in Charlie's demons, and when he has to say goodbye to his friends when they are all graduating and going on to college, his dark inner life crashes in on him. This story delves into all the issues young people face today while finding themselves and their path in life: their sexuality, falling in love, family issues. Charlie though has a darker past that he's buried so deep that he only remembers bits and pieces in flashes. It is when he talks with Sam about her past, all the while falling in love with her, that his own secrets start to push to the surface. Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller have proved themselves to be actors with a range of talents, and while Emma Watson of course is very well known from her Harry Potter movies, she shows here that she is more than Hermione Granger in every way. This is an excellent movie that I highly recommend."

","Charlie is an introvert teen trying to manoeuvre his way through his freshman year of high school. But it's difficult when you have no friends, you're dealing with recent tragedy in your life, and you've withdrawn into yourself. He's a prime target for bullying.<br/><br/>But then he meets Patrick and Sam, two quirky older teens who are inseparable. And full of life. Oh so full of life. They take Charlie under their wing and show him what it means to be accepted, to be understood, to be loved. ""Welcome to the island of misfit toys,"" Sam whispers to Charlie. For the first time in a long time, Charlie feels like he belongs and that he is surrounded by people who understand. And he starts to blossom and emerge from his cocoon.<br/><br/>But Charlie is still dealing with his own demons and recurring bouts of mental illness. His friends are the only things keeping him together. And when an incident temporarily tears them apart, he finds himself falling back into his emotional abyss.<br/><br/>But Charlie isn't the only one who has pain. Both Patrick and Sam have experienced their own troubles and each deals with them in a different way. Sam is thoughtful and tender but her low self-esteem leads her to accept less than she deserves from her suitors. Patrick sheaths his own internal turmoil with showy bravado in the form of an extrovert. <br/><br/>This was the most beautiful teen movie I've ever watched and tears emerged several times while watching it. I could feel the pain of the characters as I learned each of their secrets and realized that they were all just trying to make it through those torturous teen years without going crazy. The level of depth of each of these characters has hardly been matched in any other film I've seen.<br/><br/>I fell in love with Charlie, Sam and Patrick and was truly heartbroken to say goodbye to them as the credits began to roll. But I knew they had each other and that they had formed a lifelong bond that would see them through what would undoubtedly be more tough times ahead.<br/><br/>The three main actors in the movie are mind-blowingly good. Emma Watson does a great job breaking out of the Hermoine Granger pigeon hole as Sam. Logan Lerman is wonderful as Charlie: awkward, shy, uncertain, and sensitive. He wants to fit in but he doesn't quite know how. He needs to find friends that fit him. But Ezra Miller! Wow! This is the second ground-breaking performance I've seen him in. Following up a positively mesmerizing performance in ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"", Miller oozes flamboyance, charm and wit as Patrick. Others who round out an outstanding supporting cast include Paul Rudd, Joan Cusack and Dylan McDermott.<br/><br/>I rate this movie 9/10. It's a beautiful and touching glimpse into the lives of three incredible teenagers. I will hold fond memories of them all for a long time."

He starts discovering himself and the world through his friends. From then on it's a journey of romance, belonging, confusion, homosexuality, sex, drugs and self discovery.<br/><br/>From the very first scene you will fall in love with Logan Lerman who is exceptional to the point that you will wonder if it's the same guy who acted in Percy Jackson. Emma Watson as the girl who has been used(or abused) sexually since she was a kid, yet searching for happiness or love may be, and Ezra Miller as the gay guy(literally and otherwise) are fabulous.<br/><br/>The brilliant screenplay along with the wonderful music beautiful cinematography and classy direction transports you to a different world. The wonderful narrative is an added bonus. You are sure to come out inspired and if you are a writer there is no doubt to the fact that you will be inspired to start your new project.<br/><br/>The movie deals with a lot of sensitive issues but the most important among them, though hinted at at several intermittent scenes, is revealed fully towards the end only and that shows the amount of thought put into the screenplay. A few scenes in the middle might give you the feel of a usual high school movie but then Chbosky swiftly shows his class by bringing it back on track.<br/><br/>It's a complete movie.<br/><br/>I am giving a 4/5 for The perks of being a Wallflower.

","The biggest problem with the movie is the main character's integrity.<br/><br/>The socially awkward nerd really isn't that socially awkward. The script writer have put in a few moments where he's clearly socially awkward, then there are a lot of moments where he's socially completely normal, and even a moment where he's the complete opposite of a quiet nerd.<br/><br/>The resolution is also somewhat surprising given his character, and makes he seem even more like a mixture of different characters. Those character types doesn't, in my opinion, realistically fit.<br/><br/>Charlie's friends are supposed to represent the outcasts of the school, but in conjunction with the soundtrack it all becomes a bit too much ""alternative"" and ends up seeming shallow - again, in my opinion.<br/><br/>When that is said, the movie is touching the ever-important subject of growing up and coping with expectations and self-doubt. The theme itself makes it a good movie. And given the context, the character's interaction feels real enough and is at moments quite touching."

Well, the theme of drug used isn't really explored, the kids just do a little drugs and end up fine.<br/><br/>I felt the film had a positive outlook on life and shared some important lessons.

","I just finished this film. It was pretty damn amazing. The chemistry between the characters and cast members is palpable; it's so, so easy to believe that they are friends and that they've built a wonderful relationship among one another.<br/><br/>Charlie's character and story continually, in turn, broke my heart, made me smile, and surprised me. Actually, the stories of the central three characters all surprised and delighted me because the movie wasn't about their problems or their pasts. The movie was really about the characters, their lives and their relationships. They came with experiences and pasts that were powerfully influential, but that wasn't what the movie was about.<br/><br/>A wonderful aspect of the movie was how much it focused on their friendships, without ignoring their families. That focus on their friendships worked well with this movie, unlike most, because it made me remember what it was like, friendships were THE most important part of my life, possibly the only important part. I think that's an experience many teenagers feel in the Western world. Perhaps it worked because the movie integrated their families into the story, like how a teen's family is there and important, but we aren't always aware of them.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film. The directing was fantastic, all of the actors did an amazing job, and I think many lines of dialogue and scenes will stay with me for a long time."

","It's all about the verisimilitude. Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of those rare movies where all aspects of the filmmaking fit perfectly into the overall direction of the movie with no element calling undue attention to itself. Bathed in a hazy glow, without any rapid-MTV style editing, the film feels like it was actually created in the '80s. The characters have their foibles while still remaining relatable- but more than that, they feel authentic. I didn't feel it was totally emblematic of my high school experience as others felt, but the themes and lessons of the film strongly resonate with that time in life.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I found myself deeply invested in the characters not because of any of the standard screen writing tricks to build connection with the characters, but simply because I felt like I knew them like I know my friends."
"TheConnoisseurReviews","8","0","1","26 February 2013"," ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" Review
","""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is a film about living life and not letting fear bind you. There also so many more underlining themes and messages within the film, such as lying, being more involved, loyalty, and so much more. It also deals with the complications of high school and the needing to fit in. It felt a lot of these themes are handled well, but the film tends to gloss over some of it. While not a big problem, it would just allow more depth to the story.<br/><br/>The writing in the film is fairly strong. Like I said it handles a lot of themes, but again the film tends to gloss over some tiny things that could have made it better. For example, early on in the film the character talks about a friend he recently lost, which causes him to become so introverted, but we don't get any real back story. On the other hand the three main characters are fairly well developed and they truly make the film. The directing is good and I like the ambiance that is created. We get a good sense of high school and the life of a teenager. A really great thing the director manages to accomplish is making us feel what the main character is feeling. When he's shy, we're shy, when he's awkward, we feel awkward, and when he's happy, we feel his happiness.<br/><br/>The characters and acting are what makes this movie so good. Logan Lerman as Charlie is the awkward teenager with a troubled past. Logan does a good job of capturing the insecurities the character feels, He has little twitches and subtle body language that speaks volumes about the character. I really like how we see this character gradually changes and opens up. Emma Watson as Sam is the girl with the bad rep that's trying to reinvent herself. She's kind of loud at first, but when we pull away her facade we get a girl that really cares and needs some guidance. Ezra Miller as Patrick is the loud gay friend at least on the surface. As we pull back his carefree attitude we see just how much trouble he has as well. The thing about the characters in this movie is that they all have more depth to them. We learn more about them and fall in love with them.<br/><br/>Overall ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"" is a pretty good film with a positive message. The writing is fairly strong, but I just wish that they would have gone more in depth with certain issues. However, the characters are likable and well performed. I give it a very high 4/5, good story with strong characters, but it just needed to go deeper into its themes."

His shy demeanor only makes him even more charming. Logan Lerman was perfect for this role..

","I went into seeing this film blindly (not even being familiar with the novel) and was surprised in a big way. I honestly rented the DVD strictly because Emma Watson isn't one to let down. I really had no idea what the movie was even about but I gave it a chance anyways. It really came through. It was such an emotional roller coaster and even though I didn't exactly relate to any of the characters the director had a way of making me feel like I could relate to even the characters that I had literally nothing in common with. I enjoyed the film so much that I picked up a copy of the book and I'm not much one to read, ever. I enjoyed it as well. I did however have some concerns with what was cut from the movie especially after reading the book. I understand that it was perhaps geared towards a much broader audience and such touchy issues were not necessarily appropriate for a major Hollywood production, and I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you want the full theatrical experience it is a must that you see the deleted scenes. I would also like to say the performances by Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, Paul Rudd, Dillon McDermont and most especially Ezra Miller were nothing less than superb. All in all I was surprised and amazed at how fantastic this film was and think it is a must see for everyone."
"Flik-Off","10","0","1","19 February 2013"," Authenticity shines bright in this gem
","I thought this was my first review ever, but I remember now that I reviewed Pokemon the First Movie two years ago. It is rare that I want to take Ebert's position and review a film. However, this wonderful gem deserves it: the cast, the crew, the writers, everyone involved deserves this review.<br/><br/>First off, Logan Lerman's character is EXACTLY like I was early on in high school, and probably the way a lot of high schoolers are. As I was watching him awkwardly try to find his place, and struggle to raise his hand even when he had an answer, I was just thinking about my time in high school around 2007. The film is so realistic, it's devastating. For instance, the high school dance scene. Charlie (Logan Lerman) saw everyone else dancing, and he slowly eases his way out to the dance floor and starts moving his body as if he's never done that before. Well, I was JUST like that. In fact, I was so bad, I had this one very nice, beautiful girl to fall back on if I couldn't find a dance partner. She'd always let me dance with her and it helped me learn. I'll never forget her.<br/><br/>Anyways, the authenticity of 'Wallflower' kills me. It doesn't rely on unrealistic plot tactics to be interesting, because it ALREADY is more than interesting. The whole cast does their job well, and Emma Watson, just coming off from Harry Potter, PROVES she can do something different- and she does. With flair.<br/><br/>To wrap up this review, let me also tell you that Logan Lerman once gave me acting advice. He's a nice person and I'd love to start seeing him in more. He deserves an Oscar for this film. Another interesting tid-bit, is that he lost the role of Spider-Man to Andrew Garfield. The two films were made around the same time. Looking at 'Perks' and especially when Charlie picks up those glasses, I couldn't help but think how good he COULD have been as the new Spider-Man as well. However, whats done is done, and Andrew Garfield did more than well to prove he deserved it too, so I'm not complaining.<br/><br/>'The Perks of being a Wallflower' proves to us that if you can relate to the characters in a film enough, then you don't need vampires or werewolves or over-convoluted gun-fire to stand out best of the best, above all the rest."

","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a high school drama/romance/comedic movie directed by Stephen Chbosky who wrote the novel The Perks of Being a Wallflower. He wrote the book and now he made it a movie. That's pretty cool.<br/><br/>Charlie (played fantastically by Logan Lerman) is the awkward, anti-social, might as well say disturbed freshman. While still being somewhat depressed about his friends suicide, Charlie writes letters to his deceased friend about how his life is going and how he wants to ""turn things around this year""(he narrates these letters throughout the movie). So comes along seniors Sam and Patrick, who befriend Charlie and ""let him in"" to their posse and expose him to the real world. <br/><br/>Sam (played by Emma Watson¬Ö. Where's Harry?) is the divine girl of Charlie's dreams. Sam ""drives"" Charlie to become a better person, while Charlie helps Sam academically. Ezra Miller gives a great performance as Sam's stepbrother Patrick, who is openly gay and also essential to assisting Charlie. Sam and Patrick do not only give Charlie a sense of self-admiration, but they try to help him get over the death of his friend. <br/><br/>The story gets pretty deep, showing how befriending someone can change his or her life around in a good way, along with solving internal problems and expressing one's self to the world around them. In this case Charlie's abusive aunt whom died in a car crash is a constant distraction in Charlie's head psychologically (its very gruesome actually). The performances by Lerman, Watson, and Miller are like a rap song by the Sugarhill gang: Fantastic, Funny, and like nothing you have ever heard (seen) before. The Perks of Being a Wallflower, despite the unnecessary, overly disturbing flashbacks about Charlie's aunt, is a good movie that goes beyond a typical high school drama/romance (take that Degrassi)."

","There are films that are just sort of lingering uselessly, with mediocre writing and acting, then there are films that are magnificent and have the potential to change the world. Those films are very rare to find, and commonly are independent films who are like gems in the pile of dung. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is the latter of the two. Its simple complexity is incredibly compelling, and will captivate you from beginning to end. Logan Lerman, who is unfortunately known for roles in films such as Percy Jackson and the Olympians, did a surprisingly superb job. Accompanied by the seasoned acting talents of Emma Watson, Ezra Miller, Johnny Simmons, and Paul Rudd, this film is so much more than could ever have been expected. Each scene is beautifully crafted, and well-intentioned. It is heartfelt, and the emotions are raw and real. The film has a resounding message of acceptance and love to all, and does not attempt to censor itself. It is an amazing film that truly brings us to the realization that ""Right now we are alive, and in this moment, I swear, we are infinite."""

","Usually movies turn good literature bad, but Emma Watson's proving that her magic didn't stop at the Wizarding World and Logan Lerman's true grasp of Charlie's character...that was truly great. Lerman's portrayal of shy and awkward Charlie made awkward younglings like myself be able to relate to him - and that's impressive. <br/><br/>Because let's face it, children and adults, teens and prepubescent younglings, we've all dealt with negative things trying to bring us down to the darkest of places, from which freshman Charlie started off - having dealt with his best friend's suicide, his aunt's death and having this something haunting at the back of his neck which he himself didn't even know what it was...<br/><br/>...And then Sam and Patrick come in a FLASH! and kidnap him away, into this world of friendship, this world of drama, this world of experience...into the teenage world. Having being withdrawn from normal social interactions since his past held him back, Sam and Patrick help expose Charlie to the real world, where while ""you can't change where you came from, you can change where you're going."" While being faced with having to chose over right and wrong (while being exposed to good music and first kisses in between), Charlie learns whether he should be making his life revolve around others' or take a chance and chase what his heart truly beats for, whether he should just remain quiet or let the world know who he was. Through the ""tunnel"" of life, Charlie learns he can be anything, even ""infinite"".<br/><br/>From making great literary references and literally making a reference or name for himself, Charlie proves that your past has no say on your future - YOU do."
"lerochka-572-401309","7","0","1","17 February 2013"," Different from the book
","It was pretty good, but I really wasn't a fan of the main character (especially in the beginning). The movie also toys between adventure and drama and one of those specific molestation discovery movies, so I feel like it's interesting to watch a single time but not a movie you'd be likely to rewatch.<br/><br/>First reaction: The lead doesn't act well. At all. The way he talks to the diary at the beginning of the movie is really not believable. In the book, he is sensitive but optimistic and loving, signing his entries with ""Love Always,"" and always wishing the best for everyone. In the movie, at the beginning he is annoying (eg curt reply to his nice English teacher) and depressed and definitely does not exude well- wishing. As the movie goes on, though, either you get used to the character or he becomes more believable. Especially believable in the end molestation scenes, though granted that may be because I don't know how people would actually act in real molestation discovery and hospital treatment situations like that.<br/><br/>That said, Patrick (Ezra Miller) played great. And Sam (Emma Watson) of course.<br/><br/>Also, from the very start the movie doesn't exactly follow the book. Which is fine if you haven't read the book, but annoying if you actually had read the book beforehand and are not just watching the movie. <br/><br/>For instance, the shop teacher Callahan actually likes Patrick's impersonation of him rather than chastises him for it, the girl in advanced English is Susan rather than a separate girl, Derek hits Charlie's sister under very different circumstances, Charlie's English teacher is an unmarried hippie rather than a married professional, etc. The movie doesn't just cut stuff out, it changes stuff.<br/><br/>Overall, though, the movie is engaging and does have some interesting philosophical aspects to think about."

","Stephen Chbosky, the author of the book, wrote the script and directed the movie version of ""The Perks of Being A Wallflower"". This book has made itself a classic in the young adult audience. As a previous reader of this novel, I felt the movie was wonderful - but it makes sense since Chbosky had a hand in every part of it.<br/><br/>Charlie (Logan Lerman), a 15-year old, enters into High School with a lot on his plate - such as the recent suicide of his best friend, a history of mental illness, and just all around social anxiety. But when he makes friends with two Seniors, Sam (Emma Watson) and Patrick (Ezra Miller), his world begins to turn around. But also, emotions are brought forth with his love for Sam and his struggle with his past. This is a movie of new experiences, internal battles, family and friends, and love through the eyes of a young teenager."

","The first time I watched this film, I was fortunate enough to get a private viewing of it with a Q&A afterwards with Stephen Chbosky himself. Before this, I had not read the book or heard a lot about it. After watching it, I was hooked and read the book in a day. The movie is very faithful to the book, both of which are amazing. The casting is great and each actor represents what you imagine the characters being like perfectly. In fact, there are some scenes I personally think the movie did a better job of portraying than the book did. Chbosky said that the casting of the film was incredibly hard, but if you view this film, you can tell that it turned out for the best. I am not the type of person to take picking a favorite movie or book very lightly, so you can believe me when I say that the book is my favorite book and the movie is one of my favorite movies."
"will-stanford","7","0","1","10 February 2013"," An evocative teen movie with more than immediately meets the eye
","I sat down to watch this movie, having not read the book, not expecting a great deal from it, thinking it would not be much more than the great number of pseudo-indie teen drama movies designed more to exploit the hormone fuelled emotions of its target audience than actually provoke any real thought. Toward the beginning of the film I feared I had been right in this evaluation, with references to typical emotional teen clich√©s such as the Smiths on vinyl, mix-tapes and the generalisation that all of high school was going to be hell for anyone who didn't immediately conform. My initial reaction was that this was a post John Hughes film that did not benefit the slightest from being made 20 years later, however I'm pleased to say that this reaction did not last long. The film developed into incredibly nuanced and mature themes, with characters who for the main part seemed real and were always engaging and ultimately led me to no longer think of it as glorified rip off as a films such as The Breakfast Club, but instead a worthy 21st century successor.<br/><br/>The story was carried by a very strong performance by Logan Lerman, who acted with real subtlety rather than twilightesque dead pan expression; he reminded me of a younger, more awkward version of Joseph Gordan-Levitt in 500 days of Summer. His character's letters to an imaginary friend, while initially seemed worryingly vaguely emotional, became not only a useful way of progressing the narrative through time, but also were revealing of Lerman's character and were foreboding as to the secrets that he kept. Lerman played the character with a quiet yet intriguing air that allowed you to believe that seniors would not only find him interesting enough to befriend, but also to fall for.<br/><br/>The other two main performances came from Erza Miller and Emma Watson, who were the step-sibling duo that rescued the freshman Lerman from his world of loneliness and depression. These two performances were respectively the highlight and one of the low points of the movie, with Miller providing a glorious performance as a flamboyant rocky horror show enthusiast and Watson providing a strained performance as a much less interesting character of the emotionally deep beautiful and alter- chick. What really made the film for me was the complexity of the majority of the characters; you believed Miller's flamboyance was just a shield for darker issues and experienced this darker side towards the end of the film, however Watson's character was free from such nuances. Despite also finding out darker secrets from her past, it was difficult to sympathise with a evidently gorgeous girl who had all the confidence of her brother, without any of the social stigma, living in a stable family and on her way to a good college. With all of this combined, I found it the most wrenching moment of the entire film when Watson tells Lerman on the eve of her departure to college she 'can't feel happy'. While Watson obviously embodies enough to charm to make any man-boy immediately fall for her, her laboured facial expressions in dramatic interactions made her character even more painfully 2 dimensional.<br/><br/>The narrative itself was very good, with twists and developments which meant that what could have been a very predictable story line kept you constantly engaged. My only criticism would be that the most dramatic event of the story - Lerman's breakdown - while exceptionally built up to, takes places and is swiftly dealt with in little more than 5 minutes, before the film is drawn swiftly to its conclusion. The script is actually very strong, with a few cheesy lines, mainly given to Watson, but these are more than over shadowed by the generally brilliant standard of the dialogue, along with the resonance of Lerman's monologues which are present throughout. The themes, as mentioned before, are very mature and are, for me, what make the film. The ideas of depression, sexuality, drugs and ultimately the shocking and unforeseen theme of child abuse keep the film captivating and allow license for scenes of emotion which make the film as evocative as it is.<br/><br/>My final bone that I have to pick I will admit may appear an anal one, but I find it so frustrating I cannot restrain myself. Early on in the three's friendship they are on a drive and stumble perchance upon a song which perfectly epitomises the moment of freedom and youthful ecstasy they are experiencing, a song that later becomes a metaphor when they cannot find it again until the end, when they have each come to their respective realisations. They take another drive, play the song again and it acts as a crescendo up to the tagline of the film (which teenage girls will now inevitably be posting in painfully serious facebook statuses) of 'we are infinite'. But what is this evasive song that try as they might they cannot grasp until they have each found themselves? It is none other than Heroes by David Bowie. This only irritates me so much because its apparent elusiveness is put on a pedestal as a metaphor for the film; so if it is so important, why would you choose such a famous song that would be well known in the early 90s? I was born in 1994 and am well aware of the song, and if I weren't would still instantly recognise Bowie's voice. I realise this is not hugely relevant, but the impracticality of it ruined this motif which was so significant in the ending.<br/><br/>All in all however, this was a thoroughly enjoyable film with some great characters, truly passionate scenes and a storyline rich and complex enough to genuinely make you think. I would challenge anyone to watch this strikingly powerful film and not be swayed by in the slightest, it is the best in its kind since the golden age of the 80s."
"alicante22","10","0","1","30 January 2013"," A surprise favourite movie of the year
","I had heard reasonably good things about this film. I had skim read some reviews, I had seen the score on here (8.2/10 a the time of viewing), I had come across it as I was looking for another book to read after finishing the Silver Linings Playbook. So, it was not an unknown to me, but it was unexpected.<br/><br/>It was a batch of movies that I had acquired with a view to watching a few whilst away on an extended holiday with some friends. It was by no means the first choice to watch, and in reality it was only because my friends girlfriend was watching with us that night that we chose this seemingly (from the title at least) girl friendly movie rather than watching Skyfall. And this is where the surprise was. A film I had only average to good expectations of on putting it on, turned into perhaps the greatest teenage angst, coming of age, funny, poignant love story I have ever come across. I know thats not exactly a HUGE genre I just described, but if you we to just call it a ""movie"" it would still be up there with my favourite of all time. As it stands, its the best film I've seen in the last 12 months for sure.<br/><br/>We feel for Charlie, his difficult first few days at school, his loneliness, his desperation for human contact that isn't his immediate family. And we feel his joy and happiness as he finds his niche in life and his new friends. But its not all just feelings and emotions, there are some amazingly real laugh out loud moments. If you have memories of your first girlfriend and how that actually came about, then you will love this too. Me and my friend couldn't stop laughing at one point but to tell you what it was would be a spoiler and that would ruin the fun now wouldn't it. But you will know it when it happens and I would imagine that memories will come flooding back about that time in your own life!<br/><br/>All in all, a fantastic film that is required viewing for all. Not one character is perfect, they are all real with faults and blemishes to their personalities and back story (even if they do often talk like middle aged people when they are supposed to be teenagers on occasions).<br/><br/>Do not hesitate. Watch now."

","I may be biased as a Smiths fan, but this film definitely lived up to the John Hughes films of the 80s. A love story, if you will, to the era before we really lost it as a society. Finding the Smiths on a mixtape is a lost adolescent milestone for the marginalized. I am not an Emma Watson fan, but she nails the alt girl of the 90s. I love that Ann Veal (haha) was in it. I love that they talk about the old record store in Pittsburg, EIDE's. I took many many many roadtrips from Canton, OH there as a teenager (and then a Primanti Bros visit). Cinamatically, it reminds me of great films like ""Rules of Engagement' or ""American Beauty"". Definitely glad I finally gave it a watch."

","I only watched this movie because I had nothing better to do on a Thursday night, and it had two actors I enjoy in it, Logan Lerman and Emma Watson. I expected this movie to be a bust. Man, was I wrong! This movie is nothing short of pure genius! I enjoyed seeing how a shy guy in high school, like me, coped and got through school every day. I thought it was pretty cool to also see how he responded to stuff like drugs and the sensual Rocky Horror Show. <br/><br/>The thing I liked most about this movie is that it showed me that, even someone dealing with issues like Charlie's can catch a break.

A beautiful story told in a very beautiful movie. This movie can definitely complete you by all means.<br/><br/>The most interesting part of the movie is that you will not get bored at any instance.

","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of my favorite books. Hearing about the movie i didn't expect much but another fail like they have with most movies about books. But i decided to give it a try and let me tell you it did not disappoint! This movie was simply to amazing all the characters fit perfectly and the whole story line was some what close to the book. This movie is a must watch.<br/><br/>Perks is about a 15 year old Charlie, who is struggling to fit in to high school. He's still trying to figure out where it is he belongs. With his mental illness and him constantly having vision about his past with aunt Helen it makes it a little hard. He then meets Patrick and Sam who both help him through his first year of high school as he does to them. Patrick refers to Charlie as a 'Wallflower' which means someone who is an expert at seeing things and understanding them.<br/><br/>This movie had some scenes where it got pretty emotional with me. I felt like it wasn't just some high school movie about teens, alcohol and drug but it gave a sentimental feel to it. Seeing the struggles that the three of them overpass with the help from one another they grow."
"richcarter1962","10","0","1","19 January 2013"," NOT just another teen angst movie
","If you had never seen a movie poster for this movie or read a review you would assume that a movie with Dylan McDermott, Kate Walsh, and Paul Rudd you would assume that these were the stars of said movie, and of course you would be completely wrong. The 3 young actors/actresses in this movie were exceptional. It was really nice to see Emma Watson in a role without a wizard involved. I have to be honest I had never heard of Ezra Miller nor Logan Lerman. They were both outstanding in this movie.<br/><br/>Now let me tell you why this movie is not a rehash of John Hughes movies of the 80's. Don't get me wrong I loved John Hughes movies and I have seen them all, The Breakfast Club being the pinnacle of those for me. First the screenplay for this movie was very well written and directed. They never seem to get in a hurry to get to the end, in fact, through several singular lines interspersed into various scenes you know that there is something that you aren't getting. By the last 30 minutes of the movie I was really wondering if we were going to learn all the secrets of these kids. Well you do but I will let you experience that for yourself.<br/><br/>My favorite line in the whole movie, and I think one that sort of sums up what this movie is really about was from Emma Watson when she tells Charlie ""Welcome to the island of misfit toys (from Rudolph the Red- Nosed Reindeer"". This is a movie about kids that don't fit in, but it is so much more than that. One other thing that made this movie stand out for me was that they never went for the cheap pulling on the heart strings moments, certainly there are some but the movie doesn't linger on those, as with most things in life they happen, you deal with it, then you move on.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to almost anyone who has ever been a teenager, or ever felt like he/she didn't fit in. I will guarantee that if you don't see yourself in this movie you will see someone you knew. This movie is very much worth the 100 minutes of your time that it asks for."

If you are with those friends who look beyond your weaknesses and stick beside you no matter what not only do they help you establish but be friends for life.<br/><br/>The dilemmas and emotional flow that a teenager goes through has been well represented here.The dialogues are so well written that it stays with you even when the movie gets over.For Eg: We accept the Love we think we Deserve and many more.<br/><br/>Overall in my opinion ,A great starcast, A great Movie.......<br/><br/>Kudos Stephen Chobowsky........."
"cnycitylady","6","0","2","15 January 2013"," Just as Disappointing as the Novel
","This is a coming of age story for young adults, but amidst its ""clever"" and ""surprisingly real"" characters and storyline lies a dull, unexciting and redundant tale of a boy who just doesn't fit into life. The title is just about the only thing clever and original in this sad story. The problems that this boy faces, the insecurities that stand before him are what stand before everyone who has ever been sixteen. <br/><br/>Now I've read the book, and I didn't particularly enjoy it, but if you want to know this lame tale then read the book. The shallow characters are deftly portrayed in the movie, but you lose the essence of their character when they alter small yet certain things in their story lines. Emma Watson, for example, was an inspired choice to play Sam. But the Sam she gives you on screen isn't the same Sam in the book. The Sam in the book is wild and confusing, she leads you on and dumps you flat. She cares about Charlie but does not know how to go about it, tormenting the poor boy during his first year in High School, while also mentoring him and teaching him how to be himself. Whereas the Sam in the movie is uncertain and loving. She knows who she wants to be but not how to get there and she secretly loves and wants Charlie, never telling him as much though. She acted it beautifully but I felt that she wasn't encompassing her character. (to be fair that was probably the script)<br/><br/>The storyline was greatly reduced, cutting out what would have made the movie more original. In the book you get more of Charlie's sister and Brother. Heck in the book you even get more Patrick, who is by far the most lovable character. But more importantly you get more Mr. Anderson, a character who played a major role in the development of Charlie's character. In the film he's there and you get the feeling that he is important but you never really see why. You just see Paul Rudd playing a teacher in the background. The movie made the most important thing the uncertain love story between Sam and Charlie which only helps to escalate the feeling that you don't know what kind of ""Coming of age"" story you are watching. You are supposed to learn all of these life lessons while viewing a movie like this, but instead you are just hoping they get together (which in the book, they do not, so the movie lied to you. They gave you a Hollywood ending.)<br/><br/>The good points about the movie are mainly just who they casted for the roles. Not one person felt miscast, and every single person's performance was stunning. They really worked with what they were given, even if it wasn't as true to the book as it should have been. I give stand out props to Mae Whitman for her take on Mary Elizabeth. (You can really see the hurt in her face when she realizes that Charlie will never love her like he loves Sam in the scene when he gives Sam his books.) You wish you see more of her, and she quickly takes the place of your favorite character.<br/><br/>The movie is also somewhat less annoying than the book was (although not by much.) In the movie you are not stuck inside the mind of a whining fifteen year old Charlie. Instead you feel you are hanging out with him and his friends, not knowing (or caring) what weird and useless thoughts are running through his head. I expected to like the movie more than the novel because of the casting and because I figured you would get the book in its entirety in two, to two and a half hours instead of taking the week to read it. But you don't. You get a watered down hour and a half version of an already suffering tale. I guess it could have been worse, but it definitely could have been better. I give it 5 points for story and 1 bonus point for casting. 6/10 total, if you haven't read the book, you might even give it a 7."

","There was a time when virtually all college shows or movies were based on himbos/bimbos vs. nerds, how to get laid / lose virginity, how to deal with boredom when/if you come from a rich family etc. The teen performers were cute and ugly, respectively, at it was stressed by ""blond"" or ""wise"" dialogs. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is totally different: warmhearted and realistic plot, switch of sad and glad, coping with introversion within company, influence of childhood to teen and adult years. The cast is also nice and even, no ordinary cute and empty faces, characters are finished in a gifted manner. Logan Lerman as the leading character Charlie is brilliant; he will likely follow River Phoenix' and Anton Yeltchin's footsteps. Emma Watson as Sam and Ezra Miller as Patrick are great as well.<br/><br/>Thus, this movie is highly recommended to all giving odds to inner depth and feelings rather than exterior popularity. It should be further promoted and screened also in Europe."

Logan Lerman is perfect in the lead role. I struggled a bit with the older women all being attracted to the lead but can't argue with it too much.<br/><br/>The rest of it really suffers from some overly powerful casting though, especially in the first half as you have to try and get over the history of the players.<br/><br/>Emma Watson is always going to be too hot, and too cool, to be a misfit and as great as she is in this she readily outshines her character. But this is nothing compared to Ezra Miller's presence, I just couldn't help waiting for the bow and arrow to come out and for him to slaughter all of his class mates.<br/><br/>For my money this should have been on the Oscar list and in a decade, once Miller and Watson are less associated with their own past I think it will really have a place amongst the hearts of fans of the Breakfast Club / Cant Buy Me Love / Ferris Bueller...."

","Coming of age stories are the order of the day. Most film-makers seem to be inclined towards taking up this genre over the others. But unfortunately, not all these films register an impact. They may fare well at the ticket counters due to the star quotient,but hardly do they linger in our memories after their running time.<br/><br/>Perks is also a coming of age film but with the difference that it breaks clich√©s and banalities. Charlie is a freshman in high school and he finds himself rather secluded from the rest of the world until he meets Sam and Patrick, his seniors. The film, apart from showing the strength of friendship between the three leads, also broaches some sensitive teenage issues. Charlie, who has just gone through an emotional disturbance in the death of his best friend, feels free- spirited and ecstatic in the company of his two friends. Each of the three leads hit low points in their lives and help each other out in bouncing back. Logan Lerman, as Charlie, is perfect in every sense. He nails the emotional scenes and also brings the cute charm that his role entails. Emma Watson (Sam), venturing out of the amazing Potter franchise for the first time, brims with confidence. Her performance was flawless. Ezra Miller (Patrick) is a very underrated actor. He juggles between the comical and the heavy scenes like a pro. The supporting cast do their bits very well too.<br/><br/>On the whole, Perks is an amazing film. By the end of it, you are sure going to feel infinite!"

I'm one of those people who is crazy about books and if the book doesn't match the movie it bothers me. HOWEVER, I've come to appreciate this movie for what it is as a completely separate work. There were some important parts in the book that didn't make it to the movie and some that were glossed over that I feel shouldn't have been put on the back burner. With that being said, I know how difficult it can be to transfer everything that happens in a book to the screen without it being three hours long. So I will say this...<br/><br/>The actors did a phenomenal job-all of them. I didn't once cringe at certain moments that could have been easily over the top. They handled it well. And Logan Lerman who plays Charlie...wow. It was like the character walked right out of the book and on to the screen. I was very impressed. Emma Watson and Ezra Miller as Sam and Patrick were great in their roles as well. What I liked the most was how this had an indie feel to it that Hollywood rarely does.

Charlie is a likable character that audiences can relate to. The shyness, awkwardness and insecurities that he experiences is something many can relate to. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower takes its time revealing his story ‚Äì and that's a bit of a problem. The first half doesn't seem to have anything interesting or special to show or say. It's all very familiar. A kid gets bullied and wishes he was part of the cool group. We've seen it many times.

Ezra Miller (We Need To Talk About Kevin) is likable and charming and Emma Watson does a good job as Charlie's love interest. A couple more roles like this for her and audiences will begin to see her as someone other than Hermione. Logan Lermen should have big things on the horizon after his impressive performance here. He is very good as Charlie and manages to say a lot without saying much.<br/><br/>The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is a decent movie that knows its target audience. Crowds have embraced this indie flick and its easy to see why. Whilst it isn't anything amazing, it's a funny, sad and sweet little drama that will resonate with teenagers and those that remember that period all too well."

","The Perks of Being A Wallflower is a coming-of-age story, revolved around the transaction into becoming a freshmen. With past demons and events daunting him, two seniors initiate him into their group, and through numerous events he engages with them, he learns more about himself about themselves , as well as love and friendship.<br/><br/>The film captures the precise essence of growing up and being a teenager, through many flashbacks, as well as a somewhat 'dark and real' camera style. Stephen Chbosky adapts his own novel excellently, and was successful in transcribing the same sensibilities and emotion elements that the novel execute.<br/><br/>All performance are wonderful, however performance by Logan Lerman (Charlie) and Ezra Miller (Patrick) really stand out at a comedic and emotional level, of which allow them to both be very deserving of awards recognition, as well as the film itself."

","spoilers... so beware.<br/><br/>I went to this movie knowing absolutely nothing about it. the exposition of the film was done all with voice over which was a bit progressive for the language of the film, but as the film evolved it made it's place. the unfolding of the character was done eloquently through out the present part of the film. the flashbacks were a tad bit overdone and in places seemed to have burst out of nowhere with no explanation. the character ""Charlie"" played by Logan Lerman was performed well (reminds of a young Christian bale) and had its moments. if it wasn't for him the flashbacks would seem a bit off. Ezra Miller and Emma Watson do to have weight on frame but it subsequently enhances Logan's character. Logan Lerman is in almost every shot of the film, holding on his back the entire movie. <br/><br/>the letter's ""Charlie"" writes to his dead friend, let us the viewer be there when Charlie think's he's all alone. it is those moments where we are the only one knowing what is going on in Charlie's head and it build's up a lot of tension through out the movie with various characters.<br/><br/>i guess i would have to say that the editing of the movie is of the greater aspect's that stood out and made a presence. sequences put together which built up great emotional substance and timing done through sound and frame making it almost impossible to drift with thought's to another world. <br/><br/>for me it was one of those movie's which made me stay in the theater after everyone left, looking at the cast running on the screen and appreciate a good piece of artwork."

","So another ""High School in America makes you suicidal movie?"",not exactly.I am a massive Harry Potter fans,so in truth I went to this movie as I really wanted to see Emma Watson in her post-potter debut.I didn't know much about the film as the trailer doesn't exactly give the story away and I hadn't read the book,so I didn't know what to expect.I entered the cinema with my hopes of Emma Watson delivering a ""Oscar Worthy"" performance and the movie being enjoyable very high,However,this proved not to be the case. <br/><br/>The movie is about an introvert,Charlie (Logan Lerman) who has a history with mental illness and finds it difficult to relate people,the movie begins with ""Dear friend,I haven't really spoken to anyone outside of my family this summer,but tomorrow is my first day and I really wanna turn things around this year"",I like this,as in truth a lot of people in their teens always feel a bit edgy before they return to high school and each of us wish to maintain and make friendships.As the movie progresses we are introduced to other main characters,Sam (Emma Watson) and Patrick (Erza Miller) who befriend Charlie after a few days of high school.For me,the casting of characters in this movie was excellent,from the leading roles of Charlie,Patrick and Sam right down to the selection of Dylan McDermott as Charlie's dad.Emma Watson delivers an excellent performance as the abused but very strong character of Sam,I think the emotion she provides is breathtaking and her character,I'm sure,is very relatable to a lot of people but especially girls, she plays a kind and loving girl who had a difficult past but is dealing with it and moving on,her character is an inspiration,and Watson delivers beautifully, she also does a decent job with the American accent of Sam,I was really impressed by her.Erza Miller is also excellent as the gay and vocal Patrick,his character suffers a lot in the movie also,but remains positive and upbeat and really highlights the high school aspect of this film,with his cheeky attitude towards teachers and his love for his friends,however,the performance that I liked the most was that of Logan Lerman,I think he was superb and for me,his portrayal of Charlie is one of the best male performances in many years,I didn't know much about Logan previous to this movie,but its safe to say I'm now a fan.He is excellent in this role and is very relatable, even though his character is slightly more introverted than most.I'm sure he has a very prosperous career a head of him.<br/><br/>There is no doubt about it that this movie had great potential and if directed correctly with its cast and story, it could have been a massive hit worldwide,however,I feel the wrong decisions were taken and I think it was a bad idea to get Stephen Chbosky,the author of the book to direct it.I feel with the incredible cast,the amazing story and messages it had to offer it could have been so much better and thats why I was so disappointed with it.Every teenager in the world could relate to what this movie is about and its content- Bullying in schools,different groups,issues with drugs,suicide,sexuality and family life.The movie had so many issues it was hard to follow,and the director put them across in a confusing and rushed way,for example,the story of Brad (Johnny Simmons) the rich,pretty sports jock who everyone wants to be,in secret he is in a gay relationship with Patrick but can't make it public due to his father being totally anti-gay!this is a touching story in its self and shows us that even the ""cool kids"" as we perceive them have problems and can be unhappy with their life. When Brad is away from the other idiotic muscular jocks,he is a genuine nice guy,I loved that about this film that it explored different aspects of high school and didn't just go with the stereotypical view that all sporty jocks are bullies,it showed they too have problems,but with this relationship,Sam's history of abuse,Charlie's mental illness and various reason for it and Charlie's sexual relationship with Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman) it all becomes a bit too much to handle and it feels as though the director felt, lets take everything from the book and cram it into an 102 minute film.Don't get me wrong I love the fact that this film deals with real issues but it becomes crammed and difficult to engage with,which in my opinion is vital,as this movie needs to be engaging and inclusive,it needs to make you feel like ""yeah, i know exactly how that character feels"" and it needs to be relatable,which at the end of the film I felt it wasn't,even though it had massive potential to be,I really feel the director let the cast down. <br/><br/>The movie is however full of inspirational and clever quotes, such as ""In this moment,I swear,we are infinite"",""Welcome to the Island of Misfit Toys"" and ""We accept the love we think we deserve"".I also love the choice of music for the movie,it has a really teenage ""lets get out there,experience things and have fun"" feel to it, and I love that. I'll watch this movie again,as I think I will need to,and probably read the book to get answers to all the unanswered questions left by the directing of Chbosky. <br/><br/>After leaving the cinema instead of feeling gripped,truly engaged and the feeling that high school is full of fun and crazy times, I felt confused,like I was trying to piece things together,as Chbosky leaves a lot unanswered in this film,and yes,that works sometimes,but this movie shouldn't have been like inception,it should have been a film that you felt engaged,in love,included and related too. As I said before,many people can relate to the issues raises in this movie and thats why in my opinion it could have been a massive hit,but poor directing will always hinder this films progress."
