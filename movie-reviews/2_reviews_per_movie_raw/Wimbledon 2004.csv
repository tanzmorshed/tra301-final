","Peter Colt (Paul Bettany) was once ranked 11th in the tennis world back in the 90's. Now with the prime of his life behind him, ranked number 119, Peter decides to throw in the towel and play his last ever Wimbledon tournament before gracefully bowing out of the gentleman's sport for good and going to work at a tennis club tending to clucky old ladies. All he wants is to go out in style, keep his dignity and try not to cock up too badly. That is, until he meets American tennis sweet-heart Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst). Lizzie is the tennis world's new golden girl, and looks to have Wimbledon in the bag... that is until Peter proves a costly distraction. They instantly take a liking to one another, and their relationship moves pretty quickly into the bedroom. Her side-tracked mind becomes apparent to her ambitious father (Sam Neill) who can feel his daughter's priorities taking a turn. Meanwhile, Lizzie is improving Peter's game by acting as his 'lucky charm'. Now Peter has to ask himself.... can the long-shot win the tournament?<br/><br/>'Working Title Films' are the same lot who brought us ""four weddings & a funeral"" and ""bridget jones's diary"" and while they stick to pretty much the same formula with Wimledon, it's a formula that works and produces a satisfying romantic comedy. Bumbling, charming Brit meets American hot-shot. Boy gets girl. Boy loses Girl.... and all the rest.... While this is nothing new essentially, it is still a very great movie.<br/><br/>Paul Bettany is a gorgeous leading man, pulling out all the charms and making himself impossible not to like. Be sure to keep an eye out for Bettany, who is more used to taking the back-seat supporting role in films (A knights tale, a beautiful mind etc...) but after Wimbledon, he has proven himself a more than capable and lovable leading-man.<br/><br/>Kirsten delivers a some-what aggressive performance as Lizzie. Sure she's a head-strong American, but couldn't Dunst have made her a likable head-strong American? It's not a bad performance, just a little 'off' at times, not quite hitting the mark she should have aimed for in this romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Jon Favreau plays Peter's manager, a typically sleazy businessman... but he does it so well, and with such delivery that he's also impossible not to like. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau plays Peter's German friend. It's a small role, but my God, this guy is a hunk and a half. Sam Neill is pretty forgettable, playing a fairly wooden one-dimensional character. The other noticeable performance comes from unknown James McAvoy who plays Peter's annoying brother, Carl. Great comedic timing and genuinely likable.<br/><br/>Wimbledon is filled with quick wit, dry English humor, fantastic (although computer-generated) tennis matches and a stand-out leading man. What's not to like? It's a great film for a good laugh and is a definite pleaser. Game-set-match!"

","There aren't many Tennis movies so when one does come out, Tennis fans  are quick to see it and quick to judge it. As well as being a movie  about Britain's famous Wimbledon Tennis Tournament it is a romantic  comedy. I think a lot of people who see the movie and are disappointed  with the so called lack of Tennis scenes are forgetting the movie is  also about the romance between the two tennis players (Paul Bettany and  Kirsten Dunst.) I loved the movie, I thought it was quirky, romantic  and fun. There are heaps of real-life tennis couples and this movie is  a great example of how two people from different places and upbringings  can change each other's lives. If you like romantic comedyies or sports  movies than I definitely recommend this movie."
"Rich B","8","37","47","7 October 2005"," Surprisingly funny and enjoyable. Well filmed and superb performance from Bettany.
","Straight off I have to make something clear, I wasn't really looking forward to watching this. A romantic comedy movie from some of the Working Title team based on Wimbledon didn't exactly set my pulse racing. I did not want another comedy from this stable, for me Love Actually had stretched the idea enough for me.<br/><br/>So after seeing it I'm very surprised I enjoyed it so much. Despite the rom-com badge and the almost unbelievable premise of Wimbledon it's actually very entertaining and the focus is very much on the com side of that genre label.<br/><br/>Movie The movie has a lot of style right from the very cool opening credits. The filming of the tennis scenes are well done and keep the flow of the movie going. Imagine showing all the crucial Tennis matches for two players climbing through the stages in Wimbledon without the story going dull and the cinematography going into a standard and repetitive style? Well it doesn't, it's almost matrix-esue in it's style in fact. For sports and romantic films, it certainly breaks the mould.<br/><br/>Putting aside the style and the fast paced music, what about the story? Well it's actually got a few twists which are quite unexpected and although it does tread typical ground, the turns are enough to keep you guessing as to the outcome and keep you hooked.<br/><br/>Neat the finals this really does come out and I was very surprised to find myself on the edge of my seat for some of the points, and indeed some of the matches.<br/><br/>It's very funny too, and Paul Bettany shows a particular talent for timing, comedy and looks on camera. It's Bettany that really carries this movie backed by strong performances by Kirsten Dunst, Sam Neill and some smaller British filled roles for Bettany's characters family.<br/><br/>Bettany is totally believable from playing the tennis matches through to the romantic moments. His acting talent shows through amazingly well and is aided by a fantastically written script with some truly funny moments. In particular the self talking moments when we travel inside the head of the tennis player during a match. They seem to capture perfectly the moments of self doubt we all seem to have, quite insightful.<br/><br/>Sound Presented: English - Dolby Digital (5.1) Sporting an excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack at times you can hear the ground around you applauding, or the sound of a ball going past. When a moment of dialogue appears everything is dialled down and there's no attempt at over use.<br/><br/>Picture Presented: Widescreen 2.35:1 Anamorphic Something that struck me was the potential to have the screen be overpowered by the greens of Wimbledon and with the traditional weather there was a thought that the movie would look too dark and dull. Neither is true.<br/><br/>The picture is sharp and vibrant through the movie, clear and bright and very colour rich, it retains this look through even the more complex of special effects match shots.<br/><br/>Extras Presented: Audio commentary with Richard Loncraine and Paul Bettany, 'Welcome To The Club' featurette, 'Ball Control' featurette, 'Coach A Rising Star' featurette, 'Wimbledon: A Look Inside' featurette, Trailers The featurettes are about how the tennis was filmed, how the actors were trained, looks inside Wimbledon itself, and some further looks into the movie. They are quite short and interesting, but they aren't the main draw here, they just serve as distractions from the superb audio commentary from Bettany and the director Richard Loncraine.<br/><br/>Insightful, funny and quite revealing, we hear much about the behind the scenes, shots that never were and how the actors got on together. This was one of the better commentaries I've heard and well worth listening to. Both Bettany and Loncraine are funny and self depreciating, typical British humour.<br/><br/>Overall It's a funny and very enjoyable movie, actually quite a surprise and in a way actually funnier than Love Actually. It also seems to capture the inner dialogues that people face daily very well, as well as some of the other dialogue being nailed rather well. Bettany shines in this film and it shows the huge talent that he has."
"bbagnall","10","52","69","4 January 2005"," Cool! The Ultimate Tennis Movie
","I've been waiting a long time for an actual tennis movie, and finally here it is and it does not disappoint. Normally I don't feel compelled to comment on the opening credits, but the sequence is so brilliant I have to. As you hear a ball being whacked back and forth, the credits start appearing to the far left of the screen, then the far right, back and forth. Suddenly you realize everyone in the theater is craning their heads back and forth. The film makers have just gotten everyone acting like a tennis crowd. You know right away the film was made by someone who actually watches tennis.<br/><br/>The film has a fair amount of amusing comedy, such as how no one except for Peter Colt can seem to remember that Peter Colt was once ranked 11th. He's moderately wealthy and he's never been hungry, but at 31 he is starting to become a little too old for tennis so he decides it's time to hang up the racket after Wimbledon.<br/><br/>The film does a great job of showing the various types of tennis games pro's go through. There's the experienced player versus the rookie. There's the friend versus friend match. There's the game where everyone is cheering for the other guy. And finally, there's the game where you play your worst enemy.<br/><br/>By the end of the film, you will understand why tennis winners usually fall down on the grass and start weeping after they win the title. I have one question though - why the @*%& did they use a rap song at the end of this film?"
"Placemat","6","45","60","1 January 2005"," Serviceable Romantic Comedy
","""Wimbledon"" is another one of those agreeable, English-flavored romantic comedies which in years past would have starred a stammering Hugh Grant. This time the principals are professional tennis players and the setting is Wimbledon. Paul Bettany makes for a good romantic lead in the Grant mold without the latter's sometimes annoying cloying and also is convincing as a tennis player at the tail end of his career. But Kirsten Dunst, the love interest, while giving a very likable performance, does not look her part. She also is not helped by the screenplay, which does not present her as a particularly compelling match. In fact, the character seems more like one that usually would be set up as the rival, missing the elements of the ""intended"". Further causing the film to come across less than compelling: Every character, save one, is nice, making it nearly conflict-free. Not a waste of time, but nothing memorable, ""Wimbledon"" is a tension-free, pick-me-up: The movie equivalent of a lightly-flavored carbonated water: effervescent, but lacking any distinct taste."
"staceym","10","72","100","1 October 2004"," Sparkling, Witty Sports Rom/Com
","I've been waiting to see this movie since I first heard about the shoot. I love Wimbledon the place, but was also suitably impressed by Wimbledon the movie.<br/><br/>It's been compared to my other favourite sports rom/com 'The Cutting Edge' and I definitely agree. The basic story has been done - washed up pro finds romance with upcoming new star and gets his second wind - but that doesn't mean that it can't be done again, and done well.<br/><br/>Paul Bettany was excellent and I was much happier to see him than Hugh Grant, and Kirsten Dunst played the competitive brat well.<br/><br/>The script had some genuinely funny moments, with Jon Favreau stealing some of the best lines.<br/><br/>We all know how the movie will turn out at the end, but this does nothing to detract from it on the whole. Brain power is not required to watch this film, but that makes it all the more enjoyable.<br/><br/>I eagerly await the DVD release and give Wimbledon 9/10."
"Fong_Chun_Kin","8","14","18","9 February 2005"," Match begins at love all
","Erm... no offence to Tim Henman and his fans, but here's one hell of a sporting fantasy for you: a professional British tennis player actually winning Wimbledon. Wow. Well, as we all tennis fans know it, such a scenario can only happen in the realm of movie magic.<br/><br/>Paul Bettany stars as Peter Colt, a fading tennis player who is resigned to retiring from the professional circuit with the fact that he'll have nothing to show for it. The only time I've seen Bettany was in A Beautiful Mind, which elicited a rather haunting performance from him. And so it was to my delight that he managed to fit into this role with such ease and charm, as if he had been doing romantic comedies all his life. He displays the typical British dry wit and slightly dark humour effortlessly, almost to a fault (excuse the pun). Not the best performance from Kirsten Dunst, but she does give a pretty convincing portrayal as the brash American world number one female player.<br/><br/>Speaking of brashness, it's a pleasant surprise to see the notoriously foul-mouthed John McEnroe in a cameo appearance, as a commentator giving his two-cent's worth during the tennis matches. His presence adds a nice touch, giving a certain ""real tennis"" feel to the fictitious tennis players in the film.<br/><br/>Despite not having real professional tennis players in the acting roles, the action sequences in the matches do look very convincing, thanks to the amazing cinematography. You certainly realise how far cinematic technology has progressed over the years when you see Bettany and Dunst belt out those groundstrokes and smashes almost as beautifully as the real-life, seasoned pros would.<br/><br/>All in all, an entertaining date flick that holds even more appeal for tennis fans.<br/><br/>Who should watch: Those who don't mind suspending their belief about British tennis to simply enjoy a lovable romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Who shouldn't watch: Tim Henman, all English tennis players and English tennis fans. They may actually believe they CAN really win a grand slam.<br/><br/>Rating: 7.5"
"seaview1","Null","47","74","13 September 2004"," Wimbledon Serves Love
","The sport of tennis serves (no pun intended) as a good background in Strangers on a Train and Pat and Mike. As the focal point of a full feature, it has never produced a solid film. Instead, there would be the occasional lightweight drama like Players (Dean Paul Martin and Ali McGraw) which fizzled back in 1980. Wimbledon, while a marked improvement over the former, does nothing to change the status quo. <br/><br/>Primarily a star vehicle for Kirsten Dunst (Spiderman, Bring It On) and rising star Paul Bettany (Master and Commander, A Beautiful Mind), the storyline is the stereotypic budding romance between Dunst who is the up and coming tennis star, and Bettany, the aging midline star who is trying for one last shot at being champion at Wimbledon. Their romance blossoms much to the consternation of Dunst's father (Sam Neill) who fears distractions for his daughter. There are a few subplots involving Bettany's quarreling parents, his playing partner, and his opportunistic agent (Jon Favreau). It's not too hard to figure who might win/lose or where the romance will lead. <br/><br/>Stars Dunst and Bettany are likable and have a nice chemistry but not much script to work with. There are a few nice lines and situations piecemealed throughout, but the plot is paper thin and the dialogue is unimaginative. This was from the people who brought us Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral? Ah, look at the credits more closely and Richard Curtis is missing; not even a Hugh Grant cameo is in sight. Sam Neill, Bernard Hill, and Eleanor Bron (Remember her from the original Bedazzled?) are wasted in minor roles. The tennis scenes are somewhat fun with the stars putting their all in the physical matches, but the tennis balls are almost too perfect as the special effects become too obvious.<br/><br/>Bettany is destined for more substantial roles and Dunst won't be hurt by this lightweight comedy/drama. One could only imagine what they could have done with a more lively script and complex characters. Sure it's nice to look at and the stars are a cute couple, but this was a squandered opportunity."
"telemationltd","7","4","4","29 June 2008"," Subtly redefining the mould of the British 'chick-flick'
","Overall I felt this was quite a good film that subtly redefined the mould of the British 'chick-flick' romantic comedy/drama.<br/><br/>It almost lost me in the first few scenes when Robert Lindsay was introduced as the tennis club manager with stereotypical skinny moustache to let you know he is a bit of a sleaze, but work through that and the underlying sub plot of this being Peter Colt's last chance to not be one of the barely remembered, did not quite make it tennis club pro's works quite well.<br/><br/>The Lizzie Bradbury character of the female lead also veered away from the stereotype for that role, although cute and very sexy her character is not particularly nice and it took me a while to get attached to her. However the reality is that at that level of competition in truth how many people are 'Strawberries and Cream nice' very few, so top marks to the script writers for a realistic heroin.<br/><br/>It was good to see a film of this ilk without Hugh Grant as the lead, no disrespect to Mr. Grant but you can only recycle him as the romantic Brit lead so many times. Paul Bettany worked well with a script that was clearly written for Hugh to the point that in the early shower scene if you shut your eyes (which I would highly recommend any red blooded male not to do) you would think it was him playing Peter Colt.<br/><br/>I firmly expected a twist at the end which did not come, to the extent that the ending was quite a surprise, enough said without invoking spoilers.<br/><br/>Also top marks to the old and new British character actors in the lesser parts who always bring an ironic smile to a local in this brand of movie."
"Steph1985","7","4","4","5 October 2004"," Not great, but definitely not bad!
","*spoilers* alert<br/><br/>I felt that the film was a step up from your typical airy fairy, not funny, Julia, Sandra or Meg romantic comedy. However, having said that, it still wasn't the best movie i've ever seen. There were the funny moments, and the token dickhead character (Bettany's brother) kept the light laughs flowing. Of course, love prevails at the end. Dunst's overprotective father, Neil, eventually warms to the man he's so sternly told to stay away from his daughter. Funny though, how after she's been knocked out of the competition that he finally pushes her to go for him (oh, and he professes his love for her on national television). Bettany's washed out tennis star character uses love as his inspiration against young pro game heavy weights to beat all odds and win the grand slam. I really enjoyed Bettany's portrayal of the washed out Peter Colt. However, i usually love Dunst's performances, but there was something that she brought to the character that didn't sit right. A certain hardness i suppose, that was unnecessary and an overly forced American accent. I particularly liked the visual effects on Colt when he was playing. I thought they were quite effective and creative, getting us inside his thoughts and emotions. All in all, i thought the film really wasn't bad, and i think i would quite happily watch it again.<br/><br/>3.5 stars out of 5."
"NativeTexan","9","46","74","22 December 2004"," Paul Bettany makes this a winning movie.
","Paul Bettany is perfect in his role, and delivers his self-effacing and ironical lines better than any Englishman since Michael Caine. He isn't classically handsome, yet you can't take your eyes off him. Whatever the camera loves, he's got. Kirstin Dunst continues to get roles she's not right for, yet carry them off by sheer self-confidence and forthrightness. She's not pretty, her figure is utterly ordinary, and she certainly isn't built like an athlete. She doesn't even look like she works out. And there's no subtlety in her performance -- maybe that's the directors fault, but her one-dimensional portrayal has all the mystery of drywall. Whichever it is, Mr. Bettany's charm and ease help soften her one-note approach to her role. Sam Neill, a brilliant and completely lovable actor, is totally wasted in this role."
"butchfilms","7","6","7","7 February 2009"," Entertaining Romantic Movie
","This movie was better of what I expected, it was interesting and entertaining.<br/><br/>I had seen Paul Bettany in "" Gangster No. 1 (2000)"" and I was surprised that he could do a romantic comedy so well too, he had a good chemistry with the beautiful Kirsten Dunst who is always good in this kind of movies. The plot is interesting and I liked a lot the tennis games scenes. What I didn't like so much were some silly moments involving Peter Colt's brother and manager. <br/><br/>Peter Colt is playing his last tournament at Wimbledon and there he will meet Lizzie a young tennis player with a great future with whom he will begin a romance behind her father's back ..........<br/><br/>I recommend watching it if you like romantic comedy movies."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","6","16","25","11 July 2006"," From the people that brought you Notting Hill...
","...comes another romantic comedy, almost exactly like it! Having picked up on the blatant similarities between Paul Bettany and Hugh Grant as foppish, witty Englishmen in Wimbledon, it came as no surprise to me to learn that Hugh Grant had originally been considered for the lead role of Peter Colt. If you have ever seen a film starring Hugh Grant as the lead, you know now what Wimbledon is essentially like and how it is acted because Paul Bettany's tennis-playing character Peter is exactly like a Hugh Grant character--confused, witty and extremely English. While Bettany does not quite have the the charming part down to perfection yet, he is much more attractive than the king of romantic comedies. He is also strangely compatible with Kirsten Dunst and that makes it a nice romance story. <br/><br/>While centering the plot around tennis (Wimbledon, in fact) is fairly uncommon, this is only a disguise for a genuinely ordinary and well-milked premise. Man is out of touch and out of luck and meets a wild, free girl who will help him awake from his sedated mental state and make him feel alive again. Conflicts inevitably rise, because the man and girl are two players in Wimbledon and so there is more at stake than just a love affair; they are both competing to win. In the end, this film is really quite cute and often at least a little funny but believe me when I say it's nothing you haven't seen before. I mostly enjoyed it because of Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, to be honest."

","31 October 2004. This fun, sporting romance of a movie would been better received by the larger movie-going audience if the sport's emphasis had been on America - but nevertheless, for any anti-Brit - that just too bad. I enjoyed the movie and even as a former high school tennis player, I even found the tennis scenes believable and exciting - this movie had a good balance between its romance and sport (something most sport-romance films often fail to be able to do). While the romance and action were typical, the basic flavor of movies nowadays have advanced a bit, including Wimbledon. It's not fun and games. There are even losses. But getting in the tennis player's mind, namely Paul Bettany, was a nice touch along with the decent tennis action. A must see for female tennis players who like a bit of romance along with anyone who likes tennis and behind the scenes comedy and entertainment.<br/><br/>An excellent date movie, with a sport-bent. Seven out of Ten Stars."

Both Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst are brilliant and adorable, and have great chemistry together. They are so sweet, and makes a perfect couple! The tennis sequences are exciting, and I particularly like the shots where they simulate the view from the tennis ball, being shot to the ground then back up.<br/><br/>So, there is finally a date movie that both boys and girls will enjoy.

"ray-280","10","4","5","11 May 2006"," On Any Given Fortnight
","Wimbledon, for all its focus on one of the world's most storied competitions, is more of a coming-of-age tale than a pure sports movie. <br/><br/>Male protagonist Peter Colt (Paul Bettany, in the performance of his career) feels like something is missing from his life, but he's not sure what it is. As he would say ""No, correct that, I know exactly what's missing."" He's 31 years old, now ranked #119 in the world, and while many remember his name from the tennis circuit, no one seems to remember that just a few short years ago he was #11 (their guesses were a few spots shy of his true peak). Colt, from a well-off family, has just accepted a job as a tennis director at a country club, a nice retirement from the sport which will begin after his completes Wimbledon, his final tournament.<br/><br/>Adding to Peter's problems are his parents, who have grown estranged to the point where Dad sets up shop in a treehouse, and his brother, who cheerfully wagers against him in the first round as if he were counting on the outcome to pay his mortgage. No one is directly evil to Peter, but the evil is that no one dislikes him because he is about as nonthreatening a presence on and off the court as a man can be. He is more pitied than respected, at least by the seeded players who view him as filler, good practice for the final rounds, but merely a local ""wildcard"" entrant who will make a graceful exit into retirement early on. He does manage to pick up a groupie in Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst), the brash, childish American star player who is expected to make Wimbledon her first Grand Slam. Lizzie's dad (Sam Neill) is not thrilled with the distraction, so even having fun becomes as much a chore for Peter as winning the match. It is not that he does not belong at Wimbledon, but where he is thought to belong, that is the cruelty here. Though more accomplished than almost everyone who will ever play the game, Peter Colt is barely known to the tennis world, and invisible to the rest of the world.<br/><br/>Colt approaches his first two matches at Wimbledon as if they were executioner's marches. His first match is against a prodigy who is expected to go far in his first grand slam, but as often happens, the journeyman takes him to school with solid play. The new job will now have to wait, as the French Open winner awaits in the second round, along with the obligatory bet-against from his brother and disbelief from the media and commentators (John McEnroe in a lively and very technically accurate performance, with Chris Evert as his sidekick). As was made obvious early in the film, it begins to become obvious to Colt that the greatness his mother told him that he had was for real, but also that he had never wanted to reach down deep enough to bring it out. Finally living in the present, Colt leaves nothing on the table and disposes of this challenge as well, leaving him to play his practice partner in the third round.<br/><br/>The ""old"" Peter Colt would have had a nice match against his equally nice training partner, but his desire to win (egged on by Bradbury) has gathered too much steam, and the partner is left sliced and diced, remarking after the match that Colt has a killer instinct never before seen. Meanwhile, Bradbury is winning her matches, but becoming increasingly distracted by what was supposed to be a boytoy becoming an important man in her life, and overshadowing her to the public, causing her father to go ballistic at the sight of him. He was right, of course, but sometimes other things in life are more important than tennis (for Bradbury), but sometimes, as for Colt, tennis has to take priority. Bradbury's day will come; it's now or never for Peter.<br/><br/>We all could look back on our lives and know we could have accomplished more than we did, but we can also look back and be happy with what we've done. Professional tennis would not exist without the Peter Colts of the world, and this movie is a glaring tribute to the journeyman players who slave in profitable anonymity and who rule most corners of the tennis world beyond the tour. In Peter Colt's case, he gets one last chance to separate himself from the masses and leave a mark on history, and while he had no delusions about climbing back to the top, anything can happen in one match, especially when the match is on your home court, a short drive from your house, against a player who may be great, but who couldn't possibly have the life-and-death intensity that Colt brought to the finals, with a little plot-driven grudge-match background thrown in.<br/><br/>As the final chapter unfolds, the movie takes a few swipes at sports-movie ""miracles"" and other cheesy plot devices, keeping the action as true-to-life as possible. Cinderella may win, or she may be valiant in defeat, but in this movie, the result is a logical one, and not the product of dumb luck or revenge-inducing superhuman strength (an incident where a ballboy is struck flips the bird at that idea).<br/><br/>All in all, a truly great film and an excellent example of what can be achieved in a true drama that doesn't rely on gratuitous sexuality or special effects to pacify a dumbed-down audience, but which rather treats the viewer as intelligent and able to appreciate a good story, without making it so complex that only a tennis pro could follow it."

","In today's cinema fare it seems many people are interested only in movies that have a lot of CGI effects, plenty of sex, or lots of explosions and violence. In an age where this country has seen the likes of 9/11 and where death appears everywhere from the TV to the newspaper to magazines, this movie arises out of the ashes to bring some hope, happiness, and smiles to one's face while watching it.<br/><br/>Sure, this movie is a formula movie that came from Hollywood, much of it being predictable, but seeing that sequels and re-makes are dominating Hollywood these days, this movie provided what I was seeking, a good heart-felt movie.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunce and Paul Bettany had some excellent cinematic moments during this movie and I thought some of the camera angles were really fascinating to watch as it followed the ball on the court. While I'm not a huge tennis fan, I do pick up the racquet every now and then but having said that, I didn't find it necessary to love the game to watch and enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>If you want to smile, feel good about life, and possibly yourself, check out this movie.

"JamesHitchcock","6","5","7","11 July 2007"," Patriotic Wish-Fulfilment Fantasy
","Tennis has not generally been a popular sport with film-makers. The hero of Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train"" may be a top tennis player, but for most of that film he has other matters than sport on his mind, like clearing himself of a murder charge. ""Wimbledon"" is the first film I can recall in which the game has taken centre stage.<br/><br/>It has been compared to a Richard Curtis film, and certainly has some similarities to his ""Notting Hill"". Both films are named after districts of London, and Hugh Grant, the star of ""Notting Hill"", was also originally slated for the lead in ""Wimbledon"". Both also both feature a shy, nervous, self-deprecating upper-middle-class Englishman who falls in love with a glamorous American superstar. The twist here, of course, is that the superstar in question, Lizzie Bradbury, is not a Hollywood actress but rather a leading professional tennis player. The man who falls for her is another tennis player, Peter Colt. Colt is a journeyman professional, just outside the game's elite. He was once ranked number eleven in the world, but he is now in the twilight of his career and has slipped to 119. He is playing in his last Wimbledon before retirement from the game, and wants to go out in style.<br/><br/>Apart from ""Notting Hill"", there may also be a real-life precedent for the romance of Lizzie and Peter. A generation ago Chris Evert, a glamorous American superstar of the game, married John Lloyd, a journeyman English professional ranked just outside the game's elite. (If a cinematic biopic of John and Chrissie were ever to be made, Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany might not be bad choices for the leading roles). Of course, there are a few differences. Whereas Evert's calm, imperturbable demeanour won her the nickname of ""the Ice Maiden"", Lizzie is a tempestuous hothead on the lines of John McEnroe. She even gets to repeat one of his lines- ""Chalk flew up!"". (If Evert and McEnroe really were the inspiration for the character of Lizzie, neither of them seem to have minded- both appear in the film as commentators). Peter is rather older than Lloyd was at the time of his marriage. And, most importantly, he manages to do something which neither Lloyd nor any other Englishman has done since Fred Perry in 1936. He wins Wimbledon.<br/><br/>That last sentence might give a clue as to the true nature of the film. The British have a curious relationship with the game of tennis. Or, to be more accurate, they have a curious relationship with the Wimbledon championships. For a fortnight in late June and early July every year, the BBC devote several hours a day to showing the matches, and the newspapers are full of articles lamenting the fact that Britain has not produced a winner of the men's singles since Perry or of the women's singles since Virginia Wade in 1977. This failure is pronounced a National Disgrace; talented players such as Tim Henman or Greg Rusedski are subjected to unfair criticism or even ridicule for failing to win Wimbledon. For the remaining fifty weeks of the year the fever abates and the great majority of the British public take little interest in the sport; the other major tennis championships are not normally televised to any extent except on specialist satellite channels. The last British player to win a Grand Slam singles title was not in fact Wade but Sue Barker, but because her triumph was achieved at Roland-Garros rather than Wimbledon it does not really count in British eyes.<br/><br/>The film, therefore, is less a comedy or a romantic comedy than a patriotic wish-fulfilment fantasy. The player whom Colt defeats in the final, Jake Hammond, is an obnoxious American who fulfils admirably the British stereotype of the vulgar, loud-mouthed Yankee cut down to size by a quiet but determined Englishman. Hammond's standing in the game is emphasised by the fact that, on his way to the final, he defeats real-life champions such as Lleyton Hewitt and Roger Federer; Colt's victims, by comparison, are all fictional characters. (The film also refers by name to other real-life tennis players such as Serena Williams and Andy Roddick, and there are thinly-disguised portraits of Henman and Amelie Mauresmo).<br/><br/>Although the film is billed as a romantic comedy, there is not that much humour; I suspect that if the script had been written by Richard Curtis it would have been a good deal wittier than it is. Most of the attempts at raising laughs centre upon Peter's difficult younger brother Carl, or upon old puns like ""love means nothing in tennis"", or the occasional piece of bawdiness. Even the romance often has to take second place to the tennis. It is a standard convention of rom-coms that there has to be some obstacle to the love of the young couple, and an attempt is made to provide one here in the shape of Lizzie's over-protective father, but he proves to be an insufficiently serious obstacle for any real dramatic tension to develop. This is generally a watchable film, and Bettany makes a likable hero, but there is nothing really deep or memorable about it. 6/10"

","Wimbledon (2004): Dir: Richard Loncraine / Cast: Paul Bettany, Kirsten Dunst, Sam Neill, Jon Favreau, Austin Nichols: Striking film about victory and achievement both in sport and in relationships. It stars Paul Bettany as a tennis player who once ranked 11th in the world but now reduced to 119. Now he intends to retire whether he wins or loses. A chance meeting with a female tennis player played by Kirsten Dunst sparks a romance that her father and manager forbids. Excellent setup establishes a love for tennis as well as certain tension. It becomes repetitious after each game and romantic encounter. The inclusion of Bettany's parents is also not necessary but director Richard Loncraine translates the game footage well with great camera work. Bettany is flawless as he makes upset victory after upset victory all the while never making it quite certain for viewers. Dunst completes the equation as a female player trying to maintain focused. Sam Neill as her father is too wooden, and Jon Favreau as the manager is equally cardboard. They both play more out of convenience than purpose. Austin Nichols plays the arrogant jerk American player up against Bettany, and even that is a weak character. While the narrative is somewhat conventional it does deliver a fascinating study of tennis that is surprisingly filled with tension while showing us what is truly important in life. Score: 8 / 10"

I am glad that we have a film which portrays all those events.<br/><br/>I remember when I was there in 1994 and tried to get in, but I was not able, could not find a ticket, and I did not feel like lining up for one, pardon queuing.

"Dan1863Sickles","7","2","2","26 March 2014"," Adorable Romantic Comedy With A Very English Feel!
","This is such an adorable movie that it's hard to understand at first why it wasn't a huge hit. An underdog English tennis star (Paul Bettany) falls for a strong-willed rising woman's champ (Kirsten Dunst.) The funny thing is, I think cultural differences between England and America really stifled this movie's appeal. The hero is such a nice guy, but I think his willingness to be sort of pushed around and second best comes across as weakness to American audiences. Perhaps not so much in England where it's more acceptable to know one's place and settle for whatever society deems appropriate. And then there's the moment where he considers taking work as a country club tennis pro, and a little group of very attractive society ladies (of mature years) make it very clear they're looking forward to having him as a stud for hire. And the movie sort of bungles the moment, since what comes across is not how attractive he is but how he's too timid to say no to anyone! <br/><br/>At the same time, it's interesting that Kirsten Dunst plays a very strong-willed and determined young woman and that in itself seems to make a lot of people uncomfortable, perhaps more in England than America. And it's hard to tell whether it's modern women or Americans of both sexes who are being stereotyped as selfish and crude.<br/><br/>Then again, there are some minor touches that are slightly creepy. Sam Neill, dark and sinister and aging very badly, is quite off-putting as the American girl's manipulative ""stage father."" You keep getting the impression he doesn't know this is a comedy! Maybe they told him it was OMEN V: ANTICHRIST AT WIMBLEDON. Or maybe he's just royally ticked off that his face has dropped five inches in the last twenty years, giving him the look of a mountainside after a mud slide. Whatever the cause, Sam Neill is glowering and snarling in every . . . single . . . scene . . . and coming across more like late period Bela Lugosi than anyone you'd meet at Wimbledon . . . or anywhere else outside the crypt."
"manusanchez90","7","2","2","1 May 2013"," Nice as a romantic comedy as well as a sports movie!
","""Wimbledon"" would be the typical romantic comedy if it were not about tennis. This makes it both a romantic comedy and a sports movie at the same time. It would not be original at all in case tennis were not the main issue in the plot. In general, it is a very nice comedy with very good length and pace and fine actors and acting. Another strong point in the movie is its nice photography of London and a nearby English town, specially the first, which is a city I like a lot. Paul Bettany is the main actor and plays the role of a relatively veteran tennis player who is not at his best. In Wimbledon, he meets a younger player portrayed by Kirsten Durnst. Sam Neill is in the movie her father and there are a couple more well-known actors doing decent jobs in their respective roles. I am not a particular fan of any of these actors, but they are all good. Paul Bettany shows he is versatile: comedies, action, dramas, mystery; diverse roles, etc. I think the tennis scenes are pretty well.-made. Probable, tennis fans will enjoy more than I did or will find more defects, but surely, everyone who does not demand too much and enjoy this kind of comedies will like it. I insist on that it is not so innovator and the end is predictable, like in most romantic comedies, but enjoyable indeed. 7."

","Wimbledon is a sweet, unpretentious, high flying, romantic comedy. The humor is intellectual, with interesting British dialogs without slangs or complications, and full of funny expressions.<br/><br/>Paul Bettany has a number of subtle facial/body expression that are just the right spice for the tone of the movie. Although I always find it difficult to accept Kristen Dunst has playing a star, she's more suited as an athletic star and perfect as Paul Bettany's opposite, bringing spunk like she can easily do.<br/><br/>The setting of the movie is quite interesting, and the shots beautiful. More over, the story has a full figure, and is peppered with interesting details. You can feel the English fever for Wimbledon, and the soundtrack is quite appropriate.<br/><br/>Only a few things mar this beauty. First, most court commentators sound like their reading their script, especially McEnroe and Evert. Second, the tennis itself, while well edited, shows flaws from time to time.<br/><br/>That being said, it is my favorite romantic comedy because it has everything and does it all right just like I want it.<br/><br/>A must see."

In terms of tennis playing, there were some damn cool tennis sequences. some of the best i would say. but that doesn't really make up for the somewhat empty story-line. all in all, this film ain't too bad. the people that watch it oughta be tennis fans or Kirsten fans (!). other than that, everyone else is just going to be watching another shallow romance flick."

Heaven knows I did.<br/><br/>Paul Bettany was worth it, just to look at him, but the humour was good too. He had a couple of really funny lines and he carried them well, providing probably one of the better performances in the film.<br/><br/>Don't go in expecting anything other than a cute story, with a touch of humour, and you'll have a good time."

","Wimbledon is a cute story where cute people fall in love, make great love, than have an inevitable and predictable fight in the middle of it all.<br/><br/>Even though this movie follows the formula's of most romantic comedies, it is saved by above-average chemistry with its leads, (Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany) and the tennis aspect it is focused around. The romance between Dunst and Bettany works because they share the commonality of their sport, which helps to ignite their relationship.<br/><br/>If you're not a lover of cute sappy moments like barefooted walks in the park or 10 mile jogs resulting in a big cuddle-fest, than at least see this movie for its realistic tennis scenes. These scenes (which were really shot at Wimbledon) are extremely well done, especially those of Bettany's matches, where you can hear his comical inner thoughts before he serves the ball. The scenes reflect the pressure and intimidation that every tennis player must feel once he steps out onto the court. <br/><br/>While Wimbledon is certainly not the best romantic comedy, I left the theater smiling rather than gagging. And for me, that's a good thing."

Not even Paul Bettany's sexy overbite could save it. Its half-hearted effort at combining sports with a love story annoyed me to no end. Hardly a decent shot, let alone sequence, of any actual tennis play and dialog about the game amounted to such trite wisdom as ""play through the pain.""

","Wimbledon, in short, is poorly written. There is very little character development and consequently it is difficult to muster any great interest in or sympathy for the protagonists of the piece.

The actors do what they can with the screenplay but in truth it smacks of children's TV with a soundtrack. It does contain a brilliant gem in the injured ballboy. I challenge anyone not laugh at this hapless episode in which a tiny kid is poleaxed by the fastest serve ever and yet is still in attendance as lucky mascot in the next match - black eye and all.<br/><br/>This is not so much a straight to DVD film as straight in the bin.

"Buddy-51","6","3","4","25 July 2005"," harmless piece of romantic fluff
","""Wimbledon"" is a charming love-conquers-all romantic comedy set in the highly competitive world of professional tennis.<br/><br/>Peter Colt is an aging player who has slipped to 119 in the world rankings; it is for this reason that he plans to hang up his racket after what he believes will be his swan song appearance at Wimbledon. What he isn't counting on is that he will meet and fall in love with a beautiful and sexy up-and-coming player named Lizzie Bradbury, a turn of events which seems to be having a very positive effect on his game. Soon, he's racking up surprise, come-from-behind wins in the tournament, becoming a major focus of attention for appreciative fans all over Great Britain. The problem is that, as Peter's game improves as a result of the romance, Lizzie's seems to be getting worse, a fact which threatens to put a serious strain on the young couple's burgeoning relationship.<br/><br/>Although the story itself is rather innocuous and silly, Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst do achieve a genuine rapport on screen. It's also nice to have a protagonist in a romantic comedy who is not exactly in his physical prime and who is facing some of the rigors of advancing age (he's all of 30, practically his dotage when it comes to professional tennis!). Moreover, the setting is novel and there is just enough of that brittle British humor in the screenplay to keep the film from feeling puerile and canned. It's true that Lizzie seems to be an entirely different person off the court than she is on, but that is just one of those inconsistencies we tend to expect from a movie in which credibility isn't necessarily a prime factor in determining our overall enjoyment of it. And director Richard Loncraine manages to generate some genuine suspense in the final showdown between Peter and the odds-on favorite he isn't expected to beat.<br/><br/>""Wimbledon"" is pure Cinderella romantic fantasy crossed with a David and Goliath, underdog-takes-on-the-reigning-champ sports story. If either of those genres appeals to you - or, even better, if both do - you should have a fun time at ""Wimbledon."""
"ivexxl","8","3","4","16 May 2005"," Nice comedy and romance
","I went to movie theater without great expectations for this film. It exceeded my expectations. It seems that winning formula for good(great)romantic comedy is the one from Notting Hill: British environment, British leading and support actors and an American (girl called Anna;just joking) lead actress. This combinations always has a charm which is most important for the atmosphere of the movie. Paul Bettany as a leading actor drives the movie. His charm is irresistible; it's very cogent that any American girl would fall for him. Kirsten Dunst is on the other hand charming too; she poses some sweetness which even when she is speaking bad words allow you to think she doesn't mean it. Of course, this is probably merit of character she is playing in film, so what I meant to say is that she knows her acting. Other supporting actors are helping this drama rolling on. Bernard Hill (king Theoden;LOR)and Eleanor Bron as Paul's(Peter's) mother and father are in moments very funny; as is his brother (James McAvoy who looks like a younger brother of Russel Crowe) brings funny stuff too. Visually movie is very HiTech. Because of this, it was possible to make a lot of exciting tennis points with a little actors effort. Seems that they were playing in front of green screen most of their tennis scenes;cause some of the plays are worthy of best tennis plays in history of tennis. Even so you don't see this cause CG effects are so good but you only think if Paul or Kirsten are so well playing. Assuredly CG doesn't compromises story telling; it's in service of it. At the end I didn't tell anything about Sam Neill performance. I will agree with that he, ""a brilliant and completely lovable actor, is totally wasted in this role"". Despite that the film doesn't lose anything on this fact. So to conclude take your sweet heart or some friends a go and enjoy in movie. As some American newspapers would say - thumbs up!"
"gelman@attglobal.net","7","4","6","16 October 2004"," Best Tennis Film Ever?
","As several critics have noted, this film is especially good at conveying the drama of a Grand Slam tennis tournament. Paul Bethany is quite credible as a journeyman British player in his final tennis tournament who suddenly begins beating much higher ranking players. Among the great strengths of the movie is the fact that it takes place on the grounds of the All English Tennis Club and that the action is announced by real TV personalities (and former players): John McEnroe, Chris Evert and Mary Carillo. Since I did not know whether Bethany would eventually win or lose the tournament, I thought the director did an excellent job of maintaining tension throughout the final match. It is true that the love affair between Bethany and the rising American star, played by Kirsten Dunst, is altogether predictable. Nevertheless, the chemistry between them is convincing. Sam Neill does his usual good job as Dunst's interfering father-manager, and the actors portraying Bethany's parents absolutely shine. Bethany's agent -- who's also Dunst's agent as well as the agent of Bethany's opponent in the finals -- may be a stock character but he's also fairly amusing. Saying it's the best tennis film ever may not seem like much but I've never seen a baseball, football or basketball movie that I thought was any good at all."

Throughout the movie, we never learn exactly what these two see in each other. We're supposed to blindly believe that they met and fell madly in love for no reason, with Lizzie suddenly becoming a muse for an over-the-hill tennis player.

I think the film lacks overall emotion, conflict, and storyline direction. This is not saying that the director went wrong or the actors/actresses could not act. I feel that the majority of the problem lay within the script itself. I could not place myself in the characters' shoes, and the conflicts that did occur throughout seemed to be played down (the parents, father figure, American tennis player who went to the finals).

"tedg","Null","6","13","17 February 2005"," Ping Pong
","When you watch so-called date movies, its often more fun to pay attention to how the writer solves the challenge of the genre. After all, movie love is pretty thin stuff when you boil it down. <br/><br/>So about a decade ago, date movie scripts started borrowing from other genres. In particular the writers borrowed the trick of focusing on the audience instead of the couple in question. The reason is that you can only go so far in making the couple appealing and attractive. So if you want to make the audience closer to caring, well you just relocate the audience.<br/><br/>Therefore, we have a slew of date movies set in public arenas so that the audience can have a clear surrogate on screen. Usually this is done by setting the movie in movieland. This way we can have a movie audience watching a movie/TeeVee audience watching the couple. When they cheer, we cheer.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most closely engineered of these was ""Notting Hill."" In that case a popular actress plays a popular actress. She has a constant on-screen audience not unlike the audience in the theater who were drawn to the film because of Ms Roberts.<br/><br/>These projects must have a climax where the love (after some screwup) is proclaimed to the on screen audience. They clap and cheer. We clap and cheer. We've had these with Meg, Julia, Sandra, Catherine and so on, each in turn.<br/><br/>Okay. Here we have the latest refinement. They are not about to play with the general shape: two people fall in love in instant movie fashion; they are pulled apart by some events; he announces his love in a very public manner to an on-screen audience thereby making it ""real."" The boundary between movie love and real love is crossed and we leave the theater feeling happy.<br/><br/>The innovation here is the crossing with a sports film using an internal narrative. You can just hear the machinery dropping into place as the screenwriter thought of the formula. Or perhaps he just went to one of the several consultants (like myself) who come up with these schemes.<br/><br/>The internal narrative is clever indeed. Usually in a sports movie we (and our screen surrogates) watch the performer, only inferring what is going on in his (usually his) mind. The less we know explicitly the better because our imagination is usually stronger than what they can display. Think of ""Bull Durham.""<br/><br/>But here, we are sometimes in the male's mind (literally hearing his thoughts), sometimes in the normal audience's and sometimes in the on-screen audience's (including the hackneyed announcers-in-the-booth). Shifting back and forth (mirrored by the back and forth of the ball) and adding the idea that he himself is a watcher and wonderer is pretty clever.<br/><br/>But the whole thing falls apart at the production level. There's some stuff about a dysfunctional family (or two) that falls flat. Dunst is no longer pert and charming. The direction is clumsy.<br/><br/>Too bad.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

I'm still not sure whether the characters were played by real actors or by construction-paper cutouts.<br/><br/>As a tennis player who almost broke into the USTA top 100 in the state of Georgia, but aged out of my division, I might have at least enjoyed the tennis scenes and the player's comeback attempt. But it was not to be. The tennis was thoroughly uninspiring. Peter's character didn't even appear to have rehearsed his perfunctory lunges for the ball, not to mention his drop shot."

","This is a sweet little date movie that's cute, harmless and fun. I for one am a huge Kirsten Dunst fan, not only because I'm an 18 year old guy but because i respect her as an artist and believe that she has done some truly excellent work. I really enjoyed this film and would recommend it for two people to go see together if they want to get to know each other. Now, for the most part, i enjoy films that tend to stretch to the more artsy side or a good compelling drama. i like films that in my mind could be Oscar contenders and make me think about my situations in life and something i can connect to. I was somewhat distraught because i wanted to see Garden State for the second time but my girlfriend wanted to see this. like i said i feel kirsten dunst is a brilliant artist and i love all the films that she has done but i was a little leary. But 15 min into it i loved it. It's sweet, quirky and just a nice movie that in the end makes you feel all warm and fuzzy."
"jdesando","Null","3","5","16 September 2004"," Tennis 'love' with no points when the film is finally judged
","When the opening titles are more inventive than the film, disappointment is palpable: Director Richard Loncraine ('Richard III') can excel in the competitive titles niche, but he can't sustain the creativity for the rest of 'Wimbledon' itself. Wait, that sounds like a loser in a tennis match. And so it goes.<br/><br/>The love affair between Wimbledon wanabees Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst 'Spider Man 2') and Peter Colt (Paul Bettany, 'Master and Commander') is as lame as some of the competitors who fatefully twist ankles and wrists giving berths to lucky rivals. That the cute meeting and subsequent passion of the protagonists should deeply affect their performances is the ludicrous subtext of a film that otherwise tries hard to give a sense of what being a tennis combatant means. When Lizzie says that 'a little fooling around can be good for your game,' we know this is a stretch for Dunst's sometimes-proper roles and a setup for failure on the court the next morning. No surprises.<br/><br/>The interior monologue of the player as he goes for the ball, the locker room and press conferences, the complicated friendships and rivalries are interesting and insightful. Cinematographer Darius Honda provides unusual insider visuals, and while the digital images of balls in flight are both contrived and intriguing, there is art in slowing down for reflection on a game that spins when the ball is served. <br/><br/>The presence of Chris Evert and John McEnroe for commentary adds another touch of reality during the matches. Yet, it is love on which this film spins. As William Allingham said, 'Scarcely a tear to shed/Hardly a word to say/The end of a Summer's day/Sweet love is dead.' For the romance in 'Wimbledon,' it is tennis 'love' with no points when the film is finally judged."

","I've seen this movie when I woke up this morning before going to work and I was charmed by it. It is a nice feel-good romantic comedy, perhaps pretty obvious in its storyline, but with good performance (even Kirsten Dunst that I normally dislike was quite charming) and excellent tennis scenes enhanced by catchy special effects. Of course it is not as good as Nothing Hill because it lacks these unforgettable moments of pure humor and even if the characters are charming, they are not as colorful as the one in Nothing Hill, but if you want to boost your temper on a depressing rainy day, this film is highly recommended! At least it gave me the right support that I needed before leaving my cosy flat to face this hard day of labor."

She has much to teach fading English star Peter Colt (Paul Bettany) on and off the tennis court.

","I went to see this movie with low expectations, and was pleasantly surprised by it.<br/><br/>If you're not a tennis fan, it may be a little confusing sometimes, because the movies tries to compress all the sport technicalities in very little time. Thus, so many reviews criticizing the format of the Wimbledon tournament, or whether a Brit can go all the way and be successful at Wimbledon. If you're looking for precise tennis, go watch the Tennis Channel, this is a movie.<br/><br/>Now, because it is a movie, I don't think that Wimbledon is the movie's goal. It is just the setting. I believe that the movie's theme is the human spirit, its tribulations and what it is able to accomplish.<br/><br/>We can all be identified in Peter Colt's self-doubts and fears. We can sympathize with his ""failures"", and how he is enriched by other souls' perspectives on his life: his parents, his best friend, his brother, the brits in general, and of course, Lizzie Bradbury's.<br/><br/>I find the performances superb, a LOT better that I expected. Actors seems very believable as pro tennis players. Bettany actually moves like a pro, and Dunst is very convincing too. I loved how the movie gets into Peter Colt's mind during playtime, how they incorporated real life information with the movie's fiction, and how it adapted the ""matrix-like"" slow motion, making the match play exciting.<br/><br/>If you are into romantic comedies, then this one is for you too.<br/><br/>Go watch it with an open mind."

A horribly brief scene where you see just the sillouette of Kirsten Dunst in her shower, too foggy to see any detail, and a thankfully brief glimpse of Paul Bettany's bare butt are the only destinguishable instances of nudity, and for the prudes out there, there's a lot of implied sexual innuendo that may offend your sheltered child's delicate ears, nothing they won't hear at public school though! Other than the mild innuendos, the language is quite mild too. Dundt's character seems way too sexual at first, every man's dream... LOL but this is explained a little ways into the story."

A brilliant performance of Paul Bettany, who's star is rising in movieworld and of which you can see that the British school in movie actors is more mature than the Hollywood school. Kirsten Dunst gives an average but also defendable performance in the movie, in which she actually smile a lot and, however less real than Paul is comparison with our vision of Wimbledon, stands. A more real vision of the tennisworld would take a women tennisstar of 17 years old, what wasn't a movie like the movie we have now. So well done. All over a brilliant product in the line of British quality humor."

For its genre though, it was a very enjoyable movie and even a step up since the romance was often, in a way, the B storyline. A fairly unique premise and excellent work from Paul Bettany as usual. Bernard Hill, James McAvoy, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau and Jon Favreau gave memorable performances also, but Kirsten Dunst left a little something wanting.<br/><br/>The camera work and narration was different and very interesting.

Added to that,both Bettany and Dunst aren't really believable as a couple despite the fact that both had good performances.What's even worse is the fact that the tennis action is far from authentic especially when one is familiar with the sport.Everyone watching this pretty much knew what is going to happen at the end of the film and how Peter is going to perform in his last tournament which made it contrived and predictable.Overall,the presence of the lead stars and their acting skills save this film especially when it lacks strong features and make it functional for people who love films of these genre."

","Paul Bethany steals the show with his charm, wit and dashing smile. His co-star Kirsten Dunst delivers, as always, but will not be remembered for this fairly unremarkable role. The two actors have a surprising chemistry, and appear very relatable. They are average actors; blonde, young and normal, and pull off the athlete status with grace.<br/><br/>Though classified as a romantic comedy, the love story between the two tennis players was not what kept me watching. Instead, Wimbledon is driven by Bethany's character Peter, and his last chance at a successful career. Suspense is gradually built, keeping one wondering if Peter can really pull the whole thing off, until one is on the edge of their seat by the end. Though a fairly predictable love story, it works for the film and gives the viewer a secondary story to root for if the tennis is not enough. Neither could stand alone, and thus complement each other and serve the film well. With a perfect balance of sports and love, Wimbledon will keep any viewer enthralled."

So enjoyable after all the sports people have commented on their many wonderful matches. Loved the part where Chrissie asked John if he knew all about the questions about a line shot - in or out, and how labored the questioning of it got. Funny, when your remember all the shenanigans McEnroe used to put officials through.<br/><br/>No, its not a great sports movie, or even a tennis movie, but thoroughly enjoyable.

"oparser","Null","1","1","2 January 2011"," A lightweight romantic comedy that delivers
","Three words say it all: British romantic comedy. If the genre is not your cup of tea, you won't like this flick either. But if you loved other British romantic comedies like ""Love Actually"", ""Notting Hill"", ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""About a Boy"", and so on, then you'll probably like ""Wimbledon"" too, even if the storyline is simple and the characters are not as deep as they could be. Just don't take it too seriously, and suspend your belief about Wimbledon players not sleeping the night before an important match because they play Romeo and Juliet, and you'll fully enjoy the movie: entertaining, funny, romantic, British. The storyline is simple yet effective. Cute but usually unlucky British tennis guy meets cheeky yet romantic American tennis golden girl, and gets lucky. Not only does he have sex before each match, but he even wins the matches. After some (romantic) troubles and some (tennis) adventures, our hero incredibly wins Wimbledon, she doesn't, but she is going to in the future. And they'll live happily ever after. Of course! If you like tennis, the movie has a plus side. You'll root for the hero when he plays the match of his life. (Spoiler alert!) Of course our man is going to win, because he's been unlucky in his tennis career, because he is British (and this is a British film), because his opponent is American (and this is a British film, again) who acts like a spoiled child, and -most of all- because the guy is in love, and in romantic comedies Love Wins All! Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst are not Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, they are not Boris Becker and Steffi Graf either, but they are cute and a good choice for the parts. If you love London, you'll enjoy the locations too. My vote is 7.5 out of 10."

I haven't seen Paul Bettany in any other movies, but his performance was great; and Sam Neill, as always, was great. With the same screen writer, Jennifer Flackett, as the premier movie Madeline and the same director (Richard Loncraine) of the 2001 mini series ""Band of Brothers"" and the 2006 Harrison Ford movie Firewall. As far as romantic comedies go, this would almost be the best. I'd recommend for anyone with a good sense of humour watch it."

","Personally when I heard that a romantic comedy, with the background of Wimbledon was released in cinema's I thought just another way to make money out of tennis. One of the main reasons I didn't go to the cinema to see this movie. Firstly I am not so keen on romantic comedies I find them tedious and uninteresting, only being able to watch a few excellent romantic comedies. However after seeing this on TV I thought it was a good romance, although I wouldn't class it as a comedy. I wouldn't say however this movie was funny, although their were a few moments of private laughter. As usual, the plot was simple, (almost based on real life tennis player Tim Heinman, again not the best tennis player but how everyone in Britian would like him to win Wimbledon) a nice love story centring around washed pro athlete in his last tennis game. However after meeting Kirsten Dunst's character (the favourite to win in the women's Wimbledon) Lizzie, who helps Peter's character to get back in the game. As expected their is romance, argument, make-up and winning. An obvious story line centring around the Wimbledon, to make tennis players, intrigued. Surprisingly, their is good acting from both actors, with a good soundtrack and score. Suspense is built through the movie with some good tennis and good camera-work. If only all tennis action was like this in real life, maybe in my opinion tennis wouldn't be so boring!"

","I have seen it 4 times, and I find it mentally attractive. I have to agree with critics that the actors are not ""Bradjelina,"" but they do have chemistry. Bettany's thoughts and facial expressions are priceless, and his blondish leaning towards white hair only highlights his age and wisdom.He also never fails to be the idiot as he continues to joke around when he is losing to Hammond during half time(sorry, I'm a soccer fan). Though I admit my ignorance of tennis, I have to admire his poise and skills. Durst, the leading actress whose name appears first on the TV guide, poster, etc, fails to do anything. I guess she is just his doll of inspiration. No wonder it bombed in US box office with appro.16 mil: Durst was flat. Overall, I enjoyed the movie and had many great laughs. I think that biggest problem lies in us Americans; we fail to acknowledge the British humour. Don't feel bad; I only understood Bettany's incredible sense of humour the third time around. Without a great plot or graphics, Bettany was able to carry out a noteworthy film."

","Paul Bettany in white shorts, Kirsten Dunst in the shower, two gorgeous leads falling for each other, an underdog winning...whats not to like? Wimbledon has had accusations of being lazy, stealing from other plots etc, yeah so its a 'paint-by-numbers' romantic comedy that seems repetitive, because well, it is. Its comforting, its familiar, safe territory that we all enjoy. Wimbledon doesn't claim to be a ground-breaking new film, a daring motion picture to break records, its just a really nice, decent film with two actors enjoying the chemistry they have on screen. So those critics who think Wimbledon is a predictable yawn with no imagination? Think again. I for one am content with this 'crowd pleasing' romcom that had me rooting for it from the beginning."
"siderite","7","1","1","20 August 2006"," Unexpectedly good romance/sport movie.
","Well, first of all it's a British movie. It couldn't have been completely bad, I mean, they have humour. It did smell a little of Notting Hill and other UK romantic comedies that put together a charming Englishman and an American starlet, but it was all original. As original as a sports movie can be, of course. There is always the tension of the ""big championship"" mixed with the tension of the romantic relationship and sprinkled with tension relaxing humour. Play those buttons right and you've got the instant orgasm.<br/><br/>But it wasn't all recipe. There were some very inventive shots of the tennis ball and some good jokes. They didn't overdo it, either, so it wasn't something you keep laughing at. James McAvoy played a ridiculously small part, while Kirsten Dunst seemed awake the entire course of the film. No partially fainted declarations of love in a slow almost inaudible voice in this movie. Sam Neil, an actor that I like, despite some poor choices in films he chose to play in, plays her slightly controlling dad who comes through in the end.<br/><br/>Paul Bettany has it going on. He has that lovely accent, good looks and, from what I have seen in his movies, a very large emotional range that he can easily express. I am looking forward to more of his films.<br/><br/>Bottom line: good to watch with the girl, it contains nothing spectacular or some amazing twist, but it is a decent easy going romantic sports movie that makes almost no mistakes."

You see the career life, just as much if not more, than the romance part of these two characters' lives.<br/><br/>Kiresten Dunst was perfectly chosen for this part, and although, off the top of my head, I don't recall seeing Paul Bettany in any other films, I thought he did a terrific job playing his character, perhaps more so than Dunst.<br/><br/>The two really make you believe that they are tennis champions...and the film delivers there stardom and romance in a way that not only do you feel like you're apart of the relationship...but it also has an amazing way of making you feel like the fans and the audience watching them from a distance. It's brilliantly directed, perfectly casted, and excellently written.<br/><br/>It's funny, witty, light, cute, romantic and sweet. All the things that make up a terrific romance.

Its worth watching again and again if just for the way the movie was shot. The internal monologue of Paul Bettany is great and so is the insight into the tennis world. It shows you a realistic perspective of an aging athlete who has never been the best and how he would view the world. Then along comes Dunst and he finds a new perspective on his game.

","I bet everybody wonders what's going through Roger Federer or Leyton Hewitt's mind when they are about to serve or to receive. Tennis is one of the world sports that require the most concentration and it is also one of those where there's no tie; either you are a winner or you are a looser.<br/><br/>""Wimbledon"" deals with all of this, during the tournament with the same name and in the mind of Peter Colt (Paul Bettany), an old pro that is ranked 119 in the world, and when anybody meets him they say: ""You were once 15th in the world"", or ""You were the 17th"". Colt corrects: ""Actually it was 11th, and for the most part of 1996"". A player always remembers things like that; it's a big deal.<br/><br/>So Colt is loosing his game, and Adam Brooks, Jennifer Flackett and Mark Levin let us know what he's thinking with their screenplay. Not one of them has written anything very respectable in the past, but they go through Colt's mind and they handle all of the clichés of the romantic comedy, and they do it very well.<br/><br/>It's Wimbledon, and it's Colt last professional tournament because of a ""wild card"", and he meets Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst), a rising young player who's playing too, and they begin to win; in tennis and inBecause Paul Bettany is a great actor the romantic part is a perfect fit for him; even when he hasn't done romantic films. Because Kirsten Dunst is a fine actor and experienced in the chemistry department; she's a perfect fit too; and the most responsible in making the couple work.<br/><br/>Characters like Lizzie's father (Sam Neil) and Peter's agent (John Favreau) are two necessary inclusions for the plot of the genre; to make us laugh or to make us get angry. That's the only reason why we are able to accept them instantly and anticipate most of their actions. We also get the best friend, training partner and coincidentally rival (Nicolaj Coaster-Waldau) who gives advice and says it's all alright.<br/><br/>This is not a film about real situations at all, but there's a sense of reality in scenes like the one that shows the way Peter family lives; with all the simplicity of the world, and all their love to support their son. Even his brother, who always bets against him, loves him and wants him to succeed. Or images where the people support their best British player in their tournament; cheering him as he leaves the hotel for a match.<br/><br/>The movie works mostly because of the performances but also because it makes tennis its main attraction and it doesn't disappoint. I play tennis, and the matches are as real as it can get, in a movie where they must have been choreographed. There's no way director Richard Loncraine could have shot an entire match, but he managed so the viewer could feel entertained.<br/><br/>Besides, his camera possesses a lot of movement, and when Peter's thinking, it goes round and round, and when he's playing, it's changing frames constantly; and when he's going to look for his love and she's waiting, it just follows through as it should be, because of the very important moment finding love is."

","Playing on the tennis term ""love"" added a couple of good lines to this feel-good romantic comedy/sports movie. In fact, the dialog between Peter Colt and Lizzie Bradbury(Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst) was one of the well-done elements of this movie. The tennis scenes were extremely well done, particularly Paul's many court scenes. The internal dialog added to the suspense, even though we know early on that Paul will play above himself. I'd bet Bettany plays a pretty mean racket himself. There were a few stereotypical characters, but also some off-beat roles, such as Peter's family that added an element not often seen in sports movies. While I was not sure of Kirsten's true feeling at times, Paul did an outstanding job in his role, from physicality to emotional reactions. The Wimbleton setting was as authentic as one could hope for, although at times I wondered about the prescient comments of announcer John McEnroe reflected in Paul's internal dialog. Noentheless, the final match had as much tension as the real thing, and I very much admired Paul's handling of it. It isn't every day a movie comes along that is engaging, fun, and leaves one with a warm sense of satisfaction. This one won't test your critical faculties, but it will be time well spent."

They LOOK like pro tennis players. and isn't that the aim of all actors-- to look like their characters? and on top of that the soundtrack of this movie is excellent. seriously if you voted ""against this movie"" watch it again with a more positive attitude and i can guarantee you'll like it (at least) a little more.PS: i love Deiter Prohl. he's really good! :D"

","One of the best heart wrenching exciting stories ever told. Duo looks so good together in the movie. Very exciting story of Wimbeldon and the different aspects that can affect a tennis player. Drama of US vs British Wimbeldon is also a underlying issue in the movie. Kirsten performs flawlessly as an actress and surprisingly Paul expresses all the emotions that truly can carry the Peter Colt character to the level it needs to make this movie one of the better ones I have seen in quite awhile. I'm not too intrigued with a tennis story...but this is not a tennis movie... its a story of love and the love of Wimbeldon. I voted it a 10 for the acting and for the story that truly is a great story."

","OK, first of all I have to tell, how much I adore Kirsten Dunsts talent in acting. I really think she is one of the best in her generation, and hope to see her in a lot of movies.<br/><br/>So well, Wimbledon is about this 30 something folk, Peter Colt, who was once kind of a good, or acknowledged tennis player. And now he's like nobody. He's about to quit playing as a pro, he just does this wild card thing at Wimbledon (stylish hello, isn'T it?). He is played by Paul Bettany, who can be familiar from the Beautiful mind movie. So he mets the Dunst's character, Lizzy, a very young (19) tennis player from the US. First it is just about ""researching"" between them, but we actually see them fall in love. Oh, and he starts to win... Quite big, in the end.<br/><br/>The whole movie is filled with that lovely British sense of humor, I really like, and tough it is a fairy tale, it's from the best kind of that.<br/><br/>It really deserves the time it would take to watch... Over and Over and Over...:) I loved it!!!"

","I had very low expectations when i went to see this movie because my Grandpa told me that it was a stupid movie. Only after I left the cinemas I remembered that Grandpa hates sports or comedies. I love sport and when I saw this movie I laughed, enjoyed the storyline with Lizzie Bradbury and Peter Colt. The visual effects were superb and wonderful how they could look like such good tennis players, though they have hardly played tennis in their lives! As soon as the movie came out I was lucky enough to borrow Wimbledon from my cousin and i loved every second of it. I soon bought it. Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany both did a great job at acting out as professional tennis players. If you love sport (especially tennis) this has enough action and comedy to make a great movie!"
"series_of_moments","7","1","1","22 July 2005"," Typical romantic comedy, but a surprisingly successful sports drama.
","It was what I expected in a lot of ways. Kinda' hokey, kinda' corny, but entertaining. A run-of-the mill romantic comedy with few surprises on that end. The actors did a good job keeping it interesting and fun. Dunst played the strength or her character well, but never seemed to take the heavier scenes seriously enough. Paul Bettany was solid, but in a lot of scenes, he overplayed the stereotypical Hugh Grant British stammering and awkwardness. It should be noted that this is from the same team that made Notting Hill.<br/><br/>I must give the movie a LOT of credit for transferring the game to the screen rather well. Wimbledon did an outstanding job at depicting the psychological game within the game. At some points I actually felt the tingling in my legs that I remembered from the starting blocks in my first track meet. Intense. The visual effects were also well done. In some ways it played like The Matrix only instead of the war against the machines it's Wimbledon and instead of ""the one"" it's some British guy.<br/><br/>In spite of its genre-specific clichés, it was original enough for me to enjoy. I gave it a 6 for being an enjoyable movie, and an extra point for its visual effects and dramatic power. I recommend it to the romantic comedy fans and mild sports fans."
"lavatch","Null","1","1","8 July 2005"," A Winning Combination at Wimbledon!
","The strength of ""Wimbledon"" was in two areas: (1) the good chemistry between the lead performers Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany and (2) the lively tennis action sequences staged on the famed Wimbledon tennis courts in London.<br/><br/>The romantic scenes between the two tennis players, Peter and Lizzie, as performed by Dunst and Bettany, were touching and sincere. From their accidental first meeting in a hotel through the development of their relationship on and off the tennis courts, the scenes were heart-warming and filmed in unusual and attractive locations around London. My favorite sequence was in Peter's attempt to play ""Romeo"" and climb up the vines into the bedchamber of Lizzie. It was impressive as well that both Dunst and Bettany sported good athleticism in their highly convincing tennis scenes. <br/><br/>My only criticism of the film was in the screenplay. A number of the characters, including a hyperactive agent and a worried parent-manager, seemed extraneous to the main action. The narrative was padded and would have benefited from a stronger subplot. But in the portrayal of the principal relationship of the two young tennis players, ""Wimbledon"" offered a delightful and winning combination!"
"mbunky","8","1","1","4 July 2005"," Love in tennis and outside
","I love romantic comedies, and this one went straight to the top of my list. It's the kind I can watch every weekend and not get tired, so basically, it's worth renting. Wimbledon revolves around Peter Colt, a Englishman and Lizzie Bradbury an American, who meet at the Wimbledon tennis tournament. It's the end of Peter's profession career as a tennis player, and Lizzie's on her way up. Being a romantic comedy, the movie is about how they get together. Though I don't think Kirsten Dunst ( who played Lizzie Bradbury) is a particularly good actress, the energy she added to this movie brought added just the right kick. All the scenes fit together seamlessly, it's funny and charming, and under it all it gives you a few moral lessons about family and will power. One thing that I use to judge romantic comedies by is how I feel after I watch them and this makes me leap out of my chair and be ready for whatever comes at me. This movie does not need a sequel, if the make one I will be mad."
"TheNorthernMonkee","7","1","1","13 May 2005"," successfully makes tennis interesting
","SPOILERS As a sport, Tennis is unique as being either boring or wonderful depending upon the location. There are those around the world who love tennis with a passion, and likewise there are some that hate it. Strangely though, for two weeks each year, the entire British nation focuses on a sport, it has a habit of ignoring for the rest of the year. With rain, strawberries and hopeless British players who never fulfil their potential, the two week Wimbledon Championships are always fun to watch, and a great way of showing how well the nation can hold a tournament.<br/><br/>Wimbledon is such a huge attraction however, that films have received backing before to involve it in one way or another. Until 2004 though, no film had ever considered actually making the tournament a crucial part of the plot. One possible reason for this might be that more often than not, the notion of a game where two people knock a yellow ball over a net, is just not that adaptable to the screen. In ""Wimbledon"" though, the true genius is that the film actually manages it with style.<br/><br/>Peter Colt (Paul Bettany) is a useless British also ran who is taking part in his final professional tournament. In contrast, Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst) is a young up and coming player who expects to win the tournament. When the two meet, fireworks are set off and soon the two fall in love as Colt plays the finest tennis of his life.<br/><br/>Romantic comedies always tend to follow the same path. So much so, we often do know how the film will progress before we even put it on. The key to what makes one entertaining though is the supporting cast and the way the two stars gel.<br/><br/>Firstly, as far as a leading couple, Bettany and Dunst work remarkably well. Playing off her youthful beauty against his experienced old hand, the two genuinely convince that they care for each other. As established actors, it's little surprise that they work well together, and if not for the age difference (Dunst is currently 23 and Bettany is approaching 34) then the two could probably create a serious of different films as a couple.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is equally as good too. Whether the superb turn by Jon Favreau as the agent, or the equally good turn by Bernard Hill as Bettany's dad, the film is littered with well acted performances by a strong supporting cast.<br/><br/>Like the tournament itself though, the key point about ""Wimbledon"" is the tennis, and for that the creators have pulled something special out of the bag. Keeping us up to date with scores and only showing us certain points, the film never tries to overload you with too much ball play. When it does show you though, it manages to project the actors onto the actual pitch, and shows you from multiple angles as they rally between each other. The action is cleverly filmed, and more often than not, you genuinely believe your watching the actors playing tennis.<br/><br/>""Wimbledon"" the film was always going to be predictable. Your standard romantic comedy, it should be no surprise to anyone when the conclusion takes hold. The beauty of the film though is that as well as containing a solid cast, it manages to capture the thrill of the game and actually make tennis interesting. For that in itself, it should be praised."

","I've just seen the film on DVD, and I really liked it! I didn't really have any expectations at all, because I had never heard of it. I found it really enjoyable though; a charming little story with rounded qualities: romance, humour, and a little suspension and excitement added. Not too predictable, but it didn't give me any big surprise either. I much appreciated the photo and the light, many of the scenes from Brighton were beautiful. We're in the midst of spring here in Stockholm. The days are getting longer, the light is soft, trees are budding, and the fruit trees (apple, cherry, pear) are in full bloom.

Also Kirsten dunst character is very cute and adorable. Also the fact that this is a sport movie makes it even better specially a tennis one being that there aren't much of these or none at all. Also the way this movie is directed is very interesting and the way director gets into the player's head is interesting and you get to know what someone thinks while they are playing which I can state as an athlete myself that is a lot and losing is miserable. Showing the struggle of an athlete trying to come back is great and very interesting and gives a twist to the romantic comedy genre."

It made me want to play tennis again. And as usual, Kirsten Dunst, did it again. Its time to move on from Julia Roberts refreshment. Kirsten Dunst is the future Julia. She is funny, refreshing, rebellious and beautiful and just to seeing her smiling can make someones day. And as a matter of chance, the other female artist i could think about that i like as much as Kirsten is Reese Witherspoon, and for my surprise, the trivia said that she was supposed to play Kirsten's role.

I'm not sure how director Richard Loncraine feels about the sport, but the way the matches are filmed, I'd have to guess that he's mesmerized by it. ""Wimbledon"" is your typical underdog story, set in the world of tennis, but with a romance thrown in. Aging tennis star Paul Bettany and young, aggressive spitfire Kirsten Dunst are the duo in question. He's a longshot, and she's the superstar. Dunst has never been sexier or more appealing in an adult role, and Bettany proves he's got the chops to ascend to leading man status. ""Wimbledon"" is a winner all-around."

His career of late has been dismal and he figures he will be sent home quickly and without anyone noticing. At the other end of the career ladder is Lizzie Bradbury (Dunst) a young shooting star aiming at the championship. The two meet when Colt is given the wrong room, and a sort of relationship starts to evolve. Even as the two are at different points in their lives, Colt with a dysfunctional family looking for what to do after his career and Bradbury with her father (Neill) watching her every step. As if hit by a magic wand, Colt puts his game together and starts to advance through the tournament. Bradbury, and especially her father is concerned however that their relationship might distract her.<br/><br/>Comment: A very sweet and witty romantic comedy with stellar performances from the cast. Especially Bettany and Dunst do great work. I really liked Bettany's character Colt's introspective monologues and his conversations with tennis friend Prohl, played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau. The parts with either them talking or Colt and Bradbury developing their relationship are simply great. But there is tennis as well, and contrary to what I expected, the scenes with the play are fast-paced and full of nice special-effects, due to good editing and special effects, not at all slow and boring as I feared they would be. The one minor flaw is that the plot is too predictable and full of clichés, but fortunately it does not taint the movie otherwise. In conclusion a fun and romantic, yes it is both, there are both laughs and loves, good romantic scenes. Highly recommended!<br/><br/>9/10"
"moviefan2003va","7","1","1","21 January 2005"," Good
","I think this was a good movie, however, I think it was marketed in the wrong way. It was marketed to appeal to younger audiences but more mature audiences would have found the movie just as entertaining. It's a good romantic film. Bettany is a credible, untapped romantic lead. He has terrific chemistry with Dunst. He perfectly channels the self-doubting, humble, and aging tennis pro who is sensing the sun setting on his career. He is a shoo-in to be beaten in the first round of Wimbledon until he meets Dunst who inspires him to continue on and eventually win. Very, cute, charming film with a cast that makes it slightly more exceptional than most romantic movies covering this same territory."

","Sports Movies are usually immensely positive good-natured affairs altogether. Wimbledon is no different as Tennis tries to drag itself into the mainstream and gain some appeal with tykes around the globe. Some schmaltz thrown in along with the lovely Kirsten Dunst and you have a line-up capable of taking on any audience. Or do you?<br/><br/>Tennis. Rusedski, Agassi, Sharapova et al. They make big news once a year as we all tune into Roland Garros and Wimbledon but how big a deal is it really. This movie tries to drag the sport kicking and screaming into the 21st Century.<br/><br/>With two excellent leads in the Lovely Kirsten Dunst and a surprisingly charming Paul Bettany(Master Commander) and a supporting cast including Sam Neill (Jurassic Park), Jon Favreau (Swingers) and back-up folk such as John McEnroe and Chris Evert there's plenty of people who can make a movie enjoyable.<br/><br/>The main gist of things is that aging Brit Peter Colt(Bettany) has decided to make one last bash at the Championship, expecting to make a quick exit. The night before his first match he meets Lizzie Bradbury - the rising American starlet who sets his pulse racing and seems to spark him into action. The movie follows their blooming relationship while keeping up with their progress through the tournament. Not the massive cheese-fest it could have been as Colt gets fairly lucky along the way and it appears he was once class having been ranked 11th in the world at one point. Focus seems his problem, not ability. His new lady love hones that focus as he makes an assault on the title.<br/><br/>The tennis coaching for this was done by former headband-lover Pat Cash. By all accounts they had to abandon plans to make them look really good and had to add the ball in digitally later. Not for want of effort, both leads spent weeks in preparation for their roles. A well paced movie, you don't really have time to get bored and as such it remains wholly enjoyable for the duration. Sam Neill is pretty good with what little he has to do as the over-protective father who manages to avoid the cliché of being unreasonable for the sake of it. The rest of the cast are fun and entertaining particularly the younger brother (Carl) who some may recall as Pvt. Miller from Band of Brothers. Well worth a trip, Irishphat rating is a healthy 3 out of 5."
"kvdd","Null","1","1","3 November 2004"," actually, not quite bad!
","Despite some clumsy tennis action shots at the beginning, the match scenes are actually quite good! Paul Bettany is charming, very believable. Kirsten Dunst (who is definitely not my favorite actress) is casted well as a fanatic tennis player who wants nothing but win. But the fact that she falls (so rapidly) for this losing player is strange... just as strange as seeing the professional tennis players drink beers, stay up late, eat very greasy food etc.<br/><br/>Characters around the main persons are rather flat; Lizzy Bradbury's father changes his mind a bit too quickly, and the heroes' parents fall in love again like a shift of the wind.<br/><br/>The humor is a bit too American, shame. A more British touch to it would match the subject better. <br/><br/>And still, the whole thing was quite entertaining!"
"TheEdge-4","Null","1","1","25 September 2004"," Or perhaps we should call it ""Love all, Actually""
","A lot of people seem to be getting bent out of shape about the number of errors in this film (mostly tennis related despite the presence of Pat Cash as a technical adviser). Why? This is Wimbledon the movie, not Wimbledon the documentary. All I care about is if this film succeeds as entertainment and on that basis, it most assuredly does.<br/><br/>Yes, there are mistakes if you want to look for them (for instance, the lead character drives down the Mall to Trafalgar Square in order to get to the Dorchester in Park Lane, which is in the opposite direction and completely the wrong route to take unless you are going by cab, but conveniently allows the filmmakers to feature Buckingham Palace and Nelson's Column to make sure everybody (i.e. Americans) know we are in London). But since the story centres on a British player winning the men's singles final, this is hardly based in the realm of reality anyway and therefore any further criticism over accuracy is pointless. As it is, to this non-tennis-playing viewer, the tennis scenes seem convincing enough and since the majority of the story is set off-court, I think the film's producers made the right decision in casting actors in the lead roles rather than tennis players.<br/><br/>Paul Bettany adds yet another fine performance to his list of credits (which include a great turn as Geoffrey Chaucer in Brian Helgeland's gloriously anachronistic ""A Knight's Tale"", ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"", ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Gangster No. 1"") and Kirsten Dunst is equally up to the task, despite having the harder job as her role is somewhat underwritten and gives her less to work with. Her top billing is for marketing reasons as Bettany's character, Peter Colt, is the main character in this film, not hers but Dunst's name is bigger at the box-office, especially after the ""Spider-man"" films. Still, the two manage to make their characters likable enough for you to care about them and to want them to win through at the end (plus any film in which Kirsten Dunst's first scene sees her emerging from the shower gets my vote). There are also good supporting performances from Sam Neill, Bernard Hill, Eleanor Bron and James McAvoy which help.<br/><br/>Behind the camera, Richard Loncraine provides some stylish directorial flourishes and thanks to the extremely talented cinematographer Darius Khondji, both London and Brighton have never looked lovelier.<br/><br/>This film is the latest from Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner's Working Title company and adheres closely to the formula which has worked well for them in the past in such films as ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""Notting Hill"", ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" and ""Love Actually"" and as such should be another smash hit for them which should help make up for the disappointing performance of the much (and unfairly) maligned ""Thunderbirds""."
"jack_malvern","7","1","1","21 September 2004"," Four Nottings, Actually
","It wasn't written by Richard Curtis, but if you've seen his roster of five-act rom-coms you will sense his presence. Wimbledon obeys the British feelgood formula so slavishly that it feels as though the director was just filling in the blanks.<br/><br/>But what blanks. It is properly funny, well-paced, and uplifting even in its most predictable moments. Paul Bettany is jolly good as Hugh Grant and Kirsten Dunst is a huge improvement on Andie MacDowell in the romantic-lead-to-sell-the-film-in-America role. The supporting cast, especially James McAvoy and Jon Favreau, is excellent.<br/><br/>If only it could have been a little more original. The characters, key plot elements and even some individual scenes have been imported wholesale from Notting Hill.

Either way, it's fun to watch and a good inside look at the ways and means of Wimbleton.<br/><br/>Hey Spiderman: Watch out! Kirstin Dunst and Paul Bettany are a hot item here. Their chemistry works. Jon Favreau plays a completely believable whored-up agent with a strong ""despicability quotient"". James McAvoy (new to my movie going experience) is the younger brother of Paul Bettany. He delivers convincing sibling rivalry to a dysfunctional-anyway Colt-household. Everyone else in the cast is fodder for those big 4. They're all good. No one is hogging lines or camera time.

The film doesn't focus on solely the sport or the budding romance,instead melding the two for a very successful mix.

"film-critic","2","4","9","11 January 2005"," I'll jump! You don't want that on your conscience, do you?
","Was the purpose of this Hollywood film to see how just how many clichés they could fit into a two hour time frame? Perhaps it was just I, but I counted nearly twenty in the first hour. From the accidental meeting to the overuse of the ""good luck charm"" theme, Hollywood successfully packed in these and a bunch more for this little British film. With clichés weighting down the truck of this ride, we also have two actors helming it that need more skill in the romantic comedy genre, or else they may find themselves veering off the road and down a steep hill crashing into more and more poor films. Bettany was not a substitute for the Hugh Grant style of British acting that this film desperately needed, while Kirsten Dunst is not aging well at all. Her acting seems to be depleting with her charm and looks, causing us to actually watch the tennis games in this film instead of their performances. Thankfully, we had these CGI tennis matches to watch, which was the only eye-catching element to this entire film. It covered the element that Bettany and Dunst were lacking, which was talent.<br/><br/>So, was I too harsh with the beginning paragraph? I don't think so. What could have been a decent film with better British actors and a stronger leading lady, eventually fell apart with the nonchalant emotion of Bettany and the ""collecting my paycheck"" style of acting from Dunst. Even veteran actor Sam Neill couldn't escape the clutches of cliché as he played the same father-esquire figure that we have seen time and time again in this genre of film. I hope his paycheck will go to the reconstruction of the broken nerves in his face that were unusable in this film thus giving us a reason why his character did not smile nor show any form of emotion towards his daughter or boyfriend. It was as if he was rehearsing for a role in The Stepford Wives instead of this movie. These three actors literally gave the worst performances of their career. They never broke their own mold, but simply followed the lines and direction given to them from the script. If the script itself could have done its own acting, this may have been a better film. Instead we are lead on an emotional carriage ride that has squares for wheels and seems to be lost the entire time. If I had to give a reason as to why this film was not as successful in the box office as it could have been, I would have to say it was the acting. It really slumped this film deeper into a darkened corner.<br/><br/>If one can look past the acting, there really isn't anything else to see. Lacking the excitement from a sports film, even if it is tennis, director Richard Loncraine follows the same route as every other sports film released by Hollywood. Imagination was not a prerequisite for making this movie. From the overplayed underdog story, to the forced connection between Dunst and Bettany, to finally the unemotional ending, Loncraine gives nothing short of disaster. When these films are being produced by the dozens in Hollywood, it is your job as the director to give us something new. Either a fresh face, or a fresh course of events. Do not fall into the same clichés over and over again, as it seems that Loncraine has opted to do (referencing my comment about packing as many clichés as possible into this film).<br/><br/>If I must note only one good thing about this film, I would have to go with the use of CGI. Apparently, the graphics department was ordered to use their imagination to give us a new perspective on the game and to freshen up the look of tennis. This was successful as I thought that the uses of CGI to capture the effects of the ball on the court were outstanding. It is an element not used often enough in sporting films, so it provided some ease to my eyes that were swollen from the rest of this picture. As I think about it, even the CGI was a bit disappointing because it proved that the actors were not actually playing the sport, thus only destroying whatever believe we had in their feeble characters. Oh well, I tried.<br/><br/>Finally, I would like to say that I was a bit disturbed by the idea of Bettany and Dunst together. I felt that their relationship was built upon Bettany doing better at the game. She was his good luck charm. He knew that from the beginning, yet decided to stay with her to help him reach new heights of fame and fortune. He, in other words, used her. Director Richard Loncraine does a fantastic job of avoiding this issue and placing the entire emphasis on love. That is all fine and dandy, but we need reality to take into effect her and demonstrate that without Dunst, Bettany would have ultimately failed. Loncraine tries to give us some explanation at the end of the film (not to give anything away), but is unsuccessful because of the cliché surrounding it. I personally thought there was no emotion between the two love interests, only this dark addiction to being victorious that kept these two together (or at least one rushing after the other). Think about this as you watch the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was pitiful. Nothing in it was spectacular, nothing was imaginative, and nothing sparked any bit of creativity or excitement for me to pick up a tennis ball and begin playing again. Bettany and Dunst gave the worst performances of their careers as they stumbled through the emotions and lines of this film. With these two hardly showing any skill it was only a matter of time that the remaining elements followed suit.<br/><br/>Grade: ** out of *****"

While Bettany give another excellent and solid performance as the charming Peter Colt, audiences have to tolerate Dunst, whose whiny voice and uncoordinated serve is so laughable that tennis buffs will be forced to yell at linesmen on screen and threaten the umpire to call this film out of the bounds and forfeit the audience's money.

","About half-way through this facile film I turned to my wife and said ""Is this the worst film that you have ever seen?"" She agreed that it was certainly one of the worst. Actually, to be fair, it did improve towards the end when the mushy Mills and Boon ""love story"" gave way to some well-filmed tennis action. The Wimbledon matches, especially the final climax of the film, were rather well done and the quality of the tennis looked good to my (admittedly untutored) eye. But before that we were ""treated"" to a sham of a film with unconvincing characters unconvincingly played and with a story line as banal as it was preposterous.<br/><br/>Filming sport has always been problematic and there are few epics in the genre. Perhaps ""Chariots of Fire"" and ""Rocky"" and more recently ""Seabiscuit"", but there aren't many others. One of the problems is that the joy of sport is that the unexpected tends to happen and that to create an artificial unexpected in a fictional movie plot can pale when compared with the original. In ""Wimbledon"" a washed-out British tennis player gets inspiration from his encounter with a pretty young American. Quite why the makers of films like ""Four Weddings and a Funeral""; ""Notting Hill"" and now ""Wimbledon"" have to have upper middle class Brits of a certain age getting laid by worldly-wise American gals I'm not sure. Anyway the tried and tested story-line gets rolled out again this time. Paul Bettany is a ""Hugh Grant"" figure par excellence (if they film Hugh's life story he could get the part, with a little hair dye) and his love interest Kirsten Dunst is sweet to look at. The speed with which she jumps into bed with Bettany might upset the Christian right, but it seems to help their tennis performances.<br/><br/>The film's dialogue is cringe-making in the extreme. How actors as good as Richard Lindsay, Eleanor Bron and Celia Imrie got their mouths around this dross is wondrous. And quite what John McEnroe and Chrissie Evert agreed to be in it I've no idea (they would be well advised not to give up the day job). Just another pay day I suppose. I cared little for the precious central characters with their ghastly families and their spoilt brat lives. Having said that I did enjoy the tennis scenes and the denouement I found exciting. But in truth it is a pointless film and you would be well advised to find something better to do than to spend an hour and a half of your time sitting in front of this guff. Buy a ticket for the real Wimbledon maybe?"

","To further alienate myself from my target audience, I will admit that I am not much of a 'tennis' guy. Football, baseball, hockey and even golf all take up precious hours not spent watching the latest theatrical release and I don't seem to want to spend the time to get to know the sport that is as rich in tradition as any of the above. <br/><br/>That is not to say that I don't understand or respect the court. Throw me names like Agassi, McEnroe or Sampras and I would be able to pick them out of a line-up. But the sport on a whole just doesn't turn my crank. <br/><br/>Surprising then my anticipation for the new tennis themed film Wimbledon hitting theaters this weekend. Maybe it was the catchy tagline 'Wimbledon Serves Love'. Maybe it was the marketing which promoted the film as 'From the creators of Notting Hill' or maybe I'm so shallow that seeing Kristin Dunst running around a court in a short skirt that had me check my local listings. Who knows? <br/><br/>Wimbledon is story developing around two tennis stars whose careers could not be heading in more opposite directions. Peter Colt (Paul Bettany) was once ranked 11th , but at the ripe old age of thirty-one, now stands at 157th on the players standings. As Wimbledon begins, he announces his retirement to an uninterested room of reporters. However, then Colt meets Lizzie Bradbury (Kristin Dunst).<br/><br/>Lizzie is an up-and-comer American superstar. Her looks and play have the paparazzi following her like a celebrity. She is a favorite to win the tournament and she comes to England with an over-protective father that will try everything within his power to keep his daughters mind focused on the task at hand. <br/><br/>When Lizzie meets Colt sparks fly immediately. Colt has accidentally walked into Lizzie's hotel suite where she is taking a shower. She walks out and smiles with that glow and dimple bearing grin that Dunst should paten. Their awkwardness over the situation is overshadowed by the unmistakable chemistry the two lead actors emit towards each other. <br/><br/>Before the first serve, the two are engaging in couple activities. They are running from the press, hiding from her father and ignoring that they are on the eve of the most prestigious tennis event in any calendar year. <br/><br/>The relationship's effects on the two are also varied. Lizzie falls to some bad luck early, while Colt surprises even himself with his steady play and a win streak that puts him into the finals. Convinced that their relationship is the reason for both of their fates, Dunst runs back to her father's arms while Colt stays in pursuit in an attempt to express his true feelings for the American superstar. The ending is to be left to the paying public, but let's face it, happy endings sell. <br/><br/>If I could use one word to sum up my Wimbledon experience, it would be 'nice'. Wimbledon is a 'nice' film. Never daring or overly interesting, it keeps pace by switching between the excitement of the court action and the heat of the romance on the streets of London. Never offending, but never taking any chances to be different from the hundreds of other films that try to be average either, Wimbledon satisfies the palate but gives us nothing to remember on the way home. <br/><br/>Maybe it is because for every pro there is a con to counter its progression.<br/><br/>For every bit of humor like the brother who likes to bet against his sibling with the local bookies, there is the lack of humor in the agent played by Jon Favreau  a role that was written for its expected humorous output. For every close up angled view of a tennis match that let's you feel like you're truly at the game, there is a love story that continues to spark without setting the screen afire. One minus one plus one minus one equals average. And with a tag line and an opening credit scene that made me chuckle just in its simplicity, I find that a fault indeed.<br/><br/>www.gregsrants.com"

Makes a mockery of all the real professionals such as Federer who is mentioned in the film and all other professional tennis players that take their profession seriously and train like professionals (abstaining from sex, alcohol) and the myriad of sacrifices in order to be number 1.

","The tennis matches were well faked in this flick, with glimpses into the mind of the lead player (Paul Bettany) that we were not granted for his love-match (Kirsten Dunst), who is mainly presented on her back in bed. As usual, her role is seriously underwritten: she has no friend (as Bettany's character does), she has no car, and misbehaves during the competition by drinking, eating and shagging. Why he is able to win in his early 30s in spite of this behaviour, while she loses in her mid-20s is incomprehensible. Anyway, they both get out of tennis ""it's only a game"", get married and have two children in a highly traditional manner that probably made many female movie-goers vomit into their popcorn. Yes, it's a highly traditional movie, all about a male winning and a female worshipping him and having his babies, but it's all right because it's only entertainment, right?

"psi_fla","Null","0","0","27 September 2004"," The charm of the talented cast keeps this run of the mill Brit-com from turning lame.
","Rating: *** (out of *****)<br/><br/>Richard Loncraine's Wimbledon falls into the same trap as Richard Curtis's Love Actually; that is, there are many things to dislike about it. Yet, as a whole, Love Actually left a positive impression on most of the general public when they left the cinema. The question is, will people feel the same way about Wimbledon? Probably, but in this case a little more tolerance of the film's soppier elements is advised. And that might not go down too well with the most cynical of viewers. <br/><br/>So does this mean that Working Title Films have suddenly hit a stumbling block with their last two major Brit-coms? Well, no. Both of them are pleasing enough entertainments. They're just not up to the standards of some of their previous efforts. The happy ending isn't a problem - when you watch their best love films (which include Bridget Jones's Diary and Four Weddings And A Funeral), that's exactly what you want. The central problem is the love story itself. I credit Loncraine for taking the Working Title love formula and trying to apply it to something a little different, i.e. tennis, but in this context it seems abruptly handled as well as a little awkward. It's to the credit of the two talented leads, Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany, that this story manages to get off the ground and become a sufficient crowd-pleaser.<br/><br/>The premise sounds just like you would expect it to. British tennis player Peter Colt (Paul Bettany), having fallen to the rank of 119 in the world, has decided that this year's Wimbledon championships will be his last. The turning point arrives when he meets the current rising star and ""bad girl"" of women's tennis, Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst) - and he not only falls in love with her but suddenly finds that he has the potential to win the tournament. Of course, there are obstacles along the way, such as Lizzie's overprotective father (Sam Neill), but surely he'll overcome those.<br/><br/>Yeah, it's pretty run of the mill stuff, with quite a few implausibilities along the way. But Wimbledon isn't as much of a fantasy as you might think. After all, we've seen people like Lizzie and Peter on the court in real life (some have recalled Chris Evert and Jimmy Connors in the 1970's), and overachieving underdogs are coming to the fold more often these days, if not necessarily in tennis. (Remember Greece's victory at Euro 2004?) The tennis aspects of the story are actually handled very well, even if the games are CGI-enhanced. Dunst, Bettany and all the other actors playing tennis stars don't put a foot wrong here. We are further entertained by the presence of former players-turned-commentators, like John McEnroe and Chris Evert.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, just about everyone in the supporting ensemble is wasted. Gifted character actors like Sam Neill and Bernard Hill have little to do as Lizzie and Peter's respective fathers. I think the problem here is the muddled plot, or lack of it - we are constantly rushed from scene to scene, hardly getting a chance to spend time with the players' families. Fortunately, there are still some real scene-stealers to be found, like Jon Favreau's agent. <br/><br/>Enjoy Wimbledon for what it is - a rather thin film, but one that should cheer up its audience with its charm, goodwill, cast and music (although we didn't really need to hear ""This Year's Love"" yet again, did we?). You may consider it the warm-up exercise for what should be Working Title's real high point this year - the return of Bridget Jones."

There were also scenes where the camera scans across the crowd, smearing them all together and focusing in on one or two at a time. It was just an interesting movie that was well acted and well done.

","Wimbledon is a romantic sports movie that double faults on both counts. Not only does it serve up very little tennis, but it is also weak romantically.<br/><br/>The film tracks two tennis pros on very different arcs. Rising American star Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst) is playing in her first Wimbledon Championship while English vet Peter Colt (Paul Bettany) may be playing in his last. Along the way both players find they may love something more than tennis.<br/><br/>PLOT PROBLEMS: Wimbledon's biggest fault lies in its inability to stay within its plot lines. One would expect a film running just 100 minutes to be tightly focused on Bradbury and Colt Instead precious minutes are wasted on distracting subplots involving Colt's parents and brother.<br/><br/>POOR PREMISE: And the basic plot premise is questionable. Given the youth in women's tennis, would a first-time Wimbledon player, probably in her mid to late teens, be attracted to a 31-year-old, who, like in teen years, is like 100?<br/><br/>TENNIS TROUBLES: The film is also misses the mark tenniswise. If you'd expecting an inside look at the pro game, you'll be disappointed. Unlike Blue Crush (2002) which showcased pro women's surfing, tennis and Wimbledon are mere props for a generic love story that could easily have been about two accountants in an office building. Much of the action takes place outside The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club and the usual celebrity cameos are virtually non-existent. Sadly even Mr. 3000 had more behind the scenes action than this movie.<br/><br/>And the tennis itself has a fake feel. It is heavily laden with special effects reminiscent of Matrix 'bullet time' and annoying in your head voiceovers, ala For the Love of the Game (1999).<br/><br/>Sadly (MINOR SPOILER) the best match is a charming game of 'air tennis' between Bettany and Dunst.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: The movie's final fault lies in trying to be too nice, which makes for a lack of drama. There are really no villains here and no real great challenges for our actors to overcome, making for a politically correct but rather dull movie."

Which is really very odd because there are so many of them, and they're not actually that hard to understand. In a romantic comedy, boy meets girl (except in gay romantic comedies, in which either girl meets girl or boy meets boybut I digress), something keeps boy and girl apart, and after overcoming some comedic adversity, boy and girl get together.<br/><br/>This isn't rocket science, so screwing it up is sort of unforgivable.<br/><br/>In Wimbledon, boy meets girl, and nothing much keeps them apart.

Paul Bettany plays his role to complete perfection.<br/><br/>Of course, the overall story of the movie is a little improbable. I admit to thinking initially that Kirsten Dunst's character is a little over the top, and the chances of someone like her falling in love in the course of a week and a half tournament seem slim to none. Something about the film, though, makes you believe.<br/><br/>Maybe it's the fact that it's one of these films where you don't just see a ""the whole world revolves around the couple"" kind of storyline. You see them struggle and fight, like -real- people do. <br/><br/>Oh, and speaking of being real, certain other elements give this movie a sense of being ""in the real world."" I was really impressed and happy- though not totally surprised judging from past experience- to see John McEnroe and Mary Carillo in this film. They're real tennis commentators, and thank God they were acting as their normal selves in this movie. Also, the mentioning of such real tennis characters such as Tommy Haas, Lleyton Hewitt, and Roger Federer (of all people!) brought humor to the film. Of course we know Peter Colt and his unrealistically rude (or maybe not?) rival do not exist, but the movie still manages to make you ponder the what-ifs of such situations. That's what a good movie does.<br/><br/>I know maybe giving this film a 9 might seem a little wacky. It has it's faults. For example, the way it looks sometimes when they're playing- how they keep the points short and change camera angles frequently because the actors and actresses, despite being able to play well enough to act the part, are far from professionals.<br/><br/>It's a little predictable sometimes, but it has everything.

","I went to see this movie with my girlfriend unfortunately we weren't getting along and i had to watch this movie. I wasn't looking forward to it i mean its pure fantasy an Englishmen(which i am) winning Wimbledon and sleeping with Kirstenn Dunst PROPOSTORUS. But this film caught my heart it had very few of those cheesy romantic comedy moments even though it was very formulaic. The performances by the leads were brilliant with Paul Bettany finding his nich as the next British good guy(still very few in cinema). You know the best feature of this film through I enjoyed it immensely, my girlfriend didn't. This is one of the few very few romantic comedy's that i would ever think seeing again."

","It takes a certain degree of expertise to have a cast as previously accomplished as this and come up with such a load of inconsequential nonsense. Perhaps trying to piggy-back on the success of Love Actually, Notting Hill et al, the movie panders unashamedly to the American 'Hey, I just love your cute London Town' mentality. It can't even get this right.<br/><br/>Some of the cinematography is quite pretty, but by the end even the most thrilling Wimbledon final for years was between two players whose characters had left such little impression that I couldn't have cared who won. Oh, and keep an ear open for the whispered 'to camera' thoughts of the main character.

Paul Bettany is a good actor who is in auto-pilot and let's be honest if this film was done 10 years ago we'd be seeing bloody Hugh Grant or Colin Firth in the leading role. Kirsten Dunst is a big disappointed in this film. My positive thoughts go towards the highly talented Jon Favreau (why is he in this film!?!?!) who steals scenes as the sports agent (not as good a agent as ""Swingers"" co-star Ron Livingston is in ""Adaptation."" though!)<br/><br/>Not for the pretentious.

","I liked it as I watched it, but as it drew to its ultra-predictable conclusion, I realized just how shallow it was. Movies like this depend on the charm of their two leads, and Paul Bettany holds up his end, but Kirsten Dunst's underwritten, underperformed character as little more than ""the girl"" prevents the movie from achieving romantic magic. In fact, Kirsten Dunst is losing it for me.<br/><br/>Dunst was a wet blanket in Spider-Man 2, an ever-whiny Mary Jane who could not convincingly perform the tiny part in Broadway's Importance of Being Earnest revival. Here, there doesn't appear to be a soul to her free-spirit tennis pro. Dunst's eyes just look blank, like she's going through the motions to collect a paycheck.<br/><br/>The plot really centers around Bettany's character. He's a 30-something British tennis pro whose ranking has slipped to 118th in the world. He's decided to retire as a time when no one really notices, and he'll make Wimbledon his last tournament. While there, he starts to fall for a young American rising star.<br/><br/>We know at the beginning of every match who's going to win. We know when Bettany loses the girl, he's going to get her back. This is from the production company who brought us Love Actually, and this movie could've been the tenth subplot cut out of that movie. I heard a lot of the older people commenting on what a ""cute"" movie it was, but there's really nothing substantial here, nice as it is to see Bettany in a romantic leading-man role. Rated PG-13 for language and sexual situations."

","Writers in Hollywood still do understand the fact that one night stands are not the norm for today's society. The best comedies, romantic or otherwise, are the ones whose premise, mannerisms, or anecdotes find humor in real everyday life. I found Dunst's performance to be not very believable, but, she has a good range of emotions, which she displays well in this movie. The real star of this movie, however, is Bettany. I've found his acting to always be extraordinary. His breadth in the acting craft is almost without parallel. A Knight's Tale was the first movie to really showcase his abilities, and he has yet to falter in any vehicle after that. Still, neither of these actors can save this shortened movie. Perhaps it should not have been edited down the the result that you see on the screen."

","Wimbledon has absolutely nothing going for it. Sans Kirsten Dunst and Sam Neill it has a no-name cast, a completely ridiculous, clichéd boring plot and poorly developed characters. Trying all too hard to be in the same light as films like ""Notting Hill"", the first mistake this film makes is delivering completely implausible situations for the two leads to meet under, and a completely contrived romance that somehow stems from that. The antagonist in this film is not developed enough, nor is the lead's parents, who switch character in every scene they are in, ranging from kooky mysterious folks a little on the warped side to down and out parents pathetically trying to relive their youth through their offspring. Sam Neill starts off in the film as a bad guy, a father who refuses to allow the romance to stem between his daughter and the protagonist, to a supporting father who supports it. What stems his change of heart is never explained, nor are most of the ridiculous aspects of this movie. Boring and bland, this film should not be viewed by anyone."

","Wimbledon is the story of a pair of tennis players, 119th ranked Paul Bettany who is on the down slope of his career and young and up and coming Kirsten Dunst. Sounds like the recipe for a tennis version of A Star Is Born, but it doesn't quite work out that way.<br/><br/>Bettany has seen his better days and is picked as a wild card seed for the Wimbledon tournament the goal of every British player. The younger and faster and stronger players are getting all the media attention, players like young Ms. Dunst over in the United Kingdom with her father Sam Neill keeping a watchful eye.<br/><br/>Like Norman and Esther these two mismatched players fall in love, but this Norman Maine does not fall into dissipation. With her encouragement he forces a second wind for his career and finds himself miracle of miracles in the finals.<br/><br/>You say these things don't happen in real life, but every now and then they do as Ron Howard's Cinderella Man attests, the real life story of Jim Braddock. In tennis I remember a much past the prime Jimmy Connors winning that last major tournament before packing it in.<br/><br/>Audiences love a comeback story and Dunst and Bettany are an appealing pair."

The female lead does not seem like a real person, and is not developed well. <br/><br/>The plot is extremely contrived, predictable, and trite, with a tacked-on ending that is way too glib and phony.

","Originally intended for Hugh Grant, who I feel would be have been too old, they got Paul Bettany who was younger and in a great vein of form after ""Master and Commander"" to pay the dashing, yet faltering, Peter Colt, who had watched his younger years go by without the triumph he so wanted. Now about to retire and settle down to a life of quiet obscurity teaching tennis to middle-aged women in an exclusive tennis club. However, wanting one last Hurrah, he decides to enter Wimbledon as a wild card, and after a pleasant encounter with Lizzie Bradbury in a shower (Lordy, Kirsten looks good naked) he starts to regain some of the form that he hasn't seen for some time.<br/><br/>This is a surprisingly entertaining film that is notable for its two charming lead performances by Paul Bettany, who is great in the lead and plays the role of the dwindling tennis hopeful to perfection, and Kirsten Dunst as the up-and-coming tennis star with all her life before her. The script is far better than many would give it credit for with some really touching stuff about the ageing process, and both the cruelty and the joy of it, which for many people, will be something that they will be too young, or too old, to understand.<br/><br/>The direction is handled ably by Richard Loncraine who manages to blend both the romance and the comedy with equal aplomb creating a delightful mix that works well. Good Sunday afternoon fare for anyone who understands what life is about and how to grab onto the good things while they are still there."
"bob the moo","Null","1","3","12 July 2007"," Probably only of interest to die hard fans of modern British romantic comedies
","It has been many a year since Peter Colt was at the height of his powers. Now though he enters Wimbledon ranked 119th in the world and even the British public have given up cheering him. Deciding to retire out of the professional game after this tournament, Peter heads to London with hopes to go out with some dignity and maybe even get some column inches. On arrival though he stumbles into the room of American pro Lizzie Bradbury while she is in the shower. After some brief flirting they meet up later and continue, having fun before finding themselves in something more serious  but how will it affect their respective tournaments.<br/><br/>Screened for the first time on UK terrestrial television during the 2007 Wimbledon tournament this romantic comedy had an element of the same easy scheduling that brought it to UK cinemas. In a way it is this sense of rather obvious convenience that pervades the whole affair because it is a bit like the writers have extracted elements of other British comedies and just rolled them into the British event of Wimbledon to top it all off. This painting-by-numbers approach does of course generate a reasonably OK film  just not one that really ever marks itself out as anything special. The plot sees a fairly unconvincing love affair being put as the base of a story that features a slightly more interesting (but no less predictable) rise of an Englishman making his way through the Wimbledon tournament. It pushes all the easy buttons and did produce a bit of interest for me and also the odd chuckle but nothing more than that.<br/><br/>The main problem for me was the fact that I never gave a toss about the central relationship  not even once. The script is one reason for this but really one has to ask why Kristen Dunst thought that it was acceptable for someone of her fame to churn out a performance that any giggling starlet would be capable of. She is all surface and she gives nothing that suggests she is playing a real person  suffice to say she has no chemistry with Bettany. Which is a real shame because Bettany is actually pretty good and brings a lot of charisma and charm to the lead role. He makes his parts of the film interesting and I quite liked him as the leading man in this sort of thing. The support cast are mostly pointless, with Lindsay, Neill, McAvoy, Favreau and others just adding name value without actually having a lot to contribute as actors, although McEnroe was a good touch.<br/><br/>Overall then a fairly obvious romantic comedy that doesn't offer much more than what you'd expect if you washed all the colour out of some of the better ones. Bettany's charisma does lift proceedings somewhat but there is little he can do with a poor script as his foundation and a smiley giggly sock showgirl as a co-star. One for genre fans only here."

Girl falls for guy her father doesn't really approve of. They separate but get together in the end. And this is not a comedy. I thought it would have a few laughs, but it doesn't. Also, I thought Paul Bettany was way too old for Kristen Dunst. So, I didn't care for them as a couple.

Paul Bettany actually wasn't bad, but he was down two sets from the start with this disappointing movie.<br/><br/>John McEnroe and Chris Evert were laughable--I've never heard such terrible, unrealistic tennis commentary from anyone (including them); we'd have been better served if they'd been played by actors (and whoever wrote their lines should be fined, if not banned from the game).

","For the longest time, I was interested in seeing this. But when I finally got around to watching it, I could not have been more bored with what I saw. This was absolutely a by-the-book romantic comedy, and to the point that there is entirely no chemistry and no real substance. It is as though the characters know what should happen each and every point along the way and that, aware the things will end in that she-loves-me, she-loves-me-not, way, react accordingly to their predetermined outcomes. Right down to the very end with children, winning future tennis competitions (twice), and living happily ever after. Can't Hollywood come up with anything creative anymore? This seems to fit the allotted roles of almost any mainstream romantic comedy to be released in the last five years at least. The same thing gets played out again and again and again. Although, here, it could not be done with less soul and charisma.<br/><br/>The story is that of Paul Bettany as a mildly ranked tennis player who is competing in Wimbeldon in what he expects to be his last game. He is an aging player and, as said before, not a particularly highly rated one. He doesn't quite have the emotional support, either, I suppose, what with his kooky family (think of his brother as the John Rhys Meyers type of Notting Hill--comedic relief, but a bit less vulgar) and his absentee agent. But, lo! He meets the rather forward American women's champ (Kirsten Dunst) who gets him to loosen up and of course, they fall in love, much to the chagrin of her overbearing typical sports parent (Sam Neil struggling with an American accent) who wants her to avoid distractions in concentration (think John Mahoney in Say Anything, but without such a miserable finale). And yada, yada, yada, you can probably guess from beginning to end how the movie will ensue.<br/><br/>I am not so elitist when it comes to romantic comedies, enjoying some of what might be consider the more cheesier ones from time to time. But this movie plays out so entirely by-the-book, that it lacks an flavor that might keep someone entertained."
"playingkarrde","Null","1","4","9 December 2004"," Another waste of time rom-com
","""From the makers of Notting Hill Four Weddings"" comes the tag line strapped onto the trailers for this film, but in all honesty, who is that? Maybe the producers? Last time I checked it was not producers that made a film good.<br/><br/>And this is evident here. Richard Curtis, the real creator of aforementioned rom-coms is nowhere to be seen and we are left with a director and two stars who are self proclaimed to have never played or followed tennis before making this movie. I really feel for Pat Cash that had to act as technical expert on this picture.<br/><br/>Frankly, I won't go into the story as its as dry and lifeless as any other waste of time romantic comedy. The writing is witless and the storyline predictable and characters moronic with no depth at all (save a few fleeting moments from the brilliant Bernard Hill). <br/><br/>Being a tennis fan though I wanted to watch this as we are not treated to many films centered on our sport. Luckily, the action on court was well produced (thanking the producers? Ahem) and the film boasted some nice visual effects. It was not plainly obvious that every tennis ball hit was CG. To any tennis fan or fan of Wimbledon it was obvious that the directors and stars of the movie were not tennis fans. Many glaring inconsistencies with Wimbledon... but I guess this could be overlooked as the film is just a romantic comedy. Clearly written for an American audience (American TV station on a UK TV? Come on...) at least we managed to get the film set in Wimbledon rather than the US Open. <br/><br/>There is little good to say about any of the actors save Hill, although Bettany does a good job holding his first leading role. No good writing to work with and an even worse co-star (its like she isn't even trying anymore - just another pay cheque until the next Spider-Man film?) but he is convincing for his part. There were some nice allusions to Hen-Mania which was good and I liked having David Mercer on the commentary early on. It's a shame McEnroe's wooden performance took over later - but again, obviously written for an American audience (I love you really Mac!).<br/><br/>Overall if you are a tennis fan then its probably worth watching for the nice oncourt action. If you are a fan of romantic comedies then you can find better out there. Don't expect the film to hold up to the ""Bridget Jones/Notting Hill/Four Weddings"" mantle that the advertisers would have you believe and you may waste a couple of hours while waiting for something better. It's light, its... fun, and its predictable. Not great, pretty bad, but there is worse out there."

","Wimbledon can mostly be looked at as a combination of all the other movies that, with failing plots and dry sports story lines, have come and gone before. Think 'Notting Hill' meets 'The Mighty Ducks' and you've, somewhat, got Wimbledon (with the exception that Wimbledon is a tennis movie rather than a hockey movie). <br/><br/>The story starts off with Peter Colt (Paul Bettany), a once popular tennis player who has now dropped his rank down to 119th. Peter is attending his last Wimbledon before he retires, but the odds of winning don't look too good for him. Struggling to keep up with the competition, Peter is in desperate need of a miracle. Luckily one arrives  Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst), a thriving women's tennis player who is at the top of her game. The two meet when Peter accidentally stumbles into Lizzie's hotel room while she is in the shower. Surprise, surprise it was love at first sight for Peter. The two begin to secretly engage in a romance, which have some advantages and disadvantages. Peter is suddenly rocketing to the top of the tennis world again, while Lizzie is left in the dust. Her once competitive personality and unstoppable skills are now lessening and leaving her helpless on the court. When the secret gets out about Lizzie and Peter, Lizzie's father, Dennis Bradbury (Same Neill), is furious. Lizzie must make a decision between two loves: the guy or the game. <br/><br/>Actor Paul Bettany can mostly be noted for his performances in movies such as Master and Commander, A Knight's Tale, and A Beautiful Mind. His character in Wimbledon differs greatly from the others he's played in that in this film, he gets to play the heartthrob. Kirsten Dunst is probably best known for the motion pictures she's played in, like Bring It On and Spiderman 1 & 2. Like Bettany, the character she portrays is much different from those in previous movies. In Wimbledon, Dunst gets to be a little more 'grown up' than before. <br/><br/>The two actors made a charming couple in this film, but the movie itself left much to desire. It's plot was somewhat unrealistic, and moved slow at times. It had the typical plot of a sappy love movie and you already knew in the first five minutes how it was going to end. 'Guy meets girl, guy falls for girl, some conflict occurs to keep the two apart, but they come together and live happily ever after. The End.' I will say that they did do a good job of staying partly focused on tennis and didn't forget that the title of the movie is the name of a tennis tournament, and not 'Here's Another One of Those Movies That You Can't Seem to Get Away From!' I like the fact that Dunst gets to play an older, more adult woman rather than her normal movie roles. Also, the movie itself had comic relief throughout it, which kept me somewhat interested. <br/><br/>Wimbledon is one of those movies where if you like impractical plots and happy endings or if you're just a tennis fan, it's right up your alley. I give this movie a rating of three out of five stars."

A Brit wins Wimbledon? Oh puleeze! Unfortunately it's on the night we lost to Germany in the World Cup, which doesn't help. <br/><br/>This is one of those Britflicks whose production values are designed to appeal to American audiences in the feeble hope that the film will make some money. This rarely comes off. We are a hard hearted unpleasant cynical race who ought to leave schmaltzy sentimentality to the Americans who are expert in it. British films made for British tastes occasionally strike it lucky over there, but in a completely unpredictable fashion. I have no idea whether this one did, but I doubt it.<br/><br/>Look at the storyline involving the little ballboy hit on the head. Our Hero shows him a little care and tenderness. How unbritish! In a true Britflick nobody would have cared if he'd been carried off stone dead.<br/><br/>This film, like so many we make, falls quite expertly between two stools.

Best known for her role as Spiderman's girlfriend, Ms Dunst is just not sexy enough for film. She is not all that good looking, either. Chris Evert is FAR sexier, and MUCH better looking. And why was Mr. McEnroe so calm; that's not his real personality. The real problem with the film was trying to find a Brit to play a Wimbledon finalist. There hasn't been one since Fred Perry in the 1930s lol. This was an unintentionally funny film with Dunst playing a Chris Evert wannabe, and Mr. Neill playing her father. Mr. Neill is better off going back to Jurassic Park; this role is not for him. I always thought The All-American, starring Tony Curtis was the worst sports film ever made, but at least Tony had talent for other films and looked like a pretty good touch football player. Dunst couldn't beat Ms. Evert's father in Fort Lauderdale. If she could act, we could overlook her poor tennis, but her acting is weaker than her serve. Thank God for fast forward."

","""Wimbledon"" is a charming little rom-com that relies more on the actual sport than it does on the romance; maybe that wasn't a bad thing, as the sport of tennis and the grandeur of the Wimbledon grand slam tournament get thrust into the limelight and received some extra exposure via Hollywood. <br/><br/>Paul Bettany shows off some super acting talent playing the roll of a posh pro tennis player who is coming towards the end of his career and has dropped to 119 in the world rankings.<br/><br/>On the other end of the spectrum we have Kirsten Dunst who's character is just starting out in her career, a girl with big ambitions who has already set her sights on winning Wimbledon, with help from her overbearing father who also manages her career. <br/><br/>Sadly the two young leads don't particularly share a vast amount of on screen chemistry and watching them share the screen together felt a little awkward, in a romance film the couple have to appear to really be in love with each other and the viewer shouldn't have to suspend their belief, sadly in ""Wimbledon"" this wasn't the case. <br/><br/>The vast majority of supporting characters seemed to be critically misplaced, none more so than the cameo appearance by British sitcom star, Robert Lindsey, for the life of me I cannot understand why he was cast in this film. <br/><br/>The one stand out supporting star was Pete's (Paul Bettany) younger brother Carl, played by a young James McAvoy, his on-screen time was minimal but he added some much needed comic relief, such as the scenes in the bookies when he insists on always betting against his brother in his matches. <br/><br/>Not a great film by any means but completely inoffensive nevertheless, a decent enough film to watch if you're bored and happen to come across it on TV, Netflix etc"

","Before I traduce this film, ~ I have to point out how much I admire the cast of great actors. Betany gives a flawless performance, as usual, but is working with an awfully outdated attack on the class system, which Mr. Allen has no real conception of being one of the elite and not a native of the British Isles. The premise of a society riven, and divided by class runs along clankingly throughout. <br/><br/>After the killings in the film, it meanders on aimlessly until, trying to seek some resolution, Allen comes up with: horror of horrors the corpses of the dead materialise like some Homeric decent into the underworld. Maybe Allen might have succeeded had he followed Homer's lead and made Betany descend like a mystic elevator into Hades, but no. Sadly the dead materialise in the Kitchen illuminated by the open fridge.<br/><br/>The wait for this resolution was not worthwhile, and to save myself embarrassment I had had to leave the cinema.<br/><br/>Has Woody Allen lost the plot?

The main story could've probably been dealt with in a much more effective manner in almost half the time (I know this is not how the movie industry works but a girl can dream...) At its core, this film is a textbook rom-com disguised as a tennis flick to try and fool you into thinking you're seeing something new.<br/><br/>Another reason I wasn't a fan was Kirsten Dunst. She was predictable and lacked something I couldn't quite put my finger on. I do like some Paul Bettany, so I felt obliged to be happy with his performance, but their match seemed odd, even though the chemistry worked for the most part. What made it worse was the blatant disregard for the amazing array of supporting characters, who were used for plot exposition rather than interest.

","I'm a dude, but I can genuinely appreciate ""chick flicks""...if they have some originality and/or creativity. Wimbledon is predictable and really doesn't veer off the path of this type of drama. The plot is shallow & the characters are one dimensional. I never really believed Kirsten Dunst's character really wanted Paul Bettany's. I felt like a possible redeeming quality (especially for a guy) could be the competition & action of the tennis matches, but I felt like the entire idea of Wimbledon & tennis was very secondary to the love story they were trying to tell.

"fedor8","Null","0","4","16 February 2008"," CGI tennis is exactly what the world needed.
","I know it's just a dumb, predictable, formulaic romantic comedy, but I feel the urge to nitpick at the tennis aspects nevertheless: <br/><br/>1. The extremely nerd-looking, X-legged Bettany wins the match in the 3rd round and then plays... in the quarterfinals! Whatever happened to the 4th round? Did he get a bye for being English? There is a 128-person draw in every Grand Slam tournament, not a 64 one, hence seven matches to play. Is it too much to ask to have the barest minimum of realism in a Hollywood movie?...<br/><br/>2. Bettany plays his semi-finale match on some crappy side-court. This NEVER happens, not even when it rains for days - especially not when a local player is in the semis! <br/><br/>3. The men's semi-finale match was played around the same time as Dunst's semi-finale. This also cannot happen - unless it rains for days. Yet there was no rain.<br/><br/>4. After Bettany predictably wins his semi-finale match, he goes to the locker room and finds a dozen male tennis pros there. What exactly are they all doing there at such a late stage in the tournament? After all, it's not the 1st round anymore. Apart from the singles, there are only the men's doubles and the odd guy playing mixed. Bettany should have found himself almost alone in the changing room, or at the most surrounded by agents, masseurs and organizers, not other players.<br/><br/>5. Dunst supposedly plays her first Wimbledon. That would make her 16 or 17. Dunst cannot pass off as that young. I can't remember the last time a female player debuted as late as this 20+ Dunst they gave us. Or are they implying she's 17? That would make her underage, putting Bettany in a bit of a spot. All top female talents play their first slams as early as when they're 16 or 17, some even earlier. There is no such thing as a super-talented U.S. gal reaching the semifinales on her first try - at the age of 20+.<br/><br/>6. CGI rallies do not in any way reflect what actually happens on a real tennis court. The second match point in the finale is like a CGI Star Wars version of tennis: utterly laughable. Yet another point, in the same match, was supposed to have a successful lob, but the ball wasn't high enough to lob a midget in a wheelchair, let alone a 6-foot pro; nevertheless, Bettany just apathetically watches it fly by him, doing nothing to smash it into the opponent's half. I understand the need to make the film exciting, but creating cyber-space-like tennis rallies is not the way to go - unless you think that only morons watch your movies.<br/><br/>7. Any pro veteran who needs a teenage Lolita to give him tips on how to attack/read a player's serve has to be an idiot.<br/><br/>And, finally...<br/><br/>8. LOVE does not win you grand slam finales.<br/><br/>9. Google ""vjetropev 100 prettiest"".<br/><br/>Halfway through this mediocre turkey I was thinking: ""it can't be THAT cheesy... he's not actually going to win the title...?"" But yes: the movie IS that predictable - and that corny. The washed up 30something player, whom everyone forgot about, falls in lurve with a U.S. Lolita, and this inspires him to go all the way.<br/><br/>Sam Neill's U.S. accent is in shambles.<br/><br/>There is not enough chemistry between Dunst and Bettany. Tommy Haas, who was mentioned at one point, should have been cast. He is far better-looking than Bettany and they wouldn't have needed to cover up for Bettany's crappy technique by CGI-ing all of his shots. Plus: anyone can act."

","""Wimbeldon"" is a not very good movie about Pete (Paul Bettany), a battler on the mens tennis circuit who comes across women's champ Lizzy (Kirsten Dunst, in her finest role since ""Spiderman 2""). They form an immediate spark after a chance meeting at Wimbeldon (I think this is where they got the name of the movie from) and soon begin to fall in love. The relationship does wonders for Pete's game, but messes with Lizzy's. Lizzy's dad (played by Sam Neill) soon interferes and things get tricky.<br/><br/>Their story plays out kinda how you'd expect, but there's a few other annoying story lines that get thrown in that complicate things.

"johnnyboyz","6","0","2","13 July 2007"," Serves up a nice love story in a very believable environment; just don't watch it for its Tennis.
","The film Wimbledon does something that, in a way, is rather underhand: it combines sport with romance in order to branch it out amongst targeted audience  in this case, the sport is Tennis. True, a few years ago I wouldn't have touched a 'rom-com' with a barge pole but I've come to respect them a little more what with seeing the one that started it all off (Four Weddings and a Funeral) and really liking it.<br/><br/>Although I don't play Tennis, I'm still rather fond of it so I was always going to give this a go as sport as a film genre fascinates me  just to see how they do it and what route they actually take. The situation surrounding watching Wimbledon was rather similar to when I watched Tin Cup a few summers ago; romance mixed with a sport: Golf, something I do actually play and, deep down, love. However, unlike Tin Cup or most other sporting films; this is named after an actual location; an actual sporting event  it would've been a very different film had Tin Cup been entitled 'U.S. Open' and the reasons are evident in this film.<br/><br/>Wimbledon is, on the surface; a film with very impressive cinematography, funny and quirky character development as well as staying as real as possible off the court even though on it, it falls short. The film makes good use of its location and the ground scenes of Wimbledon really do put you there as the characters mingle with one another, take time out in locker rooms and practice on the practice courts. The film also moves along at what first appears to be a pleasant pace but soon feels like it has descended into such a 'lets just rush to the good stuff when they're together', you just don't notice the chance encounters that build up. Once the two leads are together, they then turn into such a celebrity couple the film quickly begins to rely on certain things like the two running away from photographers whilst laughing and joking to act as its humour. Suddenly, the 'getting to know you' script routine which was actually funny at times has been made redundant and we're having farce presented to us to act as the comedy. The couple even have time to drive down to the coast during the championships; a scene that tries to create some sort of a bond between the two as they play a game of 'air' Tennis.<br/><br/>So, off the court things are a little up and down which is one thing. On the court, things fall a little flat and that's being nice since there isn't much there to fall flat in the first place. The matches are very short, edited in a horrid way and commentated on like they don't even matter. The film goes out of its way to make everything perfect in a frustratingly bad way. The protagonist's father manages to pick up his sons first round match on an old, black and white TV in a tree house  I doubt if I could pick up a first round match between two unseeded players on my freeview digital TV box and I doubt John McEnroe of all people would be commentating on it. What's more, the continuity completely goes to pot at various times; the fact Peter (Bettany) actually skips a round en route during his Wimbledon run is shocking enough but would a Wimbledon semi-final really be played on court number 2? It's things like this that make me wonder if it was done deliberately or not in order to suspend reality. A Brit other than Tim Henman or Andrew Murray doing well at Wimbledon? Really!? Twinned with this, the matches in most of the rounds are so short; you need not show them. You only catch a glimpse of one shot in his opening match. All this build up and then one shot  a backhand winner in the first set, wow; that's exciting. If they'd had the characters talk, read and hear about Peter's matches instead of showing them to us, maybe it would've worked better and the final would've seemed more epic  ""Ok, a Tennis match and it's the final: here we go."" <br/><br/>Although Wimbledon isn't a bad film; you get the feeling it's not really trying to be a good one. The love story is sweet and there are lots to get a hardcore Tennis fan excited but it lets itself down with nasty, fake CGI Tennis matches consisting of one or two shots and that bouncy, sarcastic, 'all is not lost' aura that it carries, especially towards the end."

","The charm of Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst keeps this from being a total waste. The movie blends two well known stories, the old pro who has one last chance to show what he is made of and two lovers who are too busy with their lives to identify their love for each other. Neither story is completely successful and neither brings enough new to the formulas to make this movie very memorable. Paul Bettany, who was so good as Russell Crowe's boozy roommate in A Beautiful Mind, makes a great leading man in that British way. He doesn't look much like a tennis player, but it doesn't matter. You could say the same thing about Kirsten Dunst, but she is such a joy to watch, that it isn't important. They may not look like it, but their scenes together are the better part of the movie. The movie, like Peter's early career, is full of unfulfilled promise."

She didn't complain about his love making. Plus, it was very romantic and Shakespearean of Peter to climb up to her bedroom window, just to be close to her.  Peter never tells Lizzie that he is risking seeing her, against her father's wishes. He should let her know of his pursuits regardless. She needs to know his tenacious heroism.  Peter/Paul  what's up with your goofy tennis playing? Wimbledon or the local park? It's doesn't do justice to Wimbledon or this story-line. That two handed back hand was too much  silliness. Do actors ever review, edit, or proof-view their films? Would you really o.k. that? Anywhoserville, you starred in this film. That says something about something. Finally  Strong Links  Peter's apology scene was almost surreal sweet. It was strangely romantic.  This story and cinematography meant well, despite surrounding underutilized or underdeveloped characters  Peter may not have been a pro, but he had a nice sense of consistent focus and energy, both in tennis and courtship. Very nice, smooth, reasonable, controlled but still very natural, playful (in courtship)  more is even better. Way to go.  Peter really wanted to court Lizzie in a romantic sweetheart traditional sense that all to easily gets lost, neglected, ignored or forgotten in today's dating world. But in this film all of these good intentions were established, particularly by Peter. Kudos to you Mr. Bettany. Despite a not even fair script, your acting still captivated our attention. It is one of your consistent attributes in acting, which I have seen. Thank you.  Kirsten? I think that you do really well with Toby McGuire. I would stick with what works woman.

Bettany's character made the quarters after 3 matches. in reality it takes 4. and never in the history of ANY grand slam would they play the mens and womens semis at the same time, and on lowly outside courts. even if we ignore the hugely fanciful notion of an Englishman playing good enough to make it through to a grand slam final one cannot ignore the fact that it would cause hysteria amongst the success starved English sporting public. what could have been a good sporting romance turned into a frustrating viewing experience for any tennis fan."

","I saw this once before, and obviously couldn't have been paying the fullest attention, because when I watched it again I had no memory of what I saw, only the two lead stars in it, from director Richard Loncraine (Richard III, Firewall). Basically Peter Colt (Paul Bettany) is a professional English tennis player, but over the years has gone down from a good place in rank, and knowing he is getting old and losing his ambition plans to quit after one more Wimbledon. Then he meets American rising female tennis player Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst), and slowly of course he is falling for her, and while she finds him interesting he gets a boost for his tennis playing again. Lizzie herself plays great games and wins easily, and during the Wimbledon tournament she and Peter begin their love affair, to the disapproval of Lizzie's tennis coach father Dennis (Sam Neill), but to the interest of Peter's parents Edward (Bernard Hill) and Augusta (Eleanor Bron) and brother Carl (James McAvoy). There is the point when they break apart for personal reasons, Lizzie does intend to go back to America and drop out of the game, but then sees Peter declare his love for her during a television interview. Peter has managed to get to the final round of Wimbledon, having had his luck in the game change dramatically since his love affair, and Lizzie arrives just in time to see him win in the end, and they embrace their feelings for each other. Also starring Robert Lindsay as Ian Frazier, Celia Imrie as Lydice Kenwood, Penny Ryder as Sylvia Littlejohn, Annabel Leventon as Pauline Rossdale, Jon Favreau as Ron Roth, John McEnroe, Danny Baker as Radio London DJ and Chris Moyles as Radio 1 DJ.

","Bettany is a charming actor and that's what raises Wimbledon a notch higher than it should be. You like Peter Colt and root for him. The movie does do a good job of showing us what it's like to be a part of a major tournament. The atmosphere is there. Bettany and Dunst obviously worked hard to learn tennis skills but, apart from their serves, they don't perform realistically on court. Bettany wouldn't beat many amateurs with such wristy shots and sloppy footwork. There's a fluidity that simply can't be re-created by non players and I think the action scenes would have worked better with quicker cuts instead of following Bettany's awkward attempts at chasing the ball. I do take issue with a previous poster who said Dunst wasn't attractive enough and didn't look like a tennis player. She's gorgeous and has the slender frame that you see on many of the current pros. A player with Dunst's looks would be right up there with Sharapova in terms of popularity. She also has a nice chemistry with Bettany. The romance is predictable but you do want them to get together. Wimbledon has popped up several times on the dish and I've found myself watching parts of it more than once. I guess it got more than a few things right."

","""Wimbleton"" is the kind of movie that fails to impress if one is familiar with the romantic comedy genre. The plot itself is so-so: A retiring professional tennis player who has lost his zeal finds his love of the game re-inspired by a top female tennis player during his final tournament. Add in the typical romantic comedy quirks - sassy lead female, charming lead male, quirky sidekicks, somehow deficient male rival, contrived embarrassments, a final conflict between lovers that ends in a reunion - and we've all seen this movie before we've even seen it. One could argue that the script writers weren't setting out to write Shakespeare, but would it be so bad to be a little original? <br/><br/>Paul Bettany is wonderful as the disheartened Peter Colt. His role doesn't really require much range, but Paul's performance exceeds what is written on script. It's not enough to cover for the mediocre script, but it's better than nothing. Kirsten Dunst's Lizzie Bradbury is written similarly one-dimensional, although her performance adds enough obnoxiousness to keep us from wishing for more. While supposedly charming and charismatic, Kirsten comes off as childish and annoying. True, the zeal of children can be quite inspiring, but it doesn't quite work out when that zeal is coming from the love interest. It really highlights the age difference between Paul and Kirsten. I don't think we are intended to think of Peter as a cradle robber throughout the film, but that is the end result. While Peter seems to be a late 20s/early 30s man, Lizzie seems like a 16 year old girl. What's especially disheartening is that Kirsten appears to play the same character again in ""Elizabethtown.""<br/><br/>The supporting cast is well cast and work well with the leads. I suppose this is a silly argument due to the plot of the film, but I found the tennis matches boring. Paul's voice-overs seem more of a hindrance than anything else - I'm not sure what it is about them, but I could have done without. Overall, this is nothing to rush out and see."

","Wimbledon is an enjoyable piece of fluff but it does very little to try to distinguish itself from the other films in the same genre. In this romantic sports comedy, Paul Bettany plays Peter Colt, a tennis player whose bad luck changes when he scores a wild card entry into the Wimbledon tournament. There he meets and falls in love with American tennis star Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst), but can his luck hold out for much longer? The plot sounds stupid but the two leads really help make this film more watch able. Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst have enough chemistry between them to make you care about the film more while your watching it. They make the film enjoyable to watch and have some funny scenes together as well. The only problem I had with them was their age. Peter is 31 but Lizzie's age is never revealed. The relationship seemed kind of wrong since she could have been 18 or something. The rest of the cast all give good performances as well and my favorite supporting character was James McAvoy, who played Peter's brother. Richard Loncraine directs and does a decent job but doesn't really try anything new either. There is really nothing wrong with this film as its executed well. Its just a film we have all seen before and we have seen it done better. This film is very by-the-numbers and its hard not to see where its going. Its not that long though as its only 98 minutes long so its not too much of a punishment to watch. If you don't like tennis then avoid this film as it will most likely bore you to tears. If you do enjoy tennis then this film might be worth checking out. I do enjoy playing tennis but I don't really watch it. Luckily, the tennis matches in this film are exciting to watch. In the end, this film isn't horrible but it really isn't very memorable either so if you enjoy tennis and your in the mood for a piece of harmless fluff then rent this film, If you don't, then its better if you just skip this film. Rating 7/10"
"mark-williams-2","4","0","1","15 May 2005"," OK, but not original and not meant for this cast
","I'd seen various interviews with the cast members of this film over the course of the last year or so and was well aware of the filming that had taken place whilst the real ""Wimbledon"" was taking place - so it was really interesting to see how they had managed to successfully edit the film together.<br/><br/>Overall the film is ""OK"" and nothing more. Yep, it's a romantic comedy, but you probably knew that already. It was clearly written for Hugh Grant to play the lead role - this does not take away from the acting abilities of Paul Bettany - he did a fine job, but the words ""Bugger"" and ""Damn"" are now synonymous with Hugh Grant and British movies - and they were all over this film - in the right places.<br/><br/>There are some great editorial gaffs in here as well - watch out for ""Peter"" throwing a cushion at his Brother!"

","""Wimbledon"" was a film that disappeared quickly from the local theaters. When we attempted to see it, alas, it had already gone. This comedy, directed by Richard Loncraine, is of special interest for those tennis fans that haven't had the opportunity to watch the sport at its best and brilliantly photographed. The movie is also a romantic view at the people that headline those tournaments.<br/><br/>Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst are excellent as the couple one sees at the center of the story. Mr. Bettany is an actor that is always a pleasure to watch in anything he does. Peter Colt,as played by Mr. Bettany, is the has been tennis player facing an uncertain future of working as a pro in local country clubs, to make a living. He is at the end of his best years, and he knows it. In fact, he is constantly reminded about his number in the tennis ranking that he has to clarify for everyone.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst makes a great contribution to the film as Lizzie Bradbury, an up and coming American sensation. She falls for Peter, even though he is not in her same league. The sunny Ms. Dunst is an absolute delight in the film. This actress is always a welcome sight in anything she does.<br/><br/>In the minor roles one sees Sam Neill, who doesn't have much to do playing Lizzie's father. Jon Favreau, is Peter's agent who returns his attention as Peter's fame begins to shine again. Bernard Hill and Eleonor Bron play Peter's parents.<br/><br/>The star of the film though, is the magnificent spectacle of Wimbledon, the best venue for tennis in the whole world. We see the excitement of the competition that Mr. Loncraine has created for all people that love tennis to enjoy."

","Extremely slow. Boring. Dull. It's on as I write this and I can't stand to keep my attention on it. I've paused it to reorganize files on my computer in the other room. I've been surfing the Net and posting on a message board. I've been writing a story.<br/><br/>The lead character is the male lead, not Dunst. He is boring and self-pitying. I don't even want Peter to win because he's too much of a whiner. Unfortunately, it is his self-pitying drone that narrates a too large portion of this film. Narration is considered the tool of the bad script and it lives up to that expectation in this film. Not enough showing and too much telling.<br/><br/>Dunst's character is not someone I enjoy very much - which goes to show what good actress she is, because I usually adore her charisma.<br/><br/>The ancillary characters of Peter's family are annoying and pointless. They just distract from the painfully slow story. Even Jon F. who I usually love is annoying and out of place. I liked Peter's practice partner better than Peter, but he did not have enough screen time. He would have been a better male lead.<br/><br/>If this movie had heart it might fall in line with all of those other underdog sports movies (Cutting Edge, Rocky, Dodgeball (it was better than this!), etc.). But it had no heart. The characters were caricatures. Stiff acting. Meandering direction. Disjointed scenes. The lighting seemed off. Hazy plot. A waste of a cast. Don't bother.<br/><br/>The views of London were the best part of the film, fortunately I LOVE London."
"cdy-2","3","0","1","5 March 2005"," Possibly the Worst Rom-Com Ever
","Committee-written piece of schlock. Any actual live tennis match from the real Wimbledon Championship has far more drama, heart, and tension than this piece of pointless, poorly executed drivel. About all you can say about it, is that it's pretty. Pretty stars, pretty locations, pretty homes, pretty hotel rooms. As a travelogue for London, it's not bad. As a piece of story-telling it is absolute crap.<br/><br/>Working Title normally excels at this genre, but maybe I'm thinking specifically of Richard Curtis who doesn't appear to have had anything to do with this film. Paul Bettany does a credible job as the slightly over the hill tennis player who finds love with Kirsten Dunst. Dunst gives a cardboard cutout performance of a cardboard cutout character. Bettany's parents, played by Bernard Hill and Eleanor Bron are the brightest spots in an otherwise dismal cast, but even they just do the best they can with the stock characters they've been given."
"TxMike","Null","0","2","22 February 2005"," ""In tennis, 'love' means zero. When you 'love' you lose."" (Lizzy)
","Kirsten Dunst as American bad girl tennis pro Lizzie Bradbury and Paul Bettany as aging British tennis pro Peter Colt make this movie fun to watch, although in fairness it is quite a simple little romantic movie. In my mind I compare it to another American/Brit romantic comedy, ""Notting Hill"", and 'Wimbledon"" is not even in the same class in charm and wit. My wife and I enjoyed it, with fairly well done tennis matches, but is best rated at about '5' or '6' of 10.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. Peter had already decided to retire from competitive tennis, and take a job as the club pro at a club for the rich and pampered. He once had been rated as high as 11 in 1996, but now was 119, and really had no hope at Wimbledon, which he entered as a wild card. He wasn't even the best British pro there, and this was to be his last tournament. Quite by accident, given the wrong room key at the hotel, he meets Lizzy when he finds her in the shower of the hotel room. A romantic encounter later and Peter finds that Lizzie has become his tennis 'muse.' With her in the stands, and in his mind, he plays better than he had in a long time. He wins matches and, with the help of an injured opponent, makes it to the Wimbledon final.<br/><br/>He is losing the final badly when heavy rain delays the match. Aborting her trip back to the States after losing her match, she shows up in Peter's locker room, encourages him, and casually tells him how to ""read"" his opponent's serve. Long story short, he wins Wimbledon. After he hugs his family in the stands, he finds Lizzy. The movie ends with a cut to a future time in New York, they have children, Peter coaches tennis, and Lizzie won both the US Open and Wimbledon before she retired. <br/><br/>The DVD has a few interesting extras, the best showing how they filmed the tennis matches without a ball in play, and digitally added the ball in post production, a necessity to get realistic tennis action."
"b1gtete","5","0","1","12 February 2005"," More comedy less romance
","Upon renting this movie, I thought it was going to be in the nature of your prototypical cleverly crafted Hugh Grant esquire English romantic comedy. Instead I was treated too much tennis, a complete and utter lack of what seemed to be anything funny, and a romance that seemed to blossom faster than a speeding bullet. I gave this movie a 5 simply because I'm a sucker for the old underdog sports movies, but please when somethings called a romantic comedy, could we please get a little more comedy? Not to mention I thought they did a horrible job of making us feel anything for Kirsten Dunst character. She to me at least seemed like the typical stuck up sexy young athlete who likes too have way too much fun. I enjoyed the male lead, but I still didn't find his story all that compelling. It all just seemed to come a little too easy and of course they went with the overloaded mega happy ending."
"drclark","8","0","1","11 February 2005"," One bad performance lets down otherwise good movie
","Kirsten Dunst is not a tennis player. She does not look or play like one, and most important she didn't act like one.<br/><br/>Sports movies ride and fall on the credibility of the sports reenactments. Why? Because most of the people who will see the film are going to be fans of the sport. Its tough, but its true.<br/><br/>Paul Bettany is not a tennis player, but he plays one well on the big screen.<br/><br/>There is one other problem, there is no real chemistry between Dunst and Bettany. It is hard to watch a romantic comedy when the romance is somewhat unbelievable. What is interesting is that the relationship starts as one predicated purely on lust. I believed that.<br/><br/>Bettany saves this film. He is self-deprecating, charming and funny. I believed his character - tired, no self-confidence, war-weary. Sam Neill, great as always - he is Australian, playing an American, in Britain. Odd, but vaguely believable.<br/><br/>What is interesting about this movie is that it reminds that in sports anything is possible - Greece winning the European championships, Boston winning the World Series, Seabiscuit beating War Admiral.<br/><br/>At its heart, this movie succeeds in this tradition admirably. If only they had recast Kirsten Dunst."
"actionlad","7","0","1","7 February 2005"," Much better than it appeared to be at first...
","When I first saw the commercials for this film, I thought, ""ahhhh, a film that is going to try and get me interested in tennis (kind of like another Dunst film ""Bring it On"" trying to get me interested in cheer leading). What is this some tennis coach is falling for his tennis pro pupil?"" Boy, did I misjudge this one.<br/><br/>Instead, it explores themes that I think anyone whose ever been serious about a competitive sport has gone through to one degree or another. Peter Colt (Bettany) is a former tennis superstar whose considered the possibility of giving up the sport altogether and taking a job at a local tennis club teaching horny old ladies how to improve their game. That's until he meets Lizzie Bradbury (Dunst) and something begins to happen inside him that seems to translate to his performance on the court.<br/><br/>I ended up liking this film more than I thought I would because the script crafts very likable characters that you as the viewer want to care about. I really liked that you didn't even have to play tennis to know what was going on. Sometimes sports movies get to into the scoring of the game or how its played and you start to feel for the characters involved. I also like an internal dialogue Colt had going on while he was trying to play. Thoughts of frustration and disappointment keeping going through his mind throughout many of the scenes and it actually works. Sometimes directors try to intercut these kinds of things throughout a film and they seem more annoying than anything, but that wasn't the case this time.<br/><br/>The only critique is that near the end of the second act, things start to drag a bit because there starts to be more of a focus on Colt and Bradbury's relationship and less on the actual tennis scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a nice surprise."

Lizzie Bradbury is a young ace and fast becoming one of the best. This is her first English tournament.<br/><br/>At the start of the tournament Peter is in the wrong room and sees Lizzy naked.

","(may be spoilers) Another in a long list of dim-witted romantic comedies which includes almost anything by Julia Roberts or Meg Ryan. This one at least has Kirsten Dunst who is a little more interesting than the aforementioned. Why do these films always include such idiotic fluff like the pantomime tennis game between the two principles or the ridiculous sequence where Bettaney climbs into the bedroom window as in Romeo and Juliet. The plot and dialogue are pure drivel.However, the film does contain one great sequence and that is the championship match at the end. This part of the film contains a great deal of the tension that is common in a Wimbledon final and reminded me of the great championship match between Patrick Rafter and Goran Ivanisievic of a couple years back. For tennis fans skip the rest of this gooey pap and fast forward to the final sequence it's worth the price of the rental."

","Over the decades, the British have been reduced to fantasizing about one of their own winning the Gentlemen's Singles at Wimbledon, which remains one of the great annual British occasions despite its domination by foreigners. (Not to disparage Lloyds of London investor Virginia Wade and others who've won the Ladies in recent decades).<br/><br/>Filmed at Wimbledon 2003, mostly on the ""jinxed"" Court Two, ""Wimbledon"" features a likable British player slightly past his sell-by date. Others from other countries are younger, stronger, hunkier, more popular, etc. The British love of the underdog is on display in this film as it is at the for-real Wimbledon tournament. (Not just Brits, too-- they cheered on no-hoper foreigners from Old Drob to Ivanisevic).<br/><br/>""Wimbledon"" seems pitched to the American television viewer, as tennis fans in most other countries aren't likely to have gotten used to Chris Evert, Mary Carillo and John McEnroe as the sport's essential voices. In this film, though, lead actor Paul Bettany furnishes a more useful voice, off-screening his thoughts from start to finish. Few scripts now call for so much narration, but it works here."

","This is a nice little movie about a British tennis star who is on his way out and the young female American star who goes to Wimbledon and the events that lead to her helping him become the star of the tourney. The acting is fine by Kirstin Dunst and Paul Bettney, and as always Sam Neill was very good in his part, although a small one. The one thing I will say about the movie that I liked were the tennis tournaments as they were very well played or both Dunst and Bettney had plenty of tennis lessons for this movie. Go see it if you like a light movie with no real message."

","Wimbledon certainly doesn't offer anything new as far as romance comedies go, but it does shine under the talent of its main character, Peter Colt (Paul Bettany). Bettany brings a charm and likability that I expected to get from Kirsten Dunst in this film. Instead, I was pleasantly entertained by this wonderful actor. Dunst, on the other hand, seemed unnaturally childish in her role as Lizzie.<br/><br/>Tennis rarely makes its way into the field of sports movie genres, but it seemed like the perfect sport to serve as a backdrop for this cute comedy. Rescued by the talent and magnetism of Bettany, Wimbledon reminds us that Hugh Grant isn't the only British actor who Americans should watch."

","An accomplished English tennis player (Bettany) has lost all confidence and ambition until he falls in love with American player Lizzie Bradbury (Dunst) and recaptures his will to win Wimbledon...<br/><br/>From the makers of other whimsy's like ""Notting Hill"" (1999), this is certainly nothing new, innovative or extraordinary, but this romantic comedy is pleasant enough for a couple of hours light entertainment even if it's rarely ever very funny. It's good to see that Kirsten Dunst seems to be maintaining a screen career after she first came to public attention in ""Spiderman"" (2002). Shot in Cinemascope, this would of worked better in the standard Widescreen format."
"dkennedy3","7","0","1","5 October 2004"," Interesting ... but not entirely convincing
","Filmed largely around the 2003 Wimbledon tennis championships, the story takes us into the lives of two of the contestants whose paths converge during the two-week event. Kirsten Dunst plays the somewhat brash American top-line women's singles player, and Paul Bettany the older British competitor who was once ranked as high as world number 11, but has sunk to 119 currently. The liaison has a different effect on the progress each of them experience through the tournament, but the end result is not all that surprising to the viewer. Some of the logistics of Wimbledon we see are interesting, but as one who met their partner on the tennis court it seems to me the chemistry between the two main players is just not quite there. I honestly found the little asides by some of the extras to be more interesting than Dunst and Bettany most of the time. These included the brief appearances by John McEnroe as commentator, the wily old locker room porter, and the admiring young ballboy. In summary, a pleasant enough romantic comedy in an unusual setting, which will adequately fill the gap if you are looking for something light. A rating of marginally less than 7 out of 10 seems appropriate."

","I just saw this movie yesterday and I thought it was a decent love story. It certainly is better than the last British comedy/love story which was ""Love Actually."" That was simply horrible. I give this movie 5 out of 10 stars. It is a good movie to take to a date. It has something for both male and female viewers. While this movie revolves around tennis, you do not need to know anything about tennis to understand the movie.<br/><br/>As for the characters, I thought Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany played their respective roles well. I always liked Dunst ever since ""Bring it on"" although I still say she should have never played Maryjane in Spiderman. Whoever in the movie studio thought of that should have been fired. Bettany has, I'm sure, been in many movies but the one that stuck in my mind was when he played a squire in ""A Knight's Tale."" A good actor and I hope I see him in other roles.<br/><br/>The premise of this movie is that it takes place in England. The tennis tournament called Wimbledon is about to start and an aging, has been British male tennis player ranked nearly the bottom, begins to develop relationship with a rising American female tennis player. The latter is driven to succeed while the former is just trying to finish the year so that he can retire and become a tennis instructor.

Could it be that the reason is that I am not a tennis fan? I don't think so. Just a lack of urgency. or something. If you have seen the preview, you have pretty much seen the movie.

","Wimbledon is one of those non-thinking, make-out heavily, date movies. My feelings are ambivalent, I mean I can't really totally trash or praise the movie. I think it because the rhythm of Wimbledon is steady throughout. It's this mellow, kicking the dust, shuffling my feet rhythm. Wimbledon is the typical girl meets boy story, but with a twist of behavioral sex reaction to love reversal. This time around it's the male (Paul) falling heavily and the female (Lizzie) who needs some prodding. 'Love means zero in tennis and that's what love is nothing.' I mean Dunst and Bettany gave fine performances, but nothing to run home screaming to mi Madre about; frankly, I forgot I saw the movie 15 minutes after leaving the theater. I didn't connect with Lizzie and Peter's supposed Shakespearian love affair. Is Lizzie really in love with Peter or just using him for entertainment? Seriously, I really didn't give two craps. Peter's brother, Karl, was a treatÂ…his subtle comedic performance was desperately needed.
