","I really wasn't expecting much, other than a few laughs, which would have been OK for a Dreamworks animation movie. But KUNG FU PANDA exceeded all expectations. The story is simple but the execution is superb. It would be really difficult to find something to improve on the production. The voice-overs are really good, esp Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman. The animation is very rich and the colors are crisp and bright. The action sequences are breath-taking. The laughs are mixed in at the appropriate moments. The theater was full and it was composed of a mixture of Adults and young kids. This is a fun for all movie. A testament to this fact is that almost the whole crowd stayed for the end credits. This is a very rare occurrence nowadays.\<br/><br/>Oh.. and I hope this does not count as a spoiler. I absolutely loved the Samurai-Jack type animation for some scenes."
"jacob-noergaard","9","146","167","7 June 2008"," Entertainment in its purest form
","Like many others, I saw the ""trailers"" featuring Jack Black. The featurette made me think ""Okay, at least I got to check this out"". Not much more. It didn't make me think ""This is gonna be awesome"" or anything like that.<br/><br/>Boy, was I ever under-expecting.<br/><br/>At first I thought it was quite okay, decent entertainment and at least not totally crap. But then the really funny scenes and details kicked in, after Po gets into the temple. From then on, it was laugh after laugh, excellent voice acting, amazing CG animation (but this is Dreamworks so I expected that).<br/><br/>The whole deal simply hit home run for me. Spot on. I love martial arts movies, I love Dreamworks CG movies and I must admit I find Jack Black amazingly funny (saw Be Kind Rewind the other day and loved it). There was so much charm and amusement in this movie. It's without doubt the best animation from Dreamworks since the first Shrek.<br/><br/>Now, I am not saying this will be for everyone. There IS a lot of fighting going on, and while it is (for most of the movie) comical (yet amazing to behold) violence, it might not be suitable for the smallest of children. But for any healthy kid aged 6-7 or above (especially boys), this will be kick-a**! I cannot really put my finger on anything bad. Sure, the movie is filled with clich√©s, but sometimes you can go a long way with those. And this one serves them perfectly. I even rated this higher than Ratatouille, due to the fact that it took me totally by surprise. With Ratatouille, I EXPECTED it to be great. Kung Fu Panda I only expected to be decent, but it was awesome. That deserves the last point."
"firstname-lastname-2","8","182","210","4 June 2008"," Wasn't Expecting much - Got a very good movie
","I was almost dreading seeing this movie - we won tickets to the screener and from the first scene I found myself laughing out loud. The movie is so much better than I thought it would be (and that was bad) - I expected the comedy to be slapstick/junior/potty but it wasn't. The story was also good enough to keep my kids focused glued to the screen. The animation is wonderful. Music is tasteful. I can't imagine anyone but Jack Black pulling off the voice though - he definitely made the movie for me. The only thing distracted me was that most of the movie I spent trying to figure out who was doing the voice of Tai Lung (Ian McShane). As mentioned previously in the forums about the pop culture references in this movie - I don't remember one - very nice indeed - it works with some of the other movies but I can do without. This is the first movie in a while I'd like to see again."
"MR_Heraclius","10","40","43","15 February 2020"," One of the best films from DreamWorks.
","Take it from me, this movie is brilliant. Don't go by it's silly child-pandering name, this film is for everybody. From little kids just looking for some simple fun for a little while to adults looking for a more compelling experience that makes you feel for the characters, this one's for everyone. Funny action adventure with some wise words scattered throughout."
"da_flipboy","10","199","233","9 June 2008"," Finally, Dreamworks Animation has a classic.
","After various 3D animated movies ranging from lacklustre ""star"" movies (""Madagascar""), boring tripe (""Shark Tale"", ""Bee Movie""), and over-rated, over-hyped overkill (""Shrek""), Dreamworks can finally be proud of a truly great film. (Sidebar: I actually enjoyed ""Flushed Away"" and ""Over The Hedge"".) First, the bad. If I could complain about ANYTHING it may be a few of the voices. Besides Po, Shifu and Oogway, the rest of the cast seemed pretty 'phoned-in'. Thankfully, those characters are pretty inconsequential so they're not really missed.<br/><br/>Now the good... or rather great. While classic kung fu movies are poked fun at, Kung Fu Panda does an excellent job of treating the genre with great respect in a movie geared towards kids. And while it IS kid friendly, it is not dumbed down to the point where it's childish. All the classic elements of those great kung fu flicks are there, while still keeping it pleasantly G-rated.<br/><br/>Let me get this out of the way: this movie has some of the greatest 3D animated fight scenes. Ever. What elevates them from good to great is that while I expected the unbelievable, gravity-defying stunts that are REQUIRED of a good kung fu movie, there is an amazing amount of 'realism' to the physics in this movie. Just watch the jailbreak and you'll understand.<br/><br/>Speaking of animation, the cinematography, character design and backgrounds are all done very, very well. Whether it's flying through the air alongside a leaping character, the painting-like backgrounds, or the wonderful opening sequence (reminiscent of Samurai Jack), they're all beautiful. Snap zooms, slow-motion, and flying cameras are also used with great skill to further the experience.<br/><br/>Even the music and sound is outstanding. Asian drums rumble in the background of intense fights... stones shatter and crumble away... fight sequences rise and fall with each of the music cues, or is that the other way around? Beautiful.<br/><br/>What helps make this a new classic in my eyes is what it doesn't have. There are no Matrix, Spiderman, or other dated references. There are no inside jokes related to the voice actors. There isn't even any double entendre or unnecessary crude humour. Much like ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Monsters Inc"", there's just plenty of pop-culture-free goodness that is terribly entertaining.<br/><br/>The last great part of this movie is often the most overlooked part of a good family film... heart. This movie has oodles of it. Other movies have tried to have a lesson in the end like 'be yourself' (""Shrek""), or 'the value of friends' (""Madagascar""), or... 'be yourself' (""Shark Tale""), but ""Kung Fu Panda"" has genuine cinematic moments with dialogue that carries real weight. Best line: Oogway regarding yesterday, tomorrow and today.<br/><br/>So, finally, as a complete sucker for Pixar animation, I'm glad that another animation company can actually put proper thought and execution into a FAMILY movie. What else can I say? Congratulations Dreamworks. 10 out of 10."
"jakubs-2","10","49","55","28 June 2008"," Exceptionaly visual, funny, action packed and intelligent movie for all ages.
","One of the best comedy movies I've seen, this animation feature is both packed with action and intelligent at the same time. It's yet another variation on ""You can do anything if you believe in yourself"" and carries strong morale and educational message. But the way it's done, the incredible visual side of the story, as well as the dialogs, is just exceptional. You can't but love the fat Panda boy who's dreaming about being the greatest warrior of all China only to wake up to the reality of hawing to serve noodle soup in his father's shop. Unlike his father, who also dreamed but never found the courage to act on it, Panda follows his calling and by ""luck"" get chosen to be the legendary Dragon warrior by the Kung-Fu grand master, the old turtle, to defeat the evil tiger. That's when his training and troubles start. It's really for anyone between 3 and 100 and I laughed and loved it from the titles in the beginning to the very end. Much recommended."
"bennyking81","9","86","100","28 June 2008"," Kick ass movie, almost note perfect
","I saw this movie in the Cinema last night. I can not recommend this movie highly enough to kids of all ages. it is a long, long time since i have heard a Cinema audience laughing so much during a movie ( i think the last time was during Gigli!).<br/><br/>Finally Dreamworks have managed to surpass the achievements of Pixar. All the elements are beyond anything i have seen in an Animated movie since The Lion King. the animation is hugely detailed and achingly beautiful, the script is the best i have come across in years. the only bum note in this symphony of fun is the fact that some of the immensely talented voice cast are badly underused. i can only remember hearing Jackie Chan's voice 3 times at most. having said that, the movie rests on the shoulders of jack Black and Dustin Hoffman. while playing their parts in a very different manner to each other, both are note perfect. they invest their characters with an energy (Black) and dignity (hoffman) that i could not find any fault with, even if i wanted to, not that i want to.<br/><br/>Lastly, i believe that Oogway is the best animated character ever rendered, his facial expressions are hilarious and-surpass any previous attempts to give a character convincing facial expressions (i consider Gollum to be a CG character, not an animated character, for the record).<br/><br/>in short, this is an utterly fantastic movie that everyone should watch 9/10"
"abecipriano","10","179","216","8 June 2008"," Dreamworks hits a HOME RUN with this one!
","From the very beginning, Kung Fu Panda had me practically falling out of my seat --- laughing. It was the perfect blend of comedy, heart, and action, all necessary elements in a successful and great animation/CGI film, in the tradition of The Incredibles and (less action, but containing the heart and laughter) Ratatouille, Finding Nemo and Monsters, Inc.<br/><br/>I took my wife and nephew and niece to see it on a Friday night and they enjoyed it, too! We were totally laughing, smiling, and guffawing at Po, the main protagonist (voiced by Jack Black) and his misadventures at becoming a Kung Fu expert. This was certainly a flawed character, one that a lot of people can relate to because he dreams, he's funny, and he can laugh at himself. Also, the story was pretty clear and easy to follow because the storytelling was well crafted, and the animation was paired well with characters brought vividly to life by some of the most famous names in Hollywood. <br/><br/>Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman are downright excellent as the main characters, and Ian McShane as the bad dude gave it the right fearful presence. Other big name stars don't shine as much, but that's because their roles are rather limited in the film. But that's still okay because the animators should be given equal credit (if not more) for delivering the funny, action and heart elements of this movie in an effective, amazing and (I've got to use this) AWESOME manner. Visually, this movie is stunning (notice all those scenic shots of the Chinese mountains, bodies of water, and the bridge scene; not to mention the action animation version of ""The Matrix"" with slow-mo)... simply a delight to watch.<br/><br/>It's clear that Dreamworks has gotten back in the animation game with Kung Fu Panda, after slight ho-hums in Shrek 3 and Bee Movie (call me crazy, but I liked Over The Hedge more than those two). Hopefully, it should earn well over $500M worldwide because it is so good.<br/><br/>This movie rightfully belongs in the top animation movies of all time (okay, let's not include the classic fairy tales of old; let's begin with the 90's onwards), alongside my faves ""The Incredibles"" ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Beauty & The Beast."" Has the makings of being a classic.<br/><br/>My wife and I enjoyed it so much that we saw it again the night after. And maybe another time... haha!<br/><br/>Enjoy!"
"yellocar","10","244","302","4 June 2008"," Jack Black is the Greatest Panda in the World!
","Caught a screening of ""The Panda"" and all I can say is wow! I took my 6 year old daughter, who has the attention span of a 6 year old, and she wants to see it again. So do I! <br/><br/>Jack Black is not only half of the greatest band in the world, he is also a fine voice actor. His flawed character, Po the Panda is very refreshing. So is this film. After having to sit through the boring ""Over the Hedge"" and the last two ""Shrek"" messes, I really appreciated an animated feature form Dreamworks that didn't have too many celeb voices all competing for screen time. This is Jack Black's movie. He has 75% of the lines in the script and that is not a bad thing. <br/><br/>Don't just drop the kids off to see Kung Fu Panda. Go with them. I think it's one of those rare movies like The Incredibles and Finding Nemo that adults can enjoy as much as the kids."
"the-movie-guy","8","95","115","6 June 2008"," Cute animated comedy that inspires lessons in life
","(Synopsis) Kung Fu Panda is the story of Po, (voice Jack Black), a sweet, but clumsy Panda who has dreams of fighting with the legendary Furious Five and protecting the city against all threats. The only problem is that Po has no real life experience of kung fu, and his real job is serving noodles at his dad's noodles shop. News of selecting the Dragon Warrior is sent out from the Jade Temple, and the whole city along with Po, go to the celebration. The competition is between the Furious Five: Tigress (voice Angelina Jolie), Viper (voice Lucy Liu), Crane (voice David Cross), Monkey (voice Jackie Chan), and Mantis (voice Seth Rogen). Po accidentally enters the contest and is named the Dragon Warrior. Master Shifu (voice Dustin Hoffman) must find a way to train Po and make him a Kung Fu Master, especially, after they learn that the snow leopard, Tai Lung (voice Ian McShane), is headed their way.<br/><br/>(My Comment) This is a cute animated comedy that also inspires lessons in life. The audience can relate to people who have dreams of doing the impossible, just as Po. Po ultimately learns that if he believes in himself, he can do anything. Jack Black (Po) and Dustin Hoffman (Shifu) voices were just right for their parts, and the chopstick fight between them is fantastic. Ian McShane (Tai Lung) was also wonderful as the villain, and his battle sequence on the rope bridge is spectacular. This film is for the whole family, because adults will enjoy the movie just as much as their children. (DreamWorks, Run Time 1:28, Rated PG)"
"Kimberlyjeana","10","172","228","17 May 2008"," I just saw the screening of this movie in the Chicagoland area
","I Love it! The story was great and the background was beautiful, it really felt like an ancient Chinese city. This original story is one of the best since Shrek. And the meaning behind the story may be even better! The story is about Po, an overweight panda who is the son of a noodle maker, who dreams of Po following in his footsteps. But Po longs to be a ninja fighter. Po is as you know is a panda bear and the film's unlikely hero: as the bigger than life and completely lovable bear voiced by the comic genius Jack Black. Po is a Sweet but clumsy, bear who hears the news the ancient and long awaited dragon warrior will be named, so he runs (as much as he can) to hear who will be named at the celebration.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, when an ""accident"" seems to name Po as the dragon warrior (much to the horror of Master Shifu (voiced perfectly by Dustin Hoffman) and the disappointment of Furious Five: Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Viper (Lucy Liu), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Crane (David Cross) and Monkey (Jackie Chan). Shifu must find a way to train him. One hilarious moment after another continues until Shifu recognizes Po's true driving force. This is just in time as the villain Tai Lung (Ian McShane), a snow leopard has returned as he believe is the true Dragon Warrior.<br/><br/>I can not recommend this movie enough. Certainly this is marketed for the kids ¬ñ but the whole family will enjoy it."
"ying_huang","10","17","20","18 June 2008"," Recommendation from a Chinese
","First I need to make it clear that since I was born and grew up in China, this review might be biased because there is so much more I appreciate from the movie, given my cultural background.<br/><br/>There is a specific category in the Chinese literature history called Kung Fu fictions and it had spread among generations currently between 12 - 60 years old. Have to admit, this movie touched deeply on that, far more than any Jackie Chan or Jet Lee movies. Because it is animated, it leaves more rooms for imaginations.<br/><br/>I am very satisfied with the movie, though I watched it with my American-born kids. It is still a typical Hollywood production, but somehow, it touched my Chinese heart.<br/><br/>It is a simple story, yet deep. See it if you haven't already."

","In China, the big, fat and clumsy Panda Po is a great fan of martial arts and worships The Furious Five - Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper and Monkey ‚Äì and their Master Shifu. He works in the restaurant of his father specialized in noodles, but he dreams on being a kung fu hero. When Master Oogway summons the population to announce who would be The Dragon Warrior, he surprisingly points out to the slacker Po, frustrating the expectations of Master Shifu and Tigress. Po joins the academy of Master Shifu that does not believe that Po might be The Dragon Warrior. Meanwhile the evil Tai Lung breaks out the high-security prison where he has been arrested for twenty years and heads to the temple of Oogway, expecting to get the Dragon Scroll and becomes more powerful. The Furious Five tries to intercept Tai Lung, but they are defeated. Now the only chance to stop Tai Lung is the glutton Po.<br/><br/>""Kung Fu Panda"" is a very funny and entertaining animation, with the delightful story of a clumsy Panda that dreams on being a hero. The computer-animated heroes and villain are hilarious, supported by the voices of Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angeline Jolie and other magnificent actors and actresses. Po is tailored for Jack Black and I can not imagine this character without his voice. Dustin Hoffman also makes the difference with the voice of the wise Master Shifu. I just regret that I did not pay much attention to this animation before and only now I have watched it. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Kung Fu Panda"""
"3xHCCH","10","11","13","8 June 2008"," The Best Animated Feature in the Past 2 Years !!!
","I LOVED this movie!!!! I even daresay that this is the best animated motion picture I have seen since ""Cars"" two years ago. Although the whole story of an underdog turned champion is admittedly an oft-told retread, the treatment is original and amazing and very engaging, and not corny (unlike a lot of the recent animated films). I cannot stop singing praises to this one. The artwork of the whole movie is fantastically rendered, no exquisite detail was spared in the scenery, the architecture and of course, the lead animal characters.<br/><br/>The action and fight scenes are very well done and memorable. I enjoyed watching the fight scene between Po and Shifu for the last dumpling, the fight of the Five vs. Tai Lung at the Bridge, and the climactic fight scene of Tai Lung with Shifu, and then with Po. Very exciting. My daughter even spontaneously applauded after that last fight sequence.<br/><br/>There were also a number of beautifully-crafted emotional moments throughout. I loved the inspirational talk of Master Oogwei and Po (loved those words of wisdom), the talk of Master Oogwei and Shifu with the peach blossom petals, and of course the touching moment of Po and Shifu after the battle, and even in that small extra scene after the credits.<br/><br/>The voice acting was also very good. Jack Black as Po, so natural the comedian, wow. Dustin Hoffman as Shifu, really great. I did not expect it to be him. If was fun to discover after the movie that is was Angelina Jolie who voiced the Tigress, Lucy Liu, the Viper, and Jackie Chan, the Monkey, among others. And even more minor characters like the menacing head of prison security rhino Commander Vachir voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan, all very good.<br/><br/>Overall, a fantastic movie experience that I would not mind watching over and over. There is something for everyone -- action, drama, and comedy. It is an animated classic in my book. Very highly recommended indeed!"
"piggypony","10","13","16","30 June 2008"," Wow.... Dreamworks' finest.
","When I watched the trailers to kung fu panda, I scoffed and sneered at the stupidity of a rude panda barging in and demanding to learn kung fu. If someone had asked me to go to that movie, I would have laughed in their faces, but gone anyway for the popcorn. As I watched the preview, I thought ""Well there's a waste of time and money, There's something I would never like."" <br/><br/>...Boy was I wrong. Kung fu panda has splashes of children and adult humor, done by the perfect Jack black, who fit so well with Po, the roly poly, cuddly panda. The scenery was breathtaking, and most of the time I forgot that the majestic shimmering water and lovely smooth trees were fake! The Thins that most surprised me was all the heart put into it. On the previews they are targeting mostly youths and younger audiences with their humor, but really the thing that I found sweetest of all was all the heart. The moral was so touching and sweet, that I could have never expected Dreamworks to pull it off, after their recent garbage like ""Over the Hedge"" ""Shark Tale"" and others.<br/><br/>The scenery was beautiful, and the animation was outstanding! The characters fit so well with their voices, especially my all time favorite character Master Shifu voiced by Dustin Hoffman. True, Jackie Chan and the furious five didn't have too many lines, but this does not stop the upbeat trhill and flow of the movie. I am Definitely buying this movie the second it comes out on DVD, and have seen it 7 times in the theater. The battle scenes are superb, and my entire family is getting sick of me talking about them. The storyline is very original, and bright, but within all the humor there is a heart, and other emotions,such as sadness. One of my favorite scenes is the one in which the Brave Master Shifu battles with his former pupil, the vicious (and I mean vicious) Tai Lung.<br/><br/>All the characters add their own little sparkle to the story, like sweetness being added to a cake. I really can't express my utter love for kung fu panda-It would be like trying to type out love, or music- it just can't be done. <br/><br/>Sincerely, Piggypony"
"honorhorror","9","15","19","16 June 2008"," Not only Good but also Makes me think.
","Kungfu Panda is marketed mainly as a children's movie with very childish style of cartoon-making and Jack Black. But it turned out to be eccentric and wonderful, a good story to bring your family to. If the box office becomes a flop(which is already impossible), it should be attributed to the marketing only.<br/><br/>As the tag line says, ""Prepare for awesomeness."" Even after so many positive comments, I still have no idea what the movie will come out like. One reason I couldn't figure out what the movie will be about is the super-simple title. Will it be just another Forbidden Kingdom? Or another Mulan? Or will it even turns out to be another Bulletproof Monk, which is among the disgraces to the Chinese culture? Sorry about this but I've seen too many movies portraying Chinese culture too superficial, which assumes Chinese philosophy established on either Buddhism(usually fake Buddhism) or some ridiculous superstition. So first of all, I am glad to say Kung fu Panda is the first Hollywood-made Chinese movie ever to make me feel proud for my ancestors' culture. If I haven't guessed it wrong, the writers really took some time digesting Chinese philosophies like the relationship between ""Beings"" and ""none-beings"", and other basic Chinese ideas about life and faith. No matter how old you are, the movie will make think for some time. It discussed some deep topics about human desire, confidence and destiny. After seeing it, I sincerely think that human desire can be used for good, for our bodies are like super-advanced machines and if you manage it in the right way, it won't be harder than controlling machines. Ancient Chinese assimilated so many nutrition from nature that they have a vision to achieve a balance between everything, that is also a reminding to me as a Chinese, which makes me proud.<br/><br/>The visual style of the movie completely beat my expectations. Everything is animated in a Chinese paper art style and the color red is so widely used as the main theme color. It touched me deeply because it reminded me of the glorious days of Chinese cartoons. It's like a combination of Matrix and traditional kung fu movies.<br/><br/>For many obvious reasons, it has the potential to win the Oscar. I am looking forward to some better cartoons this year. But at the same time I want Kongfu Panda to be the best animated feature of the year.<br/><br/>9/10 Almost excellent."
"Joejoesan","8","21","28","22 May 2008"," Kung Fu + Computer graphics = a winner!
","When you watch Kung Fu Panda you can't help but wonder: why wasn't this done before? Kung fu and CGI make a terrific mix in this entertaining tale of a clumsy fat panda who becomes a true kung fu master. <br/><br/>The story in short: panda bear Po (voiced by Jack Black) is a big kung fu fan. He has all the action figures of his idols, Master Tigress, Viper, Tigress, Monkey and Mantis - also known as the Furious Five, and dreams of one day becoming a kung fu master himself. In the meantime he sells noodles. When evil leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane) escapes from prison a Dragonwarrior is chosen to defeat him. Yes, our reluctant hero Po turns out to be the one! He gets a kung fu training from Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), who - after a few disastrous attempts - discovers that the only way to teach Po real kung fu is to lure him with food. But will Po be strong enough to beat Tai Lung?<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda doesn't start with a bang. The first laughs are results from the slapstick humour. Po is a lovable creature and everyone can relate to a person who dreams of the impossible. When Tai Lung escapes you're really into the story. This particular scene is pretty spectacular. It takes place in a dark cave and the way Tai Lung jumps around really gives you the impression that he's an enemy to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>What also works in the movie is the chemistry between Po (Jack Black) and Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). The latter easily steals the show as the grumpy kung fu master who doesn't believe in his mission to guide Po. The scene in which Shifu has a food fight with Po is an instant classic. There's also a great action scene in which Tigress, Mantis and the others try to stop evil Tai Lung. They fail, of course... <br/><br/>And the down side? There aren't that many bad things in Kung Fu Panda. Hoffman and Black make the movie. The role of Tigress (Angelina Jolie) could have been done by many other voice actresses. Jackie Chan (Viper) only has three or four lines and that's a shame. The final fight is - at some moments - rather violent. That can scare away some of the younger (3-6 year old) kids. <br/><br/>Dreamworks wants to turn Kung Fu Panda into a Shrek like franchise. They're right. There's enough material in here to make at least two more sequels. And CGI animated kung fu kicks really work on the big screen! So let them make a Kung Fu Panda 2. As long as they keep Dustin Hoffman as Master Shifu in the story!<br/><br/>8/10"
"Pelrad","10","20","27","25 June 2008"," Finally a Film About China the Chinese Love
","There have been many films about China that the Chinese themselves didn't like. They didn't like Disney's ""Mulan"", they didn't like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". This list goes on. Westerners have westernized the stories or included elements culturally offensive or unintelligible, and humour that, in the Orient, just isn't funny. Well, all that has changed. Last night I went to see Kung Fu Panda in Shanghai (in English with Chinese subtitles). Shangahai is the biggest city in China. The cinema was packed. And from start to finish there was non-stop laughter, excitement, and joy. The humour was universally funny, the culture was dead-on, and the story hit home with the Chinese. They could relate to the characters and their situations. They laughed. They laughed until they cried. Visually, the movie was just beautiful to look at. As an adult, I usually don't enjoy watching cartoons. But this one was more fun I've had at the movies in a long time. The timing of the film's release with the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing coming up is perfect. A job well done to all involved with the making of this little gem!"

","After the disappointing SHREK 3 and the only ""cute"" OVER THE HEDGE, DreamWorks Animation finally delivers another highlight to the CGI animated universe.<br/><br/>I got used to the rather simple story of MADAGASCAR after watching it again, I really liked SHREK and even more SHREK 2 (am I the only one?). I never liked the cultural references they built in, because I think they only work in their time (but in their time they worked great!). So for me KUNG FU PANDA is the first great ""classic"" DWA film. Go see it, it also works for adults. If you have seen some of the classic martial arts film (Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee etc) you will even more enjoy it. The voice talent of Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman and Ian McShane is perfectly used. The other voices are OK.<br/><br/>It will be a big hit for DWA, north of 200 millions domestic, eventually even 300 mil.<br/><br/>That said, my favorite CGI's are 1. THE INCREDIBLES, 2. RATATOUILLE and 3. FINDING NEMO and closely followed by KUNG FU PANDA. Looking forward to seeing KFP an second time and then maybe it will become my new Nr. 3."

","Saw this movie today. It was both entertaining and imbibing good values. For kids a definite watch. For adults too.<br/><br/>The story is a well known moral story of don't judge by the appearance. It is about a Chinese town in the valley where a kung-fu rule is about to be seized by a evil spirited tiger who wants to become The Dragon Warrior, the great. And a Panda comes in his way to achieve it.<br/><br/>The script is very good. Dream works artwork team has proved one more time. It was very funny from the beginning to the end. And some philosophical moments too. The music and colors used in the movie reminds Chinese in every aspect and mainly kung-fu. It no way is lesser than ordinary kung-fu film. Kung-fu fight scenes drawn with such a clarity. Colors used are mostly red and yellow. Some flash back and magical related scenes have been drawn to bluish grey. The effects came out were extremely good. My credit goes to directors who could imagine the whole thing in their minds to make this film.<br/><br/>Animation films have been reaching new dimensions. Though this one did not create any new dimension but will be still one among the classics. Liked a few 'Zen'nish philosophical lines of the Master Turtle character such as 'there are no accidents'.. ""i am the big Panda'..'past is history... future is mystery... and present is the only gift you have that is why they call it as 'present'...they have most profound meanings which the film could casually spill it on its way.<br/><br/>Ver good movie. A must watch."

","I can't exactly describe my feelings when I first saw this movie yesterday. It's awesome. The dreamworks has done really a good job in expressing Chinese cultural elements! It made me and my friends and all the audience laughed from the beginning to the end. When the movie came to its end, 90% of the audience didn't leave the room as usual. They stayed until the HP picture came out! Every scene is so precious and lovely that everyone didn't want to miss it! As a Chinese citizen, my feelings are complicated when I saw that the culture are so nicely expressed on screen by some foreign movie makers, but it's good, isn't it? Chinese movie makers should learn a lot from Hollywood.<br/><br/>I think Kung Fu Panda perfectly gets together several important Chinese cultural elements: traditional Chinese Kung Fu Tactics, traditional Chinese fighting story, traditional Chinese jokes, traditional Chinese scenes, traditional Chinese music, even traditional Chinese legends! I also like the song after the movie.<br/><br/>Thank you, Dreamworks!! I'm seriously considering to go to see it for the third time!"
"DICK STEEL","10","99","176","6 June 2008"," A Nutshell Review: Kung Fu Panda
","It seems like this is a movie made for all the fanboys out there,  regardless of what their obsessions are about. You know, being one who  idolizes certain somebodies or some things, and given a day that Fate  decides to throw you a curveball and give you that one opportunity to  come up close and personal to meet and greet your idol in the flesh, or  be thrown into the exact situation that you've always been dreaming  about. What would you do, and would you go weak in the knees or be  overcome with disbelief that you're actually, finally, realizing your  dream?  Panda Po (voiced by comedian Jack Black) epitomizes exactly that in  Kung Fu Panda, and that struck a chord in me and with many in the  audience as well. And for that, no matter how clich√© the story would  become, it had already done its deal and made the connection. It is no  wonder it is rated G here, and I expect that the holiday season would  allow cash registers to ring, for animation fans with the different  styles utilized to tell the story (you must be on time and not miss the  opening sequence), for kung fu fans to get a kick out of classic kung  fu moves personified in their animal forms - Tigress (Angelina Jolie),  Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Monkey  (Jackie Chan) - collectively known as the Fearsome/Fab Five, and for  the kids, given the obvious reason that hey, the protagonist is a  cuddly bear. The marketing department, if not already done, should  stock up on the plush toys, not only of the hero, but the supporting  casts as well. And make their younger forms available too, for they  will sell.  Story-wise, I can't help but to note its tip of its hat towards the  Jackie Chan martial arts movie of the past like Snake in Eagle's  Shadow, Eagle Shadow Fist, etc. The formula which follows a misfit with  weak or zero martial arts background having to undergo harsh training  under a kung fu master, finally realizing his true calling in time to  defeat the villain everybody fears. With the Jackie Chan movies, the  demise of loved one always trigger off a chain reaction, but since this  is G-rated, you won't have the pleasure of having blood spilled, but  with so many splatter-type movies in recent times, I have to admit this  was refreshing, and even having animated animals that talked, didn't  irk me as they are just so lovable here, in their own right.  It's an excellent and very even mix of comedy and drama, even though  they are quite clich√© at times if you grew up with the formula, but I  thought that was the point. While the trailers might have given away  some stuff, there are still lots more available which are hidden up the  sleeves, and some minor word replacement such as ""suck"" to ""stink"",  though you would likely be able to stay a step ahead throughout and  even guess whatever secrets the movie have, actually are. For its  stylistic training sequences, they became a throwback and a link to the  fore-mentioned Jackie Chan movies. The fight choreography isn't done  shoddily too with its designing of fights true to the characters'  forms, and integrating them all in a manner rarely seen before. Since  it's an animated flick, it was able to, and probably ramped up  whatever's possible in the kung fu fantasy realm, to give us everything  from rooftop flights to an incredible prison break. It didn't waste any  effort in tapping from the wealth of kung fu material, what with the  various names of deadly moves, secret manuals,  teacher-student feuds, and the best part of it all? Humour being quite  unexpectedly well placed, with more hits than misses to break out into  a hearty laugh by the panda antics.  For all its A-list voice actors in the movie, with the likes of Michael  Clarke Duncan, Dan Fogler, Ian McShane and those who provide voices to  the 5 key animals, Kung Fu Panda is clearly a Jack Black and Dustin  Hoffman vehicle. The bantering between the two is priceless as the  latter plays Sifu (duh) the master teacher, a highly-strung and serious  character who has a past they are shameful about (don't they all). And  as his own teacher Oogway (read: Wu Gui, aka tortoise, voiced by  Randall Duk Kim) advises, herein lies an opportunity for Sifu to  rediscover himself when training possibly the next-big-thing (pardon  the pun) Po, whom he foretold as the mythical Dragon Warrior. So begins  the forging of friendship, long lasting bonds and trust between the  two, even though they got off the wrong footing. And you can probably  feel for Po, because for a fanboy type, having your idols scoff at you  at first opportunity, is actually quite painful.  As a kids movie, there's almost always a message to take away. Here,  it's a reminder to believe in oneself, which I guess is a universal  theme to instill some confidence in the young ones. You might not look  the best, nor are the best amongst your peers, but so long as you have  that attitude to want to learn, that should put you in good steed. As a  summer blockbuster movie, it's fun, thoroughly entertaining, and  doesn't try to be too smart. It's likely to be a crowd pleaser across  all age demographics, and an ultimate popcorn fare, so long as you  manage to keep the popcorn away from the thieving hands of the panda.  And with this release beating local film Kung Fu Gecko to the screens,  I wonder what's the status currently on the Nickson Fong project."
"Tweekums","8","6","7","18 June 2011"," Fun animation from DreamWorks
","I hadn't got around to watching this film but as I'd heard good things about it I thought I'd check it out when it was on television. Initially I wasn't sure I'd enjoy it as I'm not really into 'talking animal' films; soon I was ignoring that and enjoying the humour and the story. The story itself is hardly new but tat didn't stop it being entertaining. Po is a panda who dreams of becoming a kung fu warrior fighting alongside the greatest warriors in China; unfortunately for him however he seems destined to become a noodle chef! One day the local kung fu master Oogway prophesied that a dangerous former student is going to escape from prison and return to seek his vengeance and steal the scroll that will make him the legendary Dragon Warrior. Oogway decides that he must find a new Dragon Warrior first; to this end he gathers everybody together to appoint the new warrior. Po is desperate to see the ceremony and in his efforts to see finds himself at the centre of the ceremony and being selected himself. Not surprisingly the five greatest warriors and their trainer are not impressed that a fat panda has been selected over them. When their enemy does indeed escape they head off to meet him while master Shifu attempts to train him. As is the way with such films Po finds that he has hidden depths and learns kung fu, the only question is will he learn the secret of the scroll and defeat the dangerous Tai Lung.<br/><br/>While the two films are very different I couldn't help thinking about Star Wars due to the relationships between the main characters; Shifu was like Obi Wan as his best student turns bad, Oogway was similar to Yoda. I'm not sure if this was a deliberate reference, it didn't matter if it was though as they never really laboured the point; in fact the film was refreshingly free from obvious pop culture references which I suspect will lead to it having a greater longevity than some other Dream Works animations. The animation looked pretty good in a way that made the characters believable even though they are talking, kung-fu fighting animals! The voice actors did a decent job; they avoided giving their characters 'cartoony' voices that can be a problem with animation at times. Over all I'd recommend this as it is a good family film with nothing too offensive for children or too childish for adults; it might not be as good as Pixar's best but then what is?"
"nikhil_2807","10","9","12","27 June 2008"," Awesomeness of the cute Panda
","My opinion:-- KungFuPanda is the best animated movie so far. I have seen almost all of them (toystory,incredibles,ratatullie,shrek,iceAge you name it). But KungFuPanda beats all of them. I enjoyed it thoroughly. It made us laugh like anything. Very good comedy scenes, well crafted anime art, Good action sequences, good Chinese landscapes, and very well told story. The screenplay is great. Special mention to the voices. Jack Black Rocks !! He blends into PO as if he was born to voice for PO. Dustin Hoffman suits perfect for Master Shifu. Dreamworks has surprisingly given an awesome anime picture. <br/><br/>My 10 out of 10. I'm gonna watch this movie again. <br/><br/>Highly Recommended."

","My boyfriend and I had to choose between this movie and the Zohan. Needless to say we were both glad we chose Kung Fu Panda. I would rather have sat through this movie with a bunch of rambunctious kids than an action thriller with a bunch of obnoxious teens. The animation was up several levels by entertaining the adults with fast paced action segments speckled with the genius humor of Jack Black. There was so much of this movie that no one but Jack Black could pull off. The special and sound effects were better, in my opinion, than Ratatouille. The dishes clanking, the light shining off metal objects..fabulous. Town characters were enjoyable, cute and entertaining for the little ones...and it was a refreshing time to see so many adults relax and laugh as heartily as the little ones. The scenery was at times so realistic and breathtaking. Yes...the ""skadoosh"" segment was hilarious. As were many other points in the movie. The voice cast was wonderful. Clark Duncan was intimidating, funny, and I think the little ones were endeared to him even though he was a big burly character. Hoffman..wow...several times I had to remind myself it was his voice. I really hope there is a sequel...I bet millions of kids will hope so too."

","Dreamworks has finally made a cartoon I can stand. It has finally outgrown the limits of its founders, three men an the attitude of good enough. They've for the first time put more money into one of these than in the promotion of it. They've finally weaned themselves from the contracts with Microsoft.<br/><br/>Three things impressed me. One was the attention to the characters, at least the top three. This really was world class. You can see it both in the writing and in the subtle way their faces are rendered. No expression is direct or static. Every expression fleets through a number of emotions. Its what good actors do, but animators aren't limited by the human instrument, so can make the expression of expressions more theatrical and therefore more effective. They did well here, wisely focusing on mouths and not eyes. (They still do poorly with teeth.)<br/><br/>The third thing was the use of vertical space. They are catching up, and its only notable because it isn't Pixar/Disney. But it means that now even the dullest of animation shops has adopted the rule that when you can, use that third dimension in a way that physical cameras cannot. What they do here is not remarkable compared to what others are doing. But it is remarkable when the fat kid in the class gets interested in aerobics, the laggard thinks being smart is finally cool<br/><br/>This has one well engineered fold. It starts with a highly abstract cartoon. We know it is a cartoon, because it advertises itself this way. Then we are told it was only a dream, essentially the movie within the movie. This is at the same time the real cartoon starts, but we register it as reality. Its a good trick.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
"Rectangular_businessman","8","3","3","17 June 2010"," The best animated film from Dreamworks
","""Kung Fu Panda"" is easily the best film ever made by the Dreamworks animation studio. It was even better than ""Shrek"" and ""Over the Hedge"" (Both very good films) The animation was quite well made: Not only the characters look more ""Alive"" than in many other CGI productions, but also the atmosphere looks stylish and more than adequate for the tone of the film. The characters were very likable and the action scenes were not only very funny to watch, but also were much better directed than other boring live action films like ""300"" or ""Pathfinder"". Jack Black was great in his role as the main character, and the cast did a great job as well. I highly recommend this film to anyone! It has fun, action and adorable and likable characters. This is one of the best films of the 2008, along with ""Wall-E"". <br/><br/>10/10"

","This was a nice movie with likable characters but, frankly, I didn't find it anything memorable. Yes, it was beautiful artwork but I read where it was the most beautiful animation ever put on screen, and I didn't find it lived up to that. I guess my expectations were sky high, which made it almost impossible to meet. The story could have used more laughs, too. I think that was the main thing that slightly disappointed me: the humor was mild, not laugh-out-loud funny.<br/><br/>Having said all that, it was enjoyable and it will put numerous smiles on your face as you watch it. I guess ""pleasant,"" ""agreeable,"" ""warm,"" etc., would be better words to describe the film. It is pretty, too, especially on Blu-Ray. I imagine this looked awesome on IMAX in the theater.<br/><br/>Jack Black does a nice job of voicing the main character, ""Po,"" the panda that surprised everyone, including himself, on what he could achieve if he set his mind to it. That's another plus for the film: nice messages.<br/><br/>Kids should like this more than adults but grownups will enjoy it, too."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","5","6","12 September 2008"," Awesome Colourful Kung Fu Creatures
","'Kung Fu Panda' is another delightfully entertaining flick to come out this summer. Osbourne and Stevenson do a fine job in directing. What I really liked about the film is the sincere effort behind it and its lack of pretension and use of clich√©s. The directors stay focused on the main story which is Po's struggle. I could really relate to Po's dream and love for Kung Fu and his disappointment and lack of faith in failing to be successful in doing what he loves. The stellar voice cast that includes names like Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Ian McShane, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, David Cross and Randall Duk Kim is impressive but it is Jack Black's show all the way, followed by Dustin Hoffman. Black's comic timing is wonderful as he provides some of the very memorable laugh-out-loud moments and he brilliantly succeeds in making Po both endearing and funny. I would never have guessed that Hoffman was behind the voicing of Shifu. The actor does an excellent job. I wish Jackie Chan had more lines. The music and CGI are good enough. There's a lot of energy. It's colourful and very appealing to the eyes and it's funny as hell. What's not to love? In my opinion, 'Kung Fu Panda' is a winner with both adults and kids."
"jantoniou","10","5","6","23 June 2008"," What a perfect gem of a movie...
","This is just the sweet spot you want - animation perfection coupled with a fine story that delivers an extremely enjoyable, very funny lovely gum drop of a film.<br/><br/>I think Dreamworks has easily surpassed Shrek (the first) with Kung Fu Panda. ""Shrek"" was great, but had so many puns because of the content (Fairy Tales) that it was almost too easy.<br/><br/>With the law-of-diminishing returns Shreks and the passably funny Madagascar under their belt, I had low expectations for ""Kung Fu Panda."" Pleasant surprise is an understatement: the animators, screenwriters, storytellers, voice actors, and producers all brought their ""A game"" to this one. This should be considered at the very least a CGI animation and at worst a top 30 animation classic up there with the best from Disney and Pixar. I'd rate it very close to my Pixar favorites, ""The Incredibles,"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" I won't bother regurgitating the highlights of the plot - others have taken care of that. It's the quality of this movie that's stuck with me; e.g., more laugh-out-loud hilarious moments than I can possibly remember, the tightly woven plot, and the simple, yet powerful message that isn't weighted down with too much sentimentality. I was also drawn unexpectedly to the animation itself - it has such a strong, unique use of color I found that the palette was another element that lifted the film out of the ordinary dreck of CGI. <br/><br/>This is just a great, fun, and very funny movie that is completely worth bringing the whole family to. Don't miss it."

"dont_b_so_BBC","8","8","11","10 June 2008"," Kung Fu Panda-- A Worthy Addition to the Kung Fu Movie Genre
","Watching this movie should easily explain why the Kung Fu Movie Genre simply refuses to die ever since movie technology was brought into China in late 1910s-- Kung Fu is essentially about self-cultivation, and so usually involves a human-interest story no matter how simple or complicated the plot is. And as others have noted, despite the lack of any real originality (Kung Fu Animals have been long existed in Chinese fantasy literature/ animation, see 1965's ""Uproar in Heaven"")-- Kung Fu Panda is done with such style and skill (or the Chinese would say, ""Kung Fu"") that it easily explains, again, why the Kung Fu Movie Genre simply refuses to die.<br/><br/>In a word, the whole ""Kung Fu Animals-imitating-humans-imitating-Animal styles Kung Fu"" gimmick WORKED (not to mention the comical sight of a Panda imitating other animals)-- because I was enjoying the detail and complexity of the Kung Fu Animation in much the same way I would enjoy the athleticism and aesthetics of real-life Kung Fu Action. And unlike some western attempts at Kung Fu Movies (most recently, The Forbidden Kingdom), Kung Fu Panda suffered less of the awkwardness in mixing foreign languages/ characters with Chinese languages/ characters-- because it is populated solely by animals (Peace Valley is basically a poultry & pig farm/ community) and consistently set in fantasy/ mythical China (duh, there are Kung Fu Animals...).<br/><br/>So I will give Kung Fu Panda the honor of rating it as a Kung Fu Movie-- being rated ""G"" (in most Asian countries, ""PG"" in most western countries) is no excuse. MAJOR MAJOR SPOILERS follow:<br/><br/>1) Most Missed-Opportunity Fight Scenes: Oogway vs. Tai Lung, Tai Lung vs. Peace Valley, and all the other ""flashback"" fight scenes-- we never really get to see how amazing or dangerous Oogway or Tai Lung can be.<br/><br/>2) Most Spectacular Fight Scene: Tai Lung vs. the Rhinoes-- things were blowing up and crashing down in a way which would have made Tsui Hark & Stephen Chow proud.<br/><br/>3) Most Well-Choreographed Fight Scene: Po vs. Sifu-- truly a compendium of some of the best chopsticks moves in the Kung Fu Movie Genre.<br/><br/>4) Most Awesome Fight Scene: the Furious Five vs. Tai Lung-- it was just awesome to see the Furious Five teaming up in their only fight scene (the sparring scenes don't count), which would have been perfect if they had a chance to do Formation Fighting.<br/><br/>5) Most Fearsome Fight Scene: Tai Lung vs. Sifu-- the only ""serious"" fight in the movie, because both fighters were able AND willing to kill each other. Sifu would have died if this movie was made for an western adult audience (or made for/ by the Chinese).<br/><br/>6) Most Predictable Fight Scene: Tai Lung vs Po-- Po defeating Tai Lung with the use of natural and environmental advantages (ala Jackie Chan) actually took the ""edge"" off this climatic fight in favor of comic relief and made it look too easy for Po (Tai Lung has beaten everyone else), so much so that the final blow looks questionable. It might have worked with a (Hong Kong, not US) Jackie Chan or Stephen Chow for the right balance of comedy & drama, but Jack Black's style of (over-)cockiness diminished any real sense of danger for me.<br/><br/>7) Most Unexpectedly Beautiful Scenes: the 2-D Opening Sequence-- because the ""distorted"" perspectives of ink-painting and shadow puppetry aesthetics actually work better in 2-D; and the almost monochromatic ""passing"" of Oogway-- because it was SO simple.<br/><br/>8) Most Unexpectedly Funny Scenes: ""I wish my mouth was bigger"" Noodle-scene, ""Maybe you should have another look"" Acupuncture-scene, and almost every one of the precious few moments given to Mantis (or any of the Kung Fu Masters at the temple)-- it was just unusually comical having them actually act/ talk ""normally"" (real Kung Fu Masters are usually quite sedate/ focused), instead of over-acting like Hollywood comedians.<br/><br/>My only gripe is that beside Po, none of the named characters such as the tortoise Oogway (Chinese for ""tortoise""), the master/ teacher Sifu (Chinese for ""master/teacher""), the tigress Tigress (erm, you get the idea), etc. were given enough screen time-- despite having more interesting personalities and back-stories than Po, the typical Kung Fu Movie protagonist (see Jackie Chan's late 1970's break-out Kung Fu Movies). A prequel about how the fastidiously over-achieving Sifu managed to warp Tai Lung into an unscrupulous over-achiever would be much appreciated... and yes, I smell a toy/ TV/ movie franchise.<br/><br/>Oh, and a final word about the beautiful Chinese landscapes and architecture-- well, I'm a bit hard to please cos I've seen & climbed the real thing (looks to me like Tai-shan or Mt. Tai, with its 10 km stairway, mixed with various other parts of China)... but yeah, the animators did a GREAT job. ;)"

Trained by Shifu the five are being groomed so one will become the Dragon master and protect the village from the wrath of the evil Tai Lung and in a hilarious set up that task falls to the reluctant Po. Cue comedy training scenes and 'Karate Kid' style balances on one leg as the clumsy and unfit Po tries to become the ultimate fighting force. With an all star cast of voice talent here, Black, Hoffman, Jolie and Chan to name but a few, the characters are instantly likable, but what sets this film apart is really the animation which is simply stunning and often uses matrix style slow motion to great effect as the camera whirls you round a fight scene that just stays the right side of not making you dizzy. The story despite being heavy on the morale of believing in yourself and you can do anything rhetoric is a strong one and the script is full of great jokes. Add to this some fun slapstick and it should have the adults laughing along with the kids.

","Kung Fu Panda is both a send-up of and a tribute to the kung-fu genre, and it works. Innocent eyes will goggle at the beautifully rendered characters, break-neck action, and gentle humor; more experienced viewers will laugh at loud at all of the kung fu movie clich√©s... a hopeless loser that goes from zero to hero in about one day of intense training... a promising but evil student who turns against his master... the wise, ancient master... the prophesy... the various forms of animal-style kung-fu practiced by actual creatures of the correct type... it's all there, without any wires, and without the awful dialogue you would expect from a chop-sockey film. Jack Black entertains, and shares some excellent dialogue with Master Sifu, voiced by Dustin Hoffman. The Furious Five, a group of powerful Kung Fu warriors, is voiced by various big-name actors, but somehow, they rarely seemed to get enough voice-time to justify those big salaries - particularly Jackie Chan (Monkey), who had about three lines of dialogue. Presumably they based Monkey's movements on some of Jackie's more inspired moves from the past. This is where the film lost a point. An honorable mention should be given to James Hong, who voices Po's (Jack Black, the Panda) father's voice - apparently, PO is the son of a goose who owns a noodle shop. Ian McShane also deserves mention as Tai Lung, the immensely powerful evil Snow Leopard kung-fu master who must escape from prison and return to the valley in order to fulfill PO's destiny. See this movie. It brought awesomeness back to a genre that has seen a lot of crap in the past 5 years (anything with Star Wars in the title, anything starring Jackie Chan, anything directed by the Wachowski Brothers...), and it's even clean enough to bring your kids to.

","I am not a big fan of Dreamworks' non-Aardman movies after Shrek. They used too many jokes, pop-culture references etc. instead of serving real story with real characters. The only exception is, I think, Over the Hedge, which, while not really Pixar-standard, is one where they didn't overuse pop-culture references but gave us lovable characters and a good story. I think Kung Fu Panda is closer to Over the Hedge than other Dreamworks-movies. Actually I didn't find real pop-culture references (while there may be a lot of references to martial arts movies - I lack knowledge of them - there is nothing that does not fit to the story and the characters) at all. Slapstick is very childish in the movie; I can understand that, they wanted to sell it to the little ones too. But other than that, and most of the time, it is a beautifully-animated kung-fu movie with great scenery that is more for adults and kung-fu movie lovers than for children. They even give time for character building, although it is only for the Panda and the two masters; others are really one-dimensional (they even don't really have too much screen time for more). The story is nothing new, but maybe that's not something you would expect from a Kung-fu movie. All in all, the movie is much more fun and sensitive but with less jokes than its ads suggest. i did like it even if I didn't love it - maybe you should be a kung-fu fan for the latter."

There was definitely original humor. Adults will adore this movie. Many scenes contained humor that actually made you laugh. I guess you could actually compare this movie to Shrek which was hailed everywhere. Jack Black was the perfect actor for the lead role. I think he should be in more kid movies. He wasn't his normal immature acting. He was serious, yet funny. The whole idea of Kung Fu Panda may seem a bit ""questionable"", but don't believe that. You HAVE to see this movie!"
"shahmatt","9","4","5","19 June 2008"," Kung Fu Panda is a good movie
","I must admit I was a little skeptical going in to watch this movie, the main reason being, Dreamworks, in my opinion, has not produced a good movie since Shrek. By good movie I mean, a movie with a good story, heart, and humor. The Shrek sequels and other movies from the studio have all been corny and shallow, utilizing big name voices but with little in the manner of storyline and heart. Pixar, did exactly the opposite. Avoiding big names as much as they could except for where they felt it was necessary to help the storyline. Pixar put movie first, then voice actors. Dreamworks the reverse. And look at which company does better. Pixar of course! <br/><br/>A good friend told me that Kung Fu Panda was 'friggin Awesome', so I decided to take a chance. The trailers looked interesting. A little different from Dreamworks' typical approach of touting voices and funny scenes. Kung Fu Panda does have its fair share of voices, with Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, and Dustin Hoffman. But the trailers did not focus on the voices at all, which led me to believe that this might be something new.<br/><br/>So it started. I was mesmerized by the stylized opening sequence. I'm sure many an animator would take note of the work. It left me intrigued and interested. It also got me to smile and set me up for what was to come. The opening sequence is important. Make sure you don't get late and miss it.<br/><br/>The movie then switches into the normal style of 3D animation that we have become so familiar with in recent years. Kung Fu Panda has a lot of talking animals in it, and no humans at all. Jack Black plays Po, the Panda, who works in a noodle shop assisting his father (a goose?). He dreams of learning Kung Fu, and is a big fan of the fearsome five, a group of five animals who are experts within their animal talents. He is a true fan boy, and owns action figures of each of them. The story unfolds in a way that is not too unexpected. Po, our unlikely lovable hero, has to eventually defeat Tai Lung, and save everyone.<br/><br/>Interestingly, I found that the style of story had some similarities to Chinese folklore. The storyline intentionally encompasses Chinese culture and tradition to a degree. A rare thing to behold. I loved the effort.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda will appeal to all ages. For the young, the motivational message that comes towards the end. And for the older, an enchanting work of great entertainment. I was entertained.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda is a good movie, and is reminiscent of the days when Dreamworks came up with Shrek. Now go see it and enjoy yourself!"
"joemovies-2","8","4","5","18 June 2008"," Definitely worth the wait
","This animation i have to say is one of the best i've seen and i'm not a fan of pixar type 3D animation (ie Find Nemo, Shrek etc...) since they're too much for kids. But this animation is worth the hype and the wait. Not only is it entertaining/funny but also has a moral to the story which we all should learn from (both adults and children).<br/><br/>The graphics is excellent, story is simple/typical (aren't majority of them nowadays) but the moral included makes this animation not only for kids but for everyone.<br/><br/>Generally i don't want any sequels to be made since they are just for money grabbing reasons but for this one i hope they make a trilogy since i really LOVE PO."

","Kung Fu Panda is one of the best animation movie I have ever seen. It has excellent animation; everything seems so realistic. The voice for the characters were a perfect match for in the movie. Throughout the movie, there are many scenes where you laugh until you can't anymore.<br/><br/>The story line was pretty good. It is just like any other animation movie. The only thing that sets this movie different from others is the laughter, adventure, and kung fu style.<br/><br/>This is a great family movie, but I suggest about letting little kids watching it because of the kung fu, action fighting thing.

It's difficult to envision what kind of person would not enjoy this film.

I was practically crying; and turned to my friend to tell her, ""That was worth the price of admission, alone."" Jack Black makes a great voice and really brings the fat panda to life.

"cathie454","8","6","9","8 June 2008"," Amazingly good
","After seeing the commercials on TV for this one, I didn't want to see it. It looked inane and more of a children's movie than one for adults. Today, though, my friend wanted to go, and I was pleasantly surprised to see one of the best movies I've seen this year. I was first struck by the art work... not the CG/animation but the artwork, the backgrounds and sets of the scenes. They're stunningly beautiful, as is the soundtrack. Then the story pulled me in, even the minor things like why a Panda has a goose for a father. I really liked the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-type action scenes; they were really well done, using the characteristics of each character to add to what the character was able to do. The villain was especially well done, intimidating but not over-the-top scary that would scare small children. (There were many children in the theatre of course, but the movie kept them interested apparently because they were all well-behaved, engrossed in the movie.) The acting was well done as well. I'd wondered if Jack Black would be as funny when you can't see his physical humor, but I shouldn't have worried. I read a review of the movie this week that said Angelina Jolie wasn't very good. I'm not really a fan of hers, but I don't know what movie that reviewer saw; I thought she was great. In fact, I wish there had been more scenes and actions with the 5 Kung Fu warriors, the Monkey, the Snake, the Mantis, the Tiger and the Stork. They were all excellent as was the Kung Fu Master, voiced by Dustin Hoffman. Hopefully, there will be a sequel (done as well as this one was) and we will see more of those characters, and find out about Po's father."
"vivifan","8","2","2","9 October 2016"," Kung Fu Panda is a great animated film, but not just animated either
","I have to say before watching this movie and hearing the title I thought to myself that it has to be the dumbest name for a film ever. The film looked like it was going to suck judging from the trailers.But as it turned out after watching this I found myself engaged and interested in what was going on. This movie is a perfect example of never judge a book by it's cover. The story of the film was very simple yet it was funny, cute, charming, likable and it can be pretty serious at times.The Animation was very impressive and colorful, the facial expressions on the animals looked great and there movements on them were great to. The soundtrack was very good and the action scenes were very entertaining. The acting was good and the characters were all fun to watch. If i had to point any flaws to the film would be two things, the furious five while pretty cool didn't have many lines and it would've been nice to have more development from them. The bad guy Tai lung wasn't a terrible bad guy since he was a cool fighter and he had a good voice that fits him well, but he was underdeveloped and could've been better.Overall Kung Fu panda is a great film that teaches people that they can do anything in life if they put there minds to it no matter what flaws they have."
"Mr-Fusion","9","2","2","3 January 2012"," Jack Black's greatest role, and one of the best animated films of the last decade.
","""Kung Fu Panda"" hits all the right notes of a terrific animated movie: gorgeous artwork, engaging story and characters, and it's made for everyone - big and small.<br/><br/>The titular character is Po (Jack Black), a roly-poly panda with over-sized ambitions to match his girth. Stuck in his workaday job as a noodle-pusher, Po's biggest dream is to be a kung fu master and join the Furious Five, China's legendary superhero team (Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, David Cross and Seth Rogen). Po is thrown headfirst into training when a prophecy names him the new Dragon Master, to the chagrin of the Five's master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). Meanwhile, the imprisoned Tai Lung (Ian McShane) has escaped, lusting for vengeance against Shifu, his former master. As the nigh-unstoppable escapee approaches, everything rests on the unlikely Kung Fu Panda.<br/><br/>Steeped in Chinese mysticism and showcasing the breathtaking mountainscapes of the Far East, ""Kung Fu Panda"" is a film that is impossible not to like. The frenetic action scenes come fast and furious, while the quiet moments are stocked with inspirational Chinese proverbs and characterization. Much of the humor - and there's plenty of it - centers around the comically overweight panda as he faces off against his kung fu superiors.<br/><br/>And Jack Black has found the perfect character for his trademark brand of overwrought hyperactive comedy, which usually borders on obnoxious. But here, it completely fits with the Panda who won't quit. Po is full of heart (as is the film), and his boundless energy and need to reek of awesomeness just makes him one of the most likable characters I've ever seen.<br/><br/>And the whole movie is just as likable. No, scratch that.<br/><br/>Lovable.<br/><br/>9/10"
"findashwin","9","2","2","29 December 2011"," Fantastic Movie. Philosophical, Inspiring, Funny
","This movie is entertaining and well thought out in many levels. In the most reductive form, its the story of a Panda(an unfit animal for training Kung Fu?) who wants to be a Kung Fu fighter. The movie is about how he eventually gets there, and that he does against many odds in a very entertaining way. That is the inspiring part of the story.<br/><br/>If you look a little bit more deeply, we see that the 5 animals that are currently training to be the dragon warrior are monkey, crane, tiger, snake and mantis. They are not chosen by co-incidence, but these are the famous five animal fighting styles taught in Kung Fu.<br/><br/>When the funny panda goofs up and unwittingly puts himself in a spot where he gets picked for the dragon warrior, master Shifu is not thrilled, and he does not believe that the panda can be a dragon warrior, and he is determined to make the panda give up and leave. But wise Oogway has faith in his selection. Eventually, master Shifu has to accept the fact that he has to train the panda to be a dragon warrior and in that process Shifu has to relearn his teaching methods as well.<br/><br/>After intense training the panda has proved he is worthy and gets to open the dragon scroll, and here is where it reaches a philosophical zenith. When he opens the dragon scroll, he is supposed to see something special that is supposed to give him an advantage over his enemy, and what he sees is an empty scroll with a reflection of his face! The message indirectly conveyed is to have faith in oneself or, that if you truly believe in yourself you could be special, i.e you could achieve the impossible! Panda learns this(the meaning of the scroll) only later when he tries to find out what makes his dad's soup so special!<br/><br/>Everybody else (furious five and Shifu), see the scroll as well, but however, it was only the panda who figures out what the empty scroll means. He tries to explain to Tai-Lung as to what the meaning of the scroll is, Tai-Lung does not see the meaning and thinks he is being tricked which eventually leads to his own destruction!<br/><br/>Some of the core philosophy behind Kung Fu, is drawn from Buddhism. I cant help drawing a parallel between a famous saying originating from Buddhism- it says ""Before Enlightenment chop wood carry water, after Enlightenment, chop wood carry water."" The difference is only in the frame of mind. Analogous to that, even here after seeing the dragon scroll, panda only had to change its frame of mind to be special."
"id_unplugged","2","16","33","9 January 2010"," Unbelievably Irresponsible Movie
","Cartoons are typically targeted towards the younger audience. The impressionable minds, the sponges. So instead of making a movie which teaches that hard work, sustained commitment, discipline and patience ultimately pays off, here, we have the exact opposite. The team who has spent a lifetime preparing for a task is pushed aside in favor of a wholly unmotivated, ill-prepared, unqualified on all accounts ""hero"", who is chosen by destiny (which fairy tale could do without it ?) and conveyed through a turtle, who is about to kick the bucket himself.<br/><br/>In matter of two days, a panda who is so overweight that he literally cannot get up, and could (or should) keel over from a massive stroke or a heart-attack any minute, is sharpened into a Master Kung-Fu fighter through a program of --consuming chicken dumplings.<br/><br/>It's a frightening message for the younger generation: That unqualified and unprepared triumphs over the qualified and prepared, by goofing off. Panda has no inherent special powers in him. No gifts are bestowed upon him to make him special. He just becomes special because he believes he's special. Wow.<br/><br/>I will say that there is nothing visually wrong in the way this movie is put together. The animation, direction and voice overs are all first-rate. My beef is with the central premise of the movie, which is why, I feel, kids should not be exposed to it."
"jaredmobarak","7","14","29","31 May 2008"," Can you handle the crazy feet?¬ÖKung Fu Panda
","Pixar is where it is at for me animation-wise in Hollywood. Maybe that makes me a snob, but something about their films resonant on a level that the others can't even begin to touch. Sure Shrek and Madagascar are funny, but besides the off-belly laugh, they are kind of shallow and hollow. With that said, I went to check out Dreamworks new foray into computer graphic cinema, Kung Fu Panda. Admittedly, I knew very little about this thing other than the fact that Jack Black and Angelina Jolie voiced characters. It could possibly be due to the fact that I don't watch much TV, but I've seen sparse promotion at best until walking into the theatre and seeing a giant 3D panda in the lobby. On the whole, the film plays out much like you'd want a family/kid friendly picture to. We are given examples of friendship, belief in oneself, and humility¬óall life lessons we hope to inspire our youth with. With a good backbone such as that, along with some humorous bits and stunning action choreography, this panda definitely packs a punch doing his job: entertaining the audience right until the final frame.<br/><br/>Credit the producers for compiling a top-notch roster of vocal talent to enhance the somewhat ho-hum script. These types of movies are never very original, so it takes a bit of extra panache to really draw me in. Black is actually quite good in the role and Po the panda plays right into his schtick. When arriving at the hall of warriors, he goes to every artifact and does his thing, screaming his excitement at all the cool stuff like it's his JB character from Tenacious D eying Jimi Hendrix's first guitar. The Kung Fu arm mannerisms even recall his air guitar/rock n' roll motions. Black is somewhat restrained and his manic energy is reigned in to be effective on the comedic and dramatic levels. This guy is, after all, our entrance into the story and the character we are supposed to relate to. An outcast and an original, we all can see a bit of ourselves, always dreaming but never taking the leap to achieve those goals. We watch his evolution and start to believe that it could happen to us too.<br/><br/>It is a fine line for the supporting roles. A Panda with historical knowledge of the ancient art yet without any actual experience has been proclaimed the savior of the valley against a monster of a foe. He is truly the ugly duckling and all those around him must straddle the division of chiding him and the absurdity of the situation, but not be too mean¬óthere are kids watching. In order to keep a good grasp on this tenuous situation, the filmmakers cast a group of affable people with the ability to work in serious moments, but never relinquish the humorous edge to their voice. Guys like David Cross, Seth Rogen, and Jackie Chan are perfect for the roles of the true warriors attempting to reconcile their preconceptions of this screw-up swooping in and taking their thunder. Moments like the acupuncture scene really show this to be true. Jolie is good as Tigress, another fighter and prize student, but the role ends up being pretty forgettable and by the books. She never really gets the range to go crazy. Neither does Dustin Hoffman as the master and teacher to them all, yet he is a still a success. My favorite supporter was the great Ian McShane as Tai Lung, the villain of the tale. No one has a better voice for nefarious deeds than this guy and he delivers continuously.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes, it is a nice tale to teach the kids about faith and comradery. For us older folk, however, we are treated with some spectacular action/battle sequences to satisfy our want for more than just preaching. The chopstick fight between Hoffman and Black is fantastic, having comedy and tenacity with some nice artwork and fast paced movement. The battle on a rope bridge towards the end, as well as the final confrontation, is also highly enjoyable. Credit the entertainment to the acting and a gimmick that at first made me cringe. Throughout the film we are treated with slow-motion insertions during the action. A nod to old Kung Fu films and the satirical spoofs created as a result, I was thinking I'd grow tired of the maneuver very fast. Fortunately, as the movie continues on, the moments become sprinkled in with perfect timing. The escape from Rhino prison wouldn't have been half as fun without the speed changes in the action and the slow-mo facial expressions of those getting thrown around. Even towards the end, the filmmakers began to use it as an original comedic device. Capturing Po's reaction to a charging Tai Lung is absolutely priceless.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda is by no means a masterpiece, but for a cartoon that really flew under my radar, I had a lot of fun taking part in the experience. Right from the beginning, with a stylized 2D rendered sequence as an introduction, I saw that this wouldn't be quite the run-of-the-mill work I was anticipating. Always staying fresh and funny I can fully endorse anyone wanting to check it out as a nice appetizer to what could be a fantastic main course in Pixar's Wall-E come this summer."
"BA_Harrison","6","6","10","21 July 2008"," A bad ending spoils this otherwise enjoyable film.
","Po is a panda (voiced by Jack Black) who dreams of being a kung fu master; however, being a little on the large side and just a waiter in a noodle shop, the chances of him realising this fantasy seem relatively small. But when Po leaves work to witness the selection of the Dragon Warrior (the mighty martial artist who is destined to save the valley from dreadful danger), he somehow finds himself chosen for the position.<br/><br/>Now, with only days before the arrival of the villainous Tai Lung, a powerful snow leopard with destruction on his mind, can Po learn the secrets of kung fu in time and become the hero he so desperately wishes to be?<br/><br/>Although Kung Fu Panda has a lot going for it¬ócool animation, great characters and some wonderful gags (which work particularly well if you're a fan of martial arts movies)¬ó I'm going to go against what seems to be the general consensus, and declare that I thought the ending sucked, and spoilt what might have been an otherwise excellent adventure.<br/><br/>Following loads of wonderful action, plenty of laughs, and some mystical mumbo-jumbo about a magical scroll that contains the secret of unimaginable power, Kung Fu Panda turns into a weak morality tale, preaching that real strength comes from belief in oneself. Whilst I think that being confident and comfortable with who you are is a wonderful sentiment, I do think that a positive mental attitude only gets you so far, and that the mighty rhino-bashing Tai Lung would've torn Po a new one! End of.<br/><br/>Some fans argue that Po used his weaknesses (ie., his fat) to his advantage, deflecting his enemy's more powerful moves; others say that after Tai Lung realised that he could not improve his powers through the use of the Dragon Scroll, he lost his confidence. I say 'hogwash!'.<br/><br/>Tai Lung was a highly trained juggernaut of rage who easily fought his way past guards twice as bulky as Po and defeated five of the best warriors in the country (does that sound like someone lacking confidence to you? I don't think so). Po should have been turned into panda paste.<br/><br/>Of course, there is the theory that once Po worked out that he all he needed to do was be himself, he finally realised his destiny and became the fabled Dragon Warrior. If this is the case, then it's a lame, wishy-washy idea that isn't explained very well .<br/><br/>Either way, the ending spoils the film. And that's a real shame.<br/><br/>5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb."

","Another highly entertaining flick from Dreamworks. Jack Black played a clumsy fat Panda to great effect, and was nicely complimented by the other animal characters. The story was very predictable, but the animation, pacing and great action made up for it. I loved the action sequences, particularly those involving the villain. Out of them all, the 'escape' was probably my favorite sequence.<br/><br/>Though I wouldn't call it a classic, as it lacked the emotional touch of 'Nemo' & Lion King etc, it is entertaining for adults and kids alike, though it kinda seemed a little violent for kids (but then who really cares these days!)."

","From the time I was a little one to now, I have always loved movies and anything else with an Asian flair. From Mulan to Samurai Champloo, Asia's rich and interesting culture have always been in my must-have book, and I have loved them since childhood. Kung-Fu Panda takes an interesting look at this genre, as well as a modern one.<br/><br/>Po, a chubby, yet lovable Panda (Jack Black) works in a noodle shop with his Goose father (David Hong), but dreams of Kung-Fu and fighting with the Fearsome Five, a team made up of Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Viper (Lucy Liu), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Crane (David Cross) and Mantis (Seth Rogen). When the old turtle sage Oogway announces a tournament for the selection of the Dragon Warrior, Po tries to attend, but, because of late arrival, is shut out. When he falls into the stadium after another failed attempt to get in, he is unwittingly selected as the warrior. Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) is now faced with the task of training a panda with great knowledge but little skill in Kung-Fu. Meanwhile, the evil Tai Long (Ian MacShane) has escaped from prison, and is now threatening the village. Can Po live up to his new title and the dreams that keep him going? When the film was advertised, I became very interested. Seeing promo after promo peaked it. When I read the article on this film from USA today, I was surprised to see that a number of adults had gone to see it in the opening weekend! I figured, that's good enough for me, so I got my mom to take me to the theater to see it...and absolutely loved it. It is probably the best film from Dreamworks yet. The characters are what really draw you into the movie and the action/fighting sequences are expertly timed. The voice cast is perfectly cast. Jack Black plays our furry, chubby, kung-fu loving hero Po. Angelina Jolie is the bad-ass tigress who, although brash and thinks Po is a joke at first, is brave and learns to trust in her new comrade. Dustin Hoffman, Jackie Chan, Michael Clarke Duncan and Lucy Liu also round out the cast. The effects and animation also make the movie a must see!"
"D_Burke","9","3","4","11 June 2008"," Not Just a Great Animated Movie- A Great Movie . . . Period!
","I was very entertained by ""Kung-Fu Panda"". This movie ranks among Dreamworks Animation's best along with ""Shrek"", ""Shrek II"", and ""Antz"". The animation as a whole was excellent, including the fantasy sequences that took the form of supposed 2D animation. Even when the animation was 3D, the animation had everything down to a T from the blades of grass to roof shingles to animal's fur.<br/><br/>Of course, since 3D has now become the norm for animated movies, I know that 3D animation alone cannot save a movie. For instance, ""Doogal"", ""Shrek The Third"", and ""Shark Tale"" (which also featured the voices of Jack Black and Angelina Jolie) were big disappointments for me. Fortunately, there was enough good comedy, great action sequences, and intriguing characters to keep me entertained and to rate this movie as the best to come out of this summer so far.<br/><br/>For starters, Jack Black was perfect as Po the Panda. In my opinion, Black was underused in ""Shark Tale"", which was probably why I didn't like that movie so much. Here, he brings his great comic timing and a touch of his Tenacious D personality into this panda character. He especially works very well in the training sequences with Head Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). I thought it odd that his character was the only panda in a story set in China, but I won't get too picky.<br/><br/>The actors who played the Furious Five were also well cast. Angelina Jolie was a natural to play Tigress, who is probably the first truly strong female character in animation history who also isn't involved in a love story subplot of a film. I actually found myself relieved that they left such a subplot out and just concentrated on a great story.<br/><br/>If I have one complaint against the movie, it's that the other four fighters weren't as focused on as they should have been. Yes, there's only so much you can fit into a 90 minute movie, but the snake (Lucy Liu), crane (David Cross), praying mantis (Seth Rogen), and monkey (Jackie Chan) all individually made such intriguing characters. Indeed, this is one of the few animated movies I've seen that merits a sequel, and I hope that all four of them are focused on in that other movie should it come along.<br/><br/>Otherwise, that's my only complaint against the movie. It just worked so well otherwise. Other than the mostly American voice-overs, the movie stayed true to a traditional Kung Fu movie by the likes of Bruce Lee and Sonny Chiba, and also had elements of spaghetti westerns and other movies such as ""Star Wars"". None of that would have been complete with a great Darth Vader-esquire villain like leopard Tai Ling (played by lesser known actor Ian McShane), and an even better Yoda-esquire mentor like tortoise Ancient Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim). This is an altogether incredible movie that I personally can't wait to purchase on DVD. I may even see it again in theaters, and there are few movies that make me want to do that."
"fantasyescapist","Null","4","6","3 July 2008"," With dazzlingly animated fight scenes and the likable panda Po, I found this very entertaining.
","I saw this with a friend at a preview screening last Sat and I was worried it might be like the other forgettable mass-produced animated films, but I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>The voice acting was pretty flawless. This is a very good case of finding the actors(even if they are all well recognised stars) that fit that characters well. I couldn't imagine anyone else voicing Po apart from Jack Black - he just seems to completely embody Po's personality and humour. Jolie also has the severity of her character Tigress while the standout being Hoffman conveys Shifu's exasperation and everything else as the panda's master.<br/><br/>Pacing and Plot: OK, so the plot is probably borrowed form numerous sources but it does have a classic storytelling feel to it, and there are certain parts that don't happen(especially during the climax) exactly the way you expect. Slightly clich√©d, but charming and entertaining enough to overcome it, I think.<br/><br/>Animation: The opening 2D sequence is nothing short of amazing, in my opinion. The fight scenes and Tai Lung's escape is just stunning to behold - both witty and a feast for the eyes. This coupled with the subtle character animation that brings them to life might be overlooked since the masses are probably used to it due to the load of animated films that come out, but it's really well done.<br/><br/>Music: This is where I take my hat off - there are no of those stupid, generic pop songs playing during the film! Thank God! The music is very good, from the orchestral parts I heard and does give one a sense of being in China.<br/><br/>Overall, there are some things not explained(like why Po's dad is a duck and Po's past) but apart from niggles with lack of originality story-wise and some clich√©s, this is really an experience to enjoy fully in a cinema I think, due to the sheer scope of the fight sequences and the cinematography of old China. It has it's quite funny scenes and even if it's not funny all the way through exactly, it has a heart, which is always important to me - it raises it from just flash to having some substance. A very good animated film from Dreamworks and even if the forthcoming sequel isn't as good, this'll be one for me, to enjoy again and again when it arrives on DVD."

","Kung Fu Panda Rated: PG Time: 1:31 Stars: The voices of such notables as: Dustin Hoffman, Jack Black, Lucy Liu, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan and others Final Grade: B+ Overview Summary: This is an animated story of a fat panda, that in his dreams longs to be a kung fu hero, being thrust into his role in destiny to save his village and valley from an ancient and evil foe. If kung fu fight scenes bother you, be aware that there's lots of kung fu action (which some chose to avoid - so fair warning) as well as lots of laughs and action for both kids and parents alike.<br/><br/>This is a family oriented movie, given the fighting scenes, and my family and kid really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The final moral of the story is that the secret to true greatness is found inside of one's self and that you can achieve the greatness you seek if you want it...but a lot more than that happens in the hour and 31 minutes that this film runs.<br/><br/>Now The Details: Our movie opens with a fat lazy panda dreaming of being a great kung fu warrior and saving the world from the throws of evil through his fighting skills and those of the other major fighting skills personified by the crane, snake, monkey and in this case tigress. He then wakes up to the reality of his own peasant life in the family business.<br/><br/>But, as his luck would have it, there's a contest in the village to determine the warrior who will be chosen to defend everyone from a recently escaped evil villain.<br/><br/>By a most humorous stroke of luck, our hero to be is chosen to be the one to defend the village from the evil one. Needless to say, he's as shocked as the heir apparents' are.<br/><br/>There's some good laughs and moments during his rushed training and acclimation to the rest of the group and alas his time to prove himself comes through as he and the bad guy square off to fight over who gets the golden scroll with the all powerful secret message inside.<br/><br/>You can basically guess who wins but what's interesting is that, at the end, the moral that a person's inner self is what determines their own success and that you can do and be whatever down inside you set you r mind's goals to be.<br/><br/>This movie is clocked full of animated action and fighting scenes, lots of humor and 1:31 of family fun.<br/><br/>Enjoy this one with the family and the kids may be talking about it for days.<br/><br/>And that's the I saw it, From Where I Stand.<br/><br/>( The writer is a regular contributor to www.fromwhereistand.info )"

","Went to see Kung Fu Panda on Saturday with very high expectations and I wasn't disappointed in fact, it was better than I thought. I was funny and it has a lot of action and adventure. It is also a movie that leaves you some valuable learning like ""never give up"" and ""always believe in yourself"". A very good story about an Enthusiastic, big and a little clumsy, Po is the biggest fan of kung fu around which doesn't exactly come in handy while working every day in his family's noodle shop. Unexpectedly chosen to fulfill an ancient prophecy, Po's dreams become reality when he joins the world of kung fu and studies alongside his idols, the legendary Furious Five--Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper and Monkey--under the leadership of their guru, Master Shifu. But before they know it, the vengeful and treacherous snow leopard Tai Lung is headed their way, and it's up to Po to defend everyone from the oncoming threat. It is like a tribute to all those Chinese kung fu movies. The cast of voices is excellent, Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, Dustin Hoffman, Seth Rogen and Michael Clark Duncan all with awesome performances. In conclusion, this is one of the best movie of the season and the best animated DreamWorks movie since Shrek 2."

","I hate talking animal movies and CGI movies so when you put those two together, it's usually a pretty bad combination for me. There have been a few exceptions like most of Disney/Pixar's films and now, Kung Fu Panda. I'm a big fan of kung fu movies and I think most fans will enjoy this movie because it seems to have been made specifically for those people.<br/><br/>The story and actually quite good and has a lot of heart. There are some really great action sequences, as well and they really captured the kung fu feel with this movie. I also thought the visuals were great which is rare, at least to me, in a CGI film. There are a lot of very good things about this film that almost everyone should enjoy.<br/><br/>Kung fu fans probably won't be disappointed with this one as I had a blast with it. I was expecting total garbage and actually am happy that I saw it. I'll be picking up the DVD when it comes out."
"arvenohx","9","4","6","20 June 2008"," Truly wonderful, a masterpiece for kids and adults
","Kung Fu Panda is a remarkable film. From the horrid title, you go into the movie expecting some cheap rip off of the Jackie Chan movies. But only a short ways into Kung Fu Panda, you realize that it is a truly beautiful and well done movie. It mixes smart (and yes, sometimes stupid) humor with beautiful rendered and artistically proficient scenes.<br/><br/>Still, the plot (more so ""theme) is atypical for the genre (the old ""underdog"" theme), and the movie at times seems like it wants to fall back upon overused animated movie tools. But this should not deter you at all from the movie. It's stunning in every aspect.<br/><br/>The voice acting? Incredible. Jack Black is truly wonderful as Po, and all of the other actors do a superb job (Angelina Jolie was Master Tigress?! I didn't even know that until the credits.). Sadly, the only character that sounds truly Chinese is the Monkey (voiced by Jackie Chan. You cannot make a good kung-fu movie without him).<br/><br/>Music? Lets just shorten this by saying it deserves an Oscar nomination (or winning *hint hint*) Now I HAVE to wrap up this by writing about oogways death scene. I am truly amazed to say I cried over a dead turtle. And I don't even cry at the end of sad movies! But the pure beauty of this scene is just so moving, even the hardest heart will soften. The music is very wonderful (although I will say I'm glad they refrained the catchy, but god awful ""kung fu fighting"" song to the credits).<br/><br/>Go and see it. You'll see it more than once.<br/><br/>You must believe."
"GrandpaBunche","8","4","6","16 June 2008"," Terrific Kung Fu Epic For the Whole Family
","After churning out mostly mediocre or rubbish animated films for years (SHARK TALE, the SHREK sequels, MADAGASCAR, BEE MOVIE), Dreamworks finally manages to release a piece that gets everything right from start to finish. It's apparent from the film's opening frame that a lot of care and thought went into the making of the delightful KUNG FU PANDA, and while the story is certainly nothing new ¬ó especially to those of us who live and breathe martial arts flicks ¬ó , it tells a familiar tale with a great deal of heart, enthusiasm, and respect for the viewer's intelligence while completely eschewing the anachronistic and largely inappropriate pop culture jokes that worked in the first SHREK and nowhere else since.<br/><br/>Po (voiced by Jack Black) is the fat son of a noodle chef who, though being groomed to take over the family business, has dreams of one day becoming a great kung fu master and hero of the people, but while quite game and enthusiast, he's lazy, clumsy, and has no skills whatsoever. The unlikely wannabe gets his shot at glory when the prophesied escape of the villainous and incredibly skilled Tai Lung (DEADWOOD's Ian McShane) looms imminent and a martial arts master must be named as the sacred Dragon Warrior in order to handle the threat. Po, quite by accident, finds himself awarded the vaunted title, much to the horror and dismay of the diminutive Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) and his balls-out badassed students, the Furious Five, each representing an embodiment of a classical animal-based kung fu style (specifically tiger, mantis, crane, snake, and monkey). All are dumbfounded that a fat load like Po could be the Dragon Warrior and all are at first determined to make sure that he gives up and leaves the temple, but they didn't expect Po's genuine love of what they do to fuel him to give it his best shot. While he's pretty much a washout, Po's girth and enjoyment of his training work to his advantage, and Master Shifu figures out just how to motivate his unwanted new student to greatness, all while his adopted daughter, Master Tigress (Angelina Jolie), seethes at the role that should have gone to her is usurped by one she feels is unworthy. As Tai Lung approaches and Po leaves the temple to accompany his father as the local villagers evacuate before the coming martial apocalypse, the Furious Five advance to stop him, but are unceremoniously handed their asses in a butt-kicking of painfully disheartening proportions. When Master Shifu, no slouch himself, proves unable to defeat Tai Lung ¬ó who, by the way, is also his adoptive child, one in whom he is deeply disappointed because he turned to evil ¬ó , Po returns to save the day after reaching a philosophical epiphany unwittingly provided by his noodle chef dad, providing the ages-old lesson of ""believe in yourself, and you can achieve miracles"" for a new generation of movie-going little ones.<br/><br/>I would have had a great time with KUNG FU PANDA even had I not been a devotee to the martial arts, so I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a fun ""hero's journey"" or training film (a la the Shaw Brothers classic MASTER KILLER), as well as advising lovers of quality animation to see this on the big screen in order to get the full effect of its visual grandeur. As for the individual points of note:<br/><br/>* The one element of the film that I feared would make or break the film turned out to be quite praiseworthy, namely Jack Black's voice acting. I loved Black in the excellent SCHOOL OF ROCK, but find him mostly annoying in just about everything else he's been in because his approach to comedy often strikes me like he's both trying too hard and is attempting to convince everyone watching that he's as funny as he thinks he is. This time, though, he gives a genuine performance that is full of heart and charm, and the viewer definitely comes to love and root for his character.<br/><br/>* Dustin Hoffman was the last person I would have expected to be able to pull of playing that mainstay of kung fu movies, the seasoned master, but he's absolutely perfect as Shifu, a character whose triumphant martial abilities are reflected in Tai Lung's misuse of his teachings, and Master Tigress' feelings of resentment at being passed over as the Dragon Warrior. Shifu conveys as weary exasperation and sadness seldom seen in a character of this type, and I find him much more interesting than many of the master types found in the literally hundreds of martial arts films that I've seen. He's no Simon Yeung, or even Keye Luke for that matter, but he's nonetheless terrific.<br/><br/>* And speaking of terrific master types, Randall Duk Kim's ancient Master Oogway is the finest of this breed since Yoda first showed up in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (1980), before his mystery and wonder were permanently flushed down the toilet in the cinematic Montezuma's Revenge that was STAR WARS: EPISODES I-III. This centered, contemplative figure is a tortoise who's every slow movement conveys both his advanced age and now effortless mastery of his art, as well as his wisdom and connection with the natural world around him. He's even Shifu's master, and Shifu defers to his decree when Oogway pronounces Po to be the Dragon Warrior; Shifu has his doubts about that, but in the end Oogway is proved right beyond the shadow of a doubt. Truly beautiful in every way, I wish Oogway had more screen time.<br/><br/>So don't wait for KUNG FU PANDA to hit DVD or cable. Go see its plethora of visual storytelling wonders on the big screen as it was intended, and I highly doubt you'll be disappointed."
"moutonbear25","8","4","6","8 June 2008"," THE Big Funny Panda
","Fortune cookie wisdom is imparted throughout the colorful KUNG FU PANDA. Some of it makes no sense out of context but it all amounts to some very simple, very basic advice about believing in the warrior within. ""There are no accidents,"" claims the coolest of Zen master turtles after a panda drops from the sky at just the right moment to be deemed the next Dragon Warrior. There are especially no accidents when no risk is taken. That panda is of course the panda from the title and from the moment this lazy emotional eater is ""discovered"" as the warrior that will go on to save the kingdom, you know exactly how the entire thing will play out. Po (voiced by an increasingly subtle Jack Black) will drown in doubt while he trains for something he doesn't believe himself capable of; the other animals will badger him into giving up; but eventually, he will find his inner kung fu master and save the day. Subsequently and expectedly, reviewers will call it out for its lack of originality. That's how it goes.<br/><br/>So it isn't so original. No big deal. What it lacks in originality, it makes up for in style and humour. Relatively new directors, Mark Osborne and John Stevenson have created a multihued ancient China that moves with stealth precision between enchantment and explosive energy. Its inhabitants are geese and rabbits that live their lives in the shadow of lore. As long as all is peaceful, then they can blissfully enjoy their noodle soups in the town square and if anything should happen to collapse that peace, then they have the kung fu specialized Furious Five ¬ñ a tiger, a monkey, a crane, a snake and oddly enough, a mantis ¬ñ to protect them from whatever evil lurks. No one member of the community has more faith in these five than Po. His idolatry of these heroes extends to numerous posters on his walls and action figures by his bed. Black plays Po as the hardcore geek that hides his enthusiasm and secret desire to be a part of it all in fear of being ridiculed for wanting the impossible. Po is that unfortunate fat kid from school that wants to hang with all the cool kids, hates that he's stuck working at the local fast food joint after school and knows that there's nothing he can do about it. Wait; was I that kid? Is that why I love him?<br/><br/>KUNG FU PANDA is overloaded with voice talent. Any scene with Po is usually hilarious as I guess Black knows what it's like to be the unlikely guy hanging with the in crowd. However, when he isn't in the picture, the delivery from the majority of the A-list cast is often bland and purely functional. Po, and his kung fu trainer, Shifu (a frustrated and disgruntled, yet still minutely optimistic Dustin Hoffman) trade quips with fervor and weight and make for much giddiness. The Furious Five, not so much. Considering they're voiced by actors as varied as Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan and Seth Rogen, you would think they would provide for plenty of conflicting antics but they end up reduced to nothing more than another obstacle for Po to overcome. I'm no kung fu expert but I'm pretty sure gossiping and bad mouthing members of the team when they aren't there (and sometimes even when they're right in front of them) is not part of the package. Our heroes aren't always what we hope they will be when we finally find ourselves face to face with them but these five could have certainly been truer to their furious form if some element of development had been given to them.<br/><br/>Still, despite its unevenness and seemingly simple approach, KUNG FU PANDA is great wisdom wrapped in even greater fun and often breathtaking animation. Sometimes the simplest of lessons are the ones that are hardest to learn. (Now I'm a fortune cookie.) Perhaps the subtlest lesson the film passes on is to relinquish your control over the destiny of your own life. Po never thought he would find himself surrounded by his heroes, getting the chance to realize his life long dream of becoming a kung fu master but here he is suddenly. Master Shifu never thought he would be training such a useless lump but here his is as well. It is only when each character let go of their egos and expectations that they saw how to make their situation work. Shedding your own expectation for KUNG FU PANDA to be something more than what it really is will allow for the good times intended to be had and an unexpected tranquility to seep into your mind."

The 5 great warriors were very poorly utilized and not given nearly enough screen time, It was pretty lame that they hired great voice talent and followed up by giving them all only a couple of lines.<br/><br/>There were 3 great actions scenes but the ending was so anti-climactic that none of them really saved the worth of the movie.

"amypeterson12345","10","5","9","3 July 2008"," Dreamworks should be Proud
","After the garbage that was Shrek 3, Over the Hedge, and SharkTale, and the only mediocre Madagascar, when I saw the preview for Dreamwork's newest film Kung Fu Panda, I laughed at the stupidity of a movie involving an overweight Panda trying to become a kung fu master. Eventually my sister dragged me to see it with her, where I discovered just how sorely wrong I was.<br/><br/>Not only is Kung Fu Panda visually appealing - the animation and scenery is breathtakingly beautiful - well written - you'll find a deeper and more engaging story here than merely a Panda trying to master martial arts - and hilarious - there are a multitude of hysterical jokes, which astonishingly are nearly all kid-friendly - but it manages to grasp what other Dreamworks films cannot even attempt: a heart. The fight scene between the awesome master Shifu and the truly evil Tai Lung doesn't only work because of the fantastic animation and the dramatic music, but because of the background story that was worked into it. The secret of the dragon scroll was so heartwarming that even the harshest critic will be touched. Po, instead of being rude and arrogant like I expected, was lovable and his longing to reach his goal is something all of us can identify with. The Furious Five's gradual acceptance of and friendship with Po was sweet and Shifu is perhaps the best-developed character in Dreamworks history. His quest for inner peace and the troubling relationship with Tai Lung in his past lead to some extremely emotional scenes. Even the end credits and the touching scene that follows them are wonderfully visually appealing.<br/><br/>Some people are saying that they don't like this movie, because it supposedly glorifies obesity and stupidity. I say they must have gone to the movie theater wearing blindfolds and earplugs. Po didn't succeed in facing Tai Lung because of his weight; he succeeded because he believed in himself! This movie teaches us that we are all special and loved regardless of size, body shape or race, something important we should really be teaching our future generations.<br/><br/>So all in all, go and see Kung Fu Panda! It's right up there with Pixar's finest like Finding Nemo and will be a film the whole family will love!"
"Sedatedwombat","9","5","9","16 June 2008"," 'Panda' is Peerless
","In recent years Dreamworks animation has been a sort of hit and miss production company. Some of their films have been nearly as good as the Pixar films (Shreks, Over the Hedge), but others have been close to complete crap (Shark Tale, Madagascar, Bee Movie). With 'Kung Fu Panda' Dreamworks hits the jackpot.<br/><br/>The film is great because of how simple it is. Simple story, simple morals, simple (but very effective) comedy, and simple style. The movie is just good to watch. You could go and see it with your family, or your best friends---its a neutral sort of movie.<br/><br/>Jack Black was the by far the best choice for the main character, Po, and you REALLY get a sense of the real Jack Black. He is such a passionate soul in most of his movies---this is especially highlighted in 'Panda.' Apart from having a simple and intriguing story, the movie has some legit fight scenes. Scenes that could only be made with animals shown in the film.<br/><br/>Honestly, this is a great movie. If you want to feel good about going to see a movie by yourself, with friends, family, a girlfriend, boyfriend, whatever---truly, this is a great choice. DO NOT think this movie is just for kids, because it really is not.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is a clever, refreshing, and entertaining flick. It may very well be the best movie in theaters right now.<br/><br/>Excellent."
"sunshowers","9","5","9","15 June 2008"," I can't wait to see it again!
","Kung Fu Panda is the story of Po (an overweight, underachieving panda) who spends his days serving noodles at his father's restaurant and his nights dreaming of kung fu greatness. When the wise Master Oogwei (a tortoise) foretells the return of a deadly warrior who is bent on exacting revenge on their village, he and Master Shifu (a red panda) must find the fabled Dragon Warrior who is destined to save them all. Much to everyone's surprise, and seemingly by accident, Master Oogwei chooses Po. With entire village's fate in his hands, Po must face the countless doubters all around him as well as the doubt in his own heart.<br/><br/>Though I was excited to go see this movie, I had some reservations. Jack Black's bumbling-yet-lovable shtick can be too much at times, and as a starring actor he can be rather polarizing. I'm happy to say that he blew me away in his role as Po. The part was clearly written for Jack Black and is very much in keeping with his personality, but rather than bringing out that annoying side of his, here he was nothing short of absolutely endearing. I suppose it doesn't hurt that Po is a roly poly panda bear, but Jack Black injected the character with so much heart and soul that you couldn't help rooting for him from the very start, no matter how hopeless it seemed. Indeed, he had the audience laughing out loud by the end of the very first line.<br/><br/>Dustin Hoffman shines equally in his role as Master Shifu, the kung fu master charged with training Po in the art. While Po is clearly flawed, Shifu is just as insecure and uncertain due to past tragedy, and he too must learn to trust that destiny will right things in the end. A number of other well-known talents voiced the roles of the Furious Five, a team of warriors trained under Shifu. The Furious Five are all Dragon Warrior hopefuls (as well as Po's idols), until Po is picked over them. It was fun to recognize their voices (Angelina Jolie as Tigress, Lucy Liu as Viper, Seth Rogen as Mantis, Jackie Chan as Monkey, and David Cross as Crane), but their roles were largely unexplored. That's okay, I was so entertained by the developing relationship between Po and Shifu that I wasn't much interested in the rest of them. Other memorable supporting parts were the roles of Po's noodle chef father (who is, inexplicably, a goose), the prison warden (an imposing rhinoceros voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan), and Master Oogwei who was reminiscent of a softer, gentler Master Yoda and is brought to life so beautifully by Randall Duk Kim.<br/><br/>The story itself is simple and predictable (and, as some critics have been quick to point out, clich√©d), but it is told so well that I can't think of anything I would have changed. Obviously there is an element of the fantastic, but the plot is woven together so seamlessly that it is easy for small children to keep track of and yet interesting enough to keep adults on the edge of their seats. Speaking for myself, there were several scenes that had me biting my nails with anxiety, and others that brought tears to my eyes.<br/><br/>Many of the laughs involved classic references to the martial arts movie genre. Having grown up in a household where martial arts movies were a big part of family movie nights, I can tell you that the writers definitely did their homework. Once again, critics will complain that they just recycled old clich√©s, but that's the point. Anyone who is a fan of old kung fu movies will appreciate how well researched this is. Honestly, anyone who complains of this as being ""unoriginal"" is probably the same kind of movie critic who will complain about there being too much singing and dancing in a musical. It's part of the genre, so love it or leave it. <br/><br/>Lastly, the animation was absolutely incredible. Dreamworks really outdid themselves here. The characters' movements were graceful and fluid... well, maybe not Po's so much, but you get what I'm saying. This was absolutely vital in a movie that features so much movement, and the animators did a wonderful job. There was also such incredible attention to detail. I'd like to watch the movie several times over just to take it all in. And the way they captured the treacherous beauty of the Chinese mountain ranges was breathtaking. Several scenes looked just like Chinese watercolor paintings.<br/><br/>In closing, I'd definitely recommend this movie to viewers of all ages looking for a movie that is hilarious yet moving, and visually stunning. The whole audience laughed and cried together, and the experience reminded me of why some movies have to be seen in theaters."

Afterwards we love to discuss what we saw and re-enjoy the best moments, but you could have heard a pin drop.

Don't expect something different or unique done to the status quo of computer-generated animation and storytelling. But of that, Kung Fu Panda is much more entertaining than some of the other recent, past efforts, and the quality is above par as well! I found myself not minding Kung Fu Panda.

","In the climactic kung fu battle wannabe ""Dragon Warrior"" Tai Lung gazes upon the sacred Dragon Scroll which reveals the secret of Martial Arts Mastery and Power, and is left chagrined and perplexed. Panda Po (Jack Black) hysterically admits to the evil and powerful Snow Leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane), ""I didn't get it the first time either¬Ö"" Jack Black is awesome as the kung fu Panda in Directors Mark Osbourne and John Stevenson's ""Kung Fu Panda""¬óone of the best movies of the year so far. ""Kung Fu Panda"" is definitely one of the funniest and most entertaining movies in a long while. Screenwriters Jonathan Aibel and Glen Berger, and Storywriters Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Vows' ""Kung Fu Panda"" has an inspiring and familiar message. Even in its familiarity and crisp spot on humor, ""Kung Fu Panda"" is surprisingly touching. After all, this is an unlikely hero's transformation tale. At the story arc Po confesses to Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), ""If there is anyone who could... make me, not me¬Ö""¬óit is Shifu. ""Kung Fu Panda"" also gets it right for the story of martial arts mastery, and perhaps mastery as a whole. This is refreshing and is also a great message for kids¬óas trite as that sounds.<br/><br/>Fat slacker Panda Po, who dreams one day of being a kung fu master, works for his Dad, Mr. Ping (James Hong) in the family noodle shop. Note that Po's father is a duck, who dreams one day that Po will take over the family business. In a bizarre circumstance ancient tortoise Master Oogway (Randal Duk Kim) chooses Po as the Dragon Warrior. As Dragon Warrior, Po inherits the secrets of the sacred Dragon Scroll. The Dragon Warrior must protect the Valley from the powerful Tai Lung, who seeks the Dragon Scroll for himself. Oogway's student Master Shifu (Hoffman) had raised the young and gifted snow leopard Tai Lung (McShane) as his own to become the Dragon Warrior. However, Oogway sensed the darkness in Tai Lung, and dismissed him as Dragon Warrior. Oogway was forced to defeat the enraged Tai Lung, and banish him. Now Tai Lung returns.<br/><br/>Shifu tells Oogway he is horribly mistaken in choosing Po. Oogway reminds his old friend, ""There are no accidents."" He also tells Shifu that the Dragon Warrior will bring peace to the Valley and ""bring peace to you"". Shifu's students The Furious Five¬óTigress, Monkey, Mantis, Crane, and Viper, quickly dismiss Po. Admittedly, Po says ""I sucked more in the history of sucking¬Ö"" In particular Tigress (insightful and arrogant Angelina Jolie) tells Po, ""You don't belong here."" Here Directors Osbourne and Stevenson deliver their message home. The pitfall of the greatly skilled is arrogance, and this is embodied by the Tigress and the Furious Five, and in fact Shifu. Surprisingly Shifu does not get it, until the end. Shifu can't rely on what he knows to make Po this great Dragon Warrior. A master can only show The Path or The Way, and it is up to the student to reclaim the greatness within. It is all about discipline, courage, and humility. ""Kung Fu Panda"" does all this in a very hilarious and visually spectacular package. I was laughing hysterically during the training session with Po and Shifu as they dueled with chopsticks over a delicious dumpling. The Furious Five trading blows with Tai Lung on the hanging mountain bridges was visually stunning.<br/><br/>Jack Black really makes ""Kung Fu Panda"" work. As voiced by Black, Po realizes the ridiculousness of his situation, but ultimately realizes this is his last chance to own up to his own greatness. Black is both hysterical and profoundly genuine. Dustin Hoffman is amazing as Shifu. Ironically and humorously he is a martial arts master, albeit a rodent of some sort, in love with his own accomplishments, clueless to The Way. Fortunately, Po comes into his life. Randal Duk Kim is great as the true Master Oogway. Angelina Jolie is brash and spirited as the skilled Tigress.<br/><br/>""Kung Fu Panda"" is one the best movies of the year. Besides being hysterical fun, it has great heart and a wonderful story. See ""Kung Fu Panda""."

","I love shows and movies that are set in Asia and also animal films too...Like this excellent film. <br/><br/>In this film, Po the Panda, was the laziest of all the animals in the Valley of Peace and a typical ""I'm your biggest fan"" kind of guy when it comes to the Furious Five. With a powerful enemy Tai Lung the Snow Leopard at the gates, all hope is pinned on a martial arts hero known as ""The Dragon Warrior"" to rise to save the day. When Po unwittingly shows up in the midst of the martial arts competition, the masters are shocked to see that this unmotivated panda bears the mark of the Chosen One. I love (out the Furious Five) Tigress and Monkey. Did you know that the individual fighting styles of the Furious Five members (Crane, Mantis, Tiger, Monkey and Viper) are actual martial art styles modeled after those particular animals.<br/><br/>I don't have a favorite scene, because I love the WHOLE film and it's lesson on believing in yourself and being your own hero - age-old lessons that I don't mind at all. And I do love the musical score by Hans Zimmer and John Powell. As I say a million times I love an excellent soundtrack in a movie."
"guusebumps","10","4","7","14 June 2008"," Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon + Once Upon a Time in China + Jackie Chan's Drunken Master + Bruce Lee + Shaw Brothers Movies + 3D Animation = Kung Fu Panda
","Firstly I can say that I am blown up by this movie. I am a fan of cartoon movies and I also a fan of Kung Fu movies. I can say that this movie is an amalgam of the many past Hong Kong kung fu movies from Shaw Brothers Wire Fu to Bruce Lee to Jackie Chan to Jet Lee in the wrapping of 3D animation.<br/><br/>When I watch Po, I remember Jackie Chan in The Drunken Master. When I watch Master Shifu, I remember many of the white haired kung fu teachers characters to Jet Li's Master Wong Fei Hung. When I watch Master Crane, I remember Fu Shen's depiction of Fang Shih Yu on high poles. When I watched Master Tigress and Master Viper, I remember those lady kung fu warriors from Cheng Pei-pei to Michelle Yeoh to Zhang Zi Yi. When I watch Master Mantis and Master Monkey, I remember kung fu stars like Liu Jia Liang, Gordon Liu, and many others.<br/><br/>The training devices so much resembles many Shaw Brothers kung fu movies with pivoting parts and so on. I particularly remember the Shao Lin wooden man scenes from those movies.<br/><br/>The fight scene between Tai Lung and Master Shifu resembles many scenes from Hong Kong kung fu movies about a skillful students goes bad. The fight scene between the Furious Five and Tai Lung resembles many Jet Li's/Modern kung Fu Movies (like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) fight scenes. The fight scene between Po and Tai Lung is literally taken from Jackie Chan's Drunken Master/old movies. When Master Shifu told Po to hit the doll, Po was imitating Bruce Lee's moves.<br/><br/>The story is not unfamiliar in many from zero to hero Kung Fu movies with doubts from the teacher, the hard training and so on, also with the antics and humor in them.<br/><br/>In short, this movie encased all the good times in kung fu cinema in the clothing of 3D cartoon animation, almost too much for me to digest. I had a really really really good time watching this movie and could not stop laughing from start to finish."

This movie is great in many levels, it ain't silly-funny and doesn't rely on anacronich humor like Shrek heavily does (you know, modern stuff being used on medieval times)or belch and fart jokes, the only ""modern"" thing I found was the fact that Po the main character it's somewhat of a Fan boy of the legendary Kung Fu Warriors (it has their action figures and collects souvenirs), other than that it's a great Kung-fu ""chosen one"" type movie done with the best animation I have seen in years, it felt kinda short, but it's a great film to watch ... and collect."

The CG animation easily stands up next to Pixar's work, and even the 2-D animated opening was beautifully done. I would've loved to see them even do the whole film in that style.<br/><br/>Plenty of laughs to be had for audiences of any age.

"Smells_Like_Cheese","9","4","7","7 June 2008"," Really cute and fun!
","Kung Fu Panda, when I saw this trailer, I have to admit, it looked pretty lame, it just seemed like a typical CGI kids film that wouldn't be much fun for the grown up's and like it would be forced humor. But I decided to go ahead and see the movie today, I'm so glad that I gave it chance because this was such an enjoyable film not just for me, but the kids as well. As I looked around the theater, everyone was just having so much fun watching Kung Fu Panda, the jokes, the animation, the voices, the story, I felt like I was watching real kung fu movie. The action sequences were so exciting and you couldn't help but just cheer for the warriors. I loved how the animals represented all the kung fu movie: the viper, the tiger, the praying mantas, the monkey, the crane, and the panda. This movie is just so much for the entire family to watch.<br/><br/>Po is a panda who is just dreaming of one day to learn kung fu like his idols, the fantastic five, but his father wishes for him to take over their noodle restaurant. Bu when Oogway has a vision and tells Shifu that he is having a vision of Tai Lung, a student gone evil, is about to come back, he picks the ""dragon warrior"", which is Po. But Shifu sees Po as well as the fantastic five, they're all disappointed and don't believe in him. But after Tai Lung escapes, Shifu has to learn to believe in Po and help him with the strengths and the ""secret ingredient"" that he has.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda is one of the year's most fun and entertaining movies that anyone could enjoy. I know that most of Dreamwork's cartoon films are not always as memorable as the Disney and Pixar combination, but they do pull out some great films. I just loved the scene where Shifu is training Po how to fight and they realize that it is food that is Po's strength, the fight for a dumpling was just so much fun and incredibly entertaining. I really enjoyed Kung Fu Panda with a passion, it's a big recommendation, it has great comedy, and some really terrific characters that will all get you in the mood for some kung fu fighting. Not to mention: Jack Black, Jackie Chan, Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, and Lucy Lui, plus many more, how could you not love a cast like that? Believe me, this is a fun movie.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Floated2","3","5","10","7 October 2010"," Not really fresh, rather boring
","I found Kung Fu Panda to be rather boring and very typical. The plot has been done many times and the other times it were done better. I also found the jokes and gags in this film to be way too childish and immature. I know its meant for children and younger teens but this film just didn't seem that great, and it also sends a rather bad message. Kung Fu Panda brings us absolutely nothing new. Perhaps it's me getting older, but the humor nowadays feels very shallow in these animated movies. And the almost non-stop violence, because there really is. I don't mind action movies, or even martial arts movies but this is clearly a movie with intended major demographics in ages 8-12, and hopefully a sizeable number of high school kids so the music and animation must be perfected. The characters were okay. Jack Black was the right choice for Po, along with the other cast but overall the film was for the most part plain boring."
"Rough_Cat","6","5","10","16 July 2008"," Weak, but well made for kids
","When one goes to see a movie of this nature, it is expected that they will compare it to its peers; Finding Nemo etc. However, I cannot even come close to putting this movie in the same category as Finding Nemo when it comes to ratings. Let me explain.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda is an easy 92 minutes, that will not only leave children in hysterics at the good clean humour, but will not leave you fuming at Dreamworks for taking another hour and a half of your life. Jack Black brings a full blown feast of his personality to the table, and Dustin Hoffman does a stellar job as the diminutive kung fu master. Jolie, Liu and Chan hardly feature in this star studded cast. The animation is as good as you expect these days, and the pace of the movie doesn't let anything to be desired.<br/><br/>However, I do have a few bones to pick with this film. One can go see Toy Story and be captured by the notion of figurines coming to life while the human beings are away, or see Finding Nemo and be content with the assumption that all the beings of the ocean can talk to each other - while they still live in sea anemones etc. These movies thrive on these settings to aid and progress the plot of the movie. One has to wonder watching Kung Fu Panda, was there any other point to personifying these animals other than to play on our feelings as to what is 'cute', and sell movie tickets to parents with children? There were little, if any, jokes for older generations, whilst the plot line was nothing but your typical underdog story. In the end, one is reminded to believe in one's self etc... blah blah blah. This is apart from the many many many MANY continuity errors that might or might not irritate you.<br/><br/>So, for the performances by Jack Black and Hoffman, as well the great animation and value for young children in the silly humour, I can give it a 6/10. As far as movies go, this does not measure up as much as other movies in its class, and certainly not as much as other movies in general, and I believe that more care was needed to take this good movie and make it a great one.<br/><br/>Strongly recommended for children and bored adults who think it's cute and funny to see a fat panda try to do Kung Fu - no doubt there will be many of you."
"CosmoBrown","5","10","25","8 June 2008"," Mediocre Panda
","Can't believe the number of glowing reviews this has been getting. The Incredibles, the Toy Story movies, Shrek 2, Monsters Inc.--those movies deserve glowing reviews. This one was entertaining but forgettable.<br/><br/>The story has no surprises at all. Po is named the Chosen One. Po trains to fight bad guy, initially frustrating crotchety trainer but ultimately winning him over. Po fights bad guy and wins. That's it. That's the whole story.<br/><br/>You'd think with a story that thin there'd be lots of room for character development. But there wasn't. There were a lot of pratfalls. Jack Black improvised the occasional bit of funny dialogue, but there weren't a lot of laughs in my theater. The Furious Five characters had no personalities at all. The villain was villainous in the most familiar and boring way possible. <br/><br/>Visually, the movie had some nice moments. The fight scenes were fun to watch. I really enjoyed the villain's escape from a very impressive prison. I also liked the look of the turtle Master. And the scene in which Po is trained to become great at kung fu using his desire to eat a dumpling was great. But overall the movie was unsatisfying."
"Jose-Joaquin-Fernandez","2","6","13","20 September 2015"," Its hard work that matters, not fate
","I hate the idea behind this movie, which is that it doesn't matter how hard you work or train; its all about fate and destiny. You can be a mediocre but if you are the chosen one, don't worry, you will not only surpass everybody else but you will be the best. Tell this to every athlete and see what his response will be. Our kids should learn that to make a difference in sports, you must work hard, train hard, eat well. You will not win a medal just because you horoscope says so. In the movie, although the hero trains and works at last, it will not match the years and whole life dedication of training that other members of the team have. So the movie has a very bad moral teaching."
"seawalker","6","3","5","25 August 2008"," Not a disaster, just a bit disappointing.
","It is not a disaster, but I thought that ""Kung Fu Panda"" was a bit disappointing.<br/><br/>""Kung Fu Panda"" is big, bright and colourful (and, by the way, looks wonderful in an IMAX DMR print). It does have wonderful animation, some nice comedy sequences and good characters, but ""Kung Fu Panda"" is not nearly as funny as it could have been, and is severely lacking in character.<br/><br/>I think the worst crime of ""Kung Fu Panda"" is the waste of a potentially top class voice cast. Half the fun of modern animated movies, especially for adults, is in the spotting of various celebrity voices having fun. ""Kung Fu Panda"" manages to leech all of the character and idiosyncraticness out of the voices of fine character actors like Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, and others, that you may as well have used a cast of unknowns.<br/><br/>A real shame, then, but not a total waste. My Nephew (12 years old) liked it. My Niece (11 years old) thought that it was OK."
"SHarris11-1","8","3","5","30 June 2008"," Really Surprised by this Film
","Kung Fu Panda is one of the better animated films of the year. Of course that's not saying much because most animated films are all about humor that is constantly in your face and is on the verge of being annoying. I went to see this on the recommendation of a friend which surprised me since he HATES kids movies like these nowadays. Walking out of this I can say that my friend was right as this really does deliver for a movie called ""Kung Fu Panda."" <br/><br/>Now the plot is basically pretty generic. A panda who dreams of becoming a kung fu master, when he just sells noodles. One day he is chosen by the wise old turtle as the one who will stop a evil snow leopard. Then he basically goes through training for most of the movie. The plot is not the glowing part of the movie except their is some charm in seeing this buffoon, for lack of a better term, grow into a kung fu master.<br/><br/>No, what makes Kung Fu Panda shine is the action in the movie. And not only the action but the characters as well. I'm talking of course about the villain and the master. The villain in this movie may have seemed pretty generic, but he's the first villain in a long time that actually scared me. And also the old master is pretty well done too. But the action in the movie is spot-on. Some of the action scenes are really intense. <br/><br/>The humor in this movie was nice to because it was a departure from that piece of garbage that was Shrek the Third where humor was just out their in the open because it needed to be. None of this humor felt forced, and the opening sequence was just laugh out loud funny. <br/><br/>In short, see this movie and go in with an open mind. I'm guessing that you will be pleasantly surprised."
"Grant_Price","8","3","5","29 June 2008"," ""You wanna go see Kung Fu Panda?"" ""....Yes.""
","Since the explosion of computer generated animation onto the big screen in recent years, Dreamworks has been the main perpetrator in overexposing the world to the genre. For every brilliant, nurtured and expertly crafted Pixar creation there is a lazy Dreamworks equivalent, heavily relying on pop culture references and famous voice talent to disguise the fact that the films suck. Yes, I'm including Shrek in this. It is a bad movie and after just seven years looks ridiculously dated. So what does any of this have to do with Kung Fu Panda? Well, because somehow Dreamworks have managed to perform a complete U-turn in their thinking and release an animated movie that isn't just good, it is excellent. I say 'somehow,' although it doesn't take William James Sidis to realise that when Pixar are receiving ten times more critical and commercial acclaim than you are, following their blueprint for success might just be a good idea.<br/><br/>So what is detailed on this blueprint? A good storyline for a start, which in Kung Fu Panda is essentially Star Wars without the stars. A Panda named Po dreams of becoming a martial arts master whilst stuck in his day job at the noodle restaurant (which, you know, is so indicative of Chinese culture.) He gets his shot when Yoda makes Obi-Wan Kenobi take Po as a padawan and train him in the ways of the kung fu force just in time to combat the evil Darth Vader, who has recently escaped from a prison staffed entirely by rhinos and is looking to exact bloody vengeance on his former master and rule the Chinese galaxy. Except in this case Yoda is a tortoise named Oogway, Obi-Wan is...something called Shifu and Vader is a snow leopard named Tai Lung. Additionally, there are five other martial arts masters, the legendary Furious Five (a tiger, a crane, a mantis, a viper and a monkey), who were trained by Shifu and do not take kindly to Po's intrusion into their perfectly balanced lives. Intersperse this with several scenes of ass kicking seemingly lifted from Jackie Chan's 'Legend of the Drunken Master' and you have one potent recipe for success.<br/><br/>However, the characters must be interesting and likable for the story to work. Thankfully they all are. From the initial dream narration of Jack Black's eponymous panda (his first truly funny role since 'School Of Rock') through to the final scene, the excellent voice work coupled with the stellar animation brings each and every character satisfyingly to life. Stand-outs include Dustin Hoffman as master Shifu, Ian McShane, who introduces a sense of dignity into Tai Lung not consistent with bad guys in children's films, and Randall Duk Kim as Oogway, who receives some of the funniest lines. He also pulls the best facial expressions.<br/><br/>The only problem with Kung Fu Panda is the relative under-utilisation of the Furious Five. Here we have characters voiced by the likes of Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu and David Crane and they are not really given enough chances to speak at all. Jackie Chan's Monkey, for instance, has about three lines of dialogue. Also, aside from their fantastic fight scene against Tai-Lung, they have little to do. This is clearly something to be exploited for the inevitable sequels, unless the whole word goes mental and decides to see Shrek 4 in record numbers, prompting parts 5 to 8 to be rushed into production instead of KFPII. Luckily, the world will then explode from the sheer irrationality of that event ever happening, so we'll never have to see them.<br/><br/>Basically, Dreamworks have produced a movie that both fans and people that intensely dislike their studio will enjoy. Sure, it probably won't be as rewarding as Pixar's Wall-E but who cares? As master Oogway says, ""Quit, don't quit. Noodles, don't noodles."" Think about that one. Or don't."

","Even though he is as much a motor-mouth as so many other actors who become annoying with time, there is something incessantly likable about Jack Black. Put his voice in a warm big fluffy Panda, and you just have to love him. Put this Panda in a Kung Fu setting complete with training-school dojo, grand masters and a nemesis to fear, and you have the first Dreamworks Animation movie that can stand up among Pixar's annual excellence as one of the best 3D animation movies made.<br/><br/>A Giant Panda is a 250-pound black-and-white bear that lives in the mountains of China, and although carnivorous, the panda has a diet which is 99% bamboo. That's how pacifist it is. But when Po (Jack Black) gets accidentally selected as the mighty Dragon Warrior by the Grand Master, there is no option left but for Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) to train the clumsy Panda into a Warrior of the highest order ¬ñ much to the resentment of the Furious Five (Tigress, Monkey, Viper, Crane, Mantis). But Po, as much as he loves Kung Fu lore, would rather eat. Yes, that's how pacifist he is. But Master Shifu has not much choice as his ex-student, the evil Tai Lung, has escaped from his maximum security prison to claim the position of Dragon Warrior for himself.<br/><br/>Some sequences in this movie are breathtaking, I exulted at the thought of animation finally telling us such diverse stories. Two sequences (and this is not a spoiler): Tai Lung's escape from prison and the foot-bridge fight are extraordinary in exigency. Dreamworks has been churning out animated movies for a few years now, but apart from Shrek, none of their movies have really hit any mark. But this is easily the best animated movie out of their bucket yet. The voice cast, although stellar, does not overshadow the characters with their star-power. The likes of Jackie Chan and Angelina Jolie get limited voice-time, but just as much as the movie requires. Jack Black & Dustin Hoffman are wonderful as loud obnoxious student & controlled cool master. And unlike Madagascar, the movie has very soft colors, curves and a glowing focus. It works very well with the cuddly look of the Panda.<br/><br/>A special mention for Tai Lung. Not since Lion King's Scar has a villain taken himself so seriously. Tai Lung is a warrior extraordinaire, and he is beyond humor or humility. Just like Jeremy Irons' Scar, Ian McShane's Tai Lung speaks with a sense of superiority. It makes him that much more of a nemesis ¬ñ a villain worthy of a much more formidable opponent than a pacifist panda. See, that's how impressive his sense of superiority is! My rating --> 4 of 5"

","Kung Fu Panda - Po the Panda (Jack Black) must somehow become a Kung Fu Master in order to save the Valley of Peace from a villainous snow leopard, Tai Lung. Set in the legendary world of ancient China, it features the voice talents of Angelina Jolie, David Cross, Dustin Hoffman, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, and Jackie Chan (kind of).<br/><br/>At first glance the movie looked like a pass, mostly because of a crap title and Jack Black's less than good batting average lately. The kung fu genre has also kind of been mocked and done to death. This is the day of CGI and the superheroes.<br/><br/>But this movie, on the whole, is delightful. It is funny and cool, and not in a topical way. It also stays away from the usual fart and pee jokes that movie execs push in when they can't admit they don't know what kids like these days. No. This movie is actually honest to goodness funny. It's also got some very good action sequences, and doesn't do the same tired montages we've seen before. Po learning shaolin in a couple days seems to go down a lot smoother than Daniel-san winning a karate contest after a week of manual labor, because of the excellent decision to do this in cartoon format, and because of Po himself. <br/><br/>There hasn't been quite this good a protagonist in an animated film in awhile. Po is a goodnatured but cowardly and overweight nerd, just like most martial arts nerds. He's the sort of guy who worships the martial arts, like me and my friends used to (hell, still do), but never had the time or discipline to learn (1 year of Aikido and 3 months of Tae Kwon Do for me. Nothing stuck). Speaking of martial arts, the movie doesn't shy away from the action either. There's about as much awesomeness as a PG cartoon can get away with. The animators did an excellent job. Of course this movie treads on familiar ground (""believing in yourself"" etc etc). It's a labor of love towards the martial arts and an attempt to keep their spirit alive.<br/><br/>Jack Black plays it just right without going overboard like he's prone to do, and the result is one of my favorite characters in their extensive movie list. Dustin Hoffman plays sound support as the Red Panda Master. Seh Rogen is hilarious and Ian McShane always plays a good villain as the Evil Leopard Tai Lung. It was a pleasant surprise to hear Michael Clarke Duncan and David Cross as well.<br/><br/>I'll probably purchase the DVD for this one. A truly pleasant surprise from a movie I expected little from about a panda nobody expected anything from, Kung Fu Panda gets an A-.<br/><br/>(now don't get greedy an make a sequel now.

","Family movies over the past couple of years have digressed into mindless entertainment, save a few examples. The humor has been shallow, nearly non-existent. To me a family movie is something where the entire family enjoy it. The humor appeals to both children (potty humor, slap stick) to the older crowd (CLEVERLY disguised innuendo and classic media references). I would argue that Family movies are the most difficult genre to work in, because one must successfully strike that delicate balance while being neither preachy or boring.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda is a worthy entry in to the pantheon of the classics. While I am not arrogant enough to place this one on the level of Disney from the golden age to the Pixar achievements, it makes its own unique contribution to a tired story that has been played out time and time again. The kind hearted, but initially inept subject overcoming their shortcomings is a movie staple. However, its treatment in this story is fresh. The voice actors play their bits wonderfully. While I was aware of a star studded cast going in, they allowed their characters to speak for them rather than vice versa.<br/><br/>So, the contrived plot points are really what hold this movie back. But, the humor with how they are treated allow this to be looked over. Instead, look for the interesting way that clich√©s are handled. I enjoyed this film. I had fun, and that's what I wanted."

While first glance at a trailer or poster will have you believing that the cgi family film powerhouse has simply extended its range to include the animals native to the far east, Dreamworks has just used those techniques to sell you a film that actually deviates from the formula with which we have become so accustomed. I wouldn't go as far as to call ""Panda"" innovative, but more so that it stays fresh amidst the over- processed films of its kind.<br/><br/>""Panda"" stars Jack Black as Po, the overweight Panda who is the son of a noodle-making goose. While Po's father hopes to pass down the noodle-making business, of course Po dreams otherwise. He loves the world of ancient kung fu and his idols are the Furious Five, five kung fu-trained animals that serve to protect the village. When the kung fu palace's old master has a vision of bad things to come, a dragon warrior must be chosen to fight this evil and Po, trying to see who will be named, appears to accidentally get chosen. <br/><br/>The first thing this movie does right is focus on Po. Po is lovable because he tries hard and dreams big despite his obvious flaws and his humor--via Jack Black--is the one part of the film that doesn't take itself seriously. As a result, Po is probably the easiest character to identify with in the entire cannon of Dreamworks animated films. While the voices of the Furious Five include Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu and more, and their master is played by Dustin Hoffman, these actors are purely supporting, proving they were brought in merely to sell the film. While some people might be disappointed, it's the right thing for this film. Po's journey is enough to focus on. While I expected Hoffman, for example, to really make the part his own, he stays very true to the written character. Any no-names could have played the 5 and considering the movie is still enjoyable despite it, that's a very good thing.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most commendable aspect of ""Panda"" is its family- friendly comedy. There aren't more than 5 or so jokes that make you laugh really hard like the ""Shrek"" franchise does, but those movies were funny because they slipped in jokes for a PG-13 or higher audience. This film appeals to kids, teens, adults and the like without doing that stuff, by relying on already-present humor and not looking toward outside sources/pop culture references. In 30 years, it is possible this movie will be looked at by young audiences as funnier than ""Shrek"" for this reason and it should. There are also some spectacular action sequences, namely when the villain Tai Lung escapes. The smartly conceived fighting choreography is probably the most underrated aspect of the film.<br/><br/>""Panda"" may never be more than cute, clever and fun, but a G film should be without trying to sneak in inappropriate jokes. This is truly a film reminiscent of Disney's wholesome animated days when it was about just writing stories people had to like. The overdone values of believing in yourself and making something out of who you are don't feel overdone in this film--they feel right. Next to the unrivaling unique ""Ratatouille,"" ""Panda"" is right there when it comes to family-friendly wide-appeal films."

","Might be fine for younger kids who haven't seen this same plot 100 different times.

Now really, how many adults reading this don't already know how the story plays out? Cute slapstick, though."
"annam_s","3","9","24","20 July 2008"," The big, fat and silly waist of my time.
","There's a conspiracy around the world! I kid you not! Apparently me and my family saw some different version of the Kung Fu Panda movie than the rest of the world.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, reading the other comments assured me of the opposite. At least the plot and special effects/kung fu combats, mentioned by everyone else, seem just the same.<br/><br/>Look, I really liked the main idea of"" there's no secret ingredient"", which, by the way, was pretty obvious to me from the start. But throwing it in as a mere side note, instead of building a good story around this comfortably familiar (though redundant) concept, was a pretty lame idea.<br/><br/>The whole movie feels like a 5-minute silly and funny at some parts TV gag stretched for the entire hour and a half - no character development, including the main hero, not a single fresh idea (which could be forgivable sometimes, but no redeeming value here) - just wonderfully executed kung fu fights. So, if you're a fan of those - you'd be pretty satisfied. In case, you're not - you won't.<br/><br/>I was really hoping this movie has something under its sleeve, as some first facial exchanges between the two old masters took place, yet, ultimately, they had no special meaning at all. And while we saw a dubbed Russian version, I really can't understand why would anyone hire such a star-studded English cast for voicing a few lines for absolutely unneeded kung fu masters characters. I doubt Angelina Jolie's or Jacki Chan's voices could do any difference here.<br/><br/>Not to mention, that this whole idea of ""a simple good guy"" who comes and succeeds at what fail the long-time experts for absolutely no understandable reason (apparently learning all the principles in one day because he wanted to get some dumplings) - look, it really starts to get on my nerves. Really."
"giren-ismaya","6","2","3","26 July 2008"," Surprisingly Good, But Inconsistent...
","*** SPOILER ALERT ***<br/><br/>To be honest, I think this time Dreamworks surprise me. I really think they delivered one good animated movie with their latest Kung Fu Panda. It was cute, beautifully rendered, and had a lovable characters.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Dreamworks will be Dreamworks¬Ö and here is why:<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda was fun, sure. But it didn't have something that Dreamworks should work very hard to achieve its goal: a great story. Yes, I know the story was rather 'good', so was the action sequences, the music from Hans Zimmer was enchanting, the China background is spectacular too. But it wasn't enough! <br/><br/>Remember, they compete with the animation giant: Pixar. Maybe the bar was set very high it will be difficult to compete with Pixar. But they should try, although I think this is kind of great for a start.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda tells a story about a fat panda, Po. He was addicted to kungfu. Unfortunately, he doesn't have the 'qualities' for being good at kungfu or any kind of sports (not surprising since he was very fat and slow). Meanwhile, far from Po, one of the most dangerous villain on China - Tai Lung - is escaped from prison. So Oogway, the famous and respectable guru try to gathered all warriors from China to pick one of them to be The Dragon Warrior. Surprisingly to everyone, Po was chosen. Along the way, Po tries so hard to believe in himself and making everyone believe that he - the fat panda - will bring peace to China.<br/><br/>I said I was surprised. Why? From the beginning until the first half of the movie, Kung Fu Panda tells us about one of the most important philosophy in the eastern world: the grand design of the universe. Oogway told everyone that Po was destined to be The Dragon Warrior, and it was not an accident. Simply because 'there was no accident'. Everything in the universe was design in its way that we as a living being couldn't do anything about it but Accept it and Believe in it.<br/><br/>But then, on a second half of the movie it fails to satisfies me. Finally Po believe in himself after he saw the Dragon Scroll. The Dragon Scroll is one and only ancient scroll that only can be seen by the Dragon Warrior itself. And it contains nothing. No words, no moves, only a plain paper that interestingly reflects every face who sees it. Later Po knows that all he could do to beat Tai Lung is to believe in himself. At the end of the story, Po was suddenly learn one of the deadliest move of all time.<br/><br/>How he could learn that moves, is still a mystery to me. After a brief introduction to the eastern philosophy this movie choose a safe, dull, weird ending. What happened to the grand-design-believe-in-yourself-there-was-no-accident thing? Maybe Dreamworks was scared that the 'heavy message' won't reach to the younger audience. But I think they should try harder to make it still believable to your sense.<br/><br/>Overall, Kung Fu Panda fails to satisfies me. But its still one of the funniest summer movie out there. I hope Dreamworks will delivered something magical and smarter next time. Although being alert that Madagascar 2 and Shrek Goes Forth is going along, I just pray for those two won't be another Dreamworks Animation Disaster.<br/><br/>Oh, and Angelina Jolie and Jackie Chan were such a waste..."
"ruelland","7","2","3","13 July 2008"," Simple, but surprisingly good.
","Dreamworks Animation has it very tough now a days, living forever in the shadow of Pixar. But it's been hard to feel sorry for them. In the seven years after the smash success of the movie ""Shrek"", they've only managed to churn out one mediocre and simplistic animated film after the other, set apart only by their top celebrity voices, and laden with kids only humor and tired pop-culture jokes. They haven't been bad per say, but when the competition is the likes of Toy Story or Finding Nemo, you start to wish they'd try a little harder. Now along comes Kung Fu Panda, easily the best CGI kids film the studio has come up with. It's nothing spectacular, but it's great fun, and probably the most fun a family can have together at the movies this summer...in a movie without trash cleaning robots.<br/><br/>The trailers for this film did nothing for me, but the minute its exciting and hilarious 2D opening was done, I knew I was for in something good. The story is definitely not the movie's strong point. It tells the basic tale of Po, voiced by Jack Black, a young and very overweight Great Panda and son of a noodle salesman, who dreams of one day being a Kung Fu master and joining the ranks of his idols, The Furious Five (characters representing the five classic styles of Shaolin Kung-fu: a tiger, crane, monkey, mantis, and snake, voiced by Angelina Jolie, David Cross, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen and Lucy Liu respectively). When a premonition warns of the escape of the evil kung fu master Tai-Lung (Ian McShane), former student of the stern sensei Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), it is decided that the sacred title of ""Dragon Warrior"" must be given to a brave soul in hopes of stopping him. <br/><br/>That title unsurprisingly lands on Po. As you might expect, there is a lot of doubting, and worry, until Po learns about the ""hero within"" and...well you've seen it all before. It's very bare bones, but it's acceptable enough when the movie's strengths work so well.<br/><br/>The voices and animation are top notch thankfully. All the actors fit well with their characters (Black can do the hefty underdog routine in his sleep) and do a fine job without a hint of them phoning it in, with Hoffman and McShane as the real standout. Hoffman excels as the up tight wise man or teacher that all Kung Fu movies need, though the Furious Five have a disappointingly smaller role then it seems they should, but have some great moments as well. <br/><br/>The animation is crisp and beautiful; this film's fantasized world of ancient China really shines, and must be seen on the big screen. The animation lends itself well to the film's main attraction-the fights. You may think a PG rated kid's film might skimp on quality fights, ""Kung Fu"" in the title or not, but in this case you'd be very mistaken. The fights are fast paced, thrilling, and delightfully executed (even borrowing some choreography from various well known kung fu flicks in some occasions) and for a PG movie, somewhat brutal. Nothing too serious mind you, but if you're a prude when it comes to kids and violence, beware. Neither the heroes nor the villain in this movie mess around when it comes to the fights. <br/><br/>The movie also seems to be a bit lacking in the humor department, which takes back seat to the action. It's still funny (without having to resort to Pop-culture gags even), but it really isn't the laugh a minute comedy you or your kids might be expecting.<br/><br/>The film's other strong point is its villain. Even in best children movies, a villain's motivation usually never stretches beyond ""because he's evil"", so imagine my surprise when Kung-Fu Panda not only provides its bad guy with some well done back story and motivation, but even manages to make him a little sympathetic. There's a scene between him and Shifu near the end that contains some strong themes that'll fly over most children's heads, and is a treat to watch. As mentioned, McShane's voice is a major standout, bringing Tai Lung to life with a sneering and devilish quality. <br/><br/>The movie chickens out at the end unfortunately, in order to stay kid friendly, shying it away from greatness. While it still fails just short of the quality and heart of the Pixar films (well, it's better than Cars anyway), KFP still provides a lot of fun and thrills for kids and grown ups a like. It's a fun, simple little summer film that any family should look into, especially if you happen to be raising little kung-fu fans of your own."
"RResende","Null","2","3","11 July 2008"," it's all in the faces
","The latest years have been busy and interesting in the field of animation. The full transition to digital creation (at least in a main stream context) is a reality, and in the middle of it, the competition between Dreamworks and Pixar/Disney is bringing benefits to us, viewers, all. So far, i've been enjoying Pixar's projects better. They are working in their specific corner of film exploration, which has to do with the use of space. The kind of freedom a virtual camera gives to animation is something they've been working properly, at a world class level in Ratatouille. That's the top of it, so far, to my taste. But here, these guys embrace a research on something that had been somehow neglected until now: the faces.<br/><br/>The camera is virtual, the sets are virtual, but so are the actors (except of course for the voices). So they can be worked in a sort of exaggerated more than real way. That's done here. So far it's the best digital faces characterization i've seen. Every expression is intended, has a purpose, and is fully enjoyable. Certain subtleties are really intelligent, because in the middle of a great technological capacity, they used quite simple devices (it comes to my mind that eye movement in the monkeys face when the panda is making fun of the master without knowing he is behind him).<br/><br/>The motion in space and throughout the space was not specially interesting, specially if you look at what Pixar has been doing. And this story had potential in that field. Kung Fu, in cinematic terms, is about a dance between the eye and the performer, and the way he fills the space he's occupying. Here we have a temple in the top of a mountain, with a village at its feet. The only thing they use is the stairs, so the panda can get tired. Could be more. But the faces make up for all this <br/><br/>My opinion: 4/5 <br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"
"smashattack","8","2","3","26 June 2008"," All the makings of an excellent story
","Kung Fu Panda is the kind of movie I've been waiting for all year. It is sad to see that a children's movie is what finally rekindled my interest in venturing to the theaters over the course of the past year. However, Kung Fu Panda is difficult to place in the ""children's"" category.<br/><br/>We'll get right to the meat of the movie--the action. I haven't seen such brilliant action sequences in quite some time, whether from an animated or live-action film. These were exceptionally choreographed, and the best part is that they didn't quite take themselves seriously in executing these performances. It's always difficult for me to enjoy a fight scene in a movie where people are flying and doing absolutely outrageous things unless it is an obvious attempt at humor. Kung Fu Panda achieves this goal with stunning aptitude.<br/><br/>Not to mention that the humor is top-notch, whether you are six or 26. I had trouble catching all the jokes, considering most of them were laugh-out-loud funny, forcing me to lose concentration on the next perfectly set up situation.<br/><br/>One of the prime aspects of this movie, to me, is the casting. Many well-known actors and actresses came together to put together this finely crafted film, and they really pulled off a performance worthy a golden statue displaying their ultimate worthiness. I can always appreciate an actor/actress typically involved in raunchy comedies (ahem... Seth Rogen) who can flip a 180 and manage to keep it clean for a full two hours. Bravo, you sickos, you gained a few more points in my book of notorious filthy acting! And finally, my favorite part of the entire movie is that the director managed to find THE BEST film composer of our time and put him to work! Hans Zimmer is as brilliant as ever, pulling out all the stops with his amazing themes and intense action sequence crescendos. And he perfectly avoids overusing the clich√© Oriental touch, only using it in key moments. I can't get enough of his music. There should seriously be a library full of his music. I'd own it and maintain it FOR FREE, and I'm not even joking. Seriously, I have a shrine dedicated to this man in my backyard which plays music from Gladiator 24/7.<br/><br/>You definitely should see Kung Fu Panda. And don't hesitate to take the kiddos."
"robertallenandersonjr","8","2","3","24 June 2008"," The best animated movie of the year so far
","Kung Fu Panda was a very fun movie to watch from start to finish. The whole cast makes it a very fun movie. Between Jack Black, Seth Rogan, Angelina Joline, Dustin Hoffman, Jackie Chan, and Luicy Liu playing the voices of the characters it was fun. They had many funny moments that they shared. I think that kids would especially love this movie. Even older kids and teenagers can enjoy this movie. I sure do know adults that take their kids to see it will have a fun time. Its fun to relive your history and go back to movies like these. Jack Black was perfect and was a riot in this. The facial expressions he makes pretty much will make you laugh out loud. When I had first seen the trailer to this movie it didn't seem to catch my eye but after the good reviews I went to see it and it was really good. Their was a ton of action for younger kids. It wasn't to long so you don't have to sit through a long movie. Overall this was a very fun family comedy. GO see it if you like animated action movies. This is a real gift to see. This is coming from someone who doesn't care for animated movies. So for me to like this one it means it has to be good. They also made the panda and other characters look very good. Overall a great animated CGI film. GO see it you wont be disappointed."
"mm-39","8","2","3","12 June 2008"," It was funny!
","When I saw the preview I didn't know what to expect knowing that Jack Black was in it. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was hilarious, I couldn't stop laughing. I liked the part where they were hiding food under the pots and playing the shell game with them. Jack Black did a good role. I like the noodle dad; this guy seems to be in all Kung Fu movies. Dustin Hoffman was great as the master. The film has a good message for kids in believing one's self. The animation was great. I didn't recognize Angelina Jolie as the voice of the tiger warrior. The film is entertaining for both adults and children. My wife loves animated movies so that is why we attend this film. My wife gives it a 8 of 10 Kung Fu kicks."
"sammiesays","9","2","3","11 June 2008"," Unexpectedly Good!
","Lets give a small background of me as a commenter. I'm 19, movie lover, and haven't recently liked any 3D movies unless made by Pixar. I saw this with my mom, who badly wanted to see it (she's a 5 year at heart). I REALLY REALLY REALLY didn't want to see this at all. I was never planning on seeing it after all the recent failure 3D movies I had seen by Dreamworks or Disney (non-Pixar). I loved Shrek though and everything by dreamworks after that excluding Shrek 2 was a waste. It wasn't until reading all the wonderful comments by others who've seen this movie, I was turned around and decided to see it. <br/><br/>It was good, very good, good enough that I rated it high. <br/><br/>The story was so well done. It's full of heart and of course set for the family. I enjoyed the atmosphere that they made for the movie. It was so ancient china and enjoyable. Each and every character had their own personality and Po was no exception. <br/><br/>Sorry parents and teenagers, there's no jokes directed to make us laugh. Their are cute moments that make you laugh but as stated for the kids. The thing that made me continue to watch was the AMAZING action sequences that just lets you sit back and stare in awe. Of course it's 3D but it was so real feeling.<br/><br/>I recommend seeing this. It's cute, the story is entertaining, and you cheer for Po the whole time in his journey to become a Dragon Warrior."
"Astralan","8","2","3","11 June 2008"," Pleasantly surprised and enjoyable.
","This was a delightful film. The deep rich color, the contrast, most of the caricature development and voices seem to come together to make a wonderful experience. The story follows the dream of a fat panda and his desire to be trained in the ways of Kung Fu. Laced with a serious overtone, the comedy is on a more mature level, but a level that even a young child can follow and enjoy. Paced well, the movie starts off as well as it ends. A bit predictable once you know all the components in the character constellation, even the anticipation lends its self to the experience.<br/><br/>I have to admit, the most enjoyable and laughable scene to this movie revolves around Po (The panda, voiced by a Jack Black) and what is discovered to motivate him to learn the teachings of his master Shifu (Voiced by Dustin Hoffman). Shifu has been left with the task to train Po to become the ultimate warrior, much to the chagrin of his other disciples: A tigress, a snake, a praying mantis, a monkey and a crane, who have studied for years to become the level of Dragon master. Unfortunately, there is also another beast, a previous student of Shifu, that also believes that level belongs to him. In the end, dark forces against that of light must meet.<br/><br/>One thing I always find disconcerting is that why, out of all the people in the world, do movies like this need to generate any interest from already famous actors? There is so much talent out there, I would think leaving live acting to live actors. Or how about a radio announcer? Or a person that does audio books? I have a hard time believing that this movie couldn't have used an unknown to be a primary voice and still kill at the box office. Just my opinion.<br/><br/>The theater was sparsely populated. I think my wife and I were the only ones there that didn't have young children. The lack of an audience allows for a more pungent viewing, one that isn't caught up in a wave of laughter that usually infects a viewer at a well attended presentation. One very young child tried very hard to understand what was going on through most of the film in a rather loud voice, but this was acceptable. I don't think a child of 3 can truly enjoy this, even as a cartoon. So, as a summer surprise, seeing this was not on my list of movies to see, I was pleasantly surprised. Recommended!"

"Jay_Exiomo","8","2","3","7 June 2008"," He's more than a talking cute panda, seriously
","Outside the ""Shrek"" franchise, Dreamworks Animation didn't really have much in the way of memorable animated films (even ""Shrek the Third"" fell into the traps of mediocrity). And while its latest product ""Kung Fu Panda"" doesn't introduce a groundbreaking chapter in the history of animation, this animated film directed by Mark Osborne and John Stevenson provides a solid entertaining hour and a half.<br/><br/>Set in a fictional ancient China populated by animals, there's Po the Panda (voiced by Jack Black), a die-hard kung fu aficionado who works in his father's (whose being a goose is never really explained) noodle shop. He dreams of one day seeing the temple head monk Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) crown one of kung fu master Shifu's (Dustin Hoffman) apprentices - Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Snake (Lucy Liu), Crane (David Cross), and Mantis (Seth Rogen) - as the Dragon Warrior to stop prison escapee Tia Lung (Ian McShane) in his quest to lay waste their land in quest for greatness. A series of events lead to Po being chosen as the Dragon Warrior, much to the chagrin of the apprentices and the frustration of Shifu, who's now tasked to train Po to fight Tia Lung, which seems an impossible task considering the Panda can't even bend to see his toes.<br/><br/>Where the story's headed is pretty much obvious with all the trappings of kung fu and sports movies. But its message doesn't come across as mawkishly sentimental and its humorous and light tone keep the proceedings fluid and at ease. The animation is competent and nicely rendered. Also, at 90 minutes, it also doesn't overstay its welcome.<br/><br/>The voice cast is commendable, particularly with Black and Hoffman. Black perfectly provides a comedic geeky quality to kung fu-obsessed Po while Hoffman lends an authoritative facet to Shifu. Chan, Jolie, and Rogen don't have much speaking parts and are only there perhaps for the star value, since anyone else could have performed their parts.<br/><br/>I would have to admit that I didn't expect much of ""Kung Fu Panda"" since haven't we all had enough of animated talking animals. And maybe that worked for it since the film delivers the laughs and the cuteness in a much needed respite from a grueling work week."
"superkorzen","9","2","3","7 June 2008"," Funny and well animated
","Kung-fu Panda is packed with explosive animation sequences that go well with the story. Most of the characters are well developed, likable and really well animated. If you watch their faces closely, you will not consider them 1-dimensional. Less is more, some of the body language was beautifully accomplished with the slightest of moves.<br/><br/>As for the story, it bears heavy resemblance to the movie Kung-fu Hustle. If you watched both movies, you will be able to tell without hesitation who is who, and many scenes and concepts from the Hustle are directly transposed to the Panda. Still, the movie has lots of original content. Event characters and jokes carried over from the Hustle are tweaked in such way that they are still very funny and enjoyable."
"Quentintarantado","8","2","3","7 June 2008"," Quite good, up there with the first Shrek
","Warning: I believe the movie is a bit scary for the very young, I think this movie should be rated PG or even PG 13. Shrek is a wonderful movie because it upends a lot of conventions, in fairy tales and in animated movies. The next few Shreks become weaker echoes of the first by doing the same movie over and over, and by existing to parody other movies without bothering to put in a meaty story to string the jokes. Kung Fu Panda is another movie that upends a lot of recent animated movie conventions that have become clich√©. Firstly, it isn't anymore a joke a minute. Some care was used in telling the story. In a way, it breaks current convention by becoming a more old-fashioned movie, by taking its time with the story. And yet, there are many touches that are clear tributes to previous great Kung Fu movies, especially Jacky Chan movies. The movie is going to be rewarding even to adults, so they aren't going to mind bringing their kids to this movie. It helps that Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman strike such witty rapport with each other. If anything becomes pretty conventional or dull, I can depend on either actor to give it a nice reading. Not necessarily a funny reading, but at least a reading that's consistent with the character. Definitely worth getting on Blu-ray!"

"Billylkbrooke","10","1","1","20 May 2018"," Kung Fu Panda - A masterpiece in thematic depth
","Preface: 
This 10/10 rating has not come lightly, primarily as I have had wildly differing views of this film over the years. The first watch had me thoroughly charmed and entertained, but some aspects of its humour concerned me enough to think this film warranted a generous 8/10. With repeated viewings, I now quote the film when watching it, so the script has certainly won me over, but with every viewing I have enjoyed the film more because my first viewing missed what made this film brilliant - depth. On this note, I would like to preface this review, saying simply that this is not a film you will immediately think is fantastic. However, repeated viewings will show you that this is a deeply underrated and underappreciated film.<br/><br/>Review Proper:
Superficially Kung Fu Panda is a simple but pretty film. It is about a Panda, Po, who is unwittingly chosen to become the Dragon Warrior, a legendary Kung Fu master granted with limitless power. He is granted this to defeat Tai Lung, an evil snow leopard with a penchant for revenge against his former master Shi-fu. The plot is not difficult to follow and is moderately predictable, providing a typical underdog story. Jack Black amuses with frequent quips throughout the film, and a surrounding cast of impressive names (Jackie Chan, Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogan and James Hong among many others) gives the plot weight. The script is also genially witty, and is full of wonderfully written lines (there's the odd stumble, but Oogway is a character you have to listen carefully to because his every line is beautifully poetic). <br/><br/>This is also a film of technical beauty; the visuals are undeniably stunning, and the music is exceptional. Hans Zimmer and John Powell worked together to write a fantastic score that immersed me fully within the Chinese setting. Oogway ascending is a famous piece for good reason, so basically go listen to it right now because it is amazing. All this makes Kung Fu Panda a good film, a solid 8/10 that packs in charm, laughter and entertainment to make its 1hr30 runtime fly past. However, this film moves from a good one to a great one because of its depth in thematic storytelling.<br/><br/>So thematically, this story is about three ideas. I will have to discuss them vaguely, because I'm trying to keep spoilers to a minimum, but watch out for how these are developed in the film because it will heighten your experience. First is a question of identity. Po is the only Panda in the story - he stands out, so immediately the story broaches the issue of what he wants to do with his unique life; follow his foster father or forge his own path. This juxtaposition sets up the issue of time, and how we ourselves set our lives to fulfil the past for a future we can't foresee. The theme of Ambition plays into this, as the main antagonist has the same ultimate ambition as Po of becoming a master of Kung Fu, but how they both seek to obtain it sets them apart. Tai Lung is exceptional, but his arrogance and inherent evil makes him too corrupt to be the dragon warrior. Po is simple and kind hearted, but he lacks any natural skill at Kung Fu to be the dragon warrior either. The story explores this effectively, juxtaposing Tai Lung and Po enough to establish that the answer is not what you want (the future) or who you were born as (the past) but who you are (the present). The past, present and future are frequently juggled and juxtaposed as their value for identity effectively sets up the main idea of the story; being content.<br/><br/>At its heart Kung Fu Panda really is about being content and says that we need to appreciate who we are now, what we currently have, to be happy. The burden of the past and the mystery of the future only holds us back. This is central to Shi-fu's story arc just as it is for Po; apprentice and master alike are both held back by their ambitions and the burden of the past, and both appreciate by the films close that the present is most important of all. They can't change their past, and cannot foresee the future, so they understand that all they can do is live with the lives they have. That the story of the film juggles Identity and Ambition into this idea seamlessly is testament to the brilliant writing of this film, and showcases how effectively complex thematic writing heightens a film. This is all epitomised in a surprising post-credits scene. This scene is wordless, simple and yet reinforces a metaphor, used early in the film as foreshadowing, that shows the writers really knew what they were doing and heightens the depth of the film from a great film to a thematic masterpiece.<br/><br/>Conclusion:
It is quite easy to be caught by the superficial goodness of Kung Fu Panda. Its recognisable plot, its simple protagonist and equally simplistic antagonist, all coincide with visuals and music to provide an enjoyable family film. However, this almost sets this film on the wrong footing by diverting attention away from the intelligence of its thematic writing. The story interweaves complex ideas of identity and ambition, all within the exploration of what we makes us content, which adds true depth to the experience. This is a film that not only holds up but improves with every viewing. You won't find any more to see in the picture, but you will find infinitely more to think about in the story it tells. This is an exceptionally intelligent film, a masterpiece that hides behind its charm. Kung Fu Panda is, in the most literal sense possible, a hidden gem."

","The story was great and the background was beautiful, it really felt like an ancient Chinese city. The story is about Po, an overweight panda who is the son of a noodle maker, who dreams of Po following in his footsteps. But Po longs to be a ninja fighter. Po is as you know is a panda bear and the film's unlikely hero: as the bigger than life and completely lovable bear voiced by the comic genius Jack Black. Po is a Sweet but clumsy, bear who hears the news the ancient and long awaited dragon warrior will be named, so he runs (as much as he can) to hear who will be named at the celebration.
Without giving too much away, when an ""accident"" seems to name Po as the dragon warrior (much to the horror of Master Shifu (voiced perfectly by Dustin Hoffman) and the disappointment of Furious Five: Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Viper (Lucy Liu), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Crane (David Cross) and Monkey (Jackie Chan). Shifu must find a way to train him. One hilarious moment after another continues until Shifu recognizes Po's true driving force. This is just in time as the villain Tai Lung (Ian McShane), a snow leopard has returned as he believe is the true Dragon Warrior.
I really like it."

","I can never get tired of this film, no matter how many times I watch it. The characters are superbly realised, well-voiced, and engaging throughout. The visuals are stunning, with landscapes, backdrops, and object design superb, and character design which suits the setting whilst also adding a great deal to the characters themselves, while the 2D segments are equally beautiful whilst adding variety to the tone of the story. The story is straightforward, but manages to be dramatic and moving without resorting to melodrama, and is above all enormously entertaining. The humour, too, is pretty simple - juvenile, in many cases - but it never fails to make me laugh. A rollicking good ride."

"CinemaClown","Null","1","1","8 April 2016"," DreamWorks Animation's Funniest Film To Date!
","One of the finest films to come out of DreamWorks Animation's canon and certainly their funniest film to date, Kung Fu Panda is an energetic blend of kinetic direction, smart writing, sparkling wit, vibrant camera-work, tight editing, first-rate animation & exuberant score that not only works as a downright hilarious comedy but also as a thrilling action extravaganza & a fascinating coming-of- age story.<br/><br/>Set in ancient China, which is populated by anthropomorphic talking animals, the story of Kung Fu Panda follows a cheeky, clumsy & squishy giant panda named Po who aspires of becoming a kung fu master. His wish is granted when he's unexpectedly proclaimed as Dragon Warrior who will fulfil an ancient prophecy, but finds himself to be the subject of ridicule by the other kung fu disciples & their mentor until an old enemy returns.<br/><br/>Co-directed by John Stevenson & Mark Osborne, Kung Fu Panda brims with a sense of immediacy without ever sacrificing its drama or characters for mere amusement. The story is set up relatively quick, characters & their roles are instantly identifiable, and although it is a rip-roaringly hilarious ride from start to finish, it's also surprisingly heavy in the drama section. Also assisting the story is the medium of animation that gives the filmmakers a huge canvas to realise their imagination on.<br/><br/>Every character exhibits a full-fledged arc in this story, the filmmakers have done a fabulous job in drawing out moments of laughter from even the most unexpected moments, the lighthearted vibe is effectively maintained throughout its runtime, the plot is relentlessly paced, and the background score by Hans Zimmer & John Powell infuses an energy of its own into the narrative while the animation makes fab use of available colour palette to put on screen a richly coloured world and it all simply works out.<br/><br/>The film also boasts a star-studded voice cast in Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen, David Cross & others, and nearly all of them suit the characters they lend their voices to. The character of Po is voiced by Jack Black and the actor does an excellent job at it for he imparts not only his vocals but a few other attributes as well. Hoffman voices Po's mentor and their teacher-disciple chemistry is this story's driving force. McShane voices the antagonist & is able to give him an intimidating quality while the rest of the cast do well in their supporting roles.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Kung Fu Panda is definitely a fresh breathe of life from DreamWorks Animation and is one of their most enjoyable, entertaining & amusing efforts that knows where it is headed & what it is doing. Scoring high marks in nearly all departments of filmmaking, delivering its message in an easily accessible manner, exquisitely balancing its elements of comedy, drama & action, plus effortlessly sustaining its downright hysterical wit at all times, Kung Fu Panda is amongst the best films of its year and remains a thrilling extravaganza for viewers of all ages. Highly recommended."

","Hearing the title and the premise, I thought Kung Fu Panda was going to be a waste of my time but boy was I wrong. The film excels in almost all aspects from the likable characters to the amazing animation.<br/><br/>The film's strongest quality is its characters. Po is likable in his tenacity and determination never to give up and fulfill his dream whereas Shifu is sympathetic in living with a mistake and taking it out on others. The Furious Five are all wonderfully unique in their different personalities but are also relatable in that they think they have been cheated. The villain is also a lot of fun, and the fact that he is a Kung Fu master allows for some exciting imagery. The world that the animators create with anthropomorphic animals is a very unique and pretty world and there is also a good blend between the ancient Chinese culture and modern day humor. The Kung Fu displayed in the film (especially by Tai Lung) is always fun to watch as it has the right blend between animation and comedy. The music by Hans Zimmer was excellent, one of Zimmer's best in my opinion (particularly the music sequence used for the five's battle with Tai Lung). However, the film does have a few flaws, personally I felt that the film's climax was a little weak, so much had been building up to that point and they tried to play out the climax between Po and Tai Lung as both serious and funny. Personally, they should have gone one way or another, but that is simply a nit pick. The fight between Po and Tai Lung is still entertaining and the film does end on a happy note.<br/><br/>Overall, Kung Fu Panda is still a wonderful film, it has an inspiring message of hope and determination that will appeal to both adults and children and as much as it appealed to me."
"OllieSuave-007","9","1","1","10 March 2014"," A good animated one from Dreamworks!
","This is a Dreamworks animated feature, a story about a noodle-shop worker panda named Po, who is the biggest fan of Kung Fu. Chosen to fulfill an ancient prophecy, Po joins an elite Kung-Fu group and trains alongside the legendary Furious Five -- Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper and Monkey -- under the leadership of their guru, Master Shifu. Their trainings come in handy when they must battle the vengeful snow leopard Tai Lung.<br/><br/>The film has the action, tense and adventure of any martial arts-themed movie, and it is counterbalanced with the laugh-out-loud comedy and humor provided by the host of characters including Po, voiced by Jack Black, and Mr. Ping, voiced by James Hong. The Furious Five, voiced by Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogan, Lucy Liu and David Cross each gave a humorous yet determined and courageous performance of their respective characters. Dustin Hoffman gave a commanding and dignified portrayal of Master Shifu and Randall Duk Kim gave a gentle, yet wise performance of the master turtle, Ooogway.<br/><br/>The movie is made in beautiful animation and great visual effects, capturing the many characteristics of China like pagoda-style buildings, magnificent mountains, a spectacular fireworks show, noodle shops, Chinese Characters and chopsticks and glass bowls. Mark Osborne and John Stevenson did an awesome job in directing a movie with adventures in action in abundance, with unforgettable characters marvelously voiced by an all-star case. The writing team of Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Burger, Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris provided a daring story with a touching emphasis on courage, believing in yourself and teamwork. And, Composers John Powell and Hans Zimmer provided a brilliant music score, with beautiful Chinese-style music accompaniment.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe this is one of the better non-Disney animated films I've seen and it is fun and terrific for the entire family.<br/><br/>Grade A"
"radoii_87","8","1","1","6 February 2014"," An effective animation with indirect hints to something of value
","You gotta love animation. It's a natural breeding ground for fun, boundless creativity and innovation, without taking itself too seriously. When done competently, it gives us glimpses of multiple structural narrative elements at the same time (layers of realities, references, allegories etc.). These elements are not meant to be completely developed. Instead, they are supposed to reveal something important about the genre and its target audience.<br/><br/>This starts with a 2 dimensional ""incomplete"" framing story that puts ""everything"" into perspective. However, it's not until an hour into the main story that we are allowed to compare it to the repressed memory of the bear as we observe the process of assembling the puzzle/achieving ""inner piece"". Indirectly, this hints how deeply intimate shared narration and creation of complex mental constructs can be. This aside, as always, there are several nice visual and verbal references(e.g. games, movies, people) that help us bridge the gap between the outer reality and the inner ones. See this, it's good.<br/><br/>I did not particularly like the poke at China but I do not see it going away anytime soon. The mentality has been there for decades. After a while, it gets amusing.<br/><br/>4/5 - Worth a watch"
"evandewangga97","8","1","1","30 January 2014"," I get a funny, exciting experience in this movie
","Personally, I am an animation movie lover. For me, animation is a kind of light movie, you don't think too much as the plot goes. What you must keep is let your imagination flow, feel the great adventure-suspense, and a wonderful fantasy, that makes you wonder and amazed. Animation movie is, I think, a cheat movie, you can always create a world or story without too much worry of its properties or safety. Of course, you can always said, it is not logical, it's odd. It's true, but that is not the way to enjoy the animation. Like I said before, don't use your left brain, use your right brain.<br/><br/>Let's move to ""Kung Fu Panda"" itself, for me it is a kind of animation treatment. It is classic, funny one, I can enjoy this in every time. The action-animation scene is somewhat entertaining. The characterization is very strong. The friendship value is exposed, and very much moral value in this funny Kung Fu movie. The Kung Fu styles is based on the actual Kung Fu itself, an epic one.<br/><br/>The cinematography is fresh. And I also feel the adventure-soul in this movie. The comedy is smart, compared with other movies like ""Madagascar Series"". It is also a simple one, great story in simple movie. I give 8 out of 10, the weakness that I recognized is just some dialog scenes. I think for those scene, the simple yet powerful quotes can be said. So It can be a real epic movie. Okay, at least, still a great movie."
"gavin-lordofthefutur-776-426631","9","1","1","6 October 2013"," While not solid, Kung Fu Panda is still one of Dreamworks Animation's best films
","After DreamWorks Animation finished distributing most of their films with their formal company, DreamWorks, they made a seven-year contract with Paramount Pictures when they made Over the Hedge. Later, in 2007, two films ""Shrek the Third"" and ""Bee Movie"" both became box office hits, but received mixed reviews from critics. Then, in 2008, DreamWorks Animation had found a way to get them back on track. They decided to make a Chinese martial arts adventure with anthropomorphic animals (similar to Disney's Robin Hood) named ""Kung Fu Panda"", now celebrating it's 5th Anniversary.<br/><br/>The reason why I saw it is because I thought that after Bee Movie disappointed me (it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't a much stronger film either), I was hoping for something better to put them back on track. However, when I sat through the whole thing, I had a smile on my face and with that, this film exceeded my expectations back at 2008 during the summer of that year.<br/><br/>I will admit that it may not be DreamWorks Animation's solid film but before I can get to the flaws, there's a lot to like about this flick.<br/><br/>The story for Kung Fu Panda is very heartwarming and original on it's own right. It pays it's respects to the Chinese culture and gives a lot of moral lessons about believing in yourself and believe that you are a very special person. The martial arts fight sequences are well choreographed and epic it gives you a lot of chills just watching them; the comedy is decent. Not as laugh-out-loud as say ""Toy Story"", but it gave me some chuckles; the dialog is witty and smart as well.<br/><br/>The music score from Hans Zimmer and John Powell is by no means excellent. It's Chinese-esque flutes in the orchestra is magnificent and the rock-guitars blends very well with the film's action sequences. Of course, let's not forget the characters and by golly they were wonderful. Po is very funny as a clumsy, but determined panda, Shifu is a strict, but kind Master Shifu; Mr. Ping is a very nice goose father to Po and Master Oogway is both wise and a bad*** turtle Kung Fu master, but the best character would have to go to Tai Lung as the sympathetic villain. His back-story is so sad it made me felt sorry for him and the fight scenes with him are great it makes him one of my favorite Non-Disney villains in the history of animation. The voice work for the characters including Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, James Hong, & Ian McShane is flawless and are a sight to behold.<br/><br/>The best part, however, would have to go to the animation. The settings and the textures are so great they look like a Chinese tapestry (similar to that of Disney's Sleeping Beauty). The character animation is solid with realistic expressions on their faces and the emotions are done very well it would make you feel for these characters as well. A+ for you, DreamWorks.<br/><br/>Now, before I would end this review, I will say that there are two problems that I do have with this flick. While the story is strong, the way they ended it felt pretty silly to me. I mean, you had an epic final battle between Po and Tai Lung, but aside from that, it ended just abruptly and leaves a lot to be desired. Second, is the Furious Five's development. Don't get me wrong. I do think they're great characters as well, but their development was lacking at best (aside from such big voice casts like Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, David Cross, and Seth Rogen) and I would've liked to see more of them (well, until the sequel, that is).<br/><br/>Overall, while it isn't solid, Kung Fu Panda is still one of DreamWorks Animation's best films next to Shrek, The Prince of Egypt, and How To Train Your Dragon and is a fun-filled martial arts animated adventure that is heartwarming, beautiful, and hilarious at the same time. Recommended to others who haven't seen it and this deserves a thumbs up from me! :)"

Kung Fu Panda's animation works greatly in all directions and I loved the opening story that's directed as if a motion comic.

","In one respect, the concept of a ""kung fu panda"" is an appropriate one. Kung fu is Chinese; pandas come from China. In other respects, however, it seems hilariously inappropriate. Pandas are widely regarded as placid, inoffensive animals, the least carnivorous of the Carnivora. Indeed, for many years zoologists denied them their rightful place in the bear family, categorising them instead as a sort of overgrown raccoon, as if unwilling to allow the noble name of the family Ursidae to be sullied by the inclusion therein of a creature which subsists on a staple diet of bamboo shoots. Even the name by which the giant panda has become known in English was borrowed from a much smaller animal, the red panda.<br/><br/>""Kung Fu Panda"" is based upon a similar concept to the Disney cartoon of ""Robin Hood"" in that anthropomorphic animals are used to represent humans. The story is one which could have been the subject of a Chinese live-action martial arts film; an evil warrior (represented by a snow leopard) escapes from prison and spreads terror throughout the land, but is finally thwarted by an unlikely hero when the greatest kung fu masters have failed to do so.<br/><br/>The story is treated as a comedy, so Po the panda becomes a comic figure. He is cowardly, clumsy, overweight and greedy, although being an anthropomorphic panda his favourite dish is not bamboo but noodles. Nevertheless, the wise old sage Master Oogway predicts that Po is destined to overcome the evil snow leopard Tai Lung and tells his disciple Master Shifu to begin training the panda in the martial arts. (Oogway is a turtle- a creature associated with wisdom in Chinese culture in the same way as the owl in the West. The name ""Oogway"" is derived from the Chinese for ""turtle"". Shifu, whose name is Chinese for ""master"" or ""teacher"", is supposed to be a red panda, although he does not bear much resemblance to one). At first Po seems to be completely unsuited to the disciplines of kung fu, and is resented by Shifu's other, more talented students, a tigress, a snake, a monkey, a crane and a mantis. Shifu eventually realises, however, that the way to motivate Po is by playing on his love of food.<br/><br/>The story has been described as a comic take on the ""hero's journey"" narrative which underlies many Hollywood movies as well as traditional myths and legends. (The ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" films are also based upon this narrative). The ""journey"" in such stories can be spiritual rather than physical, and Po's journey is one from self-doubt to self-belief. A key moment comes when Po's father (not, as one might think, another panda but a goose) reveals to him that his famous ""secret ingredient soup"" does not in fact contain a secret ingredient; what matters is that people believe it to be something special. Similarly, Po starts to become special the moment he starts to believe in himself.<br/><br/>In a departure from my normal practice, I am not giving this film a mark out of ten; cartoons like this are primarily aimed at children, who tend to judge them by very different standards from adults. Nevertheless, I will say that this is a film which I enjoyed. My wife, who is herself Chinese, enjoyed it even more that I did, as it reminded herself of the ""wuxia"" films with which she was familiar in her own childhood. (The wise old master, the self-doubting disciple who learns to believe in himself and the kung fu master who follows the way of evil like Tai Lung are all stock figures from these dramas). The Chinese-inspired style of the computer-generated animation helps give this film a distinctive local flavour and the amusing antics of Po make him a great comic character."

The Furious Five were pretty awesome in my opinion, I mean the best part of the movie is when there fighting the villain on the bridge. I haven't seen the sequel yet, but I here there's a lot more of them.

He eventually is given the chance to try and accomplish his dreams. The character development in this animation is greatly explored. Po's character development is great and enjoyable, the characters of the Furious Five are given the spotlight for some time. The plot is great and Po is challenged and put up to the test to see if he truly is a Kung Fu Panda warrior. A lot of fun, enjoyment out of the cool action and adventure.

","Kung Fu Panda is one of the best films that Dreamworks Animation has put out and still holds up well. Po, voiced by Jack Black, is a panda who is the biggest fan of the Furious Five. He works at his father's noodle restaurant, even though he loves kung fu. On the day the dragon warrior is to be announced, Po does everything in his power to get in to see who the dragon warrior is. However, a surprise happens as Po is selected.<br/><br/>Now that Po is to be the dragon warrior, he is one who must defeat an evil snow leopard named Tai Lung. Master Shifu, voiced by Dustin Hoffman, must train Po to do what may have been impossible and put him through rigorous training involving food in order to motivate Po.<br/><br/>The Furious Five are all excellent supporting characters. The stand out of them is Tigress, voiced by Angelina Jolie. Jole is excellent at being the uptight, tough one who truly thinks Po does not belong. Ian McShane is also excellent as Tai Lung. McShane brings a real tough intensity to him that shows Tai Lung's true evil spirit.<br/><br/>The best part of this film is how directors Mark Osborne and John Stevenon rely mostly on the story. They show that if you have a great story to follow, everything else will fall into place. This film has great dialogue and great transitions from scene to scene."

We were all either laughing and grinning most of the way through. The action sequences are superb and there are a lot of them without being violent. I also enjoyed a lot of the message in this movie although it seemed like something you would find in a fortune cookie. There was almost no dull moment, the action sequences were a lot better than a lot of CGI movies that should have been more about the action. The visual were great and the story is very engaging and moving although it's a very simple and straightforward story that isn't all that original. But it still carries the movie very well to the point it's more than passable. A lot of the characters also stands out and they all have their redeeming qualities.

","Kung Fu Panda will leave you and your family smiling as you recall Po the pudgy panda's struggle to believe in his own strength and follow his heart. Jack Black lends his voice to Po: Kung Fu's biggest fan. We can laugh with his earnest attempts to become a Kung Fu master despite his apparent lack of physical strength or agility. It isn't until an accident (or fate) unexpectedly lands Po in the role of the revered Dragon Warrior that he must truly learn to trust in his own worth and save his new friends and family from the vicious and vengeful snow leopard, Tai-Lung (Ian McShane). I am a preschool teacher and a huge fan of animated films. This film was one of the few that I enjoyed in 2008. Director John Stevenson out did himself. Revolutionary animation techniques even allowed for both clothing and fur on each of the animals, something that is generally not done at the same time in a film. Slow motion fight scenes and intense action sequences will keep even the most energetic little boys enthralled. Young girls will feel empowered as Angelina Jolie and Lucy Liu lend their voices to the female Kung Fu masters of the film, proving that martial arts are by no means for boys alone.<br/><br/>An all star cast makes up the film's martial arts masters, the Furious Five. The Five consists of Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Viper (Lucy Liu), Crane (David Cross), Monkey (Jackie Chan), and Mantis (Seth Rogen). They all help to create a challenging environment where Po can learn both the history and skills of Kung Fu. Dustin Hoffman lends his voice to their strict guru, Master Shifu. <br/><br/>A film that could have possibly dropped the ball by relying solely on its star-studded cast list shines through as an inspirational and highly entertaining children's film that even parents won't mind watching. Po's enthusiastic but clumsy attempts to ditch his munchies and become the true Dragon Warrior are sure to make you chuckle at least once or twice. This film inspires hope in even the clumsiest of little pandas."

"Eternality","9","1","1","3 March 2011"," DreamWorks scores a direct hit with Kung Fu Panda, injecting a sense of freshness to an otherwise traditional and clich√© narrative.
","Kung Fu Panda is DreamWorks' best animated release since the global success of Shrek in 2001. The second major animated picture this year after Horton Hears A Who!, Kung Fu Panda is timed perfectly to cash in on the profitable summer blockbusters period, and more strategically, to avoid direct competition with Pixar's new feature, the highly- anticipated WALL.E which will hit our shores in August. The debut feature film of Mark Osborne and John Stevenson, Kung Fu Panda provides an auspicious start to their filmmaking careers. <br/><br/>As the title suggests, the film is about an overweight noodle-selling panda, Po, who harbors dreams of becoming a top kung fu warrior. By accidental luck, he finds himself being labeled as the next Dragon Warrior whose immediate task is to defeat the evil Tai Lung and bring peace to the village. The story of an underdog rising from a humble background to become a destined fighter has been interpreted in many ways and in different genres of cinema (e.g. Rocky, Kung Fu Hustle). Kung Fu Panda is no different; in fact there's nothing original about its plot. So what makes the movie worth the dollars?<br/><br/>Two reasons. Jack Black and the hilarious portrayal of Po. There's no one better to do voice-overs for Po than Black. He captures the characteristics of such a character with unnerving accuracy which is not a surprise as Po is modeled heavily after Black. Furthermore, Po is created in such a way that every body movement and facial expression of his are highly exaggerated, providing a heavy source of comicality and laughs aplenty. As a matter of fact, Kung Fu Panda is arguably the funniest animated film in years. <br/><br/>The action sequences defy physics ala Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. They are kinetically pleasing though much less inventive than expected. One standout sequence involves a scramble over a dumpling between Po and his master using chopsticks and plenty of side-splitting acrobatics. In a nutshell, DreamWorks scores a direct hit with Kung Fu Panda, injecting a sense of freshness to an otherwise traditional and clich√© narrative. There's no better way to snack on Hello Pandas than this. Recommended!<br/><br/>GRADE: A- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved."

","Kung Fu Panda is the story of Po, a fat clumsy Panda, son of a noodle shop owner goose, who loves Kung Fu and dreams of being a Kung Fu hero and finds himself being chosen as The Chosen One to fight the evil forces and a renegade who threatens his village.<br/><br/>The animation, an action comedy, is good and very lovable, but nothing remarkable. The story is predictable, the message ""believe in yourself no matter what"" well known, and the characters stereotypical. However, the script is great, very engaging and funny, the main characters and the performances of most voice actors are so good that you soon forget the flaws of the film and fully immerse yourself in it.<br/><br/>The film is highly indebted to Jack Black's performance and self-deprecating humor, which really suits the personality of Po. At the end of the movie one wonders, what came first, the Panda or Jack? Also brilliant in their dubbing are Dustin Hoffman as the cranky teacher Shifu, Randall Duk Kim as the wise spiritual old tortoise Oogway, James Hong as Po's goose father Mr. Ping, and Dan Fogler as Zeng.<br/><br/>The other characters, despite being important, are mostly action figures and don't have many dialogs, but the voice actors d0 a good job too: Ian McShane as the renegade snow leopard Tai Lung, Jackie Chan as Monkey, Seth Rogen as the Mantis, Lucy Liu as the Viper, David Cross as Crane. Angelina Jolie's voicing of Sexy Tigress is very bad; she sounds as if she was reading something without acting; she should have made the effort, as her character has only a few lines, or the directors demand more from her.<br/><br/>This is one of those unpretentious movies that, even if you don't fancy to watch, will certainly entertain and amuse you. Great time and fun for everybody!"
"siderite","7","1","1","9 December 2010"," It was funny, but rather bland
","The animated story of a fat panda dreaming to become a great ninja should have been about awkwardness, involuntary humour and overcoming one's limitations. This film was exactly that. The voice acting was top notch, the 3D animation good, the funny animal faces perfect. But it was so incredibly predictable, that it brought only a type of indifferent fun for me. Maybe it was because I have seen old Jackie Chan movies and I knew how things will go, PG rated and everything, but every single little scene was in my head before it happened.<br/><br/>Bottom line: it is one of those funny American animations that you can easily laugh to, but that slip your mind the next day. You've got fat jokes, kung-fu jokes, funny faces, an angry misguided villain and the calm wise master; you've got animals acting like humans because it is funnier, not because it means anything to the story; you've got an easy effortless win from a natural talent. The secret ingredient was truly nothing."
"Ytadel","7","1","1","2 December 2010"," DreamWorks done good
","Like the rest of the western world, I love Pixar - from Toy Story to The Incredibles to Ratatouille, they've delivered some of the finest, most timeless and age-proof entertainment of the last fifteen years. Even their lesser efforts like A Bug's Life and Cars make the other kids' movies that surround them at the multiplex look leaden and trite. But this casts the harsh, judgmental light of comparison on Dreamworks, and although Shrek was a fun little flick (that has rapidly aged), I haven't been impressed by most of the work they've put out since then, pop culture-infused cookie-cutter kiddie flicks awkwardly constructed around their voice stars (the fish with Will Smith's face will forever haunt my dreams).<br/><br/>But everyone can change and everyone can evolve, and while Kung Fu Panda isn't a pockmark on a timeless piece of art like Pixar's Ratatouille, it's a lovingly constructed, humorous, and more-than-competently made tribute to old kung fu movies and a solid piece of entertainment. I genuinely liked it.<br/><br/>First off, unlike the ilk of Shrek, this movie contains NO pop culture references other than innate stylistic similarities to the kung fu flicks it lightly satirizes and pays tribute to. It stands on its own feet. Secondly, while the titular panda is very much an avatar for Jack Black's standard goofy personality, the movie doesn't make the easy mistake of just taking that and letting it sit there like a limp fish (voiced by Will Smith) - while it mines that particular style for humor all the way through, the character is forced to take responsibility and evolve, and the evolution is pretty much the same standard you would ask for if this movie were the same story starring Jack Black done in live action. Citizen Kane it's not, but there is a character arc. Third, the animation leaves Madagascar and Ice Age choking to death in its dust. No, it's not Wall¬∑E, but the characters are fluid and vibrant and the art and settings have a vaguely dusty, ancient, ethereal, Chinese feel to them that doesn't feel phoned in.<br/><br/>Also, the infinite potential of animation is actually taken advantage of to produce some pretty nifty kung fu / fight scenes. It's obviously all synthetic, being animated and whatnot, but the choreography and ideas actually build on that to do neat things that couldn't be done in live action (at least not easily and without millions of wires). There are old-fashioned kung fu fights with kicks and blocks and punches and jumps, that have a sense of momentum and energy. None of the action blew my mind to pieces but it was all entertaining to watch. As was the comedy, which was pretty much all either slapsticky type mishaps or building on the ""Jack Black"" personality, but relatively little of it felt juvenile, and I had some laughs.<br/><br/>Of course, it's not perfect by any stretch. The story - fittingly for a kung fu movie - is very simple, straightforward, and doesn't innovate in any way. None of the characters besides Po the panda, his primary mentor Shifu (skillfully voice acted by Dustin Hoffman), and the villain receive any development whatsoever; they are pretty much all paper-flat, and it seems a shame that they have Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, Angelina Jolie, and Jackie Chan voice acting but barely use them for more than a half-dozen lines each. But I don't think the kids this movie was basically made for will care, and not having ten million pop culture references, this movie actually won't painfully age year by year like certain movies starring green ogres played by Mike Myers. So I'd give Kung Fu Panda a thumbs up, not an ecstatic one, but a comfortable one."
"reese19","9","1","1","1 August 2010"," Kung Fu Panda-Great Animated Movie
","I highly recommend the film Kung Fu Panda. I have to admit that I assumed that this movie was advertised to kids between the ages of five and ten because of the animation. I only watched this film because it was a class assignment but I actually enjoyed it. The film is short and made for all ages. In the film, Kung Fu Panda, Po, the main character, is an overweight panda that secretly dreams of one day being very good at kung fu. In actuality, he is the son of a goose, Mr. Ping (voiced by James Hong), a noodle restaurant owner. Po literally drops in on a ceremony where the elderly Master Oogway, a tortoise (voiced by Randall Duck Kim) is selecting the next Dragon Warrior who will defeat the escaped villain, Tai Ling, (voiced by Ian McShane). Po is ""accidentally"" selected to be this savior even though he was not an invited party to this ceremony. During these beginning scenes, if you do not pay close attention you will surely fail to notice Po as he lands smack dab in the middle of the ceremony. I really enjoyed this movie laughing at all of Po's antics as he makes his way to the Grand Warrior ceremony.<br/><br/>The theme of this movie was to follow your dreams, believing in yourself no matter what others may feel about you. Po had to learn to be what he dreamed he was destined to be, even though his father Mr. Ping wanted him to be something else. He had to ignore being taunted about his weight by the Furious Five in order to realize that he was the ""chosen"" one. Kung Fu Panda's theme was very similar to Happy Feet. In Happy Feet, Mumble had to learn to be comfortable with his talent, tap dancing, not being overly concerned with what others thought of him and for being blamed for the fish shortage. In Kung Fu Panda, Po had to find his inner strength and look beyond being ridiculed and overweight in order to be the next Grand Warrior. Mumble was told that penguins do not tap dance and Po was told that overweight pandas are not going to be martial artists. Po and Mumble were both unique and treated as outcasts but in the end became heroes.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda had ample sound effects that were present that made a movie watcher feel as if he/she were there. The graphics were suitable and so were the lighting, angles, and music. The scene where the messenger is going through the mountains during the winter with the wind and snow howling, displayed how those background sounds help to make this scene realistic for a film watcher. The camera is tilting as the messenger takes a journey down to verify that Tai Lung is still locked up. This technique allows the camera to focus on the messenger tilt upward to follow his path in one continuous shot. Even though the camera is in a fixed location, it is flexible enough to follow the movement of the messenger and the guard. The prison breaking scene is excellent for an animated movie. It demonstrated Tai Lung's escape through sound and lighting to emphasize him breaking free. The arrows were whirling pass his head, missing each time. His deep guttural groan as he broke free of the chains was a great way to use sound.<br/><br/>Even though this movie was PG rated and geared towards kids, its universal theme or message in Kung Fu Panda, was to be confident in yourself, even if you are not the best looking, richest, or educated person. If you have this confidence then no matter what others might have to say about you, it only matters what you think about yourself. Po and Mumble both did this and forged lasting friendships through respect and admiration. I again highly recommend Kung Fu Panda to people of all ages."

I am just curious about why Americans are interested in Kung Fu so much. Instead of Taekwondo which is Korea's. But this movie is the one of my favorite movies. I can't take my eyes off it from the beginning until the end because it is very unique, cute, interesting and creative movie.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda is the story of Po. Po is a sweet, kind, but clumsy and fat Panda who has great dreams that save the world. Po has no experience of Kung Fu, but he wants be a warrior who fight with furious five warriors. He is a son of a cook. So his real job is serving noodles at his dad's noodle shop. One day, he heard some good news about selecting the Dragon Warrior from the Jade Temple. So everyone wants to go to the celebration to see the competition is between Tigress, Viper, Crane, Monkey and Mantis. They are well-known warriors and they are popular.<br/><br/>Po accidentally enters the contest and is named the Dragon Warrior. Master Shifu must find a way to train Po and make him a Kung Fu Master. The special teaching for Po with delicious food is very impressive. At last Po is trained well because he want to eat some delicious food. So he can practice Kung Fu over and over. I think Shifu is a great teacher, because he teaches learner's centered education.<br/><br/>This is a cute animated comedy that also inspires lessons in life. The audience can relate to people who have dreams of doing the impossible, just as Po. Po is not handsome, not smart, he is fat. Frankly speaking, he looks like a loser. But his dream is amazing and his passion is great. So his dream comes true. He becomes a hero. Po learns that if he believes in himself, he can do anything. This film is for the whole family, because adults will enjoy the movie just as much as their children. So let's aim high, fly high like Po. Even Po can make his great dreams comes true.<br/><br/>I Love it! The story was great and the background was beautiful, it really felt like an ancient Chinese city. Especially Tigress's voice is attractive. It's Angelina Jolie's voice.<br/><br/>The movie made us happy and laugh a lot. It was perfect because it has comedy, heart, and action, all necessary elements in a successful and great animation film.<br/><br/>I let my students see it at school and they enjoyed it, too! We were totally laughing, smiling from beginning to finish. and I downloaded the script of it, and make some blanks for my students. They could fill the blanks with joy.

","I was pretty skeptical about Kung Fu Panda at first. I thought a movie about a kung fu panda would be too dumb and westernized. However, I was gladly wrong. Every element of the movie resembles an old Asian kung fu movie. The fight scenes are very memorable and you can tell the animators worked hard on them. One of the things I did hate about the movie is the casting of the voice actors. The ""Furious Five"" are supposed to be great kung fu fighters and stuff, and are voiced by celebrities. However, they barely have any importance to the story. And it seemed like Angelina Jolie's Lion character was the only important one. Jackie Chan was the monkey, and he literally had only two lines! There was absolutely no point in having these high profile actors. Some parts of the movie are too clich√©, but overall ""Kung Fu Panda"" is pretty good."

","Kung Fu Panda tells the story of a martial art loving panda by the name of Po who lives in the Valley of Peace, protected by his idols, the Furious Five, and their master, the legendary Master Shifu. When Shifu's malevolent ex-student Tai Lung breaks out of prison and threatens to create more havoc in the valley than he did once before, Po is chosen, seemingly by accident, to become the Dragon Warrior; the prophesied hero who is the only one that can stop Tai Lung. Shifu is reluctant to train him, seeing his lack of attributes required of a kung fu master. However, he is eventually convinced to believe in the panda, and discovers a method to train him into a true warrior.<br/><br/>A product of Dreamworks, which has always been regarded as the poor man's version of Pixar, KFP shows the filmmakers venturing into previously uncharted territory for CG films; kung fu. And they have brilliantly incorporated a wealth of elements into the film; from most notably Shaw Bros movies to even Taoist philosophies and Confucian values, combining them with Tex Avery style cartoon action and humor. Even the action scenes were surprisingly taken seriously, and the directors managed to emulate real kung fu moves for the characters in the fight scenes. From start till end, the dumpling sparring sequence between Po and Shifu is a prominent example of all that combined, and remains one of the best animated scenes I have ever seen. Being Chinese I can only feel proud to see the animators putting so much effort and attention to my culture, and exposing them to the world in a major motion picture.<br/><br/>The voice work is outstanding, most notably Jack Black's, optimizing his comic talent as the title hero. Black could effortlessly transit his voice from blind optimism to insecurity, all part of the incredible spectrum of emotions he displays for Po. Dustin Hoffman is faultless as the authoritative Master Shifu, and it just puts a smile on your face to hear the voice of the master himself, Jackie Chan, as Monkey.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda triumphs as an action spectacle and a family comedy, and is a sincere tribute to the culture of the other side of the world. It takes a lot of heart, devotion, meticulous attention to detail and a collective amount of talent to achieve this. It is quite hard to imagine the kind of effort it took to bring all these together, because they certainly did not come together by chance.<br/><br/>Like the wise Oogway would say, ""There are no accidents."""

In fact, though the Oscar folks would heartily disagree, I even enjoyed it more than last year's Oscar winner, WALL-E. That's because while these other films looked exceptionally nice, KUNG FU PANDA actually looked as good but offered a lot more entertainment and fun. Sure, it wasn't as deep as WALL-E, but it was enjoyable and didn't try to be a message film. And MONSTERS VS. ALIENS had a great idea, but the laughs were rather sparse.<br/><br/>The film is essentially a story about a young panda learning that he has a lot of heart and skills deep within--in other words, it was a lot like THE KARATE KID. But it also had a lovely artistry that I admired---the scenery and style looked very Chinese (although too many voice actors were non-Asians).<br/><br/>I could say a lot more, but now it's a year after the film debuted and there are a bazillion reviews already.

This films starts off quite funny, and goes through the motions of acceptance and all that, but it's narrative is fairly weak, and after awhile, Jack Black's Po got quite annoying.

They both did a great job! The humour was pretty good, particularly with Po's fan-boy characteristics in the beginning, but his character became more and more annoying as the film progressed, and the whole Dragon Scroll things was a very typical waste of energy that reflects the overall message of the movie.

As it stands, Kung Fu Panda feels like it was cobbled together from the leftovers of 100 other movies involving chosen warriors, sagely mentors, crises of confidence and spooky supervillains. I recognized scenes lifted from Star Wars, from various karate movies, and even from the long-forgotten (or so I thought) Judge Dredd! This is not exactly a trailblazing film, in other words.<br/><br/>Also, I actually disapproved of Kung Fu Panda's underlying message about always ""following your dream,"" even if it's (a) utterly implausible and (b) involves telling your family to buzz off. You see, at the start of the film, the panda is working in his dad's noodle shop, but he dreams of being a karate master - even though he's lazy and fat. So, in order to become the hero, the panda has to reject his father's life's work and, through no particular effort of his own, become a super-powerful warrior.<br/><br/>Call me Mr. Cranky-Pants, but I think that message might actually be bad for little kids. The film, in short, tells kids to be dissatisfied with ordinary jobs - like working in a restaurant - and encourages them to pursue ridiculous unlikely jobs, like unstoppable warrior hero. It annoys me, really, that hundreds of Hollywood movies are all about vaulting over ordinary people (like the panda's dad) in order to make it big. Foreign films, you'll notice, don't always have this ""become a rock star"" message, and are actually about realistic things and realistic people. But not American movies, noooo...American movies tell you that you can become a karate master without exercise and leave your boring dad and his boring everyday job in the dust.<br/><br/>Right, enough ranting. I suppose I've been spoiled by watching too many foreign movies lately, and I can no longer get behind cute formula fiction like Kung Fu Panda. That doesn't mean I hated this movie. The animation was nice, the action was cool, the celebrity voices impressed. I just wish that a single original idea - or even a shred of realism - had been displayed as well."

","Maybe I missed something in this movie, but I thought it was one of the worst movies I have seen in quite some time. At least for adults. True, there were a few cute jokes, but how many jokes can be done at the expense of the panda being fat and flabby before the audience, even children, say Okay, we got it. The theater was about 2/3 full and for most of this movie people were getting up to leave; adults and children. A man a few seats down was snoring, which was one of the more entertaining aspects of this movie. Some of the dialogue was muddled and some of the action so fast it was hard to keep up and not get a headache. It had a nice basic plot, which was okay, but there were aspects of this movie that were not fully developed, and this included character development. For example, when Po asks his dad if he's really his dad (since the dad was a duck). I would have liked to see more development of the main characters, other than Hoffman's, as that would have at least added something to the movie for the adults. And apparently not too many kids liked this movie either, at least on the day we went, since throughout the entire movie they were talking, and not about the movie. And for the most part, the voices for each character fit, but Black's voice for Po just did not work well for the personality for the character on screen. It seemed like Black was holding back, which is too bad, since, like Robin Williams, for example, you let them go and what comes out is pure magic. Even in animation and the dialogue is more scripted."

","Well here we go with another CG animated movie full of cutesy animals. Will it be any good or will it be simply average like so many of its competitors (only Pixar produce consistent gems). Well I went in to this movie with high hopes having read a positive review in 'Empire' and the fact that I was viewing the movie in IMAX would surely help. Well unfortunately not. This is just an average movie where everything is well done but no connection was made with the characters on my behalf. Admittedly most of the children in the audience seemed to enjoy the film (but I felt even they would of enjoyed it more). The animation is strong though I found the fight scenes a bit like watching a computer game. But I just was not taken with any of the characters and the main character of the Panda just did not do it for me, there was just too much Jack Black here and not enough character. The films ends with an inevitable conclusion and although by no means a bad movie it would take a lot for me to watch this again."
"FilmCreature","8","3","6","21 June 2008"," FilmCreature Reviews 'Kung Fu Panda'
","According to Wikipedia, ""China has one of the longest histories of continuously recorded martial arts tradition of any society in the world, and with hundreds of styles probably the most varied. Over the past two to four thousand years, many distinctive styles have been developed, each with its own set of techniques and ideas."" One of the coolest things about Kung Fu Panda is that it seems to celebrate some of these individual styles, representing them with its own animal. The animated martial arts in the film is lithe and mesmerizing; surprisingly sharp for a kids movie. Teens, parents, and kung fu fanatics will all get their money's worth with this high-spirited and high-energy flick.<br/><br/>The plot is obvious. A fat, lazy panda (voiced by a precisely cast Jack Black) gets a chance to prove his worth as the ""Dragon Warrior"" who will save China from the wicked snow leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane). In order to do this, he must be trained by Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), a deceptively small red panda who has trained the greatest kung fu warriors in all China, the Furious Five, voiced by (*deep breath*) Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, and David Cross. Of course, they all expected to be chosen to be the Dragon Warrior, and here's Chub Fu to take away the coveted prize.<br/><br/>The voice talents are mostly generic. The exceptions would be Jack Black, who brings a slacker panda reminiscent of Kevin Smith comedy to life almost flawlessly, and Dustin Hoffman, doing such a good job as Master Shifu that you won't even recognize his gravely enunciation unless you listen closely.<br/><br/>I recommend 'Kung Fu Panda'. Everyone'll have a blast. Even if it's predictable to the very end, the characters are all likable, and the film has a cartoony animation style but still looks gorgeous.<br/><br/>3/4"

","Po (voiced by the incredibly talented Jack Black) is a fat panda who likes kung fu but never dreamed that he would one day be chosen as the Dragon Warrior. He also never imagined having to fight the fearsome Tai Lung (Ian McShane), who is as mean and vicious as villains come. The reluctant fighter gets help in preparing for his showdown from Master Shifu (voiced by Dustin Hoffman), and the interaction between teacher and student provide many of the laughs. There's a lot more going on around this simple storyline, and the movie is filled with comedy and action from start to finish. The animation is brilliantly done, the characters' facial expressions are priceless while the kung fu action is flawless. Although much of the humor is action-based, there's also much wit and satire in the script along with a good dose of tenderness and heart. Among the many lovable characters, my favorites are Po, Master Shifu and Master Oogway, an even older and wiser teacher who decided that there's no reason why an ordinary panda cannot be a superhero if he just believed in himself."
"hello_alexz","10","3","6","16 June 2008"," What a real Chinese panda!
","The reason why I saw this film in the very first place is because it relates to the Chinese culture and Chinese features, especially, Chinese Kungfu. Though a Chinese I am, I am not a big fan of Chinese Kungfu and quite indifferent about the animated film. But, after I finished the Kungfu Panda, I was indeed carried away to the ancient China by the film which unravels the 100 percent pure Chinese culture and features- Chinese Kungfu of course, Chinese Zen culture from the words of Master Wugui(turtle), Chinese settings( pine trees, high mountains, temples, music and garments as well), and, hilariously, a few Chinese words( Chi-eat, Wugui-turtle, Shifu-master, just to name a few). <br/><br/>Besides all the Chinese features, the film alone also is highly impressive with the laugh-out-loud funny leading character Po the Panda, the heart-pounding Kungfu fighting, and the inevitable but must life philosophy not in the pedantic way. What I like best of the film is the ending, when Master Shifu finally found his inner peace, Po the panda disturbed him once again unintentionally with his innocence regardless of his awesome record of beating the Tailang. What a Panda!<br/><br/>I wish that China could produce its own animated Chinese Kungfu Panda, dragon, or whatever, but when it couldn't, it's also very nice to see America did it and, especially, presented the real deal of Chinese culture. Thanks a lot!"

","I don't know what to say, exactly, about this movie, except that it was about as close to pure distilled comedic awesome as I have come into contact with in recent years. That said, this is not humor for every person, as it is not always perfectly clear where the punchline is. The fact of the matter is that the entire movie should be treated as one giant jab at old, super-cheesy Kung-Fu movies. However, rather than flatly lampooning it, what we wind up with is a deconstructionist approach to the genre. Rather than making fun of specific elements, Kung Fu Panda seems to set out to, instead, write every Kung Fu movie ever made, and does so to hilarious effect. It is a simple plot, but well-executed, and the animation is superb. Every frame is a work of art.<br/><br/>The only thing that keeps me from giving this movie a perfect score is that it is so simple, and the depth of the movie suffers somewhat from it. However, the movie does have a point, let no one convince you otherwise. It is nothing earth-shattering, and is somewhat in the vein of ""feel-good"" types of thematic statements, but it is, all in all, an excellent movie, and one I would recommend all should see. Unless you have a personal vendetta against Dreamworks, CGI movies, animation, Eastern culture, martial arts, or Jack Black, I could just about guarantee you would enjoy this movie."

"jgibbon08","8","3","6","12 June 2008"," A new take on an otherwise generic plot
","Call it generic, but 'Kung Fu Panda' is one of the most enjoyable films I have seen in years. Jack Black voices a lovable overweight panda named Po, living in China selling noodles in a family business. Po has developed an interest in the ancient art of Kung Fu, but accepts that this interest can only be a dream and nothing else. This changes however, when he crashes a Kung Fu ceremony and is named the Dragon Emperor. Although the other Kung Fu students protest, their master proclaims 'there are no accidents'. Simultaneously, a Kung Fu master named Tai Lung, who was previously denied the title of the Dragon Emperor and became evil, has just escaped from prison and seeks revenge. It is up to the unlikely hero, Po, to become a master and stop him.<br/><br/>While the ending is predictable, what separates 'Kung Fu Panda' from other animated films is how damn funny it is. 'Kung Fu Panda' is a mere 92 minutes, which is perfect because it never feels dragged out and it never gets boring. The animation is visually stunning, which is especially apparent in IMAX. The martial arts fight scenes represent a breakthrough in computer animation. Each character perfectly matches the personalities of the actors who gave their voices to them. Jack Black is perfect as the lazy Po, and Angelina Jolie is equally convincing as the fearless and powerful tiger Tigress. 'Kung Fu Panda' is guaranteed to entertain people of all ages, and leave them laughing even after they leave the theater."

","The wonderful bit of dialogue mentioned just above is not from an artsy fartsy movie or some sweeping epic that will stun the Academy for years to come. Instead, we receive this nice line (albeit used before) from the surprisingly good Kung Fu Panda. While it is not even close to being original, Kung Fu Panda is surprisingly funny, surprisingly rich, and has a surprising amount of decent fight choreography that might even impress the legend Jackie Chan. With Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman leading the way with their superb voice acting skills, we have the best animated Dreamworks picture since Madagascar. Yes, this includes the Shrek sequels.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda follows Po (Jack Black), a friendly fat panda that has one dream in life, and that is to be the best at martial arts. Unfortunately, his size and his lack of coordination hamper his potential. His opportunity actually arrives after he is revealed to be the chosen one that will save the village from an extremely angry tiger. Much to the dismay of the better fighters in the area and their trainer (Dustin Hoffman), they must whether accept this revelation of attempt to take in the role of protectors themselves. As you can tell, the plot borrows heavily from other films past and present, but we're not totally about the narrative¬óbesides, the short running time doesn't allow us to dwell into the storyline either.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is the best since Madagascar as well. While the Shrek sequels never attempt to enter the next level in animation to the likes of Cars and Ratatouille, or attempt to try something different, Kung Fu Panda offers a variety of animated styles that includes but isn't limited to: slowing the action down, freeze-framing some shots, rendering into 2-D, and then sometimes speeding up the action so quickly you have to be paying attention closely or you'll miss out. The physical humor here resembles that of Madagascar; fast-paced, witty, and with plenty of it to go about. The fights themselves are actually well-choreographed and quite creative; some of the best you'll see in quite some time. A good fight is tough to film, even tougher to create from scratch. The advantage of animation is that you can manipulate the camera and allow it to catch up to the action, and they use this ability well. Unfortunately, the good action sequences occur only in the second half of the movie.<br/><br/>Besides Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman, the voice acting isn't that wonderful. There is no point in Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, and Angelina Jolie getting paid the millions they are probably receiving for their roles¬óthey barely have over 20 lines in the film. The main chemistry and relationship that works well in Kung Fu Panda is that of the main character and his mentor. Dustim Hoffman's performance as the mentor is easily one of the best animated performances of the decade, going up there with Ellen DeGeneres in Finding Nemo, Holly Hunter in The Incredibles, and Sacha Baron Cohen in Madagascar.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Kung Fu Panda starts off slow, but then builds plenty of momentum once the story shifts gears and the climax is approaching (literally and figuratively). The fights are good, the animation is good, the laughs are definitely in here, and its surprisingly rich dialogue offers some useful advice for kids and adults. The movie isn't going to be a hallmark in film history like Pixar's best work, but it's definitely better than most Dreamworks animated films. Kung Fu Panda is a good original story that will entertain audiences of all ages.<br/><br/>P.S. Dreamworks was smart in releasing this before the heavily-buzzed Wall-E."

It will bring you a lot of fun. The story is quite easy,but I think that's supposed to be that way. The Kung Fu action in the movie is awesome too. Ofcouse Jack Black and Dustin did a great job too. I watched some other movies which had Chinese cultures in there, I didn't like them well. But this time, seems they did so well to show the real side of the culture, not just build them in. I watched Kung Fu Panda with my husband. He loved it too. He is a very picky guy, he even said it is a great movie to watch. There were a lot children in the theater, I could feel they had a great time in there. I even saw a little girl watching it and taking pictures with a camera. I guess it might be her second time to watch it."
"tavm","9","3","6","9 June 2008"," Kung Fu Panda is one of the best from Dreamworks Animation yet
","While I admit to falling asleep at some scenes (parts of Tai Lung's escape and some of Po's training), I was mostly highly amused and entertained by what Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) was teaching Po (Jack Black). In fact, this was one of the most entertaining of the Dreamworks Animation features. Po gets befriended by five other of Shifu's students: Viper (Lucy Liu), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), and Tigress (Angelina Jolie). The villain, Tai Lung (Ian McShane), was another student of Shifu's whose attitude got him jailed for 20 years. Also of interest is Mr. Ping, Po's restaurateur father (James Hong), who turns out to be quite an inspiration to his son though it doesn't seem that way at first. Black's line readings and the animation movements of his panda character are some of the funniest I've seen and heard on the screen yet and the relationship between Po and Shifu are some of the best mixture of funny and touching especially the end scenes that end up quite differently than you'd expect (perhaps the fact Kung Fu Panda is mainly meant for kids have something to do with it). So on that note, this movie comes highly recommended for the whole family though it's okay if you just watch this alone or with a friend as I did. P.S. I loved the 2-D animation that began this movie (which included the unique way the Dreamworks logo was done here)."

I even teared up when the turtle died. This movie did exactly what a movie is supposed to do. It kept me entertained until the very end. I was even a little disappointed that there wasn't more.<br/><br/>A word of caution. I took my 2 year old daughter because I thought it looked like a good family movie.

"Archblood","8","3","6","8 June 2008"," Enter The Panda
","A long time ago, in Ancient China, there live up in a mountain top dojo, five formidable warriors under the strict guidance of their red panda master, Shifu (voiced by Dustin Hoffman). Together as a mighty force to be reckoned with, these ferocious fighters battle evil and help to defend the innocent folks of a nearby village.<br/><br/>One day, Shifu's teacher, Oogway (voiced by Randall Duk Kim), an elderly tortoise, has a premonition that Shifu's former disciple, a snow leopard by the name of Tai Lung (voiced by Ian McShane) will escape from his fortress prison and return to terrorize the village and the dojo. With little time left, the moment has come for the prophesied Dragon Warrior to emerge and take hold of the Dragon Scroll and its mysterious secret.<br/><br/>During a ceremony to elect the destined hero after the five disciples of Shifu had demonstrated their Kung Fu abilities, an animal came falling from the heavens while making botched attempts to see the disciples in action. Eventually, Oogway pinpointed the giant panda as the One much to the shock of Shifu and his disciples.<br/><br/>Meet Po (voiced by Jack Black), reluctant hero and assistant at his father's noodle store, whose only interest seem to be eating and fantasizing about being a great Kung Fu warrior.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda is a fresh direction for DreamWorks Animation in cultural sense following the Shrek series and other animated features like Madagascar and Bee Movie. New challenges also arise for the animation team, most notably in the well choreographed fight scenes. Excellent attention had been given to the Chinese environment and as always with previous DreamWork's features, the movie's graphically top notched as the CGI feature opens with an explosive introduction that has a much more traditional animated look than the rest of the movie. Just pay attention to the swaying fur on Po.<br/><br/>The plot execution is good and so does the character development, especially for the leads like Po and Shifu. My only complaints up to these point is the under-used voice talent of Jackie Chan (voicing the highly agile disciple of Shifu, Monkey) who seem to given only pathetic one liners to sprout, thus unnecessarily making him the least talkative of the Five. Understanding how terrible his English pronunciation can be, he should at best be given the odd role of speaking Chinese like the Amazing Yen of Ocean's Eleven fame.<br/><br/>The rest of the character roster include the members of Shifu's Five, Tigeress (voiced by Angelica Jolie), leader and most deadly of the band, Crane (voiced by David Cross), an ace in aerial combat, Viper (voiced by Lucy Liu), a snake with lighting fast strikes and Mantis (voiced by Seth Rogen), a critter with very strong arms.<br/><br/>While the disciples are rather light hearted about Po's special appointment despite earlier uncertainties about his abilities, Tigress is still very much against his place in the dojo and convinced that the Five are able to defeat the evil Tai Lung without him. Shifu was very doubtful as well but the final wishes of Oogway leaves him with little choice. A montage of scenes began to reveal the reasons behind Shifu's reluctance to train Po as memories of a young Tai Lung being tutored by the pint sized master flashed across. Ultimately, betrayal and guilt drove him to attempt control over circumstances.<br/><br/>Emotional moments in some scenes of Kung Fu Panda delivers but gets a little too sentimental at times. Still, they help us to understand the problems of the key characters and the way they had to dealt with their shortcomings. Positive credits also have to given to the voice acting of Dustin Hoffman and especially Jack Black who is able to articulate the dilemmas and goofiness of Po.<br/><br/>While it has a healthy dose of fast action and ridiculous martial art moves, Kung Fu Panda, like many animated features targeted at kids, also has its presentation of life lessons, the core one being that the belief in oneself despite personal disadvantages will bring out the best in the individual. Some viewers will probably much dismissed those as clich√©s but it will certainly make many feel good about facing life's challenges.<br/><br/>With a balanced plot, interesting characters and of course, good old Kung Fu, this well crafted animated feature is no doubt the feature to watch for this year. Competitors for the Annies should get intense with entries from Blue Sky Studio (Horton Hears A Who!) and the yet-to-be-released Wall-E by Pixar, vying for the 'Best.....' spots.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, you can expect the kids to be tickled by Po's clownish antics and the older folks entertained as well, by the main sell (Kung fu, of course) of the movie."

I would skip Kung-Fu Panda easily, but whad'ya know, the ""making of"" was rather interesting, which made me ignore my tingling spider-sense and giving it a try. Truth be told - the movie looks very good (as expected), and I'm a sucker for these marvelous 2d animation eye-candies which seems to be popping around in those 3d movies. And so the animation is great, the character design is inspiring and everything Appears to be working out well. Well - too bad looks ain't enough in order to make a movie. it might suffice for a screen saver, a poster or even a rather interesting ""making of"", but that's as far as it goes. Sadly most of the plot is rather dull, same old jokes, same all goofy animal who just doesn't seem to find its place, but hey, polls and statistics claims that about 50% of western children are overweight to obese. Most of them have broken dreams of becoming things they can never be, so why not selling them the illusion that any fat loser can be the ""Supreme Dragon Fighter""? Pack a few lame jokes along the way, and you're good to go. Usually in similar films when the clueless loser is supposed to undergo a path that will make him the ultimate hero, he either practices and improves or finds out about some ""magic quality"" he had within himself all along. In this movie, the makers of the movie didn't bother themselves to make a choice, so the Panda hero easily shifts between the options, not really qualifying for any of them. He gets better and seems to know stuff even though he had almost no time to practice, and when that doesn't suffice he suddenly turns into ""fat people don't get hurt, only bounce your attacks back with their fat"" mode. Such behavior could have been tolerated farther if the jokes or the plot would cover up for it, but they don't.<br/><br/>This entire movie... no, the entire 3d ""family action comedies"" genre (or whatever name the studios choose to call them) seems to be repeatedly chewing, then puking itself, and so on and so on. Rather sad (sad, you see, not funny) if you think of all the talented artists and animators who do a great job, but are forced to dance to the rotten melody of untalented, uninspired impotent directors and writers.<br/><br/>This movie manages to get 4/10, solely due to its looks and visuals."

If the Panda were female or if he were a caricature of a visible minority, jokes of the same ilk would be inexcusable, so how is this funny? I'm sick to death of this trite perpetuation of a stereotype that, at best, teaches children forget that there is a broad range of what is beautiful, or, indeed, what is healthy.'There is evidence that fat people who achieve cardiovascular fitness through exercise have better health outcomes than lean people who don't.' Many people are overweight. Many people think that being fit means being lean. We have to stand this idea on its head and film and TV would be a powerful way to get these ideas across to the burgeoning generation, instead, we perpetuate cruelty and a culture where eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder, ranging between 5-15% for patients with anorexia and 1-2% for those with bulimia; where people with these eating disorders have the potential for imminent and serious self-harm (those with anorexia are 57 times more likely to commit suicide than the expected rate for women in the same age/racial groupings).

Cleverly scripted, it follows the Joseph Campbell ""Hero"" formula with several twists of individualistic humour, primarily allowing Jack Black's deliberately stilted story telling style to be relayed in the opening sequence (as witnessed in ""School of Rock"" and ""Be Kind, Rewind"").<br/><br/>The movie pays homage to many Chinese greats including ""Enter the Dragon"", ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" plus several early Jackie Chan movies.<br/><br/>The animation style is predominantly Dreamworks' own with just a touch of Manga.<br/><br/>My children (7 and 3) and I were laughing very early on, usually at different scenes, proving once again that Dreamworks has the formula to appeal across the age demographic.<br/><br/>In true Chinese food style, we felt sated when the credits started rolling. Ten minutes after leaving the cinema, we wanted to see it again...<br/><br/>My 7 year old son gave it 21/10. I'll settle for a more modest 9/10."

","I saw this last night at a theater in mainland China with four of my 20-something year old Chinese friends. There were about 25 people in the audience: no kids, only other 20-somethings (cinemas here are usually only attended by young couples looking for a place to go), but the movie was a hit nonetheless.<br/><br/>The film had been dubbed in Chinese, so I didn't get to hear the original voices (that's why I can only rate it a 9; I'll have to watch it again later in English) but the story itself and the lines as they'd been translated went over really well with this audience. (One of my friends commented afterward that it was so good he wondered if the English version could match it!!) <br/><br/>The theater was full of laughter all throughout. The audience (including me, an American 40-something) loved the story, the characters, and especially the brilliant slow motion ""takes"" with their great sound effects.<br/><br/>To be honest, like several others who've commented here, I really wasn't expecting much. I was VERY pleasantly surprised. If you're in any doubt whether or not to go, GO!!!"
"amateur100","Null","2","4","11 June 2008"," equaled if not surpassed Ratatouille
","I had the pleasure to see this film last night in theaters. I was expecting little. Maybe it was because Dreamworks hadn't really made films to my liking recently, or maybe it was because I didn't think Jack Black's comedic talent (what I thought to be a mix of his voice ALONG WITH facial expressions) would do well in an animated film. Well, Dreamworks delivered what I thought to be the best comedy I've seen this year (that's right, include the non-cartoons in this category).<br/><br/>The animation, firstly, was a major reason for the film's successful comedy. I was correct in saying Jack Black's facial expressions give merit to his overall performance, which is why the graphics and the perfection of just that in the visual characters had to be spot on- and it was. The script was surprisingly blunt and heartwarming at the same time. The voices were perfectly and hysterically matched (anytime Po the Panda's father spoke I couldn't stop laughing). The fight scenes were actually very impressive while maintaining the spoof-feel of the film, making them well-choreographed (if that's the term you use for a cartoon) and one of the funniest aspects of the movie.<br/><br/>In all, I couldn't stop laughing throughout the whole movie. Now I don't really know if it's a ""great"" movie in all aspects for it to be an Oscar-winner, but I think the laughter speaks for itself on the matter of whether to buy a ticket and see this movie as soon as you possibly can."

","Kung Fu Panda has always been one of my all time favorites. I was a little worried that the film would not hold up as well on multiple re-watches, but my conscience is reassured. This film is as good, if not better, than I remember it being.<br/><br/>Po's character is both hilarious and relatable. Jack Black's voice acting is astounding, and he really brings the character to life. The other characters are all well written and serve the plot well. I particularly liked Shifu and his arc in this movie. Oogway filled the wise old mentor role, with great quotes and life lessons. The Furious Five are funny and good side characters, although they could have been fleshed out a bit more.<br/><br/>But by far the best character in the film is Tailong. His motivations are understandable, he has an intimidating presence, and he makes for a formidable opponent. The part where he escapes from prison is one of the best villain establishing moments I've ever seen. Tailong then single-handily beats the Furious Five in an epic showdown.<br/><br/>Another important aspect that the film had to get right was the Kung-Fu fights, and I'm glad to say that it was quite mind blowing how well choreographed it was. Each battle had a purpose, and every punch or kick had a meaning behind it. It was also really smooth looking.<br/><br/>The message of the film isn't the most original, but it's executed beautifully, as both Shifu and Po understand the power of believing in something. The dragon's scroll is blank, and the way the characters react to it really highlights the difference between them. If you work hard and rightfully earn the scroll like Po, you see yourself in it and can understand that the true power comes from within. And if you chase after the scroll desperately, sacrificing everything for it, like Tailong, then you're forced to reflect at yourself and see what you've become.<br/><br/>I also love the color palette of the movie. During Tailong's scenes the sky is usually dark and red, but whenever Po shows up it turns yellow. There's a nice little attention to detail, and plenty of call backs at the end that you'll notice if you pay attention closely. This is a movie that is especially rewarding upon re-watching. Kung Fu Panda is a story that will entertain kids and please adults, it will make you laugh and stare in awe, and as soon as it's over you will want see it again."

"quiqueperezsoler","8","0","0","5 May 2020"," Formulaic yet mystical, amusing and incredibly well animated. Props for the striking swift and creative fights.
","As an upbeat movie that provides some sort of homage to kung fu movies and follows the chosen-one and embrace-your-destiny tropes it succeeds in all aspects. As a ground-breaking, oscar-worthy, emotionally deep animated movie it doesn't quite strike that impactful as some of the themes are approached comedically instead.<br/><br/>Where a movie about a norms' breaking panda who at first was unfit for a destiny he was chosen for finds himself discovering who he trully is, could have communicated that known trope in a new groundbreaking way; it settles for an eye-grabbing old-China aesthetic setting, endearing anthropomorphic characters and an epic, funny and mystical story worthy of praise and originallity.<br/><br/>However, it is inevitable to compare it with other animated movies that set the bar back then like Shrek and PIXAR movies of the 2000s. And unfortunately the movie borrows its tone from the studios' critically-acclaimed previous movie Shrek. A tone that works in that movie because it represents a satire of Fairy Tales tropes and stories. Kung Fu Panda on the other hand, provides emotional weight to each of its characters taking many of its themes maturely enough to be taken seriously. Not to say that the humor doesn't fit the story, quite the contrary, it is welcomed and I personally find some of those moments amusing. Nevertheless, some of the more emotional moments are ruined as Po's character is overly played for laughs. Outstanding lessons in such a spiritual approach at the art of Kung Fu through the character of Oogway or even Shifu loose their emotional impact because right after it Po deliveres slapstick comedy.<br/><br/>Personally, should the movie had embraced its mysticism and provided a more mature take at the common trope of embracing-your-destiny in such a lacking backdrop that is Ancient China, it would have become a more impactful tale aside from the amusing and heartfelt movie that it is. Kung Fu and other martial arts are perfect to channel a spiritual journey a troubled or lost person can take to find his/her destiny or to cope with the past or search for the future. Movies like the Karate Kid and the Last Samurai and even anime like Dragon Ball Z are good examples of these approach. Although a more comedic, child-friendly approach is refreshing and welcomed it can potentially damage the more spiritual aspects if they are mutually exclusive or if the humor is excessive<br/><br/>IN CONCLUSION, the film is one of the better ones of DreamWorks Animation as its endearing and jaw-droppingly well animated characters, plot and setting provide a spectacle of well-chorographed fights, legendary foes, mystical masters and an inspiring uplifting tale of self-confidence and acceptance. And the best part is that the sequels expand not only in the new adventures of the protagonists but also on their backstory. Dreamworks knows how to do sequels."

","In China, the big, fat and clumsy Panda Po is a great fan of martial arts and worships The Furious Five - Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper and Monkey - and their Master Shifu. He works in the restaurant of his father specialized in noodles, but he dreams on being a kung fu hero. When Master Oogway summons the population to announce who would be The Dragon Warrior, he surprisingly points out to the slacker Po, frustrating the expectations of Master Shifu and Tigress. Po joins the academy of Master Shifu that does not believe that Po might be The Dragon Warrior. Meanwhile the evil Tai Lung breaks out the high-security prison where he has been arrested for twenty years and heads to the temple of Oogway, expecting to get the Dragon Scroll and becomes more powerful. The Furious Five tries to intercept Tai Lung, but they are defeated. Now the only chance to stop Tai Lung is the glutton Po.<br/><br/>""Kung Fu Panda"" is a very funny and entertaining animation, with the delightful story of a clumsy Panda that dreams on being a hero. The computer-animated heroes and villain are hilarious, supported by the voices of Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angeline Jolie and other magnificent actors and actresses. Po is tailored for Jack Black and I can not imagine this character without his voice. Dustin Hoffman also makes the difference with the voice of the wise Master Shifu. I just regret that I did not pay much attention to this animation before and only now I have watched it. My vote is seven."

","Now, I'm not saying Dream Works hasn't made better movies. All I am saying is according to me, there can be no movie that can touch me deeper. I can go on and on about this movie and probably reach the max characters limit, but I'll keep it as short as possible.
Why this is the best movie?
1. A complete circle: All scenes are poetically repeated. I'll give few examples. Most of them are how Po used Shi fu's teachings to defeat Tai Lung (such as, 1. Po punches daruma doll and gets hit; same thing happens to Tai Lung when he punches Po, 2. using your enemies weakness against them: when Shi Fu is trying to get rid of Po, he beats him right and left and says the above dialogue then. Panda uses Tai Lung's tails( which is quite a cat's weakness) against him while fighting him.) Other examples include, how Shi Fu treated Tigress after Tai's broke his heart and how both Shi Fu and Po believed in their masters despite a vehemently opposing logical impossibilities stood before them.

","Such an entertaining movie. You can watch it time and time again and still find another hilarious line or part to quote. The animation is well done and character performances are great. Jack Black is hilarious, doing what he does best with sudden, random outbursts and slapstick humor.<br/><br/>While the humor and story are spectacular, the reason this movie resonates with me so deeply is the message: 'To make something special you just have to believe it's special'. While simple and maybe cheesy, the way the movie showcases this message is incredible. Taking an out of shape Panda who cannot see his toes and transforming him into the Dragon Warrior. It is the same process as making the Secret Ingredient Soup - taking something ordinary and making it extraordinary by believing it is better that it appears to be. Wonderful message. Highly recommend."
"TheMovieDiorama","6","0","0","22 August 2019"," Kung Fu Panda sporadically uses the Wuxi Finger Hold to produce an uneven yet delightful animation.
","A family-oriented parody animation, paying homage to the classic martial arts features that clearly inspired it. 'The Karate Kid', 'Enter The Dragon' and even 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' as a more obscure credit. Whilst not at the stylistic level of 'Hero' or 'House of Flying Daggers', there are glimpses of cinematic allurement, yet the basic story and one-dimensional supporting cast of anthropomorphic animals prevented this flick from reading its own omnipotent dragon scroll. In ancient China, a kung fu enthusiastic panda named Po is nominated as the ""Dragon Warrior"" and must fulfil his destiny in vanquishing the antagonistic Tai Lung.<br/><br/>Bravery. Self-belief. ""Skadoosh"". The timeless legend of a bumbling panda beckoned to save the realms of China from an evil snow leopard, where the vital aspect of life itself is the power of belief. A basic moral for children to abide to, and a pleasing adventure for adults to be entertained by. Stunningly animated, particularly the introductory sequence resembling Chinese shadow puppetry, with many shots bursting vibrant colours at every opportunity. Even the lighting was superbly animated, bouncing off furry character models exquisitely. Zimmer's score harnessed Chinese instruments and utilised them to their full potential, exhuming a rural aesthetic that complemented the environmental design.<br/><br/>Then of course, you have Po. The titular beast that would do anything, and I mean anything, for a cookie or dumpling. Voiced excitedly by Black who executed his consistent comedic timing with ease, but failed to take hold of the more heartfelt moments. And that's where my biggest criticism lies.<br/><br/>The visual comedy overwhelmed the poignant moments for the characters which rarely allowed any connectivity between them. Oogway's departure, seen through the eyes of the fragile Shifu, was probably the only heartfelt moment. Po couldn't quite capture any pure emotion, whether that be due to the frenetic screenplay or Black's overabundance of comedy is up for debate. The remaining cast members, aside from Hoffman, were forgettable and could've been replaced by anyone. The Furious Five rarely made an impact to the overall story, and essentially only provided one fight scene against Tai Lung, whom of which was terribly miscast as McShane as he lacks that sharp bite from his voice. Atleast they addressed the fact that Mr. Ping (goose) was the adoptive father of Po (panda), because that could've been an awkward conversation for parents to have with their children.<br/><br/>With Kung Fu Panda being a DreamWorks Animation product, it's unequivocally one of their more memorable films. Beautifully encapsulating ancient China in an accessible story for everyone. Its simplicity and heartfelt absence does however prevent it from realising its true potential as an all-round animated classic. Wait, let me say it one more time...""Skadoosh""."

","'Kung Fu Panda (2008)' tells the now timeless tale of an affable, Kung-fu-crazy panda who's thrust into the spotlight, and then forced to face an almost unstoppable foe, when an ancient martial arts master names him the elusive 'Dragon Warrior'. What it does better than nearly all others of its ilk is hit home its incredibly powerful, wonderfully positive message (""there is no secret ingredient"") in a scene that never fails to make me tear up. This profound message - which, for my money, might just be the best ever committed to animation - is paired with a bevy of otherwise marvellous themes to create a holistic, layered experience that's as affecting as it is entertaining. The central dynamic between our protagonist, Po, and his reluctant master, Shifu, is supremely satisfying; it leads to some truly excellent development of both players, marked by their relationship to the secondary characters as well as to each other. Even if the supporting cast generally don't get full arcs like Po and Shifu do, they all feel as rounded and relatable as they need to be. The humbly wise and usually prophetic Oogway represents someone truly at peace with their place in the world, interestingly playing out the classic 'mentor' role for the actual mentor and student of the movie, whereas the charmingly confident and uncompromisingly callous Tai Lung (perhaps the third most developed role and an overall intriguing antagonist) represents someone who cannot accept who they are, which leads to a phenomenal piece of puppeteered performance late-on when he unexpectedly receives an apology instead of his perceived 'reward'. The film is generally quite traditional, with characters who fill archetypal roles and a structure that's known as a fundamental cinematic technique. However, it does this with flair and maintains a firm grasp on its characters and themes throughout. Because of this, it ends up as a very tight and rewarding experience that comes together as neatly as possible and doesn't waste a single scene. It's just so well-written. It also has its roots in Chinese culture and martial arts movies, taking a page from a multitude of books to come up with its own visual and narrative style that's sort of adjacent to 'Wuxia'. This gives it a unique, visually appealing aesthetic when compared to 'western' animation of the era, even if the basics of its movement are consistent with the then (and even now) favoured more 'realistic' approach. The fight sequences are inventive, fast-paced and energetic. They're exaggerated yet grounded, with a focus far more on the fluidity of movement than on the brutality of battle. The complex bridge bout is technically masterful, the emotionally-charged father/son face-off is visually stunning and the sprawling final brawl is gratifying as it is fun. Each action scene is used to push the narrative, or the character development, in some meaningful way and they all look and feel unique, reflecting not only the fighting styles of the combatants but also their personalities. Bringing the latter to life is an excellent voice cast, probably one of the best assembled for an animated affair. However, it would have been nice if the cast had included a few more Asian actors to reflect its setting - adding to the already present Lucy Liu, James Hong, Randall Duk Kim and Jackie Chan. I feel this lack of representation is reflective of the piece's age rather than its intentions, but it's still worth mentioning. It's almost inconceivable that this is made by the same studio as 'Bee Movie (2007)': it's easily one of the best animated movies of the twenty-first century. Along with only, perhaps, 'Shrek (2001)' and 'How To Train Your Dragon (2010)', it totally blows DreamWorks Animations' otherwise relatively stale reputation right out of the water. In fact, I'd even say it gives Pixar a good run for their money. It's highly enjoyable, emotionally affecting and thematically rich. Plus, I haven't even mentioned how funny it can be or the fact that its score is one of the best I've ever heard. It truly is awesome. 9/10"

","It had solid performances, beautiful visuals, surprisingly funny humor, good sequences and a well-constructed story with good characters...but I have one problem: I don't think Po's fighting skills were earned. Pretty much the whole movie it seems like he sucks at fighting, and he never really gets any better until near the end the fight with Tai Lung. Here we see that even Po is surprised when he suddenly starts fighting well. We can see Tai Lung's punches tickle Po, with this weird blue magic energy stuff. It seems like Po never even learned how to fight, but the dragon scroll, or his destiny, or something starts fighting for him, which left me a bit unsatisfied. Still, this little annoyance doesn't take away from the overall experience.<br/><br/>I give Kung Fu Panda an A."

","Kung Fu Panda is one of the animated films that defined the late 2000s outside of the Disney supergiant. It has an artistically creative opening that has a style that continues in later scenes. Jack Black is the supreme choice to play a fat panda and he does it. As a character Po is a great one track panda that brings humor to the table through his personality and through physical gags. The lesson of the film is kind of shoved in your face by the end and the characters definitely have very obvious character development. This plays to the target audience though so it is alright.

","Kung fu panda is a enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS
Po is a decent character.
He goes trough a decent character arc.
He is first a man who is a fan of the furious five but then gets choosen to be a dragon warrior. He believes that he isn't the Dragon warrior and dosent fit in until something happens that makes him believe that he is the Dragon warrior and he saves the day.
Shifu is also a good character with a little development.
After Oogway died he Was the guy who needs to take the mantel and lead his students to become the greatest Dragon warriors they can be. He dosent believe in Po first but he felt obligated to lead him the right way when Oogway died and he learned an important lesson.
The side characters were alright.<br/><br/>VILLAIN
Tai Lung was actually a good villain.
He is cool and they managed to set up how much of a threat he is to the Heroes and he has an alright backstory that gives the villain a tiny bit of depth.<br/><br/>ACTION

I really wish the Furious Five had more time to develop and feel like real characters. As it stands, besides Tigress, it's hard to even vaguely describe any of them.<br/><br/>2.) The story, while definitely not bad, feels a bit uninspired. They make the plot fun, but it still lacks when you realize the potential they had with the characters.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was a great opener for the cast of characters. While it left some to be desired from the supporting characters, the main ones worked great together. Exciting fights, punchy comedic moments, and a lovable panda all work together to make a really fun movie."

","13 June 2008. The amazing blend of animation, sometimes unfamiliar voices from known actors, and the strong script make for a compelling and surprisingly well-told story-based animated movie. While the animation wasn't as always sharp or realistic as some recent movies, it some ways it made for a better movie as it was told periodically in fantastical, magical ways. Jack Black's character and his on-screen persona was softened with references to Mr. Black's sometimes obnoxious comedic antics while Dustin Hoffman's wise sage role also dampened Mr. Hoffman's sometimes redundant on-screen persona. Mr. Hoffman's character in some ways brought out a finely nuanced, new side of Mr. Hoffman's acting ability and character something that was well captured in one of his previous outstanding roles in Tootsie (1982). As for the rest of the cast, such as Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, they are for the most past unrecognizable as their on-screen personalities and this was well and good for it made the movie have to stand more on its own that depend on their past characters but on their acting abilities to bring to the screen new characters. Only James Hong, a well-known Asian character actor's role was strongly presented, the father of Jack Black's character. Overall, this animated feature blended strong moral lessons along with creative martial art scenes and comedic humor that all came together to make this movie an entertaining, but emotionally sensitive movie. The only important element missing was the edgy, biting realism that today's more contemporary mature audience requires. Eight out of Ten Stars."

","Following the story of the panda who wants to learn martial arts - Po (Jack Black) this time is to replace Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) to teach the five great teachings including Snake (Lucy Liu), Tiger (Angelia Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogan), Stork (David Cross). And yet, a buffalo (J.K Simmons) raises the grave only to take revenge on the Elder (Randall Duk Kim) because he used to kick his ass in the past. And this time we saw a little more about Po's origin when Po's father appeared.<br/><br/>If the first part is about the impossible journey to become a hero, then the second part is to continue to train to become more powerful. The third part is the journey to become someone everyone respects - a master. But along with that is also the journey to learn yourself, your own source. Perhaps this is the most beautiful part of the three, not saying that the parts that were ""short of breath"" but the image quality were somewhat better. This is extremely interesting when the action scenes are detailed but beautiful, along with Hans Zimmer's contribution, we don't have to complain about the audiovisual segment.<br/><br/>As for the ""acting"" part (voice acting), Jack Black still retains his performance like the previous parts, all the laughter of the movie is almost captured by him. The mind is the same as the soul of the whole film, but this content and implication is somewhat ""goat tiger"" part two. Because this time must also face an enemy, while learning a new lesson - the content of part one and two. In addition, when Shifu kept saying ""I am very young"" after all that Po had experienced. The only other story this time is probably learning ""new moves"".<br/><br/>That said, obviously, the film also has many unique features this time. As if Po had to teach a bunch of pandas as his relatives to study elaborately, while Ngu Dai had his own work (although they lacked the same land as before) and also a series of actors new again. Kate Hudson's unexpected appearance as Mei Mei really took away some laughter from Jack Black, but the most striking was the participation of Bryan Cranston as the father of Po, Li Shang in the role Po's adoptive father and JK Simmons' undisputed talent as the main villain this time is Kai. This is probably the most interesting guy from Tai Lung (Ian McShane) part one. A strong guy but also has a history of exciting pushing. But the funny thing is that even though he's not known. However, with the talent of J.K Simmons, this character is even more interesting when having his own funny face.<br/><br/>Unlike Kung Fu Panda 2, this time it's like the end of the series. The end of the hero ""Long Binh"", although quite unexpected, is very wonderful and very satisfying. Although it is only about the main theme of ""surpassing yourself"", this is not a bad thing to teach, especially with small children. In general, if you love the first two parts, this is a ""must see"" already. And if it really is the end for ""Long Binh"" it is also extremely spectacular.<br/><br/>Perhaps coming here, I do not need a lot of words for you to ""carry"" out of the theater to be able to enjoy great hours with Kung Fu Panda 3. With a huge cast of talent and talent. Ignoring some old rules, everything is excellent."

","I do not know that it is still possible. Thanks to first impressions advertisements and personal experience. I thought I would get a stupid silly children's movie that hopefully can entertain your 3 year old.<br/><br/>BUT I was 100% wrong. The movie was incredible in the truest sense of the word.
It was a really serious, and profound martial-arts-film you can also interpreting with a good message.<br/><br/>Po is, of course, a typical ""All-Loving Hero,"" but in this movie, it was indeed a good fit to understand his goals and motivation, so you are always excited when he went one step further and was happy with his success and progress the time is learning more and more.
In addition, I find Tai Lung is not a good opponent let alone antagonist. He has a good fighting style but does not do much and is not really taken seriously of his cheap motivation.
That would be tolerable if he was at least really dangerous or visibly evil, but he's just a strong jerk.
Tai Lung does not even have a really balanced character design, a few red or black shades would have done him good.<br/><br/>That made the whole movie a wonderful experience and tied me to the screen from the first second.
The colors, the world and the music immediately fascinated me and all with such an interesting lore that I first thought it was a bit wasted on a children's movie.
But there I was also completely wrong, because the idea and implementation are so perfectly interlocked that it's great to grow up with such a movie.<br/><br/>All that and a few super cool fights that you could compare to a Jackie Chan movie.
The only things you could probably improve on are Po's clumsiness. Because the fat comic relief is not permanently funny.
Because in a movie about learning to fight kungfu, and that you should take geeks seriously, this is only to some extent endured.
Besides, the character names are chosen rather uncreative, of course we have some good ideas, such as: Grand Master Oogway (Chinese for ""Tortoise"") or Master Shifu (Chinese for ""Master""). But then we also have names like Tigress, Crane, Monkey, Mantis and Viper what the hell?"

It's funny, action-packed, visually energizing and kick-started a franchise that's still going to this very day thanks to its sequels, TV shows and theme park attractions around the world.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda proves to be a great showcase for Jack Black's voice-acting skills and that he can be in a story that's equal-parts nonsense and no-nonsense kung-fu wisdom radiating from its central characters.

"EthanBJones_03","7","0","0","17 November 2016"," A Dreamworks Classic; recommended
","Overall: One of Dreamworks' classics. Very good movie for children and adults.<br/><br/>Good: The story is very well told and actually pretty good. The animations is solid and very well done. Not photo realistic but a nice cartoony feel. All the the voice actors did a good job which isn't surprising considering the cast. I really enjoyed the fight scenes and appreciated the more cartoony feel about them as well. Most characters had interesting qualities, layers and a purpose. The movie is quite funny with a laugh-to-not ratio of about 7:3 which is pretty good.The prospect of animals performing martial arts is a great idea. Tai Long is a great villain and a 'worthy challenge' for Po. There is a lot of character development which is very very nice. I really liked the twist at the end.<br/><br/>Bad: Some jokes weren't funny and a lot of people won't find it funny. I think that Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen etc were conned as they have like 3-4 lines each in the movie. The only two of the Furious Five members I found interesting were Crane and Tigress. I also didn't like the restriction of only a few animals in the village. I understand they probably wanted to be accurate but I'm sure there are more than what was presented. Oogwat feels less of a character and more of a plot device so I would have liked to learn more about him.<br/><br/>Best Part: The training montage between Shifu and Po.<br/><br/>MVP: Dustin Hoffman as Shifu<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>Silver"
"almita_pernas","10","0","0","29 September 2016"," Po won my heart
","This is the story of Po (voiced by Jack Black), a lazy panda who works with his father at a noodle shop and is a Kung Fu aficionado. He gets mistaken for the legendary Dragon Warrior of their village, the ""Valley of Peace""; but their harmony is at stake, for the treacherous leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane) seeks his revenge. <br/><br/>Po lives a comfortable and uneventful life, that is, until the turning point of the story. It happens during a trial that aims to select, among five contenders, the ultimate Kung Fu warrior. They are known as the ""Furious Five"" and consist of Monkey (Jackie Chan), Tigres (Angelina Jolie), Viper (Lucy Liu), Mantis (Seth Rogen) and Crane (David Cross). And while their appearances fall short in the threatening department, (the tiny mantis is even adorable) they do make up a fierce bunch. Together with their mentors; Master Shifu and Oogway, must protect the Valley of Peace and it's inhabitants from the fury of Tai Lung. <br/><br/>While the course of the movie is rather predictable; because things follow a moral path and it does contain little clich√©s along the way (hanging bridge fight scene), it makes up for in the humour and charisma section. Po is a warm silly character and one cannot help but to emphasize with him and his innocent mess-ups. Master Shifu is the voice of reason, in one remarkable scene he fights Po over a dumpling in order to train him in the ancient martial art (it also features a training montage, just as clich√© as it is inspirational). <br/><br/>The movie is filled with hilarious moments that made me tear up of laughter the first time, and soon became very memorable quotes in my mind. Let's not forget that it has its emotional scenes too, the ascension of Oogway (Kung Fu Master) into the wind, is both peaceful and visually stunning. As silly as it sounds, and more often than not, I find myself giving advice taken from this movie, ""one often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it"" and ""Noodles... Don't noodles..."" The translation does not steal the comedy, as it is just as funny if not more in Spanish. <br/><br/>Visually, the studio has done an incredible job keeping up with the fast pace of combat scenes and its gravity defying moves. It also features hand drawn opening and closing credits; they are high contrast and slightly anime themed, but blend easily into the rest of film. The characters and landscapes are rendered beautifully and detailed without becoming distracting; you could almost see the individual hairs on Po's face. <br/><br/>2008 was a big year for films, and the highest grossing were Wall-E, The Dark Knight as well as Kung Fu Panda, so it was well received by the public. During the next year's Annie Awards, Kung Fu Panda pretty much won everything, including Directing, Character Design and Best Music. <br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda's original music was composed by Hans Zimmer and features Zee-Lo Green's and Jack Black's ""Kung Fu Fighting"". It is a version of Carl Douglas's song from 1974. Powell is a highly acclaimed composer and considered the king of animation and Zimmer had worked on the Lion King, Inception and The Last Samurai. Their score is fun, epic and obviously includes a lot of Chinese inspiration. <br/><br/>But perhaps, the most outstanding element of this film is it's moral, and just like in any other children's film, characters ""do the right thing"", evolve as people and eventually reach an ""enlightenment' moment. However, and it might have been the Zen influence, or the Buddhist atmosphere, but ""that"" message felt more sincere in this film. It transmits the wonderful aim of loving oneself no matter what, (even if one is a chubby panda) bundled in with determination, good intent, and the innocence that seems to resolve conflicts in a fluid way. <br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda at its core is the typical story of an underdog who rises to the occasion by realizing that his flaws are also his weapons. The laughter brings that plot to greater heights and by the end becomes a heart-warming yet hilarious experience for the entire family."

","Kung Fu Panda is a great movie with a well developed plot and a stellar voice cast. It's very warm family entertainment as we follow a kung fu loving panda who must prove himself as the chosen one. Po is a hilarious protagonist whom you also care for, he is lovable and easy to route for. He stands out as a Dreamworks whose presence is as memorable as Shrek and Alex the Lion, thanks to a great character arch and excellent casting. <br/><br/>However, I did find that there is not as much humour aimed at adults here. It is much more childish than the likes of Shrek, which have plenty of great innuendos that are subtle and hilarious for an older audience, which left me a little underwhelmed that it was not present here. <br/><br/>The cast is outstanding and suit the personas of their characters perfectly Jack Black was the perfect choice for Po and is joined an all star supporting cast that includes Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Ian McShane, Seth Rogen and Jackie Chan, to name a few. <br/><br/>The plot itself is nothing outstanding, but the film shows that all you really need to make an enjoyable animation is a dedicated cast and hilarious dialogue. Funny, innocent and beautifully animated. Kung Fu Panda may not be as memorable as some of Dreamworks previous work, but it is certainly worth the watch if you are looking for a good family film. <br/><br/>A panda must prove himself as a worthy associate to kung fu legends the Furious Five."
"tomgillespie2002","7","0","0","17 July 2016"," The jewel in Dreamworks' crown
","I must have seen Kung Fu Panda, either in its entirety or snippets here and there, over 20 times since its release in 2008. While its relatively simple tale of an underdog who has been laughed at throughout his entire life learning to fulfil his unexplored potential is nothing new, it remains effortlessly entertaining and the kind of film you can catch halfway through and still enjoy what it has to offer. Although the title promises plenty of fat jokes, and there are certainly plenty, the film goes beyond simply appealing to kids with sight gags by working in Chinese mysticism, some wonderful voice acting, and stunning animation that would only get better and more ambitious as the series went on.<br/><br/>Clumsy panda Po (Jack Black) lives in the Valley of Peace, a scenic ancient land in China overlooked by the Jade Palace, home to the legendary kung fu masters. While he dreams of joining the Furious Five - a gang of ass-kicking kung fu specialists consisting of Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross) - Po spends his days making (and eating) noodles with his father Mr. Ping (James Hong). When he spectacularly enters the Palace during the choosing of the 'Dragon Warrior', Po finds himself picked out by the wise old Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) as the one to stop to the evil Tai Lung (Ian McShane), an escaped snow leopard seeking revenge on Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) and his Furious Five.<br/><br/>Taking inspiration from the Chinese kung-fu movies of the 1970's as well as American geek culture, Kung Fu Panda works as both as a physical comedy and an action spectacular. Although the characters frequently defy the laws of physics and seem incapable of getting hurt, the action scenes are well choreographed and exciting, with McShane voicing his role with whisker-twirling relish. There are also hints at backstories and questions raised about Po's past (why on Earth is his father a goose?), and the film is wise enough to leave the answers to future instalments and trusting in its simple introductory tale of a misfit finally finding a home. While the majority of the Five don't really find a moment to shine individually, Hoffman lends a certain gravitas to his tragic backstory and relationship with the deadly Tai Lung. The pratfalls will entertain the kids and the gentler moments will no doubt charm the adults, something that Dreamworks generally fails to do with its animated efforts, so it's no doubt that the series remains the jewel in it's crown."
"ElMaruecan82","8","0","0","8 June 2016"," White (and Black) Bears Can't Fight...
","Where does the fascination for Kung-Fu movies come from? <br/><br/>My guess is that it relies on three simple levels: first, it's aesthetically appealing and visually gracious for what is still a fighting sport, unlike boxing or say, other martial arts, like Judo, any duel feels like choreography. Secondly, it is over the top in a very spectacular way, and thus explain its exploitation for video games, when the human body became as dangerous and efficient as some robotic armor. Besides, there's something fun in watching Kung-Fu movies, it is comical precisely because of the exaggerated moves and an actor like Jackie Chan based a successful career on turning it into comedy, without mocking the essence of Kung-Fu of course, but rather its applications.<br/><br/>Last but not least, there's an inner element of underdog stories in all martial arts, but especially Kung-Fu because it's one of these disciplines where you have the feeling that you can defeat the odds more than in any sports, as most of the learning is in the brains before the brawn, and the clich√© of the pint-sized Master, being the sum of all his wisdom and capable to triumph over an army of towering thugs, is inspirational to all the little guys who wished they could master Kung-Fu when it could help them. So, for all its underdog, comedy and spectacular premises, Kung-Fu was a darling for Japanese anime, and I, myself, grew up with a great cartoon called ""School of Kung- Fu"", but these were hand-drawn classic animation that didn't explore the true potentiality of CGI animation, like for video-games. <br/><br/>Finally ""Kung Fu Panda"", DreamWorks' animated movie, released in 2008, knew how to handle the sports sub-genre with the perfect mix of special effects and comedy, telling the story of Po, a panda who's designated by an old master (or fool, or both) as the new Dragon Warrior, much to everyone's surprise, including Po. Po is a panda, so obviously, he's a fat, a bit lazy, a bit easygoing, so inevitably hilarious character, and he's voiced by Jack Black, who strikes again after his Lenny in ""A Shark Tale"". But ""Kung Fu Panda"" is much more fun and engaging, there's no pop-culture reference, only Kung-Fu archetypes. We're all used to: initiations, wise masters delivering wise lines with such a quick wit we all feel dumb in comparison, long stairs to mount, super-choreographed fights, but these elements never feel recycled because the story finds a way to be original within the predictability of its plot.<br/><br/>Calling it predictable is a bit unfair actually, because there are many original things that strike: Po is a Panda living in a restaurant, his father for some reason, is a duck (James Hong) and there's absolutely no explanation, but his restaurant waiter Job, would serve the story (so to speak) in the most interesting way. Secondly, the panda has no personal pretension to seek any title, he's a fan of martial arts, but would rather watch the show (after triumphing over the stairs) than play the game. But the old turtle Oogway (Randall Duk Kim), tells Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) that he had a vision of the Dragon Warrior, Shifu displays the talents of his Furious Five, a tigress, a mantis, a crane, a monkey and a snake, but despite their talent, Oogway picks Po who accidentally disrupted the show. As he says, there are no accidents.<br/><br/>There are no accidents indeed as another vision of the turtle is proved true as he foresaw: the redoubtable Tai Lung escaped from prison to seek a revenge. I wouldn't dare to spoil the backstory of Tai Lung, but along with Shifu, Po and Oogway, he creates a quarter of great characters. Tigress, played by Angelina Jolie, is a close runner-up but I don't know what the fuss is about with the all-star cast of the Furious Five, they always operate as a whole and are not given much dimensionality or depth as the others. If only for the interaction between Shi-fu and Po, the film was worth to watch, despite Seth Rogen or Lucy Liu's efforts. Tigress isn't really exploited to her fullest, and the training part is rather brief, so I think there was a wasted potential, although the final result is still entertaining.<br/><br/>So we get a story where the hero doesn't consider himself a hero, nor does his master, but somewhat they're forced to believe in it, until the prophecy fulfills, it's one of these tales that encourage you to believe in your potential and the result would have been dull if it didn't use a clever use of Po's gluttony, and the wisdom of his father. The fight scenes are entertaining and spectacular, as the film had brilliantly explored the potentialities of CGI to make entertaining and spectacular stuff. In fact, it is a little overplayed as it gets closer to the appeal of video games, to the point you never get the feeling the characters can ever die, they defy gravity, they survive explosions or high falls so we're closer to Street Fighter than the real Kung Fu. But let's not make it a reason to dismiss the spectacle the film has to offer."

","Po is a clumsy panda that will bring many laughs to you. He is funny, loves to eat and you will easily like him. His dream is to become a Kung Fu Master one day and join the Furious Five rather than following his dad at making noodles.<br/><br/>This movie has unique characters (except maybe of Oogway and Shifu who reminded me of the two other fighting masters from some animated series) that are all well voiced. Story is easy to follow and it will keep you entertained throughout the whole movie. Fighting scenes are mostly good, especially when they're training.<br/><br/>Nice plot in general and it teaches kids that you must believe in yourself in order to achieve what you dream of.

","An old computer programming proverb says: the best written code doesn't need any comments, for it's self-sufficient. The same can be said about movies: the best of them don't need to be reviewed, for they are perfect without any side comments whatsoever.<br/><br/>But since IMDb makes you write at least ten lines of text for them to be passed as a review, here i go. I have first watched Kung Fu Panda back in 2008 and instantly fell in love. And every time i got to re-watch it, i kept falling deeper and deeper in love with it. Wall-E may be topical and artistic, but Kung Fu Panda is like a reflection of Po's soul: deep, kind and sincere. And that's exactly what we love animation for: that it turns us into little kids for a short time and helps us believe that there is good and beauty in this world and it's up to us to create and uphold it.<br/><br/>A good animation film just sends you this message, a great one allows you to feel it, a brilliant one can make you truly believe in it. And with Kung Fu Panda's magical touch that reaches for the deepest parts of a human soul, we can all become believers, and not just for 92 minutes."

","Talk about a movie that takes the cinema world by storm. A movie that is not only outstanding but masterful in making Kung Fu look awesome and respects it. A movie where the people of DreamWorks can look back and be proud of this achievement. This is DreamWork's first big hit critically and financially since Shrek 2 in 2004. Kung Fu Panda is made in 2008 with a major comeback from last year's Shrek the Third. But now what do I love about the film? Firstly they touch on the most important elements that make an animated film great or good. That is: Story, Animation, Music and Characters. All are done wonderfully. The story is creative, heartfelt, funny, and action packed. On the side note I do love that they use 2d animation for the opening sequence which is an artistic wonder to see. They actually give it an anime type feel. Then we get to my favorite part of the film: the characters. It's been a while since I've seen a group of character I actually enjoy not being just one. My favorite character out of all of them is not Po even though he is hilarious. That prize goes to Tigress. Right when I first see her I get this feeling of pain and sort of feel sorry for her considering what we learn about her in the film. I really hope they go into more detail about her as the franchise goes on. She's the most interesting and mysterious of the character because judging by the way she is makes me think that she must have gone through a lot in her life that just hasn't been reveled yet. The rest of the character are good themselves. I like Shifu because they don't do the typical wise old master of martial arts. But he actually always seems unsure and rough around the edges. As for Po who is perfectly voiced by Jack Black is the most unique hero since Mulan. He makes me laugh more then any other character. As a whole this film is without a doubt a classic that should be acknowledged by every generation. Story: A Characters: A Animation: A Music: B+ Overall: A"

","When people talk about the truly great animations I feel like there is one that isn't mentioned enough and that is kung fu panda. The premise of this film sees the fat panda po chosen as the dragon warrior who has to learn kung fu and defeat an all powerful enemy. Now I love the character po because he is somebody we the audience can relate too and connect with. He is also excellently voiced by jack black who manages to bring this panda on the level of characters like buzz lightyear and woody of likability. The rest of the cast are great too, Dustin Hoffman is great as his master and you see their relationship develop as the film progresses. The warriors the furious five were great voiced by greats like Angelina jolie and Jackie chan. There characters grew throughout the film and became likable by the end. Ian mcshane plays the villain tai lung and he was perfect for the role. His character is actually really interesting and mcshane did a really good job. The story is pretty basic but I thought it was done fantastically well. Nearly every character develops in the film and you care about them by the end which really isn't easy in an animation. The script was fantastic, people love the humour in this film and it is all hilarious but there is also some really good heartfelt dramatic scenes that worked really well. The style was great, all the animation looks fantastic and the action scenes really help sell the big stakes in this film. Overall this is one of my favourite animations and it should definitely be seen."

","In Kung Fu Panda, Jack Black provides the voice of Po, a portly panda who joylessly serves noodles in his father's shop. Po is a self-effacing kung-fu fanatic who daydreams of being a great warrior - in his head; Po destroys thousands of enemies, blinding them with the glare of his awesomeness. His plus-size silliness and an honest-to-goodness love for old school kung-fu set the stage perfectly for everything that follows. He idolizes both the art of kung-fu and legendary local fighters the Furious Five - Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross), together proving to be a terrific voice cast. Under the watchful eye of a kung-fu master, a critter named Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), the Five stand by knowing one among them will be chosen as the prophesied Dragon Warrior when the time comes.<br/><br/>Soon Shifu's master, the wizened turtle Oogway, declares it's time to choose the new master. But he doesn't select one of the well-prepared Furious Five to protect the Valley of Peace; instead he picks our slovenly, rotund hero instead as the fabled Dragon Warrior. Now afforded an opportunity to demonstrate his worth, Po tries desperately to prove himself to wise old Master Shifu and his new, skeptical dojo-mates. A lot of comic mischief ensues, as Po topples over, bumps into things and sends stuff flying like a fat, furry version of the Chuckle Brothers. The Five, initially seen as spiteful of Po's sudden fame, soon accede to the temple master, while Shifu learns to let go of his past failures and appreciate the wisdom of Oogway.<br/><br/>Then something rather wonderful happens, ratcheting the film up to the dizzying heights. In an exhilarating sequence, Tai Lung ‚Äì the psychotic snow-leopard who wants to get his hands on the Dragon Scroll that will afford him infinite power- escapes by negotiating the three fiendish levels of the jail in a flurry of punches, kicks and gravity-defying leaps that culminate in a magnificent series of vertigo-inducing shots. Everything comes together at the finale, when Po, having learned that his technique is based on his appetite, faces off against Tai Lung.<br/><br/>As Po, Jack Black provides goof-ball hyperbole at its 'Jack Blackiest'. With an over-amped bravado and childlike excitement, he creates a memorable slacker who, in spite of himself, still manages to rise to the occasion. He's well-matched by Hoffman, who gives the diminutive Shifu a brooding soul and a sage humor. Co-directors Mark Osborne and John Stevenson mix Black's good humor with breathtaking animated action sequences, allowing the film to play out as one heck of a tribute to the martial arts genre. From the devilishly clever sequence where the Furious Five take on Tai Lung on an unraveling rope bridge, to a hugely enjoyable training sequence between Shifu and Po and the final showdown between Po and Tai Lung, directors Mark Osborne and John Stevenson take advantage of the limitless possibilities of CGI to bring us action on a scale, and of a type, rarely seen before.<br/><br/>At the end, Kung Fu Panda proves to be dazzling, clever entertainment. The adventures of Po earn every smile, every gasp, every eye-popping thrill, and they do it all with a hearty, winking ""Skidoosh!"""

Are they gonna the route of Karate Kid, is it gonna end like Rocky but i think both these movies are unsuitable for kids, so how are they gonna succeed? <br/><br/>Well, you take the funny route, but then will it just be a slapstick comedy which just passes on scene by scene with no correlation? No, that is where exceptional direction comes to place. And you see that throughout the movie.

I have never been a fan of Jack Black, i liked him after Tropic Thunder, but the voice of Po in this is just perfect, no one could have done it better, he has the right voice of a innocent wannabe kung-fu champ and a fun panda, perfect casting. Other supporting characters are also done well, the only let down was Jackie Chan, am a big fan of him and would have seen him a bigger role, but i guess his actions are more enjoyable than his talks and hence was given a mellow character, i respect that.<br/><br/>Tai Lang is the scariest and perfect villain ever created by any animated movie. In my world, that guy could stand toe-to-toe with any human villains and still kick ass. He is just my favorite and the scenes he is in, just steals the show, the detailing was fantastic, he makes you feel, yes he has got to be the Dragon Warrior, come on, not the Panda, but the back story for not making him is buyable.<br/><br/>I have never been so entertained ever since Incredibles and i would say if the movie just had a little bit more Wow moments and better Family ties, i would say its better than incredibles. well that's a personal choice. But all in all a fantastic movie, you will have fun, laugh and made for everyone in the family."

","Like all other animations this movie sure took its time in developing the critical characters. Although maybe for this movie one might feel that it takes too much time in developing those characters that it feels that the character development still happens just until the main conflict, which is quite sudden for animation movie story flow. The jokes are absolutely funny, not necessarily because of the jokes itself, but because of Jack Black's comedic aura. I've watched two versions of this movie, one with original Enlish dialog with Jack Black's voice and one with dialog dubbed into Indonesian. The Indonesian version didn't have the jokes to be cracking laughs due to the dubber lacking Black's comedic prowess. The voice acting overall is nicely almost entirely Jack Black's influence. And that's quite fair in my view since his mark is all over the movie."

","Kung Fu Panda (2008): Dir: John Stevenson, Mark Osborne / Voices: Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Ian McShane, Jackie Chan: Disappointing animation about reaching full potential, which is something this overrated animation never does. Simple plot regards panda Po dreaming of becoming a Kung Fu fighter. When he is accidentally deemed Dragon Master his master sets about to prove him unskilled. For starters, being part of this film should be deemed unskilled enough. Chalk full of stereotypes and clich√©s with only the animated images to shine. Directed by John Stevenson and Mark Osborne who oversee the colourful images. Only Jack Black as Po really comes alive. He is a dreamer whose dreams are met but the idea of facing off against the snow leopard is something predicted long before it happens. Dustin Hoffman as the Yoda-like Kung Fu master is tiring. How many miniature creatures sporting wise words have to be Kung Fu teachers? Angelina Jolie as Tigress wants to move ahead thus she will have issues with Po that will evaporate when he proves himself. Ian McShane voices the tyrant villain whose destiny is to escape prison and beat up every Kung Fu warrior save for Po who will save the day. Iother characters are flat but the wildlife references make for a great evening of watching Animal Planet. Satire of Kung Fu films with a playful take on violence aimed at wrong audience.

","The Valley of Peace could soon see the escape from prison of the snow leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane), as being visioned by Grand Master Oogway, an old tortoise. Tai Lung is also used to be the adopted son and former student of Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), an elderly red panda. He wants revenge for being denied the Dragon Scroll, which is said to hold secrets to limitless power. That alarmed Shifu, who sent the goose Zeng (Dan Fogler) to prevent the escape of Tai Lung.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, giant panda Po (Jack Black) who has always being a kung fu fanatic and a fan of the Furious Five in Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), and Crane (David Cross), somehow managed to arrive in the arena which was to select the next Dragon Warrior to defeat Tai Lung. It was suppose to choose from one of the Furious Five who had all being trained by Shifu himself, but Po ended up becoming the Dragon Warrior instead, much to the dismay and shock to the Furious Five where they questioned Po's abilities to be one. Po is originally the son of a noodle restaurant owner in his goose father Mr. Ping (James Hong), and that originally stood against him.<br/><br/>But what was originally thought of an accident from Oogway's part in his way of selecting the next Dragon Warrior, would lead to Po train hard under the guidance of Shifu. That is even if the Furious Five themselves tried to deal with Tai Lung himself, before realising how powerful he has become.<br/><br/>What happens when it comes to the crunch, when Po and Tai Lung comes face to face with each other is definitely worth thinking about. In terms of how Po thinks about his kung fu abilities, and how Tai Lung sees his own as well. It is also what the film is trying to drive home as well.<br/><br/>It is a film which moves away from the traditional stereotypes about kung fu, and brings home a simple universal message. It does have its comedic moments, but it is all done without resorting to clich√©s and stereotypes. It is actually enjoyable to watch to begin with."

","A fun and happy piece of storytelling by Dreamworks animation! As an avid fan of Hollywood cinema, one genre that I never quite dwelled into was animated comedies from big studios like Disney or Dreamworks. For so long I used to wonder, after looking at the box office reviews and collections of such movies, why were they such a popular hit with the audience. Kung Fu Panda has satisfied all my qualms with a very heartwarming performance. I was suggested this movie by someone very close to me and was asked to enjoy the smiles that it would bring along with the shade of learning that it will offer. Kung Fu Panda does all that and more... The choice of characters and their voice over personas is spot on. Jack Black delivers the dialogs of a desperate and lovable panda with delightful humor. The background animations and character designs are very cheerful and scenic despite being animated, and have been done very well to keep in sync with Chinese backdrop. Even the inclusion of 5 Kung Fu masters each depicting the original 5 shaolin fighting stances is a very apt homage to the core theme of the movie. The action sequences, I've read, were coordinated and animated with high degree or precision and realism and it shows throughout. The motivational theme centered of the Kung Fu masters, which is again a very pleasant tribute to the popular martial art movies, looks very believable especially in the phase where Po (the hearty kung-fu panda) is being motivated and trained despite being doubted by everyone. Dreamworks have managed to pull together a very original movie with the music, colors, and characters and story all working like a well-oiled machine. No wonder this movie has had such widespread reception and acclaim. After the success of ""Shrek"" series, Kung Fu Panda has been even better in terms of thematic animation from Dreamworks studios. The old mater portrayed by a tortoise is probably one of the best character selections. The slow motions of his animations and the fact that he is the most aged reflects on the knowledge that he delivers with his part in the movie. All it takes is believing in oneself and living in the present¬Ö There are no accidents! :)"

I gave in and rented it when it came out in the prepubescent days of Redbox. Well my dad rented it :p. Ever since then I've watched this movie at least once a year or more. Great and unbelievably surprisingly movie. The main character Po is funny, kind, and overall great main character. The story is engaging and actually pretty serious. This is an overall comedy but it does well in mixing in dramatic scenes. For a movie called Kung Fu Panda there are some rather serious character arks. The animation is awesome, the characters are awesome, the whole movie is awesome. If I had one problem is that the villain is a little bland. He does have an insanely bad ass opening scene.

","The latest release from DreamWorks Animation Studios, Kung Fu Panda, is a charming martial arts film that the whole family can enjoy. This film borrows its general premise from a late 70‚Ä≤s kung-fu flick, The Five Deadly Venoms, except here the animals (and their corresponding fighting styles) are not represented by men in masks, the various creatures (panda, monkey, tiger, crane, viper, mantis, etc.) are played by themselves anthropomorphized, of course.<br/><br/>The plot of Kung Fu Panda focuses on Po (Jack Black), an obese panda who dreams of being a kung-fu master and not of schlepping away in his father's lowly noodle shop. As fate would have it, the clumsy Po is surprisingly picked to be the next Dragon Warrior who is destined to save his peaceful village from the ferocious Tai Lung (Ian McShane).<br/><br/>The plot though is really inconsequential here and the film's central theme of ""believe in yourself and you can accomplish anything"" is standard, kiddie movie fare. What really and truly makes Kung Fu Panda stand out above the rest are its glorious, digital animation techniques and its dizzying fight sequences. The most notable being, in my mind, the battle between the Legendary Warriors: Monkey (Jackie Chan), Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), and Viper (Lucy Liu), and the villain, Tai Lung, on a collapsing rope bridge. This sequence is truly breathtaking on the big screen and I don't think DVD will do it justice. Put simply, it is some of the best fight choreography I've seen in quite some time, digital or real world.<br/><br/>My only real gripe with Kung Fu Panda lies in the almost criminal under- usage of some of its stars. While Black, Dustin Hoffman (as Master Shifu), and (especially) McShane shine in their voice acting roles, Jolie, Rogen, Liu, Chan, and Cross are left to die on the vine. Why sign up this big name talent (and pay their big name salaries) if you aren't going to give them anything good to work with? It makes no sense to me but I guess that's why I'm not a big-time, Hollywood dick swinger, right?<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda is fine, family fun that lacks the sly wit and humor of animated classics like, Shrek or Toy Story, but what it lacks in those departments it certainly makes up for in the visual pyrotechnics department. And I think everyone can appreciate some good fireworks on a hot, summer evening, so round up the kidlings and take 'em to see a fat panda and his furry pals kick some serious butt. You won't be disappointed"

When the powerful Tai Lung escapes from prison, everybody must battle to save the valley.<br/><br/>The animation looks great. Importantly, the characters are fun. Jack Black sets the tone, and he's perfect as Po. He's played the bumbling good nature fool before in other movies.

","I received this on DVD for Christmas in 2008 because I wanted to see it at the cinema but didn't get around to seeing it. When I finally watched it on DVD, I felt somewhat disappointed and underwhelmed because it didn't meet all of my expectations. <br/><br/>The weak points of this film include Po's father being a goose (it makes no sense, despite the fact that he's a supportive character), the darker scenes being less detailed than those in daylight, some scenes being forgettable and the ending being somewhat silly and abrupt, in spite of the emotion of Shifu apparently dying but in fact he finds peace. The film is also clich√©d in places such as including a number of uses of slow-motion, one of the Furious Five telling Po he'd be late for work in his dream at the beginning and his father saying the same when Po awakens and Tai Lung falling through the ground leaving a hole in his shape upon Po defeating him. Also the majority of the Furious Five only have names that are the same as their species, although Tigress is the most inventive name of them all.<br/><br/>On a more positive note, this film has a well-known voice cast; epic martial arts action scenes; twists and turns in the dumpling scene between Po and Shifu; an engaging back-story of Tai Lung (he looked very cute there); a breathtaking fight between the Furious Five and Tai Lung on the rope bridge (the bridge itself was reminiscent of Shrek), and some funny moments, especially Po imitating Shifu when he and the Furious Five eat noodles. I also like the 2D animation in Po's dream (despite the clich√© I mentioned earlier) and the end credits as well as the beautiful illustrations for the majority of the end credits (making them unique from having them scroll up a black background) and the post-credits scene where Shifu offers Po a dumpling and Po accepts. The scene where Oogway is lifted up to the sky by blossom petals is beautiful if a tad sentimental. I could relate to Po in a sense because he eats when he's upset (I.e. comfort eating) and I've eaten for comfort in the past.<br/><br/>Overall, this film wasn't as good as the Shrek franchise, but it was worth watching for the artistry, action scenes and voice cast. 7/10."

","Kung Fu Panda was released in 2008, and is a very enjoyable children's film. Even though I had seen this film a few times before I watched it yesterday evening, I still found myself laughing out loud. This is not the genre I particularly enjoy watching, but I was still very entertained.<br/><br/>A stellar cast, which is led by Jack Black, consisting of Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, David Cross, Seth Rogan, James Hong, and Ian McShane all portraying kung fu fighting animals. Jack Black was the perfect casting choice for the obese yet ambitious panda who was our lead, with his fun voice to say the hilarious and often improvised lines for his character. Dustin Hoffman was also enjoyable, with his growly tone giving voice to the grumpy and masterful martial artist of a red panda. Angelina Jolie was the only weak link in this cast, I'm not a huge fan of her acting in the first place, but for a role as important as hers I felt that her character was very inconsistent with the rest. Thankfully the rest of the cast, with the interesting and fun voices of James Hong and Seth Rogan, was able to distract from her character to result in a hilarious arrangement of characters. <br/><br/>Mark Osborne and John Stevenson were the directors of this film, whose work was best seen during the interesting fight scenes. The choreography in these fast, fantastical, and funny fight scenes, was very well thought out and very creative. I was laughing very hard during the martial arts fight scenes with their use of the characters like the quick snake and the fat panda, making it both hilarious and kind of cool. The opening scene I was not too fond of, the way that the directors visualized it was very inconsistent with the rest of the movie, which was likely intentional, but unsuccessfully funny. Also, throughout the whole movie was a very entertaining score co-written by Oscar winner and Oscar Nominee Hans Zimmer and John Powell, respectively, my two personal favorite film composers. Overall, this movie was pieced together very well. <br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda was a surprise to me. I have always found that the quality of animated films to be up to par with any other films, with the exception of How To Train Your Dragon and Pixar Studio's films (specifically Wall-E,) is very rare. In comparison to many live-action films this movie falls very far, but as an animated children's movie with the sole intention of making kids, and some adults, laugh, this movie was very good. Kung Fu Panda was nominated for Best Animated Film at the Academy Awards in 2009, but lost to Disney/Pixar's Wall-E.<br/><br/>I give this movie a pleasantly surprised 7.8/10."

","Of course this film is directed toward a child audience, but there is plenty for adults to appreciate. <br/><br/>First, the excellent design. Every frame - credits too - is simply gorgeous. Then the casting. Jack Black is The big fat panda. James Hong, Randall Duk Kim, and Ian McShane are likewise irreplaceable. Seth Rogan and David Cross could have exchanged roles, as could Lucy Liu and Angelina Jolie, without significant alteration to the story. The rest of the voice actors - yes, even Hoffman (not quite filling the hole in the world left by Mako Iwamatsu's passing) - could have been anyone. (But that's almost the point!) The action, the visual jokes, the pace - all perfect.<br/><br/>But what really gets me is the sustained ironic take on the mono-myth formula. Again and again the implied allusions to the ""foundling prince whose coming was foretold"" are set up only to be shrugged off without explicit acknowledgment. The writers of this film get it: we all know that story - it's in our bones - so there's no need to waste a moment of dialog on it. What keeps it light and alive is the repeated thwarting of our anticipation that the clich√©s will take over. It never happens; the clich√©s remain pawns, the butts of jokes. <br/><br/>Finally, what makes this film great. This story doesn't merely put a new twist on a timeless tale, it turns the hero myth on its head: the chosen one can be Anyone, even an antihero can become a hero: ""There is no secret ingredient."" What an affirmation for the doubt-fettered children of our over-informed cynical age. <br/><br/>PS If you love this film for the same reasons, don't bother with the sequel."

","OK maybe I wasn't quite literrally blinded, but it was really good! The incredible animation visuals make this film great fun to watch, it has brilliant vibrant colours and some well constructed comedy moments. I was incredibly impressed with the voice acting in this film and the way the characters look like their voices. Jack Black and Jackie Chan looked like they had taken the form of a panda and a monkey and computerised themselves into the movie.<br/><br/>This movie, be warned, doesn't take itself too seriously, as you may have guessed from the title of the movie, Kung Fu Panda. The outcome of the movie makes it appealing for children and adults alike and is the kind of movie that pulls you in and tortures you to keep watching (torture to be used as good not bad). And for what this movie is I am happy to give it 10/10. However there are better animated movies out there with better story lines so that has sadly made me knock off 2 from 10. <br/><br/>However, I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it, a must watch!!!<br/><br/>P.S. WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

","Kung Fu Panda is formulaic and harmless fun. It doesn't lean too heavily on the morals, thankfully eschews the usual pop culture references and disposable pop songs that hopelessly date the movie only years afterward, and definitely doesn't take itself too seriously.<br/><br/>But despite the fact that it is hardly vital cinema it is an OK film that manages to survive some deplorable Hollywood laziness and provide a non-Saw alternative to the 10-14s in the household. I would pigeonhole it as 'reasonably family friendly light entertainment' and nothing more.<br/><br/>Well this reasonably family friendly light entertainment made over 600 million dollars! To paraphrase one Will Hunting ""How do you like them Pandas?"" The tale of this well meaning yet clumsy and decidedly non kung-fu expert's rise to the top is the stuff of every second kung fu film in the 70s to be honest. Take someone with no apparent traits of a champion, give them a trainer who seems to not believe in him/her, throw in some training montages that find our hero believing in themselves and cut to them holding the trophy/prize/severed head of their nemesis.<br/><br/>In this case the unwitting hero is pudgy Panda ‚Äì voiced by pudgy Jack Black ‚Äì in fact if you aren't a Jack Black fan or simply can't stomach his shtick move on, because his dialogue is infused with so many JB mannerisms and speech patterns that your feelings toward the man may dictate your enjoyment level.<br/><br/>I like him. In small doses.<br/><br/>Panda is ordained as the Dragon Warrior in front of the resentful Furious 5 who have trained their entire lives for the very honour Panda accidentally falls into. The Furious 5 are a group of highly trained martial arts experts of various breeds; a tiger, a monkey, a crane, a praying mantis and a snake (the names of various fighting styles).<br/><br/>They are voiced by an all star cast of unnecessary celebrity cameo cash-ins that smacks of free publicity, and I say that knowing full well Jackie Chan is among them. That said I will not bother acknowledging their lack of input to the film any further.<br/><br/>The 5 are trained by Master Shi Fu (Dustin Hoffman), who I think is a possum or something?? Nonetheless he is a master teacher, and upon finding he must train Panda to become the Dragon Warrior and defend the entire village of random rabbits, ducks and pigs he is immediately aghast and feels dishonoured, though he is gradually talked around by his own master, an elderly turtle named Master Ugwei. The 5 are also resentful of this unskilled interloper and generally make no secret of this fact, especially the tigress who felt that it was she who would be named Dragon Warrior.<br/><br/>The training sequences are a little flat to be honest, but contain enough moments of humour and pratfalls to keep the kids interested. I liked Panda's Dad ‚Äì who is a duck ‚Äì and his constant references to the 'noodle dream' amused me for no known reason. Most of all I liked a sequence in the middle of the film where the main nemesis for Panda is introduced, a fearsome creature named Tai-Lung. His escape from a mountain fortress is both incredibly animated and well choreographed. This is also perhaps the main impediment to the littlies liking the film, as Tai-Lung is so well rendered and so effective a foe, that I think it might put the fear of god into any kids under say 8 or 9, which is a bit of a shame, as three quarters of the film is perfect for all ages.<br/><br/>Ultimately Kung Fu Panda wasn't nearly as 'awesome' as it was promoted, but it definitely wasn't bad either.<br/><br/>Final Rating ‚Äì 6 / 10. A solid animated film for kids aged (maybe) 9 and up, with enough jokes for the adults and kids alike, and some non-threatening action to inspire the kids to go home and kick p*ss out of their younger siblings."
"toll-8","6","0","0","8 December 2011"," Not that awesome
","DreamWorks brings out yet another animated production but does it fill the shoes of the other films that they have recently made? Although this film is good the answer is sadly no. For starters an issue with this film is Jack Black. Granted he isn't that bad in this and it is his voice that is doing the work and not his acting, but his voice is so distinct that I couldn't help but imagine that it was actually him on the screen, especially when the part he is playing is an overweight, cartoon panda. Far to life like for me. Other voice members of this team remain hidden, Hoffman is brilliant as Master Shifu and his voice becomes lost in the character, also Ian McShane as Tai Lung the deadly snow leopard is deep and menacing. The same can't be said for all the other voice cast which includes such stars as Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen, Jackie Chan, Lucy Lui and David Cross. All seem to get about ten lines each. Perhaps this isn't a problem with the voices but the character as they are so hard to connect with. Five animals, a tigress, crane, monkey, mantis and viper, all kicking ass but saying nothing, yep I can see why we can't connect with them. My favourite character I have to say was the Grand Master Oogway, an old tortoise that seemed to get everything right by accident and then state that nothing is an accident.<br/><br/>The film is about the Panda, Po. He dreams of being a kung fu warrior and not running his Dad's noodle bar, his Dad who is somehow a stork?? On the day that Oogway has a premonition that the feared Tai Lung will escape from jail, Shifu states that they must chose a Dragon Warrior to fend him off. The nominated Furious Five stake their claim but it is the panda that is selected when he accidentally flies into the arena, trying to catch a glimpse of what is going on. <br/><br/>Reluctantly Shifu begins to train him and we see that this panda is completely incompetent and the only thing he can do is eat. This however, as noticed by Shifu, is his strength. Relate aspects of kung fu to food and the panda will become awesome. <br/><br/>Tai Lung breaks out of jail, which is a very good sequence of CGI animation, and hurtles across the land to gather a Dragon Scroll out the hands of the Masters. The Dragon Scroll is what the Dragon Warrior possesses and it is an accomplishment that Tai Lung continually misses out on. Tai Lung's tale is told through a back story and his connection brings emotion to the film. Tai Lung eventually arrives at the palace and after defeating the Furious Five and Shifu it is down to the Panda to save the day.<br/><br/>As you can tell from the synopsis there are no real twists or turns and the film holds true to a very simple formula. This becomes a slight issue for me as it means children can connect with it more than adults, which certainly wasn't the case with Toy Story, Shrek, Monsters Inc or Finding Nemo and this is where this film lacks compared to those. There is nothing for an adult audience to really grip and enjoy. There is very little emotion in the film and the main humour is childish or slapstick. <br/><br/>The animation is still good. The Panda and Master Shifu having good genuine expressions but the Furious Five are undeveloped in character and animation. They could have all just been made into one character that has been worked on. Their story is just poor and very uninteresting.<br/><br/>That all being said it is a very easy watch film and I would happily sit down, chilling on a Sunday afternoon and watch it again. However using the term Jack Black must have written into the script as it is all he ever says in other films and over uses in this one, this film is certainly not awesome."

","Kung Fu Panda is better than most Dreamworks animated films, using a screenplay with quite a few clever moments to tell the simple story of a panda who becomes an unlikely kung-fu hero. <br/><br/>Po serves as a fairly standard main character, longing to escape his dull life at a noodle restaurant and train as a martial artist. Unfortunately, he's a panda, rotund and uncoordinated, so he's stuck where he is. This changes when a prophecy reveals him as a Dragon Warrior, and he's taken to train with the kung-fu masters he's idolized: the Furious Five. <br/><br/>The movie is light on character and plot, we've seen these movies many times before: the underdog who perseveres to victory, and we have the montage sequence and menacing villains, colorful supporting characters. Jack Black gives a good performance as the voice of Po, same for Dustin Hoffman as a diminutive kung-fu sage. The Furious Five voice talent boasts some impressive names behind it, a shame since they're mostly relegated to shouts and grunts. <br/><br/>Character design was interesting, I was especially taken with the turtle and the glowing eyes of the tigers, and the background paintings were exquisite. Perhaps it's sad, then, that the actual martial arts sequences were often disappointing, they move so fast and feature so much camera-work that they become hard to follow. <br/><br/>All in all, Kung Fu Panda takes a familiar story and does it well, not much substance, but mostly fun, with a good dash of wit, charm, and nice presentation. They really went all-out on the color in this movie, itself a visual feast. The opening scene and end credits feature a hand-drawn style, and is certainly worth a few more points towards Dreamworks. <br/><br/>Those seeking light entertainment should check it out, and I think kids may enjoy it, though some of the battle scenes might be a bit scary for them. I report that it left a smile on my face; not beaming, like How to Train Your Dragon, but smiling nonetheless."

","I enjoy reading children's stories because no matter what the country of origin, they all universally speak for the weaknesses and tendencies of man. Kung Fu Panda, despite not being derived from a classic children's story, has all the elements that teach and prepare children for what to expect from the cynical, imperfect world of adults.<br/><br/>Po is a panda serving as apprentice in his father's noodle shop. Despite being obese and awkward, his dream is to become a Kung Fu great one day. The day of reckoning comes when Master Oogway, a wise tortoise and Kung Fu master, recognizes Po as the ""chosen"" one to battle evil. Po is dispatched immediately to the ""Shaolin"" like training monastery.<br/><br/>Po isn't well received by his trainer Shifu and by his highly skilled classmates: the tiger, the preying mantis, the monkey, the snake, and the crane. All are jealous, disappointed and insulted that an unproven novice would overshadow their renowned reputation. Many times our cynical needs to rise in importance will cause us to destroy those destined to save us. In the end, all five and Shifu get their crack at battling evil, the snow leopard Tai Lung. They all fail. Po, the dark horse, finally comes through to save the day. All are now happy in the Valley of Peace. All is forgiven.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda is a cartoon metaphor to describe the traditional brick and mortar workplaces in America. ""New blood"" is often at odds with the senior workforces who see new approaches and ideas as a beachhead for an eventual overhaul of the status quo."

The storyline is strong, and within it, a good message that you can do anything if you can put your mind (and body) to it when you can! <br/><br/>As another reviewer pointed it, it was refreshing to see an animated movie that is pop culture free. It was also a treat to see some more lesser known animal species depicted in Kung Fu Panda, which rarely are seen in animated movies, such as Red Pandas and Snow Leopards. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this to someone!

","Great movie. Pole's character is so typically Chinese in nature, and the imagery really does credit to the artistic direction. The opening sequence is visually stunning, avoiding clich√©s, by re-inventing classic themes.<br/><br/>One of the original Chinese national leaders was a man very like Pole. During the post ice-age period, China was inundated with floods that crept across the land for years. The people selected a humble man who had the character to persist and beat the problem. This man worked for forty years to drain the flood waters, ruining his legs through climbing to mountain-tops for better views of the problem. He was a humble servant, incredibly like the hero of Kung Fu Panda, and had a job very similar to Pole's in the beginning.<br/><br/>The movie may not appeal to new-age film-goers, as it is a traditional story of good versus evil, where the bad guys are really bad."

","Prior to its release date this delightfully pleasurable action comedy-adventure from DreamWorks Animation seemed as though it would join the likes of 'Surf's Up' (2007) and 'Chicken Little' (2005) as one of the most average pieces of animated rubbish ever to be shown on the silver screen. And it is for the first ten minutes in which we are first introduced to our hero ¬ñ the Po (voiced by a hilarious, show-stealing Jack Black.) Po is an under-achieving fat, ravenous, panda born the son of a slightly mad noodle seller (voiced by James Hong) who dreams of being a famous kung fu master. His heroes have always been the amazing furious five ¬ñ Tigress (voiced by Angelina Jolie,) Monkey (voiced by Jackie Chan,) Mantis (voiced by Seth Rogen,) Viper (voiced by Lucy Liu) and Crane (voiced by David Cross) trained by the greatest kung fu teacher in all China, Master Shifu (voiced by the magical Dustin Hoffman.) When it is prophesied by the powerful all-knowing Master Oogway (voiced by Randall Duk Kim) that the dark and menacing Tai Lun (voiced by Ian McShane) ¬ñ a former pupil of Shifu's turned evil when he was denied ownership of the powerful dragon scroll ¬ñwill escape from heavy imprisonment and make the entire Valley of Piece fell his deadly wrath, the great turtle announces that the Dragon Warrior must be proclaimed as he is China's only hope. That noble position is of course seeming accidentally given to none other than Po, who must somehow be trained to fight and defeat the monstrous villain.<br/><br/>There the film throws off its predictability and becomes a fun-filled action-packed thrill-ride, leaving us all in a daze at how unbelievably wrong we all were to think that it was just another washout. For DreamWorks, this is a fine achievement and an excellent recovery from 'Shrek the Third' (2007.) What's more, this film ¬ñ unlike most comedies ¬ñ doesn't rely on the jokes to give it life. The gags of Kung Fu Panda work as more of a little extra spice to top it all off. What really makes it enjoyable is the engaging story."

","The evolution of the martial arts genre has been of particular interest to me lately, as I recently bought a Bruce Lee collection and have been watching a few of his old classics and comparing them to the newer species of movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Shaolin Soccer. I wasn't all that excited about the switch to zero gravity that we saw in Crouching Tiger, but the impact and the sheer style of Shaolin Soccer was completely unexpected and pretty damned amazing. Also, the Shaolin Temple, where Chinese kung-fu originated, is about a 45-minute drive from where I live in central China. I've been there a couple times and the kung-fu shows that they put on are pretty spectacular.<br/><br/>With that in mind, I was curious to see how kung-fu would be portrayed in a kid's movie, although I should say that I expected something truly goofy with a title like Kung Fu Panda, but I was surprised and relieved that the movie avoided being a childish kickboxing cartoon. True, it's about a Panda that is so fat that he has trouble getting out of bed in the morning, but in the film as a whole, the childish moments, the sort of over-the-top laughs and cartoonish fat jokes were mainly designed to get laughs and, more importantly, create a charming and likable main character.<br/><br/>And it would be foolish to say that the movie doesn't have it's laughs. Jack Black provides the voice of Po, a young Panda entering the last stages of his childhood, where he is beginning to wonder if taking over the tiny noodle shop run by his father Mr. Ping, a stork, is really that future intended for him. They live in the Chinese Valley of Peace under the stately shadow of a temple that towers overhead.<br/><br/>The temple is of vast importance, too, not only historically but as the location where the ceremony to choose the Dragon Warrior will be held. Po has fantasies about becoming the Dragon Warrior, fantasies that seem at once ridiculous and inevitable, given the fact that Kung Fu Panda, for all its strengths, is essentially an underdog story. Unfortunately, Po's job is to keep his head out of the clouds and drag a noodle cart up the endless steps to the mountaintop temple and sell them to the people going to watch the ceremony. He is understandably disheartened and disillusioned.<br/><br/>Po's central challenge is not just to find a way to enter the ceremony and win the Dragon Warrior title, but first to find a way to tell his father that he is not interested in carrying on the family business, that he has bigger dreams. This is the serious issue that the movie approaches, and it handles it much more seriously and effectively than I would have anticipated. The ceremony itself, on the other hand, is where the movie has fun with itself.<br/><br/>You see, there's a battle between five contenders, the winner of whom will be crowned the Dragon Warrior and will then go on to kung-fu fight the much-feared Tai Lung, who has escaped from prison and is on a mad quest to secure dominance over the valley. ""Tai lung,"" by the way, in Mandarin is written like this - Â§™ÂÜ∑, and it means ""too cold.""<br/><br/>Now, the head monk at the temple, a giant turtle named Oogway, is in charge of selecting one of five candidates who is the most qualified to take on Tai Lung and stop him. I missed the part where they explained why they don't just send all of them, but no matter. The whole thing is for fun, you remember. The five candidates are a spider-thin praying mantis about as threatening as a spider-tin praying mantis, a monkey voiced by Jackie Chan, a Tigress (Angelina Jolie), a Viper (Lucy Liu), and Crane (David Cross), although after a series of fortunate events Oogway ends up choosing Po.<br/><br/>The kung fu takes place without the constraints of live action, so it's obviously quite different from the traditional kung fu film, even the modern ones that make wide use of special effects, but there is plenty of fighting action and it's pretty impressive. The only drawback is something common to almost all animated movies and cartoons - the characters seem generally impervious to damage, even after suffering falls and hits that should kill them. The little birdies fly around their heads for a minute and the show goes on. Sure, it's for the kids, but it definitely makes the kung-fu a lot less effective.<br/><br/>Much of the comedy, however, is derived not from the slapstick fighting but from the that Po is a die-hard kung-fu fan and is suddenly thrown into close proximity with the Furious Five, who are nothing less than idols to him. Jack Black is provided with endless comedic opportunities in voicing a character who is resolutely chasing his dream of becoming the Dragon Warrior, while at the same-time becoming hopelessly tongue-tied and star-struck just by being in the presence of his competitors.<br/><br/>The animation isn't anything new, and we've either hit a wall as far as the possibilities of creating realism or there just wasn't any need for this movie to push the computer animation technology any further. I suspect the latter. As we may remember from the disappointing 2000 film Dinosaur, there are times when too much realism can make an animated movie a lot less fun than it should be.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda deserves the Oscar nomination that it has gotten for Best Animated Feature Film, but it won't win and it shouldn't. It's a charming and fun romp that is short enough that adults will be able to sit through it, but it doesn't carry the depth of meaning that movies like Toy Story or Shrek or this year's WALL-E do. The kids, however, are going to flip for it."

This is a very fun-loving, action-packed yet very funny and lovable movie.<br/><br/>Po, as the overgrown lump for a panda, is very likable because of the voice casting of Jack Blak, who doesn't overdo it and make him sound ridiculous. But the character whom I liked the most was the old trainer of his who has the right voice as the kung fu master. The tortoise too is very witty and its funny to see such a slow creature being the greatest fighter.<br/><br/>The dialogs are meant for children as well as the adults who would enjoy the touch of adult humor that has been added here and there. Some of the situations are very funny, for example the thought of having a bird as the Panda's father, Po's efforts to watch the fair etc.<br/><br/>But the thin storyline affects the movie.

","Kung Fu Panda is probably the only Dreamworks movie I have ever seen that I enjoyed more than Pixar. Its even at the same level of animation- if not higher.<br/><br/>There were hardly any flaws in this movie. The animation was beautiful and colorful, every voice was excellent for there rolls, the display of Chinese festivals and history was great, and the music was definitely at par with this year's WALL-E.<br/><br/>Jack Black is the perfect panda. He's silly, he's lovable- they couldn't have picked anyone better for the roll. Dustin Hoffman is a GREAT Shifu. All of the furious five (Crane, Viper, Tigress, Mantis, and Monkey) have excellent voicers. My favorite character is going to have to remain at long legged, graceful Crane for now, but the hilariously voiced Mr. Ping is a DEFINETE close second.<br/><br/>The only flaw I could cockily pick out (after seeing the movie at least five times) is the plot, which could be improved. The movie is about chubby Po, who's love for Kung Fu is completely disguised while working at his father's Noodle Shop. But then, after pure accident, Po is picked to fight against Tai Lung, the kung fu master that has such a temper he can ruin the valley of peace with a twitch of his pinkie finger. Tai Lung has escaped from jail- and he's COMING. It's up to Po to stop him... Most of the movie was spent showing Po's hilarious training.<br/><br/>But what the movie lacked in plot (Don't get me wrong, the plot was EXCELLENT, but its a review so I better get all the cards out on the table) was made up in its characters, great jokes, animation, and pure entertainment.<br/><br/>Also, if you've got VERY VERY small kids, you might want to wait until their a little older, depending on how sensitive they are. The awesome, action packed fighting scenes in this movie might be considered frightening for younger viewers.<br/><br/>A little side note: Secrets of the Furious Five is awesome, too.

","Animated films rely heavily on the appeal of the actors voicing the various characters. Get a group of them who could care less about the material and you'll get a quick-to-DVD release (see SHARK TALE). But get a bunch that really gets into it, and you can capture lightning in a bottle. It's happened before. I consider FINDING NEMO and HOODWINKED! to be the prime examples of this type of success. And KUNG FU PANDA now resides in close company with them.<br/><br/>Whomever cast Kung Fu Panda deserves some serious recognition. All of the voice characters, without exception, were perfect for their animal type. From Dustin Hoffman's wise Shifu and Angelina Jolies rough Tigress to Jackie Chan (as Monkey), Seth Rogan (as Mantis), Lucy Liu (as Viper) and the unforgettable Jack Black as Po the Kung Fu Panda, every one of them were awesome shining lights of pure ...um ...awesomeness.<br/><br/>The story is standard fodder: a nobody Panda (Jack Black) seems destined to follow in his father's footsteps as a shlepper of noodle dishes. But Po (the Panda) has always been infatuated with the Kung Fu masters. And when a call comes down from on-high that a new master is being chosen, Po rushes to the tower to find out who it might be (will it be Tigress? Or Viper? Or one of the others?). Surprisingly it turns out to be the rotund and out-of-shape Po.<br/><br/>Training begins and Po is neither liked nor respected by any of the Kung Fu fighters (yes, the song is in there, too, of course). But once Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) learns how to motivate Po, the training begins in earnest.<br/><br/>Problems arise, however, when word spreads that an enemy of the Kung Fu lands has escaped his prison and whomever the new Kung Fu Master might be will have to deal with him.<br/><br/>The antics and battles are funny and epic. Using his blubbery size, Po often bounces his way to success, or eats his way into the audience's heart (particularly funny is when he finds a stash of cookies in a high cabinet and does a perfect split in order to reach them and gobble 'em down).<br/><br/>It is a telling story that shows us you don't have to be some foxy 007 type in order to succeed.

","The biggest thing I took away from this movie is how much further digital animation has comes in just a few years since ""Toy Story"" and ""A Bug's Life."" Not that those are any worse for the wear, but what we see in ""Kung Fu Panda"" is a big step beyond the animated movies of just a few years ago. It is a marvel to view in high definition and with surround sound.<br/><br/>Jack Black stars as the Panda Po who admires kung fu and even has dreams where he is a master. But when he awakes he still works in his dad's noodle shop. (His dad is a goose, it is never explained how that happened). One day when a big ceremony is taking place to name the next Dragon Warrior, which is at the top of the kung fu domain, Po quite accidentally ends up falling from the sky and into the ceremony.<br/><br/>My favorite voice actor in this movie is Dustin Hoffman as the kung fu master, Shifu. He is identifying the new Dragon Warrior, and as Po falls from the sky Shifu picks him. Po is more shocked than anyone else.<br/><br/>So the movie is about Po making efforts to actually learn kung fu and against all odds actually become the master of masters, the Dragon Warrior.<br/><br/>Other key kung fu characters are Angelina Jolie as Tigress, Ian McShane, exceptional as the evil Tai Lung, Jackie Chan, funny as Monkey, Seth Rogen as Mantis, Lucy Liu as Viper, and David Cross as Crane.<br/><br/>Michael Clarke Duncan's deep voice is perfect as Commander Vachir of the high security prison where Tai Lung is being held.<br/><br/>Naturally the evil kug fu master gets away, and travels to claim the Dragon Warrior position for himself, and Po has to be the one who defeats him. But can he??<br/><br/>Good movie, lots of exciting animated action."

","Decent animated entertainment from Dreamworks, the poor man's Pixar. Except for Shrek, which I despised, Dreamworks' animated films have been rather enjoyable, if unremarkable, and Kung Fu Panda continues this trend. Jack Black voices Po, a fat, clumsy panda who dreams of kung fu while working in a noodle shop. One day, he is chosen by a kung fu master to be the next dragon warrior, the one who will defeat √ºber-villain Tai Lung (Ian McShane). Will he embarrass himself, or will at some point realize that, if he believes in himself, he can accomplish anything? Only the stupidest children can't figure that one out. Other voices are provided by Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen, David Cross, and Michael Clark Duncan. Jesus. Just think about how much money Dreamworks wasted on all these people. Jackie Chan, for instance, has possibly one line in the entire movie, and probably made a million dollars for it. The movie itself is enjoyable, especially during the action sequences, which go by a little too fast but are well choreographed. The storyboarders had their work cut out for them. The artwork is probably the best looking Dreamworks has yet conceived, but compare it to the visionary WALL-E and it's clear that this studio is just for kids."

Otherwise, this movie was certainly worth passing, unless you have children that are entertained by just about anything animated.

","It never fails to amaze me how lame American animated movies tend to be. Maybe it's because I've been an anime otaku for so long (since washed-out bootlegs in the original Japanese- sans subtitles- were first offered up at comic book conventions for ridiculously high prices), or maybe because I grew up on the likes of ASTRO BOY and JONNY QUEST (which were both aimed at kids whose sensibilities weren't of the Special Needs variety), but the current crop of Big Budget cgi cartoons (including those that blend the cgi with live-action characters, like TRANSFORMERS and the two FANTASTIC FOUR fiascos) leave me numb. Perhaps because I've also been a martial arts movie fan for most of my life, I was looking forward to KUNG FU PANDA. My own KUNG FU CATS (which also featured a hero named Po) was available for quite some time online (at fanboycomics.biz)- until the site went down- but it certainly wasn't written down to the video game level of KUNG FU PANDA. Anyone fed up with this kind of slap-in-the-face stupidity should check out some of the aforementioned anime (Japanese animation)."

","On the plus side, I admired the realistic computer-generated fur effects. This animating technology really is coming of age. On the minus side, I'm still wondering about the merits of a movie in which the over-weight 'hero' is motivated by offering him food. First, I have a concern about, well, not only Hollywood's but society in general's tendency to make fun of fat people. I guess the filmmakers could argue that the panda is just over-weight to him an unlikely hero.. and then of course if he were to become slimmer to be accepted that's not cool either. But couldn't the panda just be fat and that's that? Couldn't he have been motivated by something other than more food? The bottom line is, the story is kinda OK but nothing special. My kids liked it but I was left wanting more."
"Quinoa1984","7","3","8","9 June 2008"," a balance between the predictability of the plot and the loving homage/spoof of the subject matter
","Kung Fu Panda was the first Dreamworks animated movie I even considered going to see, nevermind liking, in quite a while. Perhaps it's because I didn't see it on a professional critic basis, and none of the past Dreamworks animation didn't have any appeal aside from a basic, kiddie movie basis (the last one was Sharktale, which left a bad taste in my mouth for a while). But after hearing some high praise, and recognizing some voice talent that seemed a little unusual (i.e. Dustin Hoffman, Seth Rogen), I took a chance. Thankfully, it paid off more than I would've imagined. It's an entertaining ride, and somehow uproariously funny in some pockets. And just when I thought I'd had enough of those ""Don't Talk"" ads before the movies at AMC with Po the Panda! <br/><br/>It is, in fact, still predictable in that quasi-Shrek kind of way: a big, lovable lug somehow gets chosen for a task of great importance, and along the way becomes everything that he never though he could be, gains respect, and retains individuality all the way through, particularly at the end. What's interesting this time around is how the filmmakers marry this repeated theme for animated kids fare with the basic plots of cool, old-school kung-fu movies, like the fare from the Shaw Brothers from the 60s and 70s. Or, for a more contemporary example, it comes closest to the Kill Bill movies (i.e. the Pai Mei chapter) in attempting homage for a 21th century crowd. What's been done over and over in those films somehow comes fresh with what's expected for a kid's movie, and it all works thanks to the sharp script.<br/><br/>Voice actors, as well, contribute pretty well to the proceedings. Jack Black, who can be hit or miss depending on the viewer (or just the mood of the moment), is fit like a glove for this character, who's a dreamer and weak-willed but wants to not stay a noodle-boy his whole life after being chosen for the Dragon Scroll. Hoffman is terrific as the 'Master' of the members of the group of the ""Five"", who are a Mantis, a Tiger, a Monkey, a Crane (you know, the ""moves""), and all the voice actors in these parts are also pitch perfect- Jolie, Seth Rogen, David Cross (a big surprise), Lucy Liu- because, for many moments, they disappear into their parts (an essential if hidden asset to good voice acting). Points should also go to Ian McShane who plays the bad-ass-turned-villain of the film.<br/><br/>Featuring training montages that veer on spoof (plus a dumpling scene that might be the funniest in the movie), fast and lively and energetic animation, and some intense fight scenes, it's a real treat for its target audience of children, but adults and martial-arts genre fans should not fear. They might have as good a time as the first Shrek, if that's indeed possible after so many years of Pixar's golden standard."

","As a teenager, I had a choice to choose which movie to watch with my girlfriend the next morning. So I diligently went online to see the IMDb rankings for the two movies. Firstly Don't Mess With The Zohan and secondly Kung Fu Panda. Based on the ratings and reviews I chose to see kung Fun Panda, it seemed the better choice.... It seemed the keyword.<br/><br/>So when I eventually went to see it, you could say I was a little let down. Actually you could say an enormous amount. To make matters worse, I was surrounded by children, normally tolerant of them, today I was not. They laughed at inappropriate jokes, scenes which were clearly not even funny. I contemplated ""when will this end?"" ""It must be shortly"" This movie is clearly not as comical as Shrek or Ice Age, it did not have witty, enchanting characters. Since when does a goose or duck give birth to a panda? There should be more factual, intellectual movies for children to see in the holidays! The only good thing was the imagery and advancement in realistic cartoons. I was more than relieved when it ended, I WANT MY $10.80 BACK!"
"timopekkafr","5","3","9","10 July 2008"," It's a fun watch for one occasion
","I see, that most of the people who have seen this film rate is sky-high, I just can't understand why. Sure, it's not a bad movie, but far from great. In a time when not many truly re-watchable cartoons come out - max. one every year - it's not hard to be number one. Others have written down the story, so I won't do so, I someone would not know, one can read it from there. First of all I don't get it why is it a must to use big-time Hollywood actors as voices for characters? Voice acting is acting too, I know, but surely others could of been used as well. I just don't believe in a movie promotion campaign where the strategy is based on the voice-actors, not on the movie itself. Onwards, why do the animated figures have to look like the people giving voices to them? Couldn't the snake be less-lu-like and the opossum less-Hoffman-like? This going to all the characters. Further more, I don't get why were there five big kung fu masters (appart from the trivial reason, that there - as it seems - are five styles named after them)? There just is no reason for it in the movie, no characters are drawn, all are totally dissed. It would of been enough to make two others and the movie would of worked just fine. In this case the two others would of gotten more character and charisma; a bit of more personality. Currently the ape, the insect and the legless-lizard are totally unnecessary.<br/><br/>Even I don't like the way the panda wins in the end, I see it's the only child-friendly-Hollywood-way, so be it. The movie is watchable once, with a few funny moments, a decent story and a touch of drama; even some sort of a moral message for the youth. For this the movie gets points. However - in my opinion - some more character work the picture would score higher. The only figures I am satisfied are the turtle and the opossum (the semi-master). Even the panda would need more. The animation and the drawing is a work of the pros... but hey, we are talking about a major Hollywood studio, so it's what they do, and they are quite good at it."
"sinncross","6","3","9","17 June 2008"," A strange, yet cute and fun approach to martial arts...
","Po (Jack Black), a clumsy Panda, works at a noodle restaurant, but as an avid kung fu fan he dreams of being able to meet The Furious Five, a group of kung fu experts noted for their great ability and heroic deeds. One day, it is decided that one of The Furious Five will be granted the status of the Dragon Warrior, and a determined Po attempts to watch the tournament taking place. After various attempts to enter the Dojo, he finally gets in, only to be told that he is the future Dragon Warrior.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda is quite a unique story: it is a clear parody of kung fu films but it does enough to prove that it pays homage to them as well. For instance, Po is told he will become the greatest warrior in the whole of China, but he is both overweight and clumsy, and has no martial arts training whatsoever: parody. However, the old and wise kung fu master, Oogway (Randall Duk Kim), has some very wise words, infused in traditional Chinese philosophy: homage. This becomes the most striking aspect of the film, and one which will no doubt be more attune t adults then children. Though it must be said that the film is more for kids then adults, unlike previous DreamWorks Animation productions such as Shrek, Madagascar and Flushed Away. This is mainly due to the simplicity of the film as a whole. The film is ridden with clich√©s, sometimes to aid the comedy, and the comedy itself can be far too silly at times. The film is also too short, and characterization pays for this. Beyond Po and Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), no other characters really gets any depth added to them. There is a little for Tigress (Angelina Jolie), but that is about it, and it's disappointing because it is possible that each character has a rich background. The length also lessens the overall impact of the film, with Po seemingly able to learn Kung Fu is a very short space of time. In fact, there were times where I felt totally disengaged with the film, wondering when it was going to show something that truly excited me.<br/><br/>But the action looks great, mostly due to the superb animation. Characters look like great representations of cartoons, and their body movements are fluid. There is also a great deal of detail, with much work being put into the fur of characters, and facial workings. Special effects do not appear to have gotten as much work on, but they are not bad at all, and work well with the other animation. DreamWorks Animation mus be commended for making a truly believable world and its clear to see references to other great martial arts films like House of Flying Daggers. If anything, its a shame that some good action sequences become used more to emphasis comedy then action, and makes the fighting less engaging then you would hope.<br/><br/>Music is very consistent, bringing traditional Chinese melodies expected of kung fu movies to the helm. At all times, it works, unlike the voice acting. Now all the voice actors do an impeccable job illustrating their respective characters, be it Angelina Jolie as the fiery Tigress, Ian MacShane as the evil Tai Lang, and even Randall Duk Kim as the serene and wise Oogway. And while Jack Black does a good enough job as Po, he comes across as too Jack Black, and Po as a character feels lifeless. In fact, the problem with Black is that unlike the other actors, he brings no charisma to his role. By no means is he a bad actor, his last role in Be Kind Rewind was great, but this time around, he doesn't quite gel with his character.<br/><br/>With unnoticeable tame language, and no sex or nudity, the film does have its fair share of violence. However it is far from being actually violent and is also used quite often for comical purposes.<br/><br/>As far as computer animations go, Kung Fu Panda is good, but not good enough to truly compete with the forerunners of the medium. For every aspect which makes Kung Fu Panda worth watching, humour and animation quality, there are aspects which make not worth the watch, simplistic story and lack of character development. It does what it sets out to do and that is entertain, but it falls short of what it should have tried to accomplish."

","Looking for an animated film that the whole family can watch and enjoy? Then the summer has a good selection in Kung Fu Panda, a magical tale of talking animals, martial arts, eastern philosophy, and good versus evil. It is also voiced by several well known stars not the least of which is the force of nature that is Jack Black.<br/><br/>Panda bear Po (Jack Black) works for his father's noodle business in ancient China but yearns for something more. His interest in martial arts leads him to being an accidental selection as the 'chosen one' to defend the local town from a vengeful leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane), a former student of the wise, martial arts teacher, Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). As the 'chosen one', Po is given the sacred Dragon Scrolls and is trained by Shifu in the ways and technique of Kung Fu much to the consternation of the Furious Five, the current crop of warriors. Po presents the ultimate challenge both physically and mentally to Shifu until the master hits on an unorthodox idea. As Tai Lung approaches and the Furious Five attempt to defend the town, Po must learn the ways of the true warrior. As he begins to mature and learn about himself, he becomes the last line of defense.<br/><br/>This story nicely blends serious themes with moments of comedic fun. What is refreshing in the humor is that it is organic and timeless without resorting to pop references (as in Shrek)-no small feat. It also depicts the ancient Chinese warriors with not only martial arts prowess, but abilities to defy gravity as in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Children will find a wondrous, far away land populated by real people in the guise of animal characters. It is a believable world with real feelings of yearning, tradition, envy, and bravery.<br/><br/>A somewhat more subdued Jack Black does a fine job emoting and realizing the young Po. Dustin Hoffman is quite good as the wise sage, a sort of Asian Yoda (or the other way around). It's rather hard to believe the star power behind the other voices including Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, and Seth Rogen. The movie could have worked just as well without them.<br/><br/>The movie actually gets better in the middle and toward the end, not that long a wait. Its basic themes of destiny and loyalty are universal. As Master Shifu says, ""there are no accidents."" The animation and creative use of camera angles and zooms are breath taking at times. You kind of wish the script had just a bit more substance and this would have become a treasured classic. As it is, Kung Fu Panda is a delightful, inoffensive adventure with something for all ages."

The goofy, ugly duckling character bumping into a table and then starting a chain reaction of things falling apart around him and then he falls on his ass and something lands on his head has been used ad nauseum in most films like this. The plot, the script, and the characters are so thin that there is zero emotional impact when the villain and Kung Fu Panda meet in the finale. There is no sense of danger whatsoever in regard to the villain. WARNING HERE BE SPOILERS All of the characters are freaking out all through the movie that the villain (a completely wasted effort from the fantastic Ian McShane) is going to kill everybody. He kills no one and Kung Fu Panda dispatches him easily in the end. Which, considering that KFP has zero Karate skill until a montage gives it to him is laughable. Every Disney clich√© you can think of is on display here-from the Ugly Duckling to the goofy supporting characters to the ""Just believe in yourself"" pep talks from the wiser older characters. Basically the film feels like all the money went into the animation and not the script and plot. This is a shame because there is no solid foundation for the films' breath-taking visuals to rest on. There is just no meat to this movie. Take away the visual side and you have a completely un-imaginative film that teaches the viewer nothing and elicits zero emotional response."

Black seems less irritating in GCI but the films wastes the rest of its unused cast.<br/><br/>A clumsy panda bear becomes an unlikely kung fu hero when a treacherous enemy spreads chaos throughout the countryside in this animated martial arts adventure featuring the voices of Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, and Jackie Chan.<br/><br/>On the surface, Po (voice of Black) may look like just another portly panda bear, but beneath his fur he bears the mark of the chosen one. By day, Po works faithfully in his family's noodle shop, but by night he dreams of becoming a true master of the martial arts. Now an ancient prophecy has come to pass, and Po realizes that he is the only one who can save his people from certain destruction. with time running short and malevolent snow leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane ) closing in, Furious Five legends Tigress (Jolie), Crane (David Cross ), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), Monkey (Chan), and their wise sensei, Master Shifu (Hoffman), all draw on their vast knowledge of fighting skills in order to transform a lumbering panda bear into a lethal fighting machine. Now, if the noble Po can master the martial arts and somehow transform his greatest weaknesses into his greatest strengths, he will fulfill his destiny as the hero who saved his people during their darkest hour.<br/><br/>With its negatives looming, Kung Fu Panda still manages to do better than thoses DreamWorks disasters (Madagascar, Shark Tale) and while it didn't quite live up to the hype, and it won't do anything with the release of WALL-E. Kung Fu Panda is a great kids movie with several laughs that will even have the tightest ass hole laughing.<br/><br/>It's in the superb visuals and the fact that Kung Fu Panda really did try. It excels, but not enough to be noticed. It works however as a decent enough bridge to WALL-E, while its a crying shame that a film devoted to hard work simply cant stride far enough to be something truly spectacular. My final verdict? Give it ago, but don't go in expecting Shrek 2 or erm ... any other good DreamWorks animations? No? Oh well."

","Honestly, I wasn't really expecting to like this so much. I really hate Jack Black, he's just disgusting. But since I didn't actually have to see him, it was OK. The subtle expressions and under-the-breath comments between the characters was rendered beautifully in CGI. My only criticism is that, considering the stunning array of huge stars doing voices, so many of them got so few lines. I mean, it's a Kung Fu movie, and Jackie Chan gets only a handful of lines. WHAT?!? But this movie really drew me in. It'll be a great movie for kids and families, but if you're an adult go to a late show and you will love it. I was pleasantly surprised. I think you will be too."

","Kung Fu Panda is a better than expected animated movie that has plenty of laughs with just the right amount of exciting martial arts action. Jack Black is perfect for the voice of Po an obese panda who wants to become a legendary kung fu master. The rest of the cast providing voices for their characters are solid including Dustin Hoffman(who gets the most screen time and dialogue of the supporting characters) as kung fu master Shifu, Angelina Jolie as Tigress, Lucy Liu as Viper, David Cross as Crane, Seth Rogen as Mantis, and Jackie Chan as Monkey. They prove some comic relief but some of them lack screen time and dialogue except for Hoffman's Shifu. Ian McShane provides the voice for Tai Lung and he does a decent enough job as the villain of the movie. The rest of the cast providing voices for the animated characters are good in their roles as well.

","As voiced by funnyman Jack Black, Po is just your average Chinese panda with dreams of one day becoming a world-class kung fu fighter (isn't that what all pandas living in China want to be?). When he's chosen by The Master to become the new Dragon Warrior, a position that brings virtually unlimited power to the individual who holds it, Po is thrown into round-the-clock training sessions to help groom him for the role - kind of like Eliza Doolittle on steroids.<br/><br/>The plot of ""Kung Fu Panda"" - with its echoes of ""The Karate Kid"" and even of ""Star Wars"" in its portrayal of teacher/pupil relationships - is fairly derivative in nature and lacks the kind of strong secondary characters we've come to expect from computer-animated films (no slam intended on the voice-over work by Dustin Hoffman, Ian McShane, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen and Jackie Chan).<br/><br/>Still, there is sufficient energy, wit and visual inventiveness in the movie to captivate the little ones while keeping the rest of us from actively storming the box office and demanding our money back. This is most definitely not one of the ""great ones,"" as animated features go, but it is short and pleasant enough to at least earn it a spot in the recommended column."

I'm not sure it quite lives up to that high of billing.<br/><br/>What I did really like about it was the animation and artwork. The colors were absolutely gorgeous and brilliant. Everything seemed to almost jump off the screen at you. I also really liked Jack Black's portrayal as the underdog who becomes the hero. He has the self-deprecating personality to begin with that fit well here.<br/><br/>Some disappointments were that some big name A list stars seem to barely have bit parts here - like Angelina Jolie and Jackie Chan. I would have liked to hear more from their characters. Jolie's rendition seemed to be especially flat and emotionless - but perhaps she was trying to portray a steely tigress. But it sounded like she was just reading lines. I also think there were few laugh out loud moments for me - and I would have expected more.<br/><br/>Overall, a very cute family movie (we sure need more of those) with a positive message.

I am thoroughly impressed with this animated feature! I was not expecting it to be full of such quietly respectful Eastern sentimentality, or as artistically rich in detail as it was. I'll have to go back for a second viewing because there were so many little details I know I missed. The entire last hour of the film, for me, was near perfect. Tai-Lung's escape from prison, the last words of Oogway, the Five's battle with Tai-Lung, Po's training, the final confrontation between Shifu and Tai-Lung, and especially the fight between Po and Shifu for the dumpling, was outstanding and beautifully done. This film evoked the kind of feelings that a film based on such a significant part of Eastern culture should evoke in me.

","Panda Po (Jack Black) loves the Chinese martial arts. He's followed the furious five: the Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross) his whole life, while he works at his father's noodle restaurant.<br/><br/>Then, one fateful day, he becomes the Dragon Master, and is trained by the five's Master, Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), to combat his biggest foe - Tai Lung (Ian McShane), a warrior Shifu raised from birth who turned evil after not being crowned the Dragon Master.<br/><br/>Now Shifu has very little time to make Po into a warrior, but he slowly discovers that the path to becoming a warrior is different for every animal.<br/><br/>The message that the movie gets across is that you don't have to be someone you're not to be someone great. Po is a fat slacker, but he moves into his destiny and learns the way of the marital arts, and is able to stand up not only to the other warriors, but his own doubts as well. Truly an uplifting film filled with comedy, heart, and kickbutt martial arts action!"

"mssclarity","8","1","2","30 September 2008"," The Panda of Bodaciousness: Kung Fu exceeds expectations
","It's not often you have to succumb to bodaciousness (grammar has to succumb slightly too). When you do, it's kinda fun.<br/><br/>The hype surrounding Kung Fu Panda was an automatic put-off for me; another Dreamworks film, another comedy, another Jack Black vehicle. The merchandise hasn't completely filled the shops yet, but I had a feeling it was just a matter of time.<br/><br/>I couldn't have been more wrong. Kung Fu Panda manages to combine the best elements of the entities involved in the film - Jack Black is at his antihero best (something I haven't seen since School of Rock), Dreamworks get back to their intelligently funny roots and the story flows with wit.<br/><br/>These elements are so strong that they made it through the marketing process which usually sucks the soul out of other movies. The preview thawed me a little - who could resist a film that featured a fat, panting superhero bear? I began to think up ways I could sneak out to see the film without anyone seeing me. After all, I have my pride, and I'd been burned by Horton Hears a Who (seriously, did anything happen in that film?) but fate landed me in Folkestone, the Town With Very Little To Do, and I was in luck.<br/><br/>The night was well set for comic surrealism. I lined up in a queue of 40-something women all wearing the same cardigan (they were going to see Mamma Mia) and thought I might be the only person going to see Kung Fu before I shuffled into a room full of 15-year-olds. The teens all stopped talking and stared as I shuffled down the aisle and took a seat in front. There was a tense moment before I told them all to go back to their activities and the previews started. Then the opening credits began to roll.<br/><br/>Meet Kung Fu Panda. His legendariness is legendary. His skills the stuff of legend. His very paws oozing with bodacity. From the very first moment, the film makes use of the progress in martial art film over the last few years and the general youthful obsession with martial art heroes to tickle the funnybones of the audience. There is the usual underdog-makes-good storyline, but with enough gags and freshness to carry the tired dog along.<br/><br/>Unlike most other animated films, Panda didn't advertise its range of stars by obviously referencing them in the looks of the characters. This meant that the characters were allowed to stand alone to be enjoyed on their own merits, rather than as cutesy versions of Jackie Chan, Angelina Jolie or the many other talented voice artists attached to the movie.<br/><br/>The thing I most enjoyed is how the film uses the rich history of martial art to support the comedy plot-line. The opening sequence is artful enough to rival the films it's referencing, such as Hero and House of Flying Daggers. Panda's fellow warriors, Tigress, Monkey, Mantis, Viper and Crane, each stand in for genuine fighting styles and every name - particularly the panda Po, meaning noodle soup - has a meaning. This respect for the subject paired with honest laughs makes Kung Fu Panda the best animated film I have seen in a long while.<br/><br/>A favourite moment: Panda (looking at historic relics) ""The Sword of Heroes! Said to be so sharp you can get cut just by looking at - Ow!"""
"MairegChernet","8","1","2","25 August 2008"," Kung Fu Panda redeems DreamWorks.
","Dreamworks Animation, after the mediocre third installment of the Shrek series, hasn't really been outstanding. Rather, it had dimmed in the shadows of oblivion. It's major rival Disney, on the other hand, has been successful with films like Wall E. But now with a star-studded cast and a smart script, DreamWorks makes a comeback with Kung Fu Panda, which is a film filled with ""awesomeness"". Jack Black does the voice of Po the Panda, and he does it great. Every scene Po is in belongs to him, in other word it makes the other characters look inferior, not weight-wise, although he is a pretty big animal. Another thing about this film is the absence of humans. Every character in the film is an animal whether a tiny insect or a frightening rhino. That sets the frivolous mood of the film, although it's not as frivolous as some might expect it. Had its fair share of plot twists and great jokes. Oh yeah lots of great jokes. Don't take this movie for a subtle one, and don't have little or no expectations of it because surely it will shatter your expectations just like it shattered the box office."
"concsubstance","6","1","2","31 July 2008"," A cute, average, family entertaining movie.
","Well, to start with an overview, this movie was definitely not a waste of time, and deserves the money. <br/><br/>The plot is kind of interesting, but a little too childish, and I'm sure it's meant to be. But the thing is that-- MANYYYYYYYY things are too exaggerated, too over the lines of any other exciting and exaggerated cartoon movie.<br/><br/>The plot also keeps you coming with a few..FEW.. gaps of comedy scenes. The story flows the way any other exaggerated action, and not comedy, movie flows. The scenes that make you laugh, really, i say really, make you laugh. <br/><br/>But when i was seated in the movie room with all the other people, i saw that all the families were laughing together, so the movie was absolutely worthwhile and well done.<br/><br/>I gave this movie 1 star for all the hard jobs that were done for completing the movie. 2 stars for the laughs. Another 2 stars for the suspense and the creative plot. And 1 star for the well-thought characters that seemed very hard to create. 6/10. -4 for the too much exaggeration.

","Kung Fu Panda - ****<br/><br/>Director: Mark Osborne & John Stevenson. Starring: Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie and Ian McShane. Certificate: PG. Duration: 92 minutes. Best Bit: The Escape and Po's training. Worst Bit: had a few corny bits. <br/><br/>If you liked Over the Hedge or The Incredibles you might love this<br/><br/>Yet again an animation with animals appears on our screens, which is OK as this one features a panda. Pandas are awesome. <br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda is the story of Po, voiced by Jack Black, who is a fat panda who works in a noodle shop restaurant thing, with his uuurrhhh dad? which is duck. Anyway Po has a dream to be an awesome kung fu master, to fight along the Furious Five and to be taught by the greatest kung fu master in the world - Master Shifu voiced by Dustin Hoffman, who is a RED PANDA which will stop you guessing for the whole film. Although there's a slight problem which is the fact the Po has no Kung Fu fight skills¬Ö and he's fat. Continuing on, the peaceful village Po lives in is in danger, as there is talk that Tai Long, voiced by Ian Macshane, might escape from Prison, guarded by Michael Clarke Duncan. So after some accidents, some training, then some friendship and then some blah blah blah blah¬Ö You can kind of guess that story line.<br/><br/>But you can't sometimes guess why they would do some stuff they do, I mean what is it with that finger hold?<br/><br/>First of all the animation, obviously DreamWorks where going for more cartoony look for this film, in which they succeeded. I have to except the character designs where ferpect. <br/><br/>I don't understand why DreamWorks have gone through loads of trouble getting an all star cast when only two of the most noticeable stars talk. They had Angeline Jolie, Seth Rogen, David Cross, Jackie Chan and Lucy Liu (both of which only said about 10 words each). Most of the less known actors got much more dialogue than the big 'uns, like Dan Fogler and Ian McShane that does exceptional as Tai Long and he's English. So basically Jack black, Dustin Hoffman and Ian McShane to brilliant and the rest are OK.<br/><br/>To be honest this film didn't have as much gags as I thought it would have, but the gags there where are very very funny. Most of the gags are about the panda's belly, which is totally fine as he's a panda. Some the best scenes are the prison escape, the bridge fight, Po's training and Po's big fight seen.<br/><br/>So overall I'm gonna say this is a great film that will make pretty much anyone laugh, with great voice acting and very good animation. I liked it and so should you. SKADOOSH!"
"bob the moo","Null","1","2","13 July 2008"," Well crafted and fun film with strong story and characters driving the humour
","Po may well dream of kung fu glory but the reality is that he is heavy, lazy, food-focused and likely to spend his life in the noodle business like his father. When the test for the Dragon Warrior is announced, Po hopes at very least to be an observer of the contest. So imagine his surprise when he finds himself to be the one chosen. Trainer Shifu and his students are sceptical at least and furious at worst, but are confident that Po will soon quit, but they do not count on the sheer, good natured pleasure that Po takes from just being involved. Thing is, what Po doesn't know is that the Dragon Warrior is prophesied as the only one who can stop the powerful and evil Tai Lung, who has just broken free of a prison of one prisoner and a thousand guards.<br/><br/>I wasn't totally sold on going to see this film but it got the group vote so away I went. It wasn't that any one thing put me off it, it was just that the bar has been set high for this sort of thing by Pixar etc and I have been disappointed by some films that were ""only"" OK. Kung Fu Panda opens with a really cool sequence that suits the genre of animated martial arts films and then quickly moves into reality and the seemingly straightforward tale of an individual who aspires to more than his appearance would suggest him capable of. It sounds generic and indeed I suppose that, in its basest form, it is but it is the delivery that sees it be much more than just this.<br/><br/>It worried me at first that the film was not loaded with pop culture references and ""for the adults only"" one-liners that Shrek etc often are but I quickly got over this. Instead of lots of quick fire humour, Kung Fu Panda actually focuses on the characters and the story and builds the humour onto that rather than the two just happening to be alongside one another. As The Times noted, the film is also free of lavatorial humour which is not only a pleasing omission but one that must have been deliberate given how easy it would have been to draw f*rt gags from the main character of Po! But instead it is a smarter type of humour, with the only downside being that younger children might be a bit restless at the infrequency of really obvious comedy. I didn't roll with laughter that much either but for me it was more rewarding as a film rather than an animated series of references and sly gags.<br/><br/>The focus on character does help because I was drawn into the story quick effectively to the point where I wasn't bored if I didn't have a laugh for five minutes. Those that set up the quick-fire stuff as the agenda risk this feeling but the story was my interest here. It also helps the voice actors to be more than just voices. Black and Hoffman both benefit greatly from this and the expressions of their animated characters. McShane has a simpler character but his voice really suits Tai Lung. The supporting cast looks great on paper with Jolie, Cross, Rogen, Liu and Chan but sadly they are not that well used and have too few lines considering. One star with no dialogue is the animation itself. It is amazingly detailed and stunning and yet another example of how the technology seems to be constantly moving in leaps and bounds.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda is not the funniest animated film you will see and it doesn't really deliver the rapid laughs of Shrek (for example). This comes with the approach though because the film doesn't load itself with pop culture references and lots of gags for kids while slipping adult humour into the one-liners, instead it is much more satisfying in its construction and deliver. The clich√©d framework of the plot is fleshed out really well and ultimately I really enjoyed it for this. Well worth seeing for what it is and how unpretentious it all is."

But one day, it is announced that that there will be a selection process of choosing a ""Dragon Warrior"" and as everyone in the town go to watch this, PO accidentally (nothing happens accidentally) enters this competition and at the same time, there's breaking news that the evil Tai Lang, a Snow Leopard, has escaped from a nearby jail.<br/><br/>Directed by Mark Osbourne and John Stevenson, the voice overs are by Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Ian McShane, Jackie Chan, Angelina Jolie and Lucy Liu and is written by Jonathan Aibel & Glenn Berger.<br/><br/>The martial arts movement for this animation was actually put on after the sequences were performed by real artists. But what has really made this into a good and watchable movie is that the story takes place in ancient China and the character of PO is such that it just makes one laugh but deep down one is aware that he is also a sensitive character.<br/><br/>Although the movie is for children, I must warn that there is violence but it is mild and, in some cases, very funny.

","Last week I saw Kung Fu Panda with a few of my mates, who'd been dying for its release. I must say, we were definitely satisfied with what we saw, i'd even say... Extremely impressed! From the previews, i thought it was just going to be another dreamworks animated film that failed to impress me (eg. Shark Tale, Shrek the Third, Bee Movie etc.), but Kung Fu Panda was full of ""Awesomeness"".<br/><br/>Jack Black plays a fat panda, who wants to be a kung fu champion, like his idols... He plays the role fantastically! Big names such as Angelina Jolie and Jacki Chan also play characters, and although the film would have been fine with some no-name actors, they definitely bring some 'zing' to the film.<br/><br/>The animation is certainly above average in the scheme of recent animated films, and the entertainment level is incredible. One of my only complaints is that it should maybe go for a bit longer. There was definitely room for a few more laughs, and my popcorn bag wasn't yet empty. I was a bit like.. ohhh, it's over? Apart from it's premature conclusion, i thoroughly enjoyed watching Kung Fu Panda. It's a fun film (one of the best animated films in the last 5 years or so) and will surely entertain the whole family."
"neil-476","8","1","2","9 July 2008"," Pletty good, Glasshopper
","Let's get one thing straight. I have always regarded Jack Black as a tolerable supporting player who, for some reason I can't quite fathom (although it seems to have something to do with some people finding him quite a bit funnier than I do), has achieved leading man status. That overall opinion hasn't changed, but that doesn't stop me recognising his voice work here as very, very good. The same goes for Dustin Hoffman, with a special mention for James Hong. The other voice artists are also good, but the parts they play don't really demand the names which play them - Jackie Chan has, what? five lines? Something like that.<br/><br/>This film looks gorgeous. The backgrounds are simply breathtaking, the characters are well realised, and the effects are excellent. There are lots of gags, most of them quite funny, and lots of action too.<br/><br/>I have two criticisms. One is that much of the action was too fast for me to follow. The other is that the movie seemed a bit - well, inconsequential. Maybe I'm getting used to the better scripted CGI animated movies regaling me with various universal truths, but I didn't detect much of that here. Just a relatively engaging story, well told.<br/><br/>And that's perfectly fine, of course."
"jhobdell","8","1","2","9 July 2008"," Hooray for Jack Black!
","Oh this was great! Right from the get go you can tell it'll be hilarious and a little wacky. Jack Black is perfect as Po, the main character Panda. Similarly, everyone is great in their individual roles - Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, Ian McShane. There are some great funny moments as the totally inept Po attempts to train as the omnipotent Dragon Warrior.<br/><br/>The best thing, for me, is the philosophical element, totally in keeping with the period of Ancient China. Although the fun of the movie will obviously appeal to children, and there is enough visual humour to keep everyone entertained, the philosophy, particularly of Master Oogway, means that there is something for the adult mind to latch on to and take away from it. Maybe that's too intellectual a standpoint for this kind of film but that's what I took from it.<br/><br/>This was great fun - go enjoy it!"

The plot is simple but solid and has a wonderful moral that made me remember of those Disney's classics I used to love as a child. This film also proves how animation techniques have improved in the last years, gestures now seem absolutely natural and that is a key element when it comes to making the audience get involved with the characters.

","After an innovative and likable start, the SHREK series quickly deteriorated and, being a similar product, I didn‚Äôt quite know how I was going to react to this one ‚Äì which is basically TMNT via SHREK and STAR WARS (with Oogway standing in for Yoda, Shifu as a cross between Obi-Wan-Kenobi and Master Splinter, Tai Lung replacing Darth Vader and Po, obviously, as an amalgam of both Luke Skywalker and Shrek!).<br/><br/>Surprisingly, I ended up enjoying it quite a bit because, not only was the animation technique on display thoroughly ‚Äúawesome‚Äù (though the very best sequence may well be the classically animated opening dream sequence!), but the characterizations themselves (particularly Jack Black‚Äôs titular bout) were vividly realized. Apart from Black, Angelina Jolie and Dustin Hoffman, I didn‚Äôt recognize the other voice artists and, realizing that the characters of Tai Lung, Monkey and Viper had actually been voiced by Ian McShane, Jackie Chan and Lucy Liu respectively only brought to mind another pet peeve of mine which has become increasingly common in contemporary movies: the credits are bundled together at the very end while the opening is reserved to an endless succession of production company logos (although, in this case, the transformed animated Asian-inflected Dreamworks logo was an inspired and amusing touch)! <br/><br/>The moral of the story ‚Äì that one should not refrain from chasing his life‚Äôs dreams in spite of the everyday adversities and that within everyone is the will to achieve this goal ‚Äì sets the scene for an epic framework of good-vs.-evil in ancient Asia. Thankfully, in spite of the expected spectacle of various action sequences, we were spared anachronistic, in-jokey references to popular movies like THE MATRIX (1999), CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON (2000) and the KILL BILL saga (2003-4). The only disappointment is the rather thin, by-the-numbers plot line ‚Äì for all his strength and ferocity, one would have expected Tai Lung to summon an army to make his bid for the Dragon Warrior title and end with a veritable battle (rather than turn up alone and, after defeating the previously unassailable Furious Five with relative ease, confront his former mentor/surrogate father and engage in single combat with Po ‚Äì which he then, obviously, loses)!"

","This was a great movie and has many different types of humor for all ages. The story was neither boring nor hard to follow. Jack Black was a perfect fit for the role of the lazy but humorous panda. It was hard for me to see Jackie Chan playing an animated character since his style of humor is more physical but he still played a good monkey. I don't know how Dreamworks pulled together this cast with names like Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Jack Black, Seth Rogan, and Lucy Liou, but this was a brilliantly casted film. Another great thing about the movie was the animation. Every angle was exciting and colorful and matched the mood of the scene. Great story and great cast for a great film."
"RainDogJr","Null","1","2","20 June 2008"," The Way of the Panda
","I love Kung Fu and of course martial arts movies, I like a lot pandas and I'm a fan of Jack Black's work so since I knew that Black was going to be a panda (great choice since Black looks like one of them) I have true desires to watch this picture and NOT since the hype before its release started in my country due to the comedian that dubbed Po. That comedian works for the biggest and most manipulative media company of Mexico so you can imagine all the f*cking publicity that they are making for Kung Fu Panda and all the hype for this mediocre comedian. Anyway, today after 1month of its release, in the Cannes Film Festival, was finally released in my country and yes I really liked it.<br/><br/>There is a TV spot with the song Battle Without Honor or Humanity as background and that song is for most of us a direct reference to Tarantino's Kill Bill. That 2003 film was, as we all know, homage to the martial arts films and to some other genres. Kung Fu Panda works in the same line with a background full of the kung fu mythology and the look of the wuxia genre. The ""serious"" characters are the furious five that are homage to some of the Chinese mart arts styles that based their movements in animal's movements. We have Master Tigress (Jolie), Master Crane (Cross), Master Mantis (Rogen), Master Viper (Liu) and Master Monkey (Chan). All of them are students of Shifu (Hoffman) whose master is Oogway (Duk Kim). The philosophy and the discipline are some of the values that these martial artists perform and I really liked this background. The enemy is also part of this but mostly part of the classic relation between master and student. Tai Lung (McShane) is the name of this snow leopard that use to be Shifu's best student but also they created a father-son relation. Of course he always has a ""dark side"" and the master knows that and he was right. The master's philosophy make that a panda is the one, the Dragon Warrior. And our hero is the one who brings the laughs of course and the one that will change the things. The character itself is the classic one that is so useless for what he loves to do and Jack Black has made some very similar ones. ""Precious Father, why have you given me this desire to wrestle and then made me such a stinky warrior?"" used to say Nacho from Nacho Libre and also JB from Tenacious D movie was similar in his dream of being a rock star. ""Precious Father, why have you given me this desire to be a kung fu master and then made me suck a fat panda?"" yes that could be a perfect and funny line for Po (Black) that is a really funny character for obvious reasons. For a moment near the beginning the panda reminds a lot King Kong but the version of Homer Simpson and it was really funny as many cool dialogs, the fact that Po was hated by his own heroes or that scene when he fights for eat. The kids in today's audience were really enjoying the panda and it has a message in the end.<br/><br/>The visual part is nothing new but that doesn't mean that is jut OK, actually is terrific and I really liked the first sequence made in 2D animation. I saw it with the Mexican dubbing and it is decent but vastly and sadly overrated. Anyway, I found this picture a really good one that easily I can watch again but now with the original voices so take your kids or your little bros and sis to the cinema to see and enjoy the way of the panda."
"jemps918","6","4","18","5 June 2008"," Not as engaging as I thought it would be
","I was definitely excited to see Kung Fu Panda. I ""prepared for awesomeness"" as its fun trailer suggested, but it wasn't as engaging as I thought it would be. It opens with a stylized fight sequence that belongs more in highbrow children's books that thankfully ended after my first yawn.<br/><br/>Po (voice by Jack Black) is an impressionable, fat panda who regularly daydreams about kung fu fighting as he helps his pop run their noodle shop. He finally gets to realize his dream when he is chosen to be trained by the great kung fu master Shifu (voice by Dustin Hoffman) to fight against the evil Tai Lung (voice by Ian McShane), much to the chagrin of Shifu's highly trained posse of Tigress (voice by Angelina Jolie), Monkey (voice by Jackie Chan), Mantis (voice by Seth Rogen), Viper (voice by Lucy Liu) and Crane (voice by David Cross).<br/><br/>It had truly awesome fight scenes (especially noteworthy Tai Lung's escape from prison) and its share of kung fu wisdom, but overall, the writing and illustration just wasn't as clever or as funny as it promised. The animals were plain and androgynous so their personalities were very reliant on their characters' voices, especially the Tigress (thanks to Jolie's unmistakably sultry voice). Only the panda had a wider variety of facial expressions, and only very few of his lines were able to elicit some chuckles from the adults in the audience. The children were more easily enamored."

","There's just so much money involved in the creation of the current breed of animated/cg movies that they rarely strike out. Indeed, I found even mediocrely-reviewed fare such as ""monsters vs aliens"" to actually be quite good and appreciable on an adult level with lots of intelligent jokes and the occasional innuendo.<br/><br/>But not ""Kung Fu Panda."" Kung Fu Panda is awful.<br/><br/>Here's the plot: fat, lazy, wisecracking panda boy is surprisingly chosen to be ""the one"" to defend against big bad guy, much to the chagrin of five sidekick kung-fu master animals who have spent their lifetimes in training and work. initially, they reject him since he's a fat lazy panda. will he find the solution, a combination of 'believing in himself' and taking advantage of his 'alternate but just as good talents' (he's fat, so he can be motivated by food) to defeat the bad guy and save the day? alas, yes. the plot is just that stupid, sending all the wrong messages. in kung fu panda's America, you don't have to do the math or practice for more than a few token montage scenes. you just 'believe in yourself.' this line of nonsense used to what they used to console kids on the slow bus with, but is now what passes for 'inclusive education' or some-such. and mind you, I'm an extreme political liberal (though a well educated one) writing this.<br/><br/>but, even such inanity could be salvageable if the jokes and acting along the way were any good. they're not. the A-list quality supporting voice talent in addition to B-list quality lead Jack Black are utterly miscast. Angelina Jolie is wasted and unnecessary, though I'm sure she was glad for the check for her afternoon of work. did anybody here go see the movie because Angelina Jolie or Dustin Hoffman were cast? then why did they bother? one suspects a massive kickback scheme is in place - how else to explain why major stars land well paying voice animated rolls that probably do nothing to drawing audiences? the only good to be gotten out of this absolutely miserable movie are the fight scenes. i'm not usually one for fight scenes (and this movie didn't change this), but at times they were clever enough. there was no groundbreaking animation in this movie; I just mean to say that if you happen to like kung fu fight scenes, then you'll probably enjoy the ones here. i personally found those in 'crouching tiger hidden dragon' far more satisfying, but I can't say that those here were in any way bad for what they were. the 'dumpling scene' was particularly well done.<br/><br/>the only thing that this movie had that in any way broke the usual stereotypes was the depiction of the prison that held the 'long caged' bad guy in the beginning. his jailers, for once, were not total dupes.<br/><br/>i, however, felt like a total dupe after watching this very poor movie - doubly so since it was recommended to me as being particularly well written.<br/><br/>conclusion: worst animated/cgi film i've seen in at least the last decade."
"olesd","5","2","7","13 November 2008"," Lots of Flash, but No Punch
","I'm deliberately rating this below what my mind insists I rate it because FLAIR DOES NOT MAKE A GOOD MOVIE! This movie is dripping with style. The atmosphere is pitch perfect, hyper real, and beautiful as a cherry blossom. Fighting sequences are flawlessly choreographed, and characters are hilarious and make expressions so subtle they deserve academy awards. Only one thing mars all this. THE MOVIE ISN'T ABOUT ANYTHING. If you don't believe me, wait till the plot-twist at the end that states the moral aloud, and crazily enough is that the secret to success is NOTHING. If you believe in something enough it apparently comes true...in the magical fantasy world of Kung Fu Panda. This moral idea of a person being able to will themselves to greatness is not only dangerous applied to real life (I can fly!) but the movie contradicts the message itself, by making the villain evil because he is selfish and a killer. Apparently it's bad when the snow leopard 'believes in himself' enough to fight for what's his, but if the Panda does it it gives him mystical powers. Also, the Panda is implied to have KILLED the leopard at the end, using the very power taught to him by the leopard's surrogate father. Good lesson there, eh? Skadoosh. As very pretty screen-savers go, this film is at least better written then Clone Wars, but equally devoid of likable characters and substance. Much like I'd recommend Clone Wars to people who love awesome battles and technical wizardry but can afford to sit through something inherently empty, if you like to watch top notch CG, some great pratfalls, and kung fu fighting animals and you can stand no character development, moral, rhyme or reason, watch Kung Fu Panda once. Then you can go read a good book or watch The Dark Knight to fill the emptiness left behind."
"SenaShetani","6","2","7","2 July 2008"," Pretty pictures and thats about it
","This movie was entertaining first off. Which I think all movies should be. Now let it be known Dreamworks is no Pixar in terms of story development. Yet visually it was on par with Wall-E. The characters designs were very nice and stylized.<br/><br/>Yet here's the clincher the story was nothing short of typical. There was nothing that possibly set it apart from other movies like itself. There has even been books and televisison shows and movies and even videogames that preceed this that are based on some the principles of this movie.<br/><br/>The main character Po was just that po' in character development. It was just another Jack Black character except this time with fur. The casting was nothing spectacular. Could Dreamworks have maybe did a little bit more with it's actual casting. Yes. Instead they choose top celebs or celebs that basically everyone is accustomed to and gave them roles. The other characters besides Po had little to no personality to me except for maybe Master Sif.<br/><br/>The humor was typical Dreamworks so I won't touch that but otherwise I can tell you now that if you're looking for a nice way to kill some time this way movie is the way to do it.<br/><br/>My overall score is a 6"
"Aaron1375","5","3","13","22 June 2008"," Not as funny as a movie titled ""Kung Fu Panda"" should have been.
","First, let me say my niece enjoyed the movie quite a bit...this was her first movie so it was a new experience for her. If I was rating the movie on her thoughts on it I would have rated it higher. However, I paid money to see this one too, and I have to say I just thought it would be funnier. Jack Black is great as the voice of the Panda as was all the cast, though I thought the five warriors were rather ignored for the most part with the Tigress one sort of stepping up a bit. The movie was just to talky for me with way to many serious moments. I will draw a parallel if I may. The first hour of Shrek had me laughing a bit and was rather good. The last half hour I did not laugh much at all and I thought it dragged down the rest of the film. This whole movie seemed more like the last half hour of Shrek rather than the first hour. It had a few cute parts here and there, but for me it just did not deliver the goods, the preview for Madagascar 2 looked better than this one. The story has a Panda who dreams of becoming a kung fu hero ending up being the chosen dragon warrior to the dismay of a master of kung fu and his students. A villain escapes and is on his way to challenge the dragon warrior and nothing to surprising happens along the way. A few chuckles to be sure in the ending fight, and scattered throughout the movie, just not enough for my tastes. However, my niece loved it so it is a good movie for kids anyway."
"Sirus_the_Virus","5","2","8","10 January 2010"," This movie is just overrated.
","Kung fu Panda was nominated for Best animated film of the year in 2008. Why? I didn't like it. There isn't much plot. I felt like there weren't many laughs. Sure the kids ate it up but that's cause kids are stupid. They loved Alvin and the Chipmunks, Aliens in the attic, G-force. Besuides Alvin, which wasn't that good, the other films were just awful.<br/><br/>Now days when I hear that an animated film is Dreamworks or something other than Pixar, I am going to assume it's not perfection. Beside Shrek. That was a great film. Kung fu Panda is definitely not.<br/><br/>The cast to this movie is great. and sure it has a couple of laughs and visuals are nice. But the plot and film itself just isn't that great. It's an overrated movie. I mean I never wanted to watch it. After I had heard it was good though, I thought""well, what the hell"" and watched it.

"jencaddell-1","Null","2","8","27 June 2008"," disappointing ending
","The ""bad guy"" in this movie is not painted to be bad enough deserve what he gets in the end. The movie shows him as a cute little baby being raised by the Kung Fu master, and taught so much Kung Fu that he eventually becomes arrogant and tries to steal something from his masters, resulting in a fight. For this he is locked in a maximum security prison, and later killed by the kung fu panda. I don't recall him ever doing anything wrong enough to deserve being killed, even in a cartoon! In fact, they built him up as being so human, that we in the audience are sincerely hoping he will change his ways and turn over a new leaf at best, or at worst, maybe go back to prison. It's not fun to go to a movie expecting fun, laughter and comedy, and instead to find yourself leaving with your children, a little bewildered and feeling like the ending to the plot was unfair and poorly designed. I can't recommend this movie--- It was simply a waste of 2 hours."

","good animated movie for the kids but if you're not a fan of animated movies, of course this movie is not for you. this movie alone is not worth the money. voices are great, although i'm a bit tired of hearing Jack Black's voice. it gets quite irritating.<br/><br/>Basically we've got a plot for an animated movie, that is overly didactic. The main character, a panda, learns his true dreams and pursues this dream, eventually reaching the zenith of his career. He achieves the seemingly impossible, with the indirect aid of his goose father and a kung fu master. Does this plot seem familiar? Mm hmm.<br/><br/>This movie isn't special. It's purely entertainment. But it is more animated than most other movies, and a lot more vivid/character-involved. Sooo you'll guess correctly that it's kind of boring for the older audience. Kung fu Panda is fun but the humor is seriously directed to the younger audience (<14.) If you think it can serve as a source of inspiration for the young kids, in that anything is possible, then go for it."

Apart from Po and Shifu(and possibly the film's villain, splendidly voiced by Ian McShane) the film is lacking in its character development, while the story while well constructed, original and fresh has its predictable parts and the message is a little over-familiar. However, when it comes to the visuals, there is nothing to fault, the whole film with its gorgeous colours and backgrounds looks wonderful. The score is excellent as well, and I can see that there was care to make it sound authentic. The script is witty, funny and smart, the pace is bright and breezy and the voice acting is solid across the board- Dustin Hoffmann is perfectly cast while Jack Black does a great job voicing one of his more likable characters. In conclusion, very entertaining film, but it didn't wow me completely. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"bloktarifa","6","1","3","31 January 2009"," Painfully average, with few good moments.
","It is a common thing these days that animated movies are not made just for kids, but also for adult audience as well. I have no reason to think that kids won't love this movie. Po is interesting character, somewhat funny, but unless you are 12 years old, this film just won't do the thing. Before I watched ""Kung Fu Panda"" I have read a lot of reviews full of superlatives, excitement and good words for this movie and to be honest, I have expected much, much more. The story is, just as I expected to be, nothing more than million times seen thing like ""there is a hero in each one of us, even the most average guys"". And to make things worse, writers didn't even try to add anything new. After 15 minutes of this movie, you can pretty much guess the rest of plot, without any errors. But the story is not the only flaw of this movie. It's not even funny. And it is supposed to be, it's animated movie after all. I have read some reviews saying the beginning is little boring, but later on, you will roll on the floor laughing and crying. Honestly, not only I haven't roll on the floor like promised, I have a feeling that I have spent an hour and thirty minutes waiting to see something spectacularly funny, but it never happened. There were few funny moments, but that's it! There was no magic, like in ""Wall-E"" or ""Shrek"", no laugh, no nothing, it looked painfully average to me, especially after big expectations I had. I think this movie is pretty much overrated.<br/><br/>By my opinion, 6/10"

","I found this movie great. From the very Jack Black style intro that is just great, to the ending that pretends to go clich√©d and then doesn't, this is a very good movie. Jack Black suited the role of Po perfectly. The movie is just plain silly at times and then switches to serious, and yet none of the transitions are jarring, they are actually very smooth. The characters in interestingly outlined and you are given quite a few glimpses into the lives and struggles of the others. These glimpses were just enough, any more and there would be information overload, any less and the movie would look half though out. It was very masterfully done."

Brilliant voice talents from Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, Lucy Liu, Eddie Izzard and many, many more.

"Zombie-Kermit","9","1","3","8 July 2008"," What seemed like another cool animated movie turned out to be so much more.
","Alright, that sounded like a really corny thing to say... but in all seriousness this was an awesome movie. I like most of those computer animated movies, but this was even cooler still. The movie was hilarious from the start, and kept it up throughout a large part of the movie. But the parts that weren't funny were what sets this movie apart from many others. It didn't rely on cheap laughs and one liners for the whole movie, (and barely at all for that matter) it had some some truly dramatic moments. And the directors knew when the right time was to leave the humour out of those moments. None of the jokes seemed thrown in for cheap laughs. They were all done at the right times and were really funny. It sort of had the feel of some of the Disney movies of the not so distant past, like Aladdin and The Lion King. The movie had me cracking up, and I'm the kind of person who tends not to laugh at much at the cinema, even if I find it funny. So I guess that covers how awesomely funny the movie is.<br/><br/>The action sequences were great. It's clear that they weren't just thrown together to look cool, you can tell that a lot of research has gone into the various Kung Fu styles portrayed in the movie. Even if you don't like the movie itself, you should be able to appreciate the art the the fight choreography, which I think is up there with the best I've seen in animation, and definitely among the best in American movies. I liked the fact that all of the characters got a chance to show off their stuff. None of the martial artists really got a bum rap in that department, which was something that could have been a problem for the movie if they had. It's a bit of a shame that we couldn't get a little more history on some of the characters and some more screen time for them outside of the fights, but there was really no time for it in between the awesomeness. So it's not really a complaint, more an idea of what could be worked on, should there be a sequel.<br/><br/>I thought the characters were really cool. Po was likable and made a good hero for the story. Shifu was great for the mentor character with personal problems. And of course Tai Lung was a great villain. Basically all the movie really needed. But on top of that you also have the Furious Five, who are all cool in their own ways. The voice acting was really good, and I thought they were all well suited for their roles. My personal favourite was Dustin Hoffman as Shifu, he was awesome. But Jack Black was good as well, and his voice really seemed to match the good hearted Po. I also thought Ian McShane made a great villain. A minor problem I had was with big stars like Jackie Chan and Seth Rogen only having a couple of lines. I have no problem with using celebrity voices, but I feel it sort of defeats the purpose when their character hasn't got enough lines to really identify the voice.<br/><br/>No, the plot of the movie was nothing groundbreaking. A pretty standard tale of the rise of a hero. But what it lacked in that department it certainly made up for in style. The animation is fantastic. There were times when I forgot that I was watching an American movie, as it had all the beauty of China within it. You can see the effort that has gone into the animation to capture the Chinese culture, and I feel they were truly successful in doing so. I also loved the attention to detail, for example the fur on the animals and the way they've added in dust rising up from the ground when the characters hit it hard, just stuff like that. Even the 2D animation used in the opening credits was great. So I guess all that's left to say is that it is an awesome movie, and I plan to grab it on DVD when I get the chance, as I would like to watch it again. My little brother saw the movie with me, and he loved it as well. I'm sure this movie will soon become a franchise, and I hope it will be one that I can follow for years to come."

","Kung fu panda. What can i possibly say? This is literally the best animated film anyone in the world could conjure. Since its release i've seen it up to three times and will ensure i see it until I've learned all the lines. Basically, everyone should know the storyline by now. Its about a no good, fat and lazy Panda who by opportunity/destiny is chosen to be the dragon warrior. This is the funniest film you'll see this year. Tropic thunder might edge near but I really doubt it would be as funny. What exactly makes this animation so unique? It borrows basically the same concept as shrek only that it beats it hands down. Its originality really perplexed me, its been long since i""ve seen anything so unique. The graphics were also undoubtedly amazing. I could actually see a little bit of jack black in the panda. His expressions, his movement, everything was so jacky. And finally, the voice! oh my God, Jack really nails it here. I really hope there would be a part 2 to explain some of the unexplained aspects of the film."

Though conversely, to praise 'Panda' further, it is valid to say that this Dreamworks production adopts a more original storyline, backed up with equally as provoking dialogue.Not to insult 'Shrek' that is, because I prefer it- just clarifying the many post-modern references that support 'Shrek' in its comedy.<br/><br/>Yes, 'Kung Fu Panda' goes back to basics (well aside from the blatant Asian-kung-fu-animation-parody), and provides laughs in a more round-a-bout way. ...Again this is not necessarily a good thing.<br/><br/>I did enjoy it, and was mused by Jack Black.

"Mattissimplythebest","9","1","3","7 July 2008"," Breathtaking both in humour and in graphical splendour
","I don't think its often you see a movie that can deliver a belly full of laughter as well as moments of poignancy but The Panda film is one of them. It was a joy to sample this film full of sparkling entertainment more because of the refreshing balance that it delivered between adult humour and kids humour than anything else. Detractors and critics will point to the quite complete and singular focus on Jack Black's character and perhaps the jocular mentality towards obesity. However I think it fairly charmless to attack the credibility of an animated adventure comedy on the basis of politically incorrect humour, after all comedy has to live on the border of good taste. As for Jack Black his performance is everything we would expect of an expert comedian - and in particular some awards have to go to the effects team for getting the facial expressions of the creature so accurate and human-like.<br/><br/>In short if you enjoy physical comedy, are not afraid or too politically minded to embrace some fat jokes, and you heartily enjoy fully rendered CGI images that swoop, dive, and lift over some awe inspiring scenery then this is the film for you."

","The trailer was to the point and part of an excellent marketing campaign, but Kung Fu Panda is weak and seems to drift until two thirds in - about fifty minutes or so - where he actually begins training after the heavy is finally and implausibly unleashed.<br/><br/>The opening Dreamworks logo and back story being in a different animation style was a good call, but from then onward the formula of starting production without a firm script proves to be a problem.<br/><br/>The Panda is immediately out of his depth and granted a savior position thanks only to the loopy, illogical judgment of the top ""master."" From there on character change their defining positions whenever it suits the needs of the swiss cheese premise: secondary guru (Dustin Hoffman's voice, having to tolerate very functional and single-level dialog) decides now that the baddie is indeed escaped from prison the Panda is the ""only one"" who can save them despite the previous demonstrations of skill from his team. What is this teaching kids, while we're at it? The one ""destined"" to blunder into victory only needs a crash course in an art form others have dedicated their lives toward? The movie is getting positive exit polls or word of mouth presently thanks to a stronger third act that only then has a narrative that perhaps should have driven the film from the start: Baddie is on the way and it will take about as long for him to arrive at home base as it will take to whip the would-be hero into shape.<br/><br/>Mind you I saw the film in pirated online form so the images were okay but I'm not glowing about the technical quality. All I'm looking at is the content and that is nowhere near up to the inspired level of most hit animated features these days.<br/><br/>I'm sure the People's Republic of China is happy that the movie has an audience and that it ultimately has nothing to say beyond a bland fortune cookie."

","The hard-headed folks at Dreamworks just won't back down when it comes to their consistent choice to produce only the animated genre of slapstick comedy despite constant unnecessary comparisons to Pixar by most audiences. Here however, I feel they've finally succeeded in forming a well-crafted comedy that references itself and its genre without any manipulative occurrences of incessant cute (despite featuring one of the universal symbols) or thin framework. One of the first cgi Dreamworks romps to lack pop culture (shockingly less than Pixar's Cars) the pacing in the film shines, as well as the slick camera work and surprisingly effective fight sequences. Particularly, there was a true sense of environment to the animation, but also a sense of peril and physical boundaries in the well choreographed combat scenes. The story is expectedly predictable as well as the clean message, but the film comes together as referential fun comedy with likable and moderately inspiring situations despite the nature of the film. There are no mean-spirited jokes, and just the right amount of heart are out into them (not too much or little) so that it begins to approach what made the first Shrek enjoyable. It makes great use of its animation, tying in it's comical pacing with a lot of great physicality. I thoroughly enjoyed the characterizations, barely noticing or caring that they typically come to us from cherry-picked A-list celebs in an attempt to drag in theatregoers. Despite that, they bring their A-game with voice work, and the audience besides the actors have fun for once. In my opinion, it's one of Dreamworks' best after they canned their 2d films. I did not see that coming, with the eye-roll inducing premise."

","KUNG FU PANDA is a Dreamworks animation whose plot you can guess from the title alone. It's predictable stuff for sure, child-friendly but without possessing that spark of magic that the old Disney films used to have. The plot is hackneyed and appears to have been written by a team of computers, as content as it is to revisit all the old tropes and cliches and attempting to put a fresh spin on them. Imagine every Asian film cliche in Hollywood packed into a single movie and you'll get some idea of what this is like. A talented voice cast (the annoying Jack Black aside) can't compensate for this generic nonsense."

","I'm about 8 years late, but I've wanted to say this ever since I saw Kung Fu Panda. <br/><br/>I actually never had the desire to see this movie. I recall seeing a trailer some time in 2007, probably with Shrek 3, but I'm not sure. I just thought that it was too childish for my tastes. Then, the summer rolled around, and my brother dragged my mom and me to the movies to see this. <br/><br/>Honestly, I spent about 10-15 minutes trying to figure out why a panda had a goose for a father before I just settled on adoption. After that, I basically just dwelt on the humorless jokes and how irritating I found Po. He was a man-child who did and said the most foolish things. I couldn't keep myself from rolling my eyes.<br/><br/>Upon Po being chosen as the Dragon Warrior, I began to pity him. I mean, I was thinking that there was no way a panda could learn kung fu AND defeat the bad guy. But I thought that his treatment by the Five and Shifu was unnecessary and harsh. Plus, I thought it was upsetting that he possessed such a poor self-image. As annoying as I found him, I never thought he was a ""disgrace"" or some ""thing"" or anything else the others believed him to be. He just had a dream, albeit a seemingly unrealistic one, that he now had the opportunity to pursue.<br/><br/>Fast forward to his training with Shifu. I actually thought his combat scene before the keep-away thing with the dumpling was another dream and was shocked when I learned it was real. But I still thought that he couldn't beat Tai Lung.<br/><br/>At the end when Mr. Ping told Po his secret ingredient for the soup, I actually began to like this movie. I give it a 6 because, in spite of those poor attempts at humor, I saw something valuable. In spite of the incredulity expressed by the others, Po remained determined and managed to beat the odds. I think that scroll managed to dispel that self-loathing we saw earlier. That's a cool message to teach to people of any age and allowed me to appreciate some of what I'd written off earlier.<br/><br/>Overall, kids can enjoy the movie, and I know many members of older audiences did, as well. It's worth watching at least once."

","I had heard some good things about this movie but I kind of relegated it to ""just a little kids film"" for years in my mind. When I finally sat down and watched it....yeah, that's pretty much what it is. I'm not saying it's painful if you have to sit through it if you're an adult--it's absolutely not. But it's not quite on par with the Toy Story trilogy.<br/><br/>There are 2 elements about the movie that really stick out as excellent. Firstly, a lot of the scenes are extremely beautiful to look at. The shots like where Po is talking to the turtle teacher by the peach tree and you get an overhead view of the valley of peace are just gorgeous. The second element that is really great are the action shots: they're fast, they're fun, they're varied. The fight sequences are a joy to watch.<br/><br/>Other then those 2 elements, I don't know if anything really stuck out. The voice actors are all well-chosen and do good jobs and the jokes are pretty good but the story is pretty predictable. Like I said, it's pretty good but I wouldn't go as far as to say it's spectacular."
"ragingbull_2005","7","0","1","9 December 2012"," DreamWorks gets it right. Finally
","I have been avoiding the Kung Fu Panda juggernaut for the past four years. The Shrek sequels actually killed my enthusiasm for any animation made by DreamWorks (How to Train Your Dragon being the exception which proves the rule). A sequel has meanwhile come and become a blockbuster, there are various episodes released periodically by DreamWorks and most of my friends have become tired of recommending this. I finally succumbed because I wanted to watch something light and short in length. Po is a Panda in China who dreams of learning Kung Fu. His father wants him to run their family's noodle business which is the farthest thing from his mind. There is a mountain atop which there is a monastery. Here, Master Oogway, a turtle who is a Kung Fu master lives along with his disciple Shifu and five other animals Tigress, Mantis, Viper, Crane and Monkey. Oogway foresees an old student of Shifu, Leng, escaping from prison and coming back to claim the dragon scroll which is supposed to hold the secrets of being the ultimate fighter. He decides to find the next Dragon Warrior to take on Leng. The animals at the monastery are training hard as they are vying among themselves to be the next Dragon Warrior. By a strange quirk of fate, Po ends up selected as the Dragon warrior. The movie follows the adventures of Po as he is trained in the various martial arts and becomes ready for the ultimate showdown with Leng. The character of Po is very cute and his antics are endearing. I could relate to him totally as I am a big foodie myself. He is voiced brilliantly by Jack Black. Shifu, voiced by Dustin Hoffman, is a complex character burdened by his past and he stays with you after the movie has ended. There are great Zen sayings uttered by both Oogway and Shifu and I loved the way an animation movie was used to portray serious thought. My only grouse was that the climax fight between Leng and Po was a bit short. However, overall this was a very satisfying watch. 3.5 out of 5."
"blacklist-1","4","0","5","15 July 2011"," Mildly entertaining, but nothing more and ultimately boring.
","I never was taken much with Kung Fu Panda as with a lot of reviewers on here. Dreamworks have come up with some pretty impressive animations over the years though my favourites being Shrek 1 and 2. But the company just isn't in the same league as Pixar. Anyway Kung Fu Panda I found mildly enjoyable but ultimately unsatisfying. Don't get me wrong I chuckled at a few parts throughout and Jack Black puts in an incredible effort of bringing a lot of charm to Po. The cast is great including Black with Dustin Hoffman (Shifu), Angelina Jolie (Tigress), Jackie Chan (Monkey), Seth Rogen (Mantis) and Lucy Lui (Viper). They all lend good voice-overs to the characters and even the story was OK. <br/><br/>But I couldn't connect with many of the characters, the fight sequences if you can call them that were choreographed surprisingly badly, the script wasn't sharp enough with the comedy as the jokes weren't all that funny and the animation wasn't as impressive as previous animations. Despite that though it's not the worst animation I've seen and it was at least trying to entertain you and the bottom line is kids will absolutely love it anyway. But it's not a movie I would care to watch again."

","I saw a trailer and maybe a few clips of this cartoon film and thought it looked like it would be fun, I didn't see it at the cinema, but I wasn't going to miss it when I got the opportunity. Basically Po (Jack Black) is the lazy tongue-in-cheek slacker giant panda, and he is the biggest fan of Kung Fu, but his (adoptive) father the Chinese goose Zeng (Dan Fogler) wants him to keep working at his family noodle shop. After trying to watch his favourite kung fu team, the legendary Furious Five: Tigress the South China tiger (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross); Po falls into the arena and it looks like he is unintentionally chosen as the one to fulfil the ancient prophecy. Oogway the Gal√°pagos tortoise (Randall Duk Kim) says he is correct about his choice of who will become the Dragon Warrior, but Master Shifu the red panda (Dustin Hoffman) is unconvinced, but the panda does study and train alongside his idols. Po and the Furious Five are unaware that the big threat and vengeful former kung fu student to Shifu, Tai Lung the snow leopard (Ian McShane), has escaped captivity and is heading their way. Po meanwhile, despite loving being next to his idols, he also also does not think he is the correct choice as the Dragon Warrior, but after some assurance by Shifu he gains the confidence to complete training. He also gets the chance to see the legendary Dragon Scroll, and after a little while of confusion as to its meaning, being blank and reflective, he feels ready enough to face Tai Lung and defeat him. In the end, after using the secret Wuxi Finger Hold to defeat the villain leopard, Po is praised by his five fellow warriors, Shifu and all of the Valley of Peace, becoming a true kung fu master. Also starring Michael Clarke Duncan as Commander Vachir the Javan Rhinoceros, Wayne Knight as Gang Boss and Tenacious D's Kyle Gass as KG Shaw. Black is really likable as the fat endearing character, and the supporting cast all do well also, the story is easy to follow, and the computer animation is just as good as what we've seen in Shrek and Madagascar, it is suitable and enjoyable for all ages, a fun animated comedy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated the National Movie Award for Best Family Film. Worth watching!"
"Turfseer","4","0","5","20 June 2011"," Impressive animation marred by screenplay's dopey slapstick humor
","When Kung Fu Panda was released in China, it was praised not only for the production values but its faithfulness to Chinese culture. Suddenly people in China were asking, how can an American production company outdo their Chinese counterparts in creating an animated film that sends such a positive message about China and gets everything right? It's akin to the Russians who launched the first man into space, only to see the American overtake them, eventually landing a man on the moon. For many Chinese critics, Kung Fu Panda is the American 'first lunar landing' of animated martial arts movies. <br/><br/>But if the Chinese critics only had a bit of critical acumen, they could easily see there's nothing to be jealous about here. Sure there's a great amount of respect for Chinese culture seen throughout the film (down to the last Chinese character in the credits) as well as some sensational animation including the opening anime 'dream' sequence as well as that incredibly difficult feat of having tons of realistic looking confetti pour down at the Kung Fu tournament where the Kung Fu Panda, Po, is crowned Dragon Warrior. But how is Chinese culture honored by turning Chinese people into a bunch of goofy, self-effacing anthropomorphic animals? Surely kids under eight will dig it, but adults? I hardly think so.<br/><br/>While the directors of 'Panda' are firmly ensconced in the world of martial arts and action adventure films, they are neophytes when it comes to comedy. It all comes down to one silly slapstick scene after another emphasizing Po as a good natured, bumbling fool with a decided inferiority complex. Whether he fails getting up the steps into the arena for the Kung Fu tournament, or shoots himself high into the air strapped to a bunch of fireworks and then unceremoniously falling straight down and landing inside the arena, only to be crowned Dragon Warrior, the idea that we should fall in love with his lovable loser is spelled out from the beginning and repeated ad infinitum. How many times do we have to see Po chucked around like an inflatable doll whether it's by Master Shifu, Villain Tai Lung or when he finds himself caught inside the mechanical torture chamber, a device that Shifu's Dragon Warrior candidates, 'The Furious Five', in contrast, have mastered.<br/><br/>I do confess that Master Shifu's 'epiphany' in realizing that he has to train Po in a different way so that he can succeed as the dragon warrior, might have been the most clever moment in the comic arc of the film. And certainly Po's transformation from self-effacing masochist to gleeful aggressor as he embraces his 'appetite', is a welcome plot twist after being subjected to the one joke idea of Po as a bumbling clown. Yes, there's finally a method to Po's madness, as Tai Lung is unable to harness Po's new found manic energy. It's sort of like a dominant major league batter unable to master the completely unpredictable path of a knuckle ball. <br/><br/>But if we view Po as representing a grownup who still acts like a kid with the particularly bad habit of overeating, then the message 'be yourself', should fall on deaf ears. In this day where smart educators are trying to control the epidemic of childhood obesity, Po's unbridled enthusiasm for that extra cupcake, would not lead to his triumph as dragon warrior. It's a wishful conceit on the part of the directors that Po would end up victorious in his confrontation with the evil Tai Lung. The filmmakers' message to kids here is be happy even if you don't treat yourself well. And things will turn out alright even if you've made no effort to change yourself.<br/><br/>As for the action adventure aspect of 'Panda', I can't help it if it seems that the 'holy trinity' of Shifu, Oogway and Tai Lung, are pilfered straight out of the Star Wars play book. Shifu appears to be a Yoda stand-in with the wise, all-knowing tortoise Oogway, reprising the Obi-Wan Kenobi role (Oogway appears to employ his own version of 'The Force' as he is responsible for turning the slight Red Panda Master Shifu into a powerhouse). Finally, Tai Lung can go toe to toe with Darth Vadar any day as both have no problems mixing erudition with brute force.<br/><br/>A good deal of 'Panda' is taken up by one Kung Fu sequence after another and you really have to be a martial arts fan to be enamored with all those repetitious action sequences. Less bothersome (but still silly) was the decision to make Po's father, Mr. Ping, a goose. There's also the Wuxi Finger Hold that leads to Tai Lung's destruction (at first it seems like a nuclear explosion but it really is a clearing out of 'bad energy' or 'bad karma'). Finally, The 'Furious Five' are not distinct enough as characters despite the conscription of such luminaries as Angelina Jolie and Jackie Chan to perform the voice overs. <br/><br/>I think 'Kung Fu Panda' would have been a better film had the films' scenarists decided from the outset not to make Po into such a hapless buffoon. That would have also probably meant that the sentimental Mr. Ping and his love for noodles had to go too. In its present incarnation, Kung Fu Panda is certainly suitable for kids (although Tai Lung's antics might be too strong a draught for children under eight). As for adults, ignore the dopey screenplay and concentrate on the visuals and the music, which certainly deserve the accolades already garnered throughout the film community since the film's release in 2008."

","As well as being the year of superheroes, 2008 was also the year when Hollywood looked at Chinese history and culture. Two big films of that year were The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, and the Forbidden Kingdom. Hollywood was looking at the big market China and East Asia offers, and therefore the money making potential. Dreamworks animation is one of the biggest studios in the world and is on a mission to challenge Pixar for dominate. They have made some good films like Shrek, Shrek 2 and Antz. But they have made some real duds over the years, like Shark Tale, Bee Movie and The Road to El Dorado and ended an association with Aardman Animations which did lead to Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit and Chicken Run. Luckily Kung Fu Panda is a return to form.<br/><br/>In an anthropomorphic version of Ancient China, Po (Jack Black) is a young, fat lazy panda who works in his father's restaurant. His father wants Po to take over the restaurant but the Panda has a bigger ambition, he wants to be a kung fu master. Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim), the wisest and oldest of all the kung fu masters has a vision that the evil kung fu master Tai Lung (Ian McShane) is about to escape from prison and cause havoc around the valley of peace. A new dragon warrior needs to be chosen to face the snow leopard. What baffles everyone is Po is picked to be the Dragon Warrior, above the Furious Five: Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen) and Snake (Lucy Lu). Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) sets out to make sure that Po quits and a new Dragon Warrior can be picked.<br/><br/>Pixar films have a lot of heart and story behind them. The Shrek series sets out to be as entertaining for the adults as well as for children, and are filled pop-culture references. Kung Fu Panda sets out to be child friendly, family entertainment. The humour in is this film is slapstick, but it's good slapstick, and there isn't toilet humour which would be easy for films like this. They are good jokes throughout, mostly physical. There is also very good action scenes throughout, and because the film is animated, and the characters are animals, there is a much wider scope with what can happen. The directors and animation department do an excellent job in this film. The story itself is based on martial arts films, and it works well as a coming of age story. Its sends out a good message for children. They are a few Chinese proverbs during the film.<br/><br/>The animation is excellent. It is crisp throughout the action. They are a lot of details with all the character designs, including minor things like spiky fur.<br/><br/>There is a good voice cast, but for family films it shouldn't matter who is doing the voices. Children don't care and an adult isn't going to watch a film because it has a big name actor. Saying that Jack Black was perfectly casted as the lead character, and Dustin Hoffman and Michael Clarke Duncan offer good support. Ian McShane is good as always. However, casting big actors as the Furious Five offered nothing. It was the lessen known men, Seth Rogan and David Cross that were the big, particularly Cross who gave Crane a dead-pan nature. Jackie Chan should have been given more.<br/><br/>A good family film."

","This is another proof Dreamworks made the best of their ""Dream-Works"" creations. Like Up I saw another hearty treat from them when I lounged myself for a marathon last 2009 Christmas. Kung Fu Panda got all the wits, talents, comedy, excitement and a bit of drama materialized into 3d entertainment. (I loved Martial Arts movies), and from the long years I saw them in real action pace I wondered how exhilarating would it be in 3D (I saw enough in 2D). Unthinkably and funnily it materialized through Dreamworks. Their sincerity and wit mixed in the story made it a modern-classic novelty success. I must say the cast are also brilliant (especially Jack Black). Jack Black's humor got well into the character of Po. The rest are humorously awesome. You'll even forget their playing the one! I mean, I didn't realize for a moment that Monkey was Jackie Chan, and Viper was Lucy Liu. Even Dustin Hoffman's voice as far as I remember (well, most recently I was fond of a lot of his old films!) is unrecognizable. One may think the story excites only kids but it caters anyone who finds entertainment open in their heart. I remember watching ""A Bug's Life"". I've seen it in VHS for almost five times and still didn't get tired of its simple but enticing story. Although it may seem thinly inviting in cover, I assure you its action and play is superbly enough."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","0","1","6 November 2009"," Some positive sides
","As you've probably expected, Jack Black is in this as he is in most else you'll see him in... if you find him irritating elsewhere(as I do), this won't be an exception. And it won't surprise you to find that this has about as much slapstick as can be fit into a 90 minute running time. However, beyond the typically silly and childish humor, this does genuinely have things to offer, for those not sold on what I've just described. The drama is actually pretty good, and rings true. This also lets its villain be more than the usual two-dimensional, diabolical maniac that far too many stories settle for. The action is awesome, and there's a ton of it. Animation is excellent, and the design is great. Use of color and lighting is effective. The cast is marvelous, though it seems a tad wasted, with the kind of talent they got, it seems like they were given kind of few lines. Cross is a little hit and miss, and I think it's mainly the fault of the material. There is no strong language, and the violence is mild, though parts of this are intense. The DVD comes with an informational director's commentary, two featurettes, a Dreamworks Video Jukebox, trailers, a game you play by the remote, and a PSA kind of thing for the conservation of wild Pandas. I recommend this to fans of full-CGI flicks, those who made this and/or martial arts. 7/10"

","DreamWorks' Kung Fu Panda, stands firmly with the best of the best of the cute-and-cuddly animal world movies. Rivaling the animation, storytelling, and characterization of the best Pixar films, Panda will tickle the funny bone, pull on the heart strings, dazzle with its death-defying action, and prove once and for all that it's what's in the heart that really counts.<br/><br/>In ancient China there was once a Kung Fu warrior so powerful that he blinded his enemies at the mere presence of his awesome power, and even the Furious Five, a group of China's most accomplished Kung Fu warriors, bowed down to him, at least in his dreams. In reality, he is merely a lowly, overweight panda named Po (voiced by Jack Black) who works in his father's noodle shop and cannot climb a flight of stairs without becoming short of breath. In reality, it is Po who worships the Furious Five, playing with their action figures and dreaming of one day being the hero they are. When it is announced that one of the Five will be awarded the title ""Dragon Warrior,"" a recognition given to the most powerful Kung Fu Master of them all, Po heads to the Jade Temple, ascends the massive staircase but finds he is seconds late, the doors closing, shutting him out of seeing his heroes and one of the most important moments in Chinese history. When Po manages to literally drop into the arena from the sky, smack-dab into the middle of the ceremony, the ancient Master Oogway (voiced by Randall Duk Kim) chooses Po to be the Dragon Warrior! The Fabulous Five, particularly star pupil Tigress (voiced by Angelina Jolie), are outraged, but Oogway insists that Po is indeed the chosen one, and Master Shifu (voiced by Dustin Hoffman) is charged with the task of training the seemingly untrainable Panda, and all before the unstoppable enemy Tai Lung (voiced by Ian McShane) breaks free from captivity to wreak havoc on the Chinese countryside.<br/><br/>Besides the explosion of smartly and seamlessly computer-created characters and worlds that have dominated animation for the past several years, the best of a more recent vintage seem to share a similar running theme, espousing the importance of individuality, self-worth, and perseverance in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. In Cars, Lightning McQueen must discover that it isn't about being the flashiest or the fastest car on the track, or even winning the Piston Cup, but rather the importance of what's underneath the fancy tires, paint jobs, and engine: a heart. Ratatouille cooks up a theme that shows that no matter how small or insignificant one may be, no matter how reviled by others, no matter who says ""no you can't,"" a sprinkle of determination, a pinch of heart, and a bowl full of positive attitude can take you anywhere. Likewise, in Kung Fu Panda, audiences come to know Po, a lovable, overweight Panda with big dreams -- and an equally large gut. Laughed at for playing with his Kung Fu toys, working a career pushed on him by a father (a duck, oddly enough) who thinks his son can do no better than the lot he's supposedly drawn, and believed to be too clumsy, too large, too unfocused to be a great Kung Fu warrior by all but, it seems, Fate. Po nevertheless tries his hardest, and with the help and blessing of a wise old friend and his master's acceptance of the fact that ""there are no accidents,"" Po becomes not necessarily the best Kung Fu Master -- but the Master of the heart, of determination, of a never-say-die attitude that takes him to unbelievable heights, fulfills his destiny, and equally important, his dream. What makes Kung Fu Panda so special is that the film never insists that a character need drastically change in order to fulfill a dream or a prophesy or discover who they really are. Po's physique never alters -- he becomes capable of great things in spite of his waistline, the film smartly stating that it's what's inside that really matters.<br/><br/>Aside from the plainly obvious yet nevertheless heartwarming and uplifting message it espouses, Kung Fu Panda is, just as importantly, a wild, exciting, and particularly funny movie. Each character is well-scripted and interesting. While the ""Furious Five"" don't receive all that much in the way of exposition, they nevertheless manage to satiate audience appetites as lovable, endearing characters, certainly an odd mixture of creatures and each of them with unique abilities and personalities. Kung Fu Panda smartly focuses on its three primary players -- the film's title character, Po the Panda, Master Shifu, and the villainous Tai Lung. Clearly, Po is the centerpiece of the film, and his character never disappoints. One of the more endearing characters in recent memory, Po bumbles his way though the film, and the running theme of his love for food never becomes cumbersome. The film smartly integrates food into practically every sequence; Po works in his father's noodle shop; his love for a good meal is a major hindrance to his physical wherewithal -- and a detriment to his waistline; Master Shifu integrates food into Po's training regimen, exploiting his ""weakness"" for good. In fact, the gags never become old, and laughs abound throughout the film. A running joke, one that only becomes funnier every time it is incorporated into the film -- that of Po becoming short of breath and doubled over every time he must ascend to the top of the Jade Palace -- is smartly integrated into the story, and each time the joke is seen, it ends with varied comical consequences."

","An animated flick about a fat, lazy, noodle cooking Panda who becomes a Kung Fu warrior and savior of his land equals 'Kung Fu Panda'. Chandni Chowk To China is the famous or should I say infamous rip off of this movie. This flick is not only entertaining, humorous but also influential. This movie talks about a looser and how he beats all odds and becomes a winner by the strength of his will. One of the quotes in the movie - 'Yesterday is history, Tomorrow is a mystery and today is a gift, hence it is called as present' is one of the finest quotes in animation history IMO. The movie is predictable but enthralling at the same time. It never bores you which is an asset. Thus even after taking too much creative animated liberties, it still manages to create an impact.<br/><br/>The voices given in this movie is perhaps the collection of the biggest stars for an animated movie I have witnessed ever. Hoffman, Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan etc are utilized well. Jack Black lives his part as the central character. Overall, a good animated flick with its heart in its place Rating : 8/10"

Practically winning an Oscar with whatever they put out there, they don't have much going wrong for them. When Shrek was released in 2001 they stepped up the rivalry with a flurry of a picture about a green monster with feelings, and what a smash, and what a turn for the books. DreamWorks seem to have got better as this year's Monsters Vs Aliens brought in the money and last year's Kung Fu panda got budged at the Oscars by Pixar's Wall-E.<br/><br/>Despite finishing runner up Kung Fu panda is a blend of dreams mixed with desire and though fulfilling many animation traits in unlikely hero and bad appearance jokes, it has a strong likability and significant relevance for children of a young age.<br/><br/>DreamWorks best pictures usually contain a variety of animals. From Over the Hedge to Madagascar they know how to attract the right audience and thanks to some splendid visuals they generate likable characters from the computer screen.<br/><br/>Po is your stereotypical unlikely saviour being overweight, unappreciated and little common sense. Black gives Po the cocky and assertive going over making him likable enough to watch the film for its entirety. Undoubtedly Black adds that necessity humour to give the family what they're looking for from their main watch. Character mistakes, fluffs and incomprehensibility fit DreamWorks pictures down to the last CGI hair. From Alex the Lion to the funny squirrel in Over the Hedge the central character has a fault, and it is always good to see the character be an outsider and to grow.<br/><br/>The narrative for this Oscar nominated animation is a blend of wonderful action with an aspiring fantasy element. What this film has that has not been in too many other animations is a vast collection of action sequences. Words cannot comprehend how splendid the choreography for the fight sequences are in this picture. The opening 2D montage is a great setup and Po's training with Dustin Hoffman's mentor is exceptional animation working.<br/><br/>The humour of the animation flows nicely with Po being the character with the main dialogue. Shifu adds some excellent guidance comedy whilst the fantastic five are collectively substantial for the majority.<br/><br/>The added drama of Oogway is excellent. The turtle master is perhaps the most mystical protagonist to ever come from a computer. He is funny, sharp and positive. An idol some might say. And whilst he isn't in this film nearly enough he adds a heartbreaking scene to a picture that flows with excellent fighting action and enough laughs to be a worthy watch for any family"

","I have seen countless trailers for this movie on Nickelodeon when it first came out. I really thought it would be a really stupid movie.<br/><br/>I was totally wrong! I watched this movie on-demand and fell in love with it! This was the funniest, greatest, most visually stunning animated movie I have ever seen!! (Other than the always incredible Pixar movies) The movie was just so funny! Jack Black did an amazing job, and he made me laugh the whole time! This movie delivered big laughs all the way through, and balanced it out with some more serious, heart-warming scenes, which were great.<br/><br/>The animation was incredible! The landscapes were beautiful, the fight scenes were detailed and exciting, and the characters looked like you could reach into the screen and pet their fur! I loved the slow motion moments.<br/><br/>Another thing, the story was really cool and well written! It kinda seemed like a mix of a classic nickelodeon storyline and the storyline for a Japanese cartoon. It was nothing less than entertaining! Don't think its just another Hollywood mess-up full of clich√©s and fat- jokes. It's a great movie for everyone!"

","Recap: Po, a big panda and a great fan of the furious five kung fu masters is leading a quiet life with his father in their noodle shop. His dreams are not in the noodle shop, but in the kung fu temple that resides on the mountainside high above the village. When it is announced that the new Dragon Warrior shall be announced the entire village, and Po especially, is excited. And the shock is total when Po, by odd events, get chosen. Everyone, even Po himself, doubts that he is the next Dragon Warrior, but stays to train with his idols. But soon the much feared Tai Lung brakes out of his prison and threatens the entire village. And it is up to Po to stop him.<br/><br/>Comments: A typical animated family story with the main plot element being that if you really believe in yourself, you can do anything. You just got to recognize your weaknesses and use your strength. But also in the typical fashion of these animated features, it contains a great dose of both visual and common humor. Or plainly speaking, it is funny for everyone. It got just the right humor that you can see will appeal to the children but also is funny for you.<br/><br/>It is easy to like Kung Fu Panda. It is very well made, by professionals that know how to do it right. And performed by a great cast. Even though it's not their faces, the voices is important to an animated film. Jack Black is just perfect as Po. And when he is supported by Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Dustin Hoffman and Michael Clark Duncan, among others, it is a great cast.<br/><br/>Just like Po, the movie recognizes it weaknesses and uses its strengths. But if I may fault it for something is that it might be a little too much predictable. It is too focused on teaching the moral lesson that anybody can be the Dragon Warrior, you just got to believe in yourself. Sweet, but you misses out on a lot of funny opportunities that could have come with surprising plot twists. Kung Fu Panda got none, even the mythical Dragon Scroll holds no surprises. It's a little too predictable.<br/><br/>That holds it back a little. It is still good, very good. But it isn't great. Too bad. It is very likable. I wouldn't mind a sequel (if the actors would want to return).<br/><br/>7/10"

","I thought this animated film was OK, but I'm sure 10 year old kids would love it. The best part of the film is the stellar animation; definitely one of Dreamworks best efforts. The story is about a panda, Po, whom loves kung fu. He is chosen to become the dragon warrior over the fab 5. As the chosen one, he is allowed to look at the dragon scroll and is destined to defeat Tai Lung, an evil snow leopard. Po is taught kung fu by his master Shifu and the other main characters were the fab 5, the snake, tiger, mantis, monkey, and crane. The film is written to be funny, and is somewhat amusing. But the story is nothing new.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Entertaining for a kids film. I'd only recommend it if you are watching it with your kids since I think this is more a kids film."

","Bottom line is that this is a rip-off of the Darth Vader story. Even the characters resemble those from Star Wars, the Master is very Yoda-like (short, big ears), and all the rest fit nicely into the Star Wars saga. And the writer is an admitted Star Wars fanatic. I'm surprised he wasn't sued.<br/><br/>Having said that, though, this is literally a ""feel good"" movie because of the texture effects of the animation. You feel as if you could literally touch the 3D objects and they are all so wonderfully, realistically textured. Far better than anything I've seen to date. Metal pots look like real metal, ceramic like real ceramic, water and fur all seem realistic as if you could touch them. A triumph of Trompe De L'oeiel! <br/><br/>And it is fun. You will laugh out loud at the readings of the lines, the bouncing bellies, and other points though you know it's a rip-off of the Darth Vader story and you know how it will end all along.<br/><br/>Still worth seeing, though. Although be prepared that youngsters will inevitably be bouncing around practicing kung-fu kicks on each other and the furniture after watching it. <br/><br/>Bouncy, furry, feel good fun that will keep adult interest, too, because of the artistic effects."

"claudia_lampl5","7","0","1","28 April 2009"," Not the best animated movie 2008 but still enjoyable
","When I first saw the trailers for Kung Fu Panda I was more than interested: I was like on a sugar rush. I not only love pandas but I'm also learning Kung Fu myself. This was my most anticipated movie 2008. <br/><br/>All in all it was a really good movie (Dreamworks best in my opinion) it was funny and even emotional at times. The fight scenes were beautiful to look at. My favorite scene is Tai Lung's escape from prison, it is breath taking and the animation is amazing. You actually see and understand why this character is feared by all the other characters. <br/><br/>Yet, after seeing it plenty of times and thinking about it I realize that this movie is far from being really perfect, like I thought it was. Like my friends say it is. Even the reviews I read said the same. There are scenes that really leave me wondering ""Is this really how this should have been handled?"" <br/><br/>The story:<br/><br/>The story itself is nothing really original. On the other hand, what is truly original today? What really matters is how the story is told. Kung Fu Panda uses the same old routine: poor hero that is hated by those he admires, it turns out he is the chosen one (by accident of course), has to struggle to gain his masters love, masters Kung Fu in a short amount of time and defeats the ultimate evil. Everything is hunky-dory again and the hero is finally accepted. I have seen this a million times. It doesn't matter that they used animals because this kind of movies were also done with cute little animals long before Kung Fu Panda. There is nothing in this movie that lifts it above the rest in terms of the story. <br/><br/>Voice actors: <br/><br/>All the time I saw trailers (even in Germany) that praised the movie because of the voice actors. ""Wow look, we have Jacky Chan on board! This movie will be awesome!"" To bad the monkey he voices has only four or five sentences in the whole freaking movie. I actually don't care for celebrities voicing cute, little animals because I don't judge a movie or a character because of that. To be honest I get tired of it. <br/><br/>Good vs. bad¬Ö.again: <br/><br/>There are no gray shades in this movie. The good guys are good and the mean baddie is bad. I really wonder why Tai Lung is considered ""bad"". We saw him training with Shifu in the flashback but than the turtle said ""there is darkness in his heart"". Why? Is he such a bad guy because he trained so hart and loves Kung Fu? Or was he bad because he destroyed one of the training dummies in one scene? That only proved he is strong, not bad in my opinion. Sure he destroyed the village later but at this point I can understand that character. He never did something wrong in the first place. Imagine you learned all your life and than you are denied your dream. Fair? Certainly not. <br/><br/>The ending:<br/><br/>The ending was probably the most disappointing part for me. Even back in theaters I felt that something was not right and that something important was missing. Po learns Kung Fu in a short amount of time. How long was he training anyway? Days? Weeks? Even month? I don't think that the Furious Five needed that long back from their fight with Tai Lung at the bridge. Still, I liked the scene were Po learns the meaning of the dragon scroll. It is a beautiful scene that somehow touched me deep inside. But what followed is something utterly ridiculous. Po and Tai Lung fight and at one point it seems that the panda is going to loose. Yet, in the next five minutes he again fights the leopard and even wins. Why? Why did he defeat Tai Lung, a highly skilled Kung Fu fighter that spent all of his life training hard? Like I said Po's training couldn't have been that long. Yet he still owns the ""bad guy"" with a technique he learned (all by himself, mind you). Before that Tai Lungs punches didn't harm him because of his fat. Isn't that wonderful? What exactly is this movie trying to teach us at this point? ""It doesn't matter how long you train, you will get owned""? ""Being overweight will help you being a better fighter""? As a Kung Fu fighter I actually know how long it takes to master this art. My teacher always reminds us that it takes years to be a really good fighter and even after 100 years of learning Kung Fu you would still not be finished. This scene bugged me the most and should have been handled differently. <br/><br/>All in all it was a good movie. I enjoyed it but I saw it trough rose-colored glasses the first times. I had to put these glasses down to truly understand the weaker points of it and maybe even to appreciate it more. Like someone said once, you have to accept the bad points from a movie to be truly a fan of it. It was the movie I was looking forward to in 2008 but it is not my favorite animated movie from last year anymore. This spot was taken by an animated movie I actually never wanted to see in theaters (but luckily I did) about a small hero made out of metal."

","Kung Fu Panda is a pleasant surprise in a long line of poor Dreamworks movies. It's their best effort since the original Shrek, mainly because more attention is given to the story and characters. Dreamworks has several problems that keep my expectations consistently low and the big one is character development. It seems that for every film, Dreamworks tries to get the biggest names possible for roles. Because of this, characters often end up feeling soulless and flat.<br/><br/>Dreamworks hasn't dropped the big-name habit with Kung Fu Panda, but each character feels very fleshed-out and real. Even the furious five, who tend to take a back seat in the calmer moments of the film, seem to have their own ambitions and conflicts. As for the main roles, Jack Black plays an in-over-his-head, clumsy fanboy of Kung Fu quite well. Dustin Hoffman plays his role perfectly, reflecting a Kung Fu movie vibe better than anyone else in the film. As for Randall Duk Kim, he plays master Oogway, the most all-around likable character in recent memory. He is immensely wise, but takes life in a carefree, humorous manner. It's no coincidence his character has some of the funniest lines in the film. But I digress...<br/><br/>The story is a follow-your-dreams message against a fantasy Kung Fu backdrop. The comedy can be summed up as ""quality over quantity"" and works perfectly that way. The action scenes are often quite imaginative and one particular scene in the prison will have you on the edge of your seat (and the edge of disbelief). The visuals are great as always, the soundtrack is a pleasing orchestral score with a Chinese flare, and overall it's a great animated film. What a pleasant surprise from Dreamworks."
"cool-bhargava","7","0","1","23 March 2009"," Philosophical, Funny & Entertaining
","Now this is one film that that is philosophical, funny, entertaining and not just for kids but for all ages. No matter how predictable the story maybe, it still keeps you glued to your seat plus the moral ""there is no secret recipe"" makes you want to believe in your self , no matter how hopeless, obsessed or how much idealistic you are about anything. The movies is well targeted , keeping in mind that one is aiming for all age groups. There is animation for kids, there action for teenagers and there is a moral for the adults to impart to their young ones , who plan to sit beside them and watch it and also for the youth to realize that no mater what anyone says the only two things important are Focus and Perseverance. The animation is one of the best in recent times and the colors in the movie have been well chosen considering the whole ""china- look"" and the kung fu theme, these keep your eyes constantly on the screen. The humour is typical Jack Black -casual, silly and goofy which makes look like a one that has a hanger stuck inside. But one thing different about this film is that, on top of all this one really attaches himself to the characters which are all so varied. Again one of the most common things used in films is how characters of comics or fantasies are basically animals, this is done because nature itself is so varied and one can easily identify each one characteristics by the animal it is, Panda- fat hence perceived as lazy or slow, Tiger- Furious and Strong, Mantis - Small yet fast and clever , Snake- Focus, vigilance and reflexes and Monkey- Fast, flexible and active, relatively less furious. These characters take you on a journey filled with dreams ,aspirations and fun.<br/><br/>Review by Scenes <br/><br/>1) Oogway Dies<br/><br/>To me this scene marks, the point where Shifu has to take a major decision and believe not only in himself but also in his master. In is after this moment he realises that he can train Po, he only has to guide and nurture him. The scene is very well shot, specially when Oogway dies and the petals seem to take him way, this I think also represents that we all are part of mother nature and that one day we shall all turn and get mixed in to the very elements of the world- fire ,water, earth and air.<br/><br/>2) Po's training<br/><br/>This is one scene, where there is a a lot fun, it's filled with action, very attractive animation<br/><br/>and it also represents how there is always a way to make a person learn and understand, one just has to know the art of doing so. As in this case it was food, so reaching someone through the things that can motivate and makes him focus him is essential. In the end , after the training when he finally gives the dumpling to Shifu, this shows that when a person has self -actualized , he rises over petty pleasures.<br/><br/>3) Tai Lung's Escape<br/><br/>This is very well written and shot. This makes the audience feel thrilled and tense at the same moments as Lung escapes. The prison looks all the more mystical and intense by keeping the contrast low and making it go underground. <br/><br/>4) Opening Scene (Dream)<br/><br/>The opening scene begins with Po's dream, which represents the inner desire of a fan or a person who is so idealistic. The dream has people shouting ""awesome"" and the five saying to Po ,""we should hang out"". This represents that Po wanted to know 'the five' and be like them, he wanted people to like him and see him at the magnificent one.<br/><br/>5) The Dragon Scroll<br/><br/>It is Ironic how the thing perceived to be legendary and to be known to also the paranormal is just about believing in one's self. In the scene when Po gets the Dragon Scroll, it is shot is a way that that shows the it is the most prized possession one can get and only one person can have it. But the truth is anyone can achieve , if he/she wishes to believe."

I have searched the web and IMDb but cannot find any information about the Spanish actors, shouldn't they be credited as well. They did a superb job. The first scene in the ""gym"" where Po gets hit in the groin and says ""mis panditas, always gets a big laugh in Spanish language theaters where in the English version, his answer is mumbled as if it wasn't correct to make that kind of joke in a children's movie. I think the animation is fantastic and everything else, but the voices are the weakest part of the movie for me, sad after how much effort was put into the animation. If you don't speak Spanish, just listen to the tonality. The messenger duck who goes to the prison is a good example of the difference, the Spanish duck's voice is just right, the English version's is too deep.<br/><br/>Does anyone know where the info on the Spanish actors is?"
"dfranzen70","8","0","1","8 March 2009"," Audacious martial arts comedy
","Jack Black, playing completely against type, is an animated panda named Po who's been mistaken for the mystical, world-saving Dragon Warrior. Po's lack of ability - not to mention a recognizable waistline - runs counter to all that Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) teaches, and it doesn't ingratiate him with his idols, the Furious Five, either. This fast-paced comedy adventure is heavier on actual culture than pop-culture references, which is forever to its credit, and the game work by Black and Hoffman aid the rather generic storyline (fat boy must overcome odds to beat skilled ninja) immeasurably.<br/><br/>There really is plenty to like about this movie. Let's start with the casting. Jack Black is a formidable, engaging comic personality to begin with, and he infuses Po with such exuberant naivet√© and vulnerability that he's just like one of us, if we too were slovenly, belching pandas. Hoffman is also spot on as the wizened and wise Master Shifu, a red panda (although with far less red fur than you'd think), stereotypically tough on his charges but with a heart of gold. Somewhere in there, anyway. Maybe it's just a heart of emerald, or something.<br/><br/>Aside from those two marquee names, Ian McShane (of Deadwood) is the nefarious Tai Lung, a former pupil of Shifu who has just broken out of prison, stronger than ever and with revenge on his mind. Considering he's voicing a creature in a PG-rated animated film, McShane's Tai Lung is full of menace and hatred, a vile enemy who's apt to scare the youngest audience members. But I'm sure the adults can handle his intensity, if they look away every now and again.<br/><br/>Po has idolized the Furious Five all his life and desperately wants to see who will be selected by Master Oogway, Shifu's master, as the Dragon Warrior. Through an awesomely funny yet contrived circumstances, Po is chosen. ""There are no accidents,"" intones Oogway mystically. Being chosen as the Dragon Warrior doesn't gain Po any favors with Shifu's current students, the famed Furious Five - Crane (David Cross), Viper (Lucy Liu), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Monkey (Jackie Chan), and Tigress (Angelina Jolie), who thought that one of them would be The Chosen One (tm). And so Po must prove himself to the other students and to his master, who just wants him to go away.<br/><br/>One debit is that the supporting cast seems to be there for their names. Liu, Chan, Rogen, and Cross, four excellent talents, barely get any lines at all, and although Jolie gets a little more, uh, voice time, she doesn't really bring anything extra to the table. Stunt casting, is how I feel about it. Stunt casting.<br/><br/>Even so, I laughed my ass off, despite the wholesome moral of even the littlest person making a difference or something. The point is that Black made me believe in Po. When he's jumping up the side of a cliff to get a sacred scroll, so was I. When Po is eating Master Shifu out of house and home, so was I. And when Po believed in himself, so did I. This movie was full of moments that make me remember exactly why I watch movies in the first place: to laugh and to believe."

","After watching this film, I was amazed.<br/><br/>The first thing that grabbed me when the film started was the animation. It's yet another showcase of Blu-ray technology for those who have it. If you have Blu-ray, don't miss out! What rivals the animation is the plot. It's very tight, and is very fast-paced. It respects the kung fu genre and doesn't make a mockery of it. The humour is fast-paced as well, with oodles of laugh-out-loud moments. It's been a while since I laughed so much watching an animated film.<br/><br/>The voice acting is high caliber, with Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman having great chemistry together. The other voice acting is very nice as well, with Angelina Jolie adding gravitas to the proceedings as Master Tigress, and even Jackie Chan cast as Master Monkey just shows the respect that the movie has towards the kung fu genre.<br/><br/>This film will be regarded as Dreamworks Animation's first real competition for Pixar Studios. Dare I say it surpasses Pixar's current offering WALL-E based on plot structure alone. How this film rates less than WALL-E is beyond me. Are people that blinded towards the Pixar brand?"

You have to watch the movie. Some of the funniest scenes were: (At the end of the movie Shifu was lying on the ground closing his eyes so Po holds him and says: no please don't die! then Shifu answers: shut up you idiot!!! i mean dragon warrior I'm just resting so Po says: OK... and then he lye's down too after a few seconds Po says: wanna go get some food."

","Since 1998, Dreamworks has become the biggest success in movie-making history when their animation (It's not as long like their live-action films, but it's a start) After The Prince of Egypt and Shrek, Dreamworks has their ups and downs with the success and unsuccess with their movies (I think Shark Tale and Bee Movie was their lowest in ratings but I find those entertaining as much as the next one) Well...after 2003, they stop making traditional hand-drawn animation (they didn't do a lot those since Shrek was their first CGI movie ever created) and continue on with the computer animation in this century.<br/><br/>That's when summer of 2008 change all of that. And that name is Kung Fu Panda! Set long long ago in the mystical ancient china lives a giant kung fu-loving panda named Po (voiced by comedian actor Jack Black) who dreams of becoming a hero just like his idols the Furious Five; Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Monkey and Viper (voiced by Angelina Jolie, David Cross, Seth Rogen, Jackie Chan and Lucy Liu) his dream finally comes true but in an expecting way when he tries to find out which one of the members from the five will get to be name the Dragon Warrior and protect the valley of peace from a snow leopard named Tai Lung (voiced by Ian McShane) When a nine thousand year old tortoise named Oogway (who invented kung fu and is play by Randall Duk Kim) chooses Po over the well-train masters, his old friend and student, a red panda named Shifu (play by none other than the legendary great and mighty Dustin Hoffman) doesn't like the idea and tries everything that he can cook up to get rid of the panda. He later learns that he has no choice but to train the panda all that he can about kung fu and save their village once and for all before Tai Lung can destroy everything in his path.<br/><br/>The story is well thought-out, voice casting is excellent, and you be dazzle how pure and beautiful the traditional cel animation at the beginning will be compare to the regular CGI they keep through out the whole movie. Now if you saw the movie, you're probably wondering the most repeatful questions. Why is Po's dad Mr. Ping a duck and will Tai Lung ever come back alive or not? Well that's pretty simple. It doesn't explain in the movie but if your parent like Mr. Ping is a different breed or culture from you, then you will know that it's obvious that you can and might be adopted with or without explaining why. As for the Tai Lung question, well...it has been shown that the famous move called ""The Wuxi Finger Hold"" is a very dangerous and unbeatable move to avoid. Could you back alive from it? I doubt that would happen if it's already explain why you be afraid of it.<br/><br/>Overall, Kung Fu Panda gets a 10 out of a 10. There's no doubt from that! Ask anyone, they will say and I quote ""PURE AWESOMNESS!!"""

","Po dreams of a life of action where his Kung Fu skills are so awesome that they blind his opponents with their awesomeness, however during the day in his waking hours he is a mere waiter at a noodle restaurant, with his father is on the verge of telling him the secret ingredient to his famous noodle soup. However, after the legendary Kung Fu master Oogway has a vision that the Kung Fu criminal Tai Lung, is about to escape, a ceremony is held to find the new DRAGON WARRIOR! Desperate to see the outcome Panda crashes the ceremony and is inadvertently picked to become the dragon warrior of legend. However due to the fact that he knows no Kung Fu and is only successful in getting his butt kicked, it seems there is little chance of him saving the Dragon Scroll from falling into Tai Lung's hands.<br/><br/>This is a skillfully crafted movie that is very funny, touching in parts, and beautifully made. The performance from Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman and Ian McShane are all first rate and they, along with Randall Duk Kim as the awesome Master Oogway are first rate. The supporting cast of David Cross, Seth Rogen, Jackie Chan and Lucy Lui have little to do in their roles, but do it well, with Rogen yet again getting the best out of the little screen time he has. Angelina Jolie for me is the only disappointment in the film as she clearly does not have a voice that lends itself well to animation. The moments of action and tension are impeccable with a sense of danger that, for me, is more real than anything in ""The Incredibles"", with the two big stand-out scenes being the bridge showdown and the ""You are free to eat"" sequence which is clever, moving and performed with a real sense of panache by both the voice artists and the animators. The score is also brilliant and in depth and tone is very much like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" in it's subtleties and complexity.<br/><br/>Another thing that this film does not suffer from and is a problem in a number of other fight movies is that thing were a bad guy appears awesome earlier in the film, then goes cr*p right before the end fight, leading to an easy win for their opponent, like in ""The Forbidden Kingdom"". In this film, we understand how the fight goes the way it does as it is clear from everything that has gone before why things move the way they do in the universe.<br/><br/>Sadly with Wall-E Pixar have not just raised the bar but placed it on a skyscraper which then makes a film like this seem, well, mediocre, when in truth, it's not. This is a well-written and superbly directed film that is worthy of the high marks it is getting on this board.<br/><br/>Although it is my second favourite animated film of the year, there is nothing about it that is second rate.<br/><br/>You are free to enjoy the film."

","Well, Dreamworks has finally done it. Though, they have made some wonderful and boldly different animated films such as the under rated Ants, Shrek, and Monster House, this is the crowning glory. They have made a cgi animated movie that has made me rolled with laughter, cry, and doing both at the same time. But what is magnificent about this film is the perfect balance of comedy timing, drama and some of the most exhilarating actions scenes that I have seen in any kind of animation. The CGI animation is astounding. And I'm not just talking about the detail of seeing hairs on a panda, or the breath taking backdrop of ancient China. I am talking also of the subtleties of the characters expressions and performance. There are numerous references to popular movies of the past but do not let that deter you as these references are integral to the story and not just there as a wink wink nudge nudge effect. The icing on the cake though is the voice casting. Jack Black's comic timing is well, awesome! He is the star. He is the lovable but clumsy big fat panda called Po, a nerdy fan of kung fu history who idolises the famous 5 kung fu warriors. He is inadvertently and very questionably marked as the chosen one who is prophesied to defeat an evil villain much to the bewilderment of everyone. The master charged with the seemingly impossible duty of shaping Po into a kung fu fighter is delightfully voiced by the great Dustin Hoffman. There are of course many more delightful characters but it is these two that carry the film. And a note to all martial arts fans (and yeah, all you old school Shaw Bros fans included), this movie is as close as you can get to animated martial arts paradise. But this is a movie for everyone. As the main character, Po would say. This movie truly awesome."

"Boba_Fett1138","8","0","1","10 December 2008"," This movie blinded me by pure awesomeness!
","It's funny. This is actually a very simple and also very formulaic animated movie but yet its better and also more enjoyable than the average one.<br/><br/>Even though I like the Shrek movies, I also think that they are being overrated and this is perhaps the reason why I didn't watched ""Kung Fu Panda"" any sooner, since it also, like the Shrek movies, got made by DreamWorks Animation and also since I also wasn't too fond of their other animated hit ""Madagascar"". I must say that ""Kung Fu Panda"" is simply a very different movie and its good to see that DreamWorks Animation also try out some new things, despite the already huge success of the Shrek movies.<br/><br/>Of course the movie is different with its characters but also definitely with its style and humor as well. I have the feeling this movie was made more to entertain and less to impress. The movie is basically made entertaining for all age categories. There is some slapstick humor for the children and some more subtle humor to enjoy for the adults. The comedy is mostly driven by the movie its characters and the voices behind them. The movie is often more funny in the way the lines are being delivered than by its actual written dialog.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with some highly unlikely characters. Of course the premise itself alone already is of course an unlikely one; a panda who loves Kung Fu fighting. Besides that, there is a Kung Fu snake and even a Kung Fu locust, while the rest of the town seems to be inhabited by only bunnies and pigs. It are more small little things like this that makes ""Kung Fu Panda"" a real pleasure- and hilarious movie to watch.<br/><br/>It's also a really stylish movie, not just in terms of its looks but also in the way it handles its action. The Kung Fu sequences really feel like Kung Fu fight sequences, although it of course goes over-the-top with it. It provides the movie with some nicely choreographed fight sequences, that are being shot with lots of style. The movie also features the most hilarious slow-motion sequences since the original Pink Panther movies, with Peter Sellers.<br/><br/>The movie really benefits from it that its main voice is being provided by Jack Black. He really carries the movie in a great way. No wonder his name is so big on the cover, despite the fact that the movie its other voices are being provided by some much 'bigger' names. It also are some unlikely names perhaps. Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie and Jackie Chan for instance are not actors who are known for their voice-work and are perhaps also a bit too 'big' normally for jobs like this. You can also wonder though why some actors were picked for this movie. Yeah sure, it's nice that the movie has Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan and Lucy Liu involved but you can also wonder why, fore they actually add very little to the movie. Most of them also have a quite small role within the movie and Jackie Chan for instance recorded all of his voice-work for the movie in just a couple of hours, on just one day.<br/><br/>The story is kept very simple and too be honest, it's also very predictable. The movie really doesn't offer any surprises story-wise and it's a real formulaic one. Of course it also features some messages in it, like basically every animated movie feels the urge to do. Yet the movie works out so fine and entertaining. Hard to say why, the movie really shouldn't work as the way it does. Maybe because it doesn't take itself serious at all and it doesn't pretend to be more than it is. It knows it should purely entertain and not as much impress with clever written side-plots or stunning looking animated sequences. The movie is made as pure entertainment and as entertainment the movie simply does not fall short.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

What I don't understand is all the people complaining about a ""lack of substance"" and it's the ""same old children's movie"".<br/><br/>Isn't that sort of the point here, folks? Children's movies aren't supposed to be groundbreaking, cinematic, deep movies that make you think really, really hard about the meaning. They're supposed to entertain children and their parents. I think this movie does it quite nicely. I just saw this movie with a few friends on a college campus and the crowd ranged from probably 3 to 50 with the majority of the audience in the 18-25 range (it is a college campus after all) and I heard some of the loudest laughs I have ever heard at a movie while watching this. I thought the jokes were very well thought out and the punchlines delivered by the actors very nicely.<br/><br/>I think it time for people to stop with their unrealistic expectations of a children's movie. It isn't going to be as deep as you want it to be, because it is meant for a 5-10 year old to understand. The target audience is not a 35 year old who had to drag their kids to the movies, although the jokes are still very funny.<br/><br/>Well done to the actors and the graphics people on making a very enjoyable flick!"

","What is there to say about how wonderful almost all this movie is? The other commentators do such an excellent job, it's difficult to find anything more to add. For the first 9/10s or so, the movie has genuine heart to it, presenting characters with far more depth to them than found in most American films, live or animated. For the first 9/10s, there are no easy answers.<br/><br/>One of the signs of a powerful film, animated or live action, is how often the characters communicate thoughts and emotions through silence.<br/><br/>This is a film with many excellent moments of that silence.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the final moment between the triumphant hero and the beaten, wounded, defeated, bewildered, now-helpless villain, who has been repeatedly shown to be a victim of a wounded father/son relationship that damaged him into the villain he has become, leaves a bad taste in the moviegoer's mouth. The villain is shown to be so thoroughly defeated that the hero's alleged moment of triumph becomes nothing more than a petty kick the dog moment.<br/><br/>The film could have and should have ended with a moment of redemption, or at least attempted redemption.

Well, Po is a dreamy young Panda whose ambitions are to become a Kung Fu expert, maybe even a master! Being a big fat Panda and the son of a Duck running a Noodle Soup restaurant in China, Kung Fu is certainly out of question.<br/><br/>Po goes to watch the selection of the Dragon Warrior by the Kung Fu greats and finds himself in the irony of things.<br/><br/>What follows next is a series of comic events, great action from the studios of Dreamworks SKG and the final showdown between a legendary Kung Fu warrior and an ordinary Panda.<br/><br/>The comic attack is pleasant and not in your face, though one feels the cute panda getting hurt too often gets a little too slapstick ¬ñ but then this movie is about facing life as it is vs as you like it; so the hit will be brutal, no doubt.<br/><br/>Two messages that are left in your mind as you finish watching this movie: Never give up. There is no secret ingredient to true happiness.<br/><br/>Overall, you will find that there is no secret ingredient to this movie, just don't give up watching this one ¬ñ a must watch.<br/><br/>The perfect movie to watch when you really want to relax and get away from the traffic, noise and hectic work.<br/><br/>On the personal front, this movie reminded me of those underdogs in the quizzing circuits, who aren't the best at what they do, and can only look awestruck, jaws open at the Greats of Quizzing.<br/><br/>Then one fine day, one of these underdogs rise up to become a world beater. Lessons for all those eager beavers not to give up and to chase dreams.<br/><br/>There aren't any Kung Fu movies around these days, this is your best bet to revive that Golden Age...<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10"

","Well I also had no great expectations on this movie when I went to see it last night. Alltho that it came from the same production house that gave us The Incredibles, I had no high hopes for a movie about a Kung Fu fighting Panda. But man was this movie a ride, it was funny, well performed by the actors lending their voices and wow Jack Black really outdid himself this time. I can sure say that he is real match up for Eddie Murphy as Donkey in the Shrek series. This movie is awesome and I would recommend it to everyone aging from 7 till 70 and even beyond coz it is just pure amusement and fun and most importantly very entertaining and never a minute boring. I had more fun watching this movie then I had watching Indiana jones 4, which imo is also great but this one is just that little extra better."
"googooji","8","0","1","4 August 2008"," good, but not totally amazing.
","I have just seen the film today. It is quite interesting, but not totally amazing. It is very well balanced in the whole film with those little lovely jokes. But some of them are kind of familiar. The character building is kind of OK to the main roles, but fortunately, the nice action scenes help the supporting roles to be remembered also. It is just an animation, so it should not be asked to have too many theories in it for people to figure out. Being entertaining is its ultimate mission. Fortunately, it totally fulfills its task! But still, as I said it is not totally amazing since I did not really get surprised when I saw this film like when I saw ""The Incredibles"". Maybe it is just caused by the different themes these two different films have. This film is quite interesting and entertaining. So if you would like to see a lovely Panda and his lovely friends doing martial arts, then don't miss this film!"
"jennysvn11","Null","0","3","3 August 2008"," it is more than a movie.
","Personally, I think this movie indicates the relationship between the big cities of Shanghai, and Beijing. If you assume that Panda represents Beijing power which is a central, dominate power in China,and Tiger represents Shanghai which is one of main cities in China which will lead China's economic development in the future. And Shanghai is eager to become independent from Beijing power(Panda). We can regard it as kind of anti-beijing Power(Tailung), however this movie actually reflects that Shanghai can not easily get rid of the central control of beijing, which panda represents. And Thats why panda(beijing) finally become the kung fu warrior. <br/><br/>Moreover, this movie also illustrates the fact that it is sitll a long way to go for China to become the superpower worldwidely, even if China is one of the largest economies in the world right now, and it is growing dramastically. However, at the per capita basis, China is still weak compared with other big powers. <br/><br/>Last but now least, in terms of contents or the story, this movie is all Chinese stuff. However, in terms of ideas of making this movie or genre. It is all Americian stuff. From which, we can see that China is still lack of innovation in film industry."

","'Kung Fu Panda' is an absolute delight! A comic underdog story that satisfies on pretty much every level, its a film that is not only a riot for kids but a joy for adults as well. Our protagonist is Po - a big, cuddly Panda living with his surrogate father in China & working as a noodle maker/server in the Valley of Peace. This, however, is clearly not where he belongs as the big guy dreams of becoming the ultimate master of kung fu...only he has no plan or physical attributes for the same. Opportunity knocks when Po is picked by the sage-like master of the kung fu temple as the chosen one to face the evil Tai Lung. All manners of hilarity ensue as Po is put through the wringer by his trainer Shifu (the excellent Dustin Hoffman). Featuring an elaborate & spectacular prison-break sequence where the fearsome Tai Lung escapes, 'Kung Fu Panda' consistently regales with stunning artwork & detailing. The colour palette used is striking indeed and every character is imbibed with lifelike ticks and mannerisms. The voice-over work is superb. Jack Black as Po and Ian McShane as Tai Lung are particular stand outs. A family film to be enjoyed & treasured, 'Kung Fu Panda' is no.3 in my hierarchy of animated features - after 'Shrek 2' & 'The Lion King'."
"vickibabe1","10","0","2","1 August 2008"," Absolutely terrifying! Edge-of-your seat suspense and a hot, young cast of Pandas!!!
","I entered the theater not knowing what to expect, and received a first-rate, terrifying chiller. The pandas gave spectacular performances, and it would be a real shocker if one of them doesn't get nominated for an Oscar. The only problem I had with this film was that the pandas showed an alarmingly large amount of nakedness which is not suitable for young viewers. (Would it have honestly killed Dreamworks to have put some clothes on those things? Anyway, the cinematography is astounding, the directing is crisp, and the pandas made every scene believable as heck. I hope one day in the near future I can meet the fine cast of pandas who delivered such amazing performances. My favorite part was when the main girl panda karate- chopped her mother's head off. First rate chills and thrills!!!"

","The last time animated film that I saw was Ratatouille (great movie). So there has been a while since I've seen one. I'm not a big fan of animated film, but every now and then when there is one that I'm interesting in watching, I go and watch it. In this case, Kung Fu Panda. What caught my attention was the idea of a panda doing kung fu, which I though was pretty hilarious.<br/><br/>The story is about a Panda name Po (voice by Jack Black), who is a big fan of kung fu. Sometimes, he dreams fighting bad guys with the legendary Furious Five; Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper, and Monkey. One day, Po's dreams comes true when he is pick to be the Dragon Warrior because the vengeful snow leopard Tai Lung (voice by Ian McShane) breaks lose from prison. Now, he is on the way to confront the dragon warrior. Meanwhile, Po trains with the Furious Five and Master Shifu to save everybody from the evil Tai Lung. There is more to the story, I won't spoil anything.<br/><br/>From the beginning, the movie manages to keep the rhythm going until the end. The story was well told and I really liked how they explain the back story of some of the characters. What I also like about the story was that it has Chinese elements to it. It almost felt like I was watching a kung fu movie, but animated.<br/><br/>I thought the cast of the movie were the right choices and they all did a great job. Jack Black does the voice of Po, the lazy fat panda. I thought he was hilarious through the entire movie. Justin Hoffman was great as the voice of Master Shifu. He was funny, but serious at the same time. The Furious Five were voiced by Jackie Chan (Monkey), Lucy Liu (Viper), Angelina Jolie (Tigress), Seth Rogen (Mantis), and David Cross (Crane). They all were pretty hilarious too.<br/><br/>The action and visuals in the movie were amazing. I thought it was a very action-packed animated movie, which I haven't seen in years. I was really amazed by the animation though. It looks very real and it looked I was watching a live action movie.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda is one of the best animated movies I've seen in years. It was absolutely amazing. It has a great story, cast, action, and the animation was incredible. I can't wait for the next movie."

","I loveeeeeeeeeeed this movie, im a big fan of these cartoon movies but i have to say this is one of my best of the best cartoon movies including Finding Nemo , Madagascar, Shrek 1 & 2 etc.... The cast for the cartoon voices was Perfect, u could actually visualize Jack Black as a panda and Dustin Hoffman , Angeline jolie were both very successful too. The story line was perfect with the timing not too slow and not too fast , it keeps u gripped and laughing and sending u real life messages throughout the whole movie. At the end of the movie u feel great somehow with a huge smile on ur face. Panda is character that resembles a lot of how we see ourselves and the other ninja characters resemble how others accept and reject us by our appearance. Definitely a movie for all ages. A 10 plus from me !"

","Kung Fu Panda is refreshing film with tons of jokes for whole family.<br/><br/>If you liked films as is Ice age or Madagascar, than you will love Kung Fu Panda :).<br/><br/>It will surprise you and make you laugh :).<br/><br/>It's very nice film, which will not bore you.<br/><br/>Very refreshing and juicy story with tons of jokes.<br/><br/>I'm loving this film, it's like fresh wind from the snowy mountains :) LOL, yes it is :).<br/><br/>If you feeling bed, go for this film, it's the professional therapeutic film :)."
"AzaraT","7","0","1","23 July 2008"," Predictable..
","Well, I was expecting this to be a good movie, and I wasn't disappointed. It was great fun, and the comedy was not as childish as you might have though. The plot was good, but I think it was a bit to predictable, I think that might be that way so children find the movie good as well.<br/><br/>Voice acting was excellent, very very good. It is the best voice acting I've seen for a while. Animation was beautiful as expected. The battle scenes were quite OK, but nothing special indeed.<br/><br/>It is indeed a good movie, and it is very funny! But still I miss something that really makes this movie stand out. There was no ""WOW!"" moment in this movie and no surprises in the plot at all."
"paulyuanimal","10","0","2","22 July 2008"," Excellent film! I gave it a 10
","I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, and felt almost ""uplifted"". I admit, I watched the bootleg version, so I wasn't expecting too much. However, even in that version, I felt that this movie turned out to be excellent! Jack Black's portrayal of Po was awesome! (He gave him a very human quality and made us all relate to the underdog). All the characters were very unique and ""cute"". I felt that Richard Gere's character (what was his name again?? Not master... but...) was awesome!!! The animal actually resembled Richard Gere!! Anyway, I liked how this movie really converted Chinese kung fu culture into a movie! And I felt that it did it justice!! Anyway, this movie was great and I recommend it to everyone!!! Signing off... The movie that immediately comes to mind when reviewing this film is Kung Pow: The Legend of Fist, a comedy with Steve Oedekerk."
"oogleboo","10","0","2","22 July 2008"," Finally
","Finally there is an animated movie with awesome characters and a proper 'bad guy' I have hungered for a juicy good verse bad animated movie since the 90's with the lion king's 'Scar' Ever since then i have found kids movies are lacking in that much needed DARK SIDE. And without seeming sexist, i am thankful for the first female characters who actually kick butt instead of painting their nails or just there to look pretty. Kung Fu Panda keeps your interest going from start to finish and leaves you eager to see it again. Jack Black does an incredible job as Po, he is hilarious. my faith in good anime has been restored!"
"Mightyzebra","8","0","1","22 July 2008"," A fun film - good for adults and kids!
","This is the new animated film from Dreamworks and I am pleased to say that it is very good! It is so good, in fact, that some (myself included) could consider it better than any of the Shrek films! :-) <br/><br/>The main character of this film is a podgy panda called Po, who finds himself, randomly picked, to become the blessed Dragon Warrior of China and fight the evil and very powerful snow leopard Tai Lung. However, Po has a number of problems: He has never practised Kung Fu, he does not at all have the skill and energy and he is way more interested in food. However, the leader of China, an ancient tortoise, believes that this chubby panda can become the dragon warrior. This is going to take a great amount of work, both for Po and for his trainer, Shifu...<br/><br/>I like this film because of the stunning CGI, the plot, the characters and the moral of the story: You can be who you want to be if you just believe. ""Kung Fu Panda"" has its frightening and violent fighting scenes, its touching scenes and its funny scenes.<br/><br/>I recommend this to anyone who likes fun films and who like pandas - for both adults and children! Enjoy ""Kung Fu Panda""! :-)"
"oslai1998","9","0","1","20 July 2008"," Jack Black Got Our Attention!!!
","The is one of my favorite cartoon movie since Finding Nemo was released.Jack Black has put a lot of effort in his movie for example e.t.c School Of Rock,Nacho Libre and more.The IMAX Version has influence a lot of people to see this movie like etc. The Dark Knight, Meet The Robinson and more.You will only enjoy it with your family or else it won't be that entertain. It talk about fighting for a FAT PANDA (PO) to being in the Chinese best Kung Fu team. Really Ifluence me a lot<br/><br/>Overall All this movie is rated 9.6/10 for me. This is HIGHLY recommended to a group of family to see!<br/><br/>Remember , see this in IMAX and with your family."
