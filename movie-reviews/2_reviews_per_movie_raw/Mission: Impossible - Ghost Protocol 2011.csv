","This was a fun movie to watch; much better than I anticipated. Usually sequels have totally run their course by the fourth time, but not so here. In fact, this might even be the best of the Mission Impossible films.<br/><br/>It has a good mixture of interesting action scenes, suspense, drama, humor, great scenery of Venice, Italy, and fine acting. Nothing is overdone to the point of being too much and, as most MI films go, it has the normal espionage-type intrigue to figure out.<br/><br/>It's just plain entertaining. Kudos to all: the director, the actors and the special-effects and cameraman. A superb job done all around."

","The first half of the movie is probably the best action movie of the last 20 years. It is intense, well shot, engaging and absolutely stunning visually. The stunts and action set in Budapest, Moscow and Dubai and are absolutely fantastic and make the movie. Unfortunately the movie slows down greatly in the second half of the movie (or is it two thirds/one third?) in Mumbai and loses itself in some common genre traps: too much explaining stuff that doesn't make sense and some fairly 'average' action. It's a small gripe, probably half explained by the fantastic beginning of the movie. The cast is the best of the series: Jeremy Renner is a good addition, Lea Seydoux is a pretty cool villain and the female lead whose name escapes me is somebody I wish I would have seen in another movie? And Cruise is Cruise, he's the man in this saga. A great movie overall, well done Brad Bird!"

","""Mission Accomplished""...<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is the forth film in the franchise (though first not to acknowledge its place in the title) and sees Tom Cruise reprising the leading role of the globe-trotting super spy Ethan Hunt. Throughout the series Hunt has evolved from team player to lone wolf and now in Ghost Protocol he must become a true leader of a team that, for the first time, he didn't choose.<br/><br/>The film blasts off into overdrive from the minute the gates open and rarely lets up, it's one hell of a ride and there's enough action and gadgets here to please any fan of the spy film genre. The plot is fairly straightforward; the bad guy obtains the key to the ultimate weapon and plans to destroy the world with it. Hunt and his team, working without the support of the IMF, must stop him at all costs. It has enough twists and turns to keep you engaged but it never gets so complicated that you risk getting lost while you're immersed in the mind- blowing stunt sequences. One thing fans of the series will probably notice this time around is that Hunt is more 'human' when it comes to the action than he has been in most of the previous outings. Not everything goes to plan and if he gets hit or falls down it hurts. Sure he's still a super spy and can do things most mortal men would never try in a million years but the added vulnerability and consequences of those actions gone wrong lifts the film to a new level and is one of the reasons it kept me on board all the way to the end.<br/><br/>If there is anything about this film that let me down a little it was the absence of a true 'super villain' like we had in MI3. Yes there's a villain and yes he's dangerous but there is something missing. I guess I could put it this way – there is no, Joker to Hunt's Batman. In MI3 things get very personal between Hunt and Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and that jacked up the menace and intensity of the conflict to a level you'd expect to see in the ultimate villain but in M:I-GP that level of personal rivalry between protagonist and antagonist was a bit lacking. It's not that Michael Nyqvist (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) didn't deliver a good performance in the few scenes where he interacts with Cruise, it's just that there are so few of these moments that he is, in many ways, almost like another one of his own henchmen and I mistook him for other characters on a few occasions.<br/><br/>Personally I felt a greater presence and sense of danger from the female assassin, Sabine Moreau (Lea Seydoux – Robin Hood), a beautiful yet malicious woman with a cold heartless gaze, completely devoid of compassion. In my opinion she'd have made a much better leading villain, especially as her actions do personally effect one of the team, but despite this little hiccup there is certainly more than enough obstacles to keep Hunt and his team busy and the audience well and truly entertained so this is really just nit-picking on my part.<br/><br/>After the relative disappointment of the second Mission: Impossible film, first time feature director J.J. Abrams (of TV's ALIAS and Lost fame) injected some much needed heart and soul into the third installment, expertly balancing a romantic subplot with the high-octane action sequences all fans demand of such a film. Although Abrams was not going to direct the fourth film it was reassuring to see that he was still involved as a producer so I had relatively high hopes that Ghost Protocol would live up to MI3 and I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>Like MI3 before it Ghost Protocol's director's chair is filled with another first timer of sorts and like the previous chapter that 'gamble' has paid off. Although Brad Bird is not a first time feature helmer this is his first foray into the world of live action so he might not seem to be the most obvious choice but there was never any doubt from either Abrams or Cruise about his talent and potential to deliver a great film. Bird's impressive previous credits include The Iron Giant, The Incredibles and Ratatouille (the last two having won Academy Awards for best Animated Feature Film). Like Abrams, Bird has also had great success on the small screen as an executive consultant on the Simpsons and I've been a fan of his work since chancing upon Family Dog (from Spielberg's 'Amazing Stories' series) in the early 90's.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg (Paul) reprises his role as Benji Dunn from MI3, the computer whiz behind all the action. Dunn has now graduated from a 'behind the desk cameo' to a fully qualified field officer and as a result gets a much beefier role in this mission becoming one of Hunt's rogue team. Pegg's natural comedic timing and likable charm adds a much-needed element of lightheartedness to the franchise that could have easily backfired had this role been miscast.<br/><br/>Rounding out the new team are IMF agents Jane Carter (Paula Patton – Deja Vu) and William Brandt (Jeremy Renner –The Hurt Locker), and both actors deliver solid performances. Carter is as sexy as she is deadly and Patton slips between these two persona's with ease while Brandt hides a secret past allowing Renner to show a vulnerability we're not used to seeing in the roles he normally plays.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol delivers exactly the type of entertainment action fans crave and as a result it is perfect popcorn movie. If you don't enjoy this ride then entertaining you is a mission: impossible."
"cyber_dude_135","8","197","293","4 December 2011"," A fun, enjoyable action flick
","I attended a VIP screening of Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol last night at the Darling Harbor IMAX Theater in Sydney, Australia. Before the movie started, there was an introduction by Director Brad Bird, and by actor Simon Pegg where they shared how much they enjoyed making the film and shooting scenes in the IMAX format.<br/><br/>I won't get into the story too much as I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but the basic plot is that the Kremlin in Russia is bombed by a terrorist group and IMF is framed for it. Because of these actions, the president decides to activate Operation Ghost Protocol, which essentially means that the entire IMF organisation is disavowed, meaning Ethan and his team are on their own, and like the tagline says ""No Plan, No Backup, No Choice"".<br/><br/>The story I found to be quite solid. Nothing groundbreaking but enough to keep the interest of your average movie-goer.<br/><br/>The performances were generally good all around. Simon Pegg was enjoyable as Benji and Tom Cruise is always great as Ethan Hunt. Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton also gave some great performances. <br/><br/>The action sequences are where the film really shines. Not all scenes were great, I thought the bombing of the Kremlin used some very fake looking CGI which made it more humorous then intense. Also, some scenes seemed a little too far-fetched and made me think that Tom Cruise must be made of steel or something. But if you try not to look into this too much, then chances are you will enjoy the action. The fight scenes were done very well, incredibly brutal and realistic looking. The sound for this film really helped as you could almost feel every punch and kick as well as the explosions. The greatest scene for me was Ethan climbing the hotel in Dubai, the worlds most tallest building. Shot in IMAX as well, I almost felt like I was right there next to Ethan looking down from above. Huge credit goes to Tom Cruise for performing this stunt himself!<br/><br/>Overall, I found the film very enjoyable. I enjoyed it a lot more than the 2nd and 3rd entries, but the 1st has always been the best one for me. I would have given this a perfect 10 but it loses 2 points for the some of the action scenes being a bit silly and unrealistic."
"murtaza_mma","8","179","271","16 December 2011"," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The Action flick of the year, should you choose to watch it!
","The long wait is finally over as Tom Cruise finally returns to the celluloid to reprise his epic role of the enigmatic IMF agent Ethan Hunt. The brilliance of Mission: Impossible III was marred by the infamous sacking of Tom Cruise by Paramount's owner and movie mogul Sumner Redstone, who blamed Cruise's bizarre sofa-hopping TV antics, and intransigent support of Scientology for movie's relatively poor show at the box office that resulted in losses of up to £75million in revenue. The sordid incident ensured that the wait for the next installment of the franchise had to be a long one. The half a decade lull that ensued saw Cruise's career sunk to a new nadir with movies like Lions for Lambs (2007), Valkyrie (2008), and Knight and Day (2010) failing to impress at the box office, while his contemporaries and coevals continued to tumble records at the box office, attaining new heights of fame and stardom. It is indeed ironic that Cruise's most impressive show in this interim has been his well-disguised cameo in Ben Stiller's Tropic Thunder (2008) in which he plays a the foul-mouthed, hot-headed, half-bald studio executive. But, every coin has the other part that completes the picture. While the things have been going a bit rough on the professional front, Cruise's personal life has finally been witnessing a much needed sense of calmness and stability. Such stability on the personal front can often lift a person's morale providing him with a sense of rejuvenation that can help him fare well in all the facets of life. Tom Cruise's rejuvenated self is pretty much apparent in the latest installment of the MI franchise, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.<br/><br/>Ghost Protocol takes the viewer on a roller coaster of a ride from Moscow to Dubai, all the way to Mumbai, never allowing a breathing space, keeping him on the edge of the seat throughout. MI – GP is indeed the quintessential action extravaganza that the ardent lovers of the genre perpetually anticipate to devour upon in order to satiate their ever growing hunger for unremitting action and adventure. Ethan Hunt is back in all his glory with some newly added dimensions to his old daredevilry that had established him as the greatest contemporary to Ian Fleming's larger than life human incarnate. As seen with Bond in Casino Royale, the key men behind the MI franchise have made conscious efforts to make the caricature of Hunt more vulnerable to danger and crises, and hence more human. MI – GP delivers everything that an action-movie lover craves for: suspense, intrigue, passion, daredevilry, razzmatazz, and much more. The adrenaline filled action is well complemented by the dazzle of the geeky gadgets on display and it is this synergy that makes MI – GP an incredibly sublime experience. The tremendous reputation that the high octane franchise carries meant the newly appointed director Brad Bird—mostly renowned for his animation flicks The Incredibles and Ratatouille—had his work cut out for him. Brad Bird has indeed been up to the task and has lived well to the expectations of Cruise and the entire production team led by J.J. Adams, who directed the third movie of the series back in 2006. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is packed with a plethora of action sequences that includes a shootout in Budapest, an escape sequence from a Moscow Jail, a sandstorm chase in Dubai, and a classic brawl in an automated parking garage in Mumbai. However, the sequence that stands out is the one in which Tom Cruise climbs the tallest building in the world, Burj Khalifa by clinging to it from the outside using suction gloves, giving the Spiderman a run for his money. <br/><br/>After the splendidly executed siege of the Vatican in the third installment, Ethan and his IMF team are on the lookout for some classified information pertaining to a Russian extremist Kurt Hendricks, which takes their quest to Kremlin. The covert mission goes awry as their plan is sabotaged by the personal intervention of Hendricks, which turns the tables on Cruise and his team rendering them sequestered and helpless. The questionable events that unfold at Kremlin, forces the US President to invoke the Ghost Protocol leading to the disavowal of IMF. Ethan and his team, which includes the computer geek Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), agents Jane Carter (Paula Patton) and William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), despite their severe handicap are the only hope left at preventing the diabolical duo of Hendricks and his stalwart Wistrom from fulfilling their demonic mission of global destruction through a nuclear war. Simon Pegg as Benji is spot on with his persiflage, and his nonchalance adds a much needed levity to the otherwise tense plot. Paula Patton as Jane Carter is a treat to the sore eyes: her imperial gait, upright posture, predatory agility, dusky complexion, steamy mystique, athletic built, curvaceous figure, and apparent haughtiness make her an object of envy for males and females alike. Her ethereal presence undoubtedly leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. The introduction of Jeremy Renner as William Brandt adds another layer of intrigue to the plot of MI – GP. Brandt's enigmatic part allows Renner to depict a wide array of emotions that his previous roles couldn't offer. The over-hyped inclusion of veteran Indian actor Anil Kapoor in the MI – GP cast is undoubtedly movie's greatest disappointment, especially from the perspective of Indian cineastes, as the actor fails to make an impression during his ephemeral performance.<br/><br/>Overall, MI – GP has managed to raise the bar for the Action genre. Indian movie-makers, who have recently started to delve into the genre, can look to take a note or two out of MI – GP in order to iron out the usual glitches. Despite the occasional lack of coherence in the plot, MI – GP works quite well at almost all the levels and promises to be a great entertainment. 8/10<br/><br/>www.apotpourriofvestiges.com"

","YES! Finally a good no-nonsense Cruise starrer action thriller. No lovey-dovey stuff like the last one, no attempts to show how charismatic Ethan Hunt is neither are there any obvious attempts to portray how cool he is. A good old action movie with Tom Cruise doing what he is known for best: Action! <br/><br/>This one's got everything an action thriller could ask for; guns, flying fists, explosions, cool gadgets, sexy cars, the occasional unanticipated startles, hot chicks, sandstorms, jumping off tall buildings (I think jumping off tall things has always been an MI trademark), also the very much needed occasional comic relief, very occasional (which is good). And this one actually has a decent enough story!<br/><br/>Every single actor in the movie has acted brilliantly. Paula Patton was very natural in her acting, Simon Pegg (the Hot Fuzz guy) was hilarious as usual with his well timed one liners and Jeremy Renner was surprisingly good! (all 3 part of Ethan Hunts team). Not to mention Anil Kapoor!<br/><br/>Oh and Anil Kapoor! Obviously he has been the talk of town for this movie. His character in the movie and his acting (however little its duration) has been spot on and he delivers on the character. His part in the movie will certainly be one of the highlights when you leave the theater. Oh and the portrayal of Mumbai has been quite unique indeed.<br/><br/>I won't spill the beans on the story but I am sure you know the gist of it from the trailers, a certain KABOOM'ing of the Kremlin puts Ethan Hunt in a tough spot and he is being chased down by Russians for something he hasn't done, so he needs to set it right and the only way he can do that is by starring in this awesome movie.<br/><br/>All in all Ghost Protocol is hands down the best one yet from the Mission Impossible series mainly because it is different from its predecessors (thank GOD for that). It is jam packed with action from the very first scene till the last and is filled with insane stunts, gadgets, car chases (sweet ones). It is fast paced and has a good enough story with a script that will keep you in the loop. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout and not give you a seconds stare away from the screen. The audience actually went ""what? Not NOW!"" when the interval screen came up! Yes, it was THAT good.<br/><br/>Well done Cruise."

","... and he's climbing the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa of Dubai. Not only he's ascending the super-tall structure, he's going to infiltrate the Kremlin in Moscow, chase people in a huge sandstorm, and of course ... save the world. <br/><br/>The story: the IMF is accused for bombing the Kremlin, although they were not actually the perpetrators. Due to this, the IMF is shut down and ""Operation Ghost Protocol"" is launched with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), Jane Carter (Paula Patton), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), and William Brandt(Jeremy Renner), a group of 4 people being what is left of the IMF. Together, they find that there was another person behind the bombing code-named ""Cobalt"" and he has a plan to ignite a nuclear war which he believes would begin the next stage of human evolution. <br/><br/>From beginning to end, I was hooked by all the action scenes. The action scenes and all the moves are spectacular. The hand-to-hand combats, the chase scenes, the gunfights are very well-done and spectacular. The cinematography was excellent and one of the best in years. <br/><br/>Of course, the Burj Khalifa scene was the trademark of the whole film. Ethan Hunt climbing the Burj Khalifa was thrilling enough. But with a limited time, having trouble going back down, and running around and swinging around the structure just quickens the pace of the story and makes the scene very stylish. This scene is just outstanding and will be one of the highlights of the film. <br/><br/>The acting was very well-done. After 5 years of absence in the series, Tom Cruise still got his spy skills here. Paula Patton's bad girl character is very well-played. Simon Pegg as the clumsy-but-genius Benji Dunn was amazing. Jeremy Renner as the so-called-analyst-but- actually-IMF-agent William Brandt was stunning and great. The performances of the actors/actresses are very strong and convincing.<br/><br/>I love the technology used in this film. They are just unreal. A device that lets you float using magnetic attraction. A device that copies the scenery behind and displays it into a screen that allows you to deceive other people who are looking at the screen. A suit that turns into a casual jacket when you wear it inside-out. All of these devices are creatively made and looking at them being operated is just so fun. And be sure to see the amazing BMW Vision (a futuristic, BMW concept car) in a scene set in Dubai. (Also, this movie is keen about BMWs.)<br/><br/>The mission tactics are also ingenious. The tactics are very smart and are very entertaining. How they create diversions in the most unlikely situations and the scenes involving the composition of a plan keep the film in a constant quick pace and increases the suspense of the film. When they take their tactics into action, that's where they get more interesting. <br/><br/>The comedy here adds up the fun in this film. Sometimes, prolonged scenes of action are just too noisy and make the movie feel plain. But not here. The comedy scenes here act as intervals between so we don't always see long, noisy, and bloated action scenes (major trouble of ""Transformers"") and make sure that we have a perfect dose of both. <br/><br/>All these elements are very well-done and balanced and together form a suspenseful, fast-paced, and thrilling, yet funny action ride worth to experience. I think we should thank genius director Brad Bird for successfully revitalizing the movie series. This movie is just brilliant and I think it's because of Bird's genius directing. <br/><br/>Final Verdict: With fast-paced directing by Brad Bird and exciting action sequences, yet with funny moments, this movie is a thrilling ride worth to experience. <br/><br/>Rating: 10/10<br/><br/>Thanks for reading my review on ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"". I hope this review is useful."
"theycallmemrglass","8","149","229","9 December 2011"," Mission Impossible to Resurrect Franchise: Solidly Accomplished
","Saw this at a London IMAX press preview screening. <br/><br/>Clearly JJ Abram's mission impossible, should he choose to accept it, is to lead a talented team to resurrect a declining franchise and re-ignite it with renewed vigour and a very high dosage of fun and entertainment.<br/><br/>I'm glad to say, mission highly accomplished.<br/><br/>Brad Bird's first time direction of real actors (must have been a shock when they talked back at him) exhibits the same zestful energy and fun that we got from his animated films such as The Incredibles. Though not with the subtlety of his Iron Giant but this is Mission Impossible, so we cant expect that kind of subtlety here. <br/><br/>Story is outrageously OTT and thats how it should be for a franchise that violently throws plausibility out of the window with much deliberation. Not much else to say about the story apart from the fact that it can easily be translated into a Bond movie. We're in that kind of villainous territory here and it is fun.<br/><br/>The action sequences are inventive, relentless, fun and tense. Some scenes are filmed in IMAX format and when seen on an IMAX screen, are breathtaking and immersing.<br/><br/>As well as Brad Bird's energised and retro direction, the cast really sparkles too. Cruise rocks as an action stunt hero. In fact more so now than he ever did. His traditional self stunt work in this series continues to impress particular in his skyscraper scenes. There is also more playfulness and assuredness in a role he has now worn into nicely. Simon Pegg gets a delightfully big promotion to join Hunt's team making us laugh throughout the movie. And Paula Patton adds an elegant sexiness to the MI team missions. Another new addition to the team, Jeremy Renner also gels smoothly into the squad.<br/><br/>This film has drastically rejuvenated the franchise that I now highly anticipate further adventures of Ethan Hunt and his new vibrant team, equally or even more so than the next James Bond movie."

","I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise as a person and that sometimes influences my opinion on a film. Even with this point in the back of my mind I must say that Tom Cruise still got it. He's a fantastic actor who doesn't even chose to have a stunt double in MI4. I couldn't even think of trying some of these. Now to the main film. You may think it's going to be just like all the other action movies and all the other Mission: Impossible parts. But with every new part of the series it gets even more spectacular: the equipment is beyond imagination, the locations are mind blowing, the secret plans are super clever, the characters are cool and smart. Also the trailer was that good that I just wanted to see this at the movies and couldn't wait for it to be released. I haven't seen any MI film at the movies and this was definitely a great decision. The best action film in years.<br/><br/>I'm giving it a 10/10 because there was nothing I didn't like about this movie and it was worth every cent!"
"PWNYCNY","8","8","9","31 July 2018"," Excellent action movie.
","The movie presents a story that is absurd. Nevertheless, it is entertaining. The movie takes the players to many different parts of the world. How they get to these places the movie does not explain. At each place people are on the run, traps are being set, communications are tense, as the good guys and bad guys try to outwit the other. The movie is devoid of any overt political content, concentrating its attention on telling the story. Tom Cruise delivers an energetic performance that carries the movie. He is in almost every scene. The movie is never dull. For fans of action movies, this movie will not disappoint."
"ionov","4","111","190","18 December 2011"," Disappointing due to hollow screenplay, incomplete IMAX and primitive plot
","A very much expected X-Mas premiere disappointed me very much.<br/><br/>The plot is primitive, except for the first 15-20 minutes most actions are predictable with virtually no drama. Action scenes are made with some care but are very mechanical.<br/><br/>The Burj Dubai (Khalifa) was where we expected some stunning blood-freezing action and there it was the action but blood did not freeze... The Moab scene in MI2 was one -- I clearly remember the cinema audience holding their breath, and one cannot stop comparing these two...<br/><br/>Those who go to IMAX version will be specifically disappointed when they realize only few sequences are filmed in IMAX format whereas during the rest of the movie you see coarse film grain and other low-res artefacts of a regular movie format blown to a huge IMAX screen as ... Why is that, dear Tom & Brad, the budget did not allow more? <br/><br/>In the absence of real or virtual drama the whole thing becomes flat and boring -- I wish they considered hiring Robert Towne again, for example... .<br/><br/>It is not very often that some characters are so irrelevant to the plot that а movie could live without them. Despite superb acting of Mashkov (russian cop Sidorov) I really miss why this character is in the movie at all ! Take him out and... nothing changes ! <br/><br/>Paula Patton (Jane) - I am sorry but Jane is as ""persuading"" in the role of a field agent as Halle Berry was in JB Arctic story.<br/><br/>I'd better stop now and will not go into smaller details (read- spoilers). The nice side is that at least some of the sequences ARE filmed in IMAX, the opening soundtrack seems to have been re-recorded and is excellent, there are some nice areal IMAX shots of Dubai and Mumbai at night. Most of Moscow seems to have been shot in Prague or Wroclaw and does look very fake.<br/><br/>What else - Tom plays as he usually do but because of the primitive plot and dull screenplay there is nothing left to remember or comment. Knight & Day is what You remember, not MI-4.<br/><br/>I personally believe any review/rating higher that 7/10 for this one is a 90% fake (""stimulating"") whereas 8-10/10 ones are 103% such."

"moviexclusive","9","138","240","14 December 2011"," The best 'Mission Impossible' yet is also our pick for the best action film of the year
","Summer is usually the time for big loud action-packed blockbusters like this, but let us tell you right at the start that none of the bombast we've seen this summer compares to what lies in store for you in the fourth big-screen adaptation of the 1970s television series. This is hands-down the best action film this year, boasting some of the most exhilarating action ever captured in a long while. It also restores Tom Cruise's marquee value as an action star, and we dare attest that any naysayer to Cruise's ability to resurrect the franchise he almost drowned will be silenced once they see what he does on screen.<br/><br/>Indeed, the last 'Mission: Impossible"" from 'Alias' and 'Lost' creator J.J. Abrams was then easily the best of the series- though all that positive word about it couldn't quite triumph the bad press surrounding its star and producer Cruise's erratic behaviour. So 'MI3' ended up hitting a nadir for the franchise at the box-office, and Cruise's star wattage has never since fully rebounded. Trying to restore its lustre wasn't a mission impossible, but it was going to be an uphill task as well- if not only for the fact that it had to better J.J. Abrams' solid work. <br/><br/>That gamble has however paid off with an unlikely bet- choosing animation hero Brad Bird from 'The Iron Giant' and 'Ratatouille' to make his first live-action film. Bird is also of course the director of Pixar's 'The Incredibles' and there is certainly the same pulsating energy running through every frame of 'MI4'. From the very beginning, Bird places his definitive stamp on the series with a classy opening that sees IMF operative Ethan Hunt breaking out of a Russian prison. That sequence, which combines Dean Martin's 'Ain't That A Kick in the Head' with Steve McQueen's 'The Great Escape', is carefully executed and fluidly filmed- and both are signature attributes of Bird's style throughout the movie. <br/><br/>No 'Mission Impossible' film would be complete without the exotic locales, fancy gadgets and big explosions- but there is a certain finesse by which Bird assembles all these elements together into one package. So even as the setting moves from Russia to Dubai to Mumbai, even as the gadgets grow increasingly fanciful (one especially nifty device is a nifty retina-based mirror-like screen) and even as the explosions get more colossal (how about blowing up the Kremlin?), Bird never lets the adventure get frenetic, alternating confidently between quiet tension and full-blown action to keep you on the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>Riveted is what you'll be as Hunt and his team infiltrates the Kremlin to steal some classified intel about the Russian extremist Kurt Hendricks (Swedish actor Michael Nyqvist from 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'), then hoodwinks two sets of bad guys just one floor apart atop the Burj Khalifa, and then races against time literally in the crowded streets of Mumbai to stop Hendricks from precipitating an all-out nuclear war between the United States and Russia. Each elaborate setpiece is in itself a spectacle, and watching them unfold one after another quite simply takes your breath away. <br/><br/>But the most awe-inspiring- and worthy of singular mention- setpiece is Cruise's vertiginous climb up the glass exterior of the Burj Khalifa using suction gloves. It is Cruise himself way up on the 130th floor, and the authenticity of it shows in every second of Robert Elswit's breathtaking cinematography that is enough reason alone to catch this in IMAX. It is even more heart-stopping than you can imagine, not least when Cruise is left dangling with just one glove after the other malfunctions. Nothing else quite comes close to the sheer dizzying excitement of this sequence- not even the intensely gripping race- against-time climax with a good-old fistfight between Hunt and Hendricks in an automated parking garage.<br/><br/>Yes, Cruise isn't one to rest on his laurels, and at the age of 49, the extent to which he commits to perform the stunts in this movie by himself is simply amazing. When he is not attempting some death-defying move in the air or for that matter on the ground, Cruise uses his immense charisma to deliver a slickly captivating performance as the leader of the disavowed IMF. He also enjoys great chemistry with his supporting players- the tech whiz Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), the tough sexy female player Jane Carter (Paula Patton) and last but not least the enigmatic analyst William Brandt (Jeremy Renner). The banter between Cruise and Pegg is particularly enjoyable, the source of most of the movie's comic relief.<br/><br/>Their wisecracks may at first seem at odds with the gravity of the situation at stake, but ultimately these lighter moments provide a light zesty touch that ensures the movie doesn't sink into its own self- seriousness. Besides these instants of levity, the script by Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec works hard to spin an intriguing espionage plot amidst the action set-pieces that harks back to the Cold War- though admittedly their most glaring failure is in creating a more compelling villain than simply another madman bent on world destruction. They fare much better drawing links between this instalment and J.J. Abrams' last, especially in explaining Hunt's absence from duty as well as Brandt's mysterious past.<br/><br/>Still, story isn't its strong suite, and Bird knows that well enough to keep most of his cards close and revealing just enough clues to keep his audience hooked. But the 'Mission Impossible' films were always going to be about delivering thrilling blockbuster entertainment, and it is in this regard that Bird truly shines. To say that the action on display is exhilarating is merely an understatement, and let us reassure you that the extra bucks you will shell for an IMAX ticket is worth every additional cent. It is quite simply the best 'Mission Impossible' entry yet, and the best action film you'll ever see this year."

","This MI production is well executed in every regard - A top cast of talented actors, direction and editing that earn a B+, and a plot and a list of film locations that are as interesting as any in the best Bond films.<br/><br/>The only thing preventing a 9 rating are a handful of scenes that could have been cut down for the sake of keeping the overall snappy pace intact...10 minutes shorter and this film would rate a 9 (A-).<br/><br/>Great fun and edge of your seat moments are dispensed throughout the film - if in-need of a MI, Bond, or Jason Bourne fix, I highly recommend MI Ghost Protocol and a bowl of popcorn."

The film reaches a major high point when the team arrives in Dubai and from there on to the end, the entertainment level keeps getting higher.

"tylerandrewolson","8","8","10","22 June 2012"," Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol
","This fourth entry breathes fresh life into the Mission: Impossible film Franchise. The original 1996 Mission: Impossible was a promising start, and now 15 Years and four films later, I'm happy to say that Tom Cruise has still got it. This franchise - unlike most these days - has still got its edge, and isn't showing any signs of losing it or wearing down. I could definitely see another episode being produced in the future. And we have Tom Cruise to thank for all of that... because he is, after all, the man who has carried these films. Cruise has not only starred in them all, but he has also been very involved on the development and production end, receiving billing as co-producer on all installments. Overall, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL offers lighter adventure - perhaps on a bigger scale than any of the previous films - and also features a stellar ensemble cast, and some of the best popcorn entertainment in a while. <br/><br/>Now pushing 50 years old, Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt, sporting his M:I-2 Haircut, and looking as young and in shape as ever (and I say that having a staunch record of unblemished heterosexuality). He is complimented by a very well-cast team of agents. This team is better than any of the others Hunt has everworked with. It includes Chief analyst William Brandt (portrayed by rising star Jeremy Renner... nominated for an Oscar 2 consecutive years in a row for his performance in the films THE HURT LOCKER & THE TOWN IN 2010 AND 2011), a likable and easy-to-relate-to character, who also has a secret....Jane Carter, (portrayed by the lovely Paula Patton) another new addition to the team, who is tough and attractive. She's not only great as eye candy, but she serves as an integral member of the team.... Returning from his small part in M:I-3 is Benji Dunn (portrayed once again by Simon Pegg). His role has been expanded as he is now a field agent. He provides a lot of laughs and comic relief....This time around, Ethan Hunt leads this team of IMF agents as they try to prevent nuclear war with Russia.... That's the basic premise: If you want more plot details, see the movie!<br/><br/>I had the pleasure of seeing this film in I-MAX, during its limited I-MAX run, and I've gotta say - The I-MAX does very effectively enhance this movie, especially during one particular scene midway through the film, which has got everyone talking...<br/><br/>This film draws from each ""Mission"" blending the best ingredients from each one. Ghost Protocol, while lighter in tone feels closer to M:I-3 than to any of the others...Not surprising considering its scored once again by Michael Giacchino (Medal of Honor, UP, Lost, Star Trek, Super 8)and produced by M:I-3's director JJ ABRAMS (Alias, Fringe, Lost, Star Trek, Super 8). Its also like M:I-2 in that it features an unrelenting amount of action/stunt work......and Tom Cruise with long hair again...It even echoes the TV Series, because it has some of the same musical cues, and really makes the mission a TEAM EFFORT. <br/><br/>Now Ghost Protocol is less story driven/character focused than M:I-3, even if only slightly so. It really isn't too heavy on story, but does have a decent amount of character development, especially once it really gets going. I felt like we really got to know Ethan Hunt as a human being in M:I-3. This is true in Ghost Protocol, but not so much as in M:I-3. Some may say Ghost Protocol lacked a strong villain, like Owen Davien in M:I-3. While that's not necessarily a fault, I will say that it would have been nice to see another great villain coming off the heels of M:I-3. <br/><br/>One thing I love about these movies is that each one is so different from the last one. Each one has a different director, and therefore a different style, feel, and flavor. Brad Bird, known for his work in animation, helms Ghost Protocol. He was an surprising choice, considering he'd only directed animated films (The Iron Giant, The Incredibles, Ratatouille) prior to accepting, but definitely a great choice.<br/><br/>Overall, M:I-4 is great popcorn entertainment. It has going for it some really awesome action sequences - one in particular that's truly remarkable, and an outstanding ensemble cast. Its definitely worth seeing in theaters, and owning on DVD/BluRay. One of my top favorites of 2011 and perhaps my favorite Mission: Impossible when its all said and done!"
"markdroulston","9","136","248","14 December 2011"," Film of the year. Believe it.
","Is there anything Brad Bird can't do? Interest was certainly high when it was announced that the animation director would be making his live- action directing debut, choosing to tackle the third sequel in the Mission: Impossible film series. Brian De Palma's first, while it hasn't aged well, is a tense 70s style thriller, John Woo's M:I 2 increased the action but lowered the intelligence, and in 2006 JJ Abrams reinvigorated the franchise with the exciting and highly enjoyable M:I 3. But all of the previous films have been completely left in the dust by Bird's Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, a strong contender for film of the year and perhaps one of the finest action films ever made. To have pulled off such a feat is somewhat remarkable for Bird. While certainly an immensely talented director (best known for The Iron Giant and The Incredibles, two films which would rank highly on any respectable list of greatest animated movies of all time), the ability to transfer his skills to live-action on the scale of M:I – GP with such flair sets him apart as a filmmaker with immeasurable gifts, and one of the most interesting directors working today.<br/><br/>So what is it about M:I – GP that works so well? Tom Cruise, returning as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, once again puts everything he's got into his role. This franchise is clearly Cruise's baby, and the famously passionate star characteristically doesn't shy away from the more perilous stunt work. The level of commitment shown by Cruise is staggering, whether he's clinging to the side of the worlds tallest skyscraper (130 floors up!), or throwing himself down several levels of a parking garage. Say what you will about his eccentricities, but the man takes a pounding at every turn of this film only to rise and face down the next challenge, the very definition of a fearless performance. Also of note is Simon Pegg making a welcome return in a much larger role than the last film, and his wisecracks and facial silliness provide much needed relief from the relentless suspense of the narrative. The story is somewhat familiar as Ethan and his team fight to stop a psychopathic genius (Michael Nyqvist) hell bent on starting world war three, but what could be a fairly standard affair in less capable hands is turned into something wonderful by Bird.<br/><br/>As you can probably gather, the real star of M:I – GP is Brad Bird. From a dialogue perspective, the film is surprisingly minimalist, as the director boldly lets his spectacular visuals speak for themselves, rather than relying on too much exposition from his characters. Likely because of his background in animation, where the visual style comes literally from the hands of the artist, Bird's compositions and framing are so meticulously crafted, particularly in some of the more pulse- pounding set pieces. The aforementioned skyscraper climb is one of the most exciting sequences I have ever seen in a film, but it's merely one of several fantastic scenes constructed by Bird and his team. Even in the quieter moments, seemingly unimportant small gags (Hunt shedding a disguise for example) add so much to the film, like the delicate icing on a huge, many-layered cake. As welcome as a new animated film from Bird would be, the astounding quality of M:I – GP suggests that anything he chooses to do from this point will be hotly anticipated. Whether his Pixar compatriot Andrew Stanton can pull off the same transition with next year's John Carter remains to be seen, but for now, Brad Bird seems to be a director who can do no wrong.<br/><br/>tinribs27.wordpress.com"
"sarosh-mohammad","5","83","147","18 December 2011"," Weak plot and screenplay...watch it if you're easily amazed
","I'll skip the details about the plot because you'll find it elsewhere and go straight to the weaknesses.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that the Mission Impossible series has always been an out and out action series and you never could expect anything more than that. However even going in with the same expectations I must say I came out disappointed. A lot of people will tell you that the action scenes were amazing and indeed they were. I can imagine how much hard work went into making those shots possible like the one on the outside of the Burj Khalifa and the one in the parking lot in Mumbai. But there is a fine line between making amazing stunts and making improbable stunts and MI4 erred on the wrong side more often than not.<br/><br/>I can start by pointing out things that Tom Cruise did that would even make Batman proud, for example falling from a good 10 feet and hitting your face onto a steel bar and coming out unscathed. there are many more but I don't want to point them all out and look like Im nitpicking.<br/><br/>Coming to the story line I must say I actually groaned when I figured out this would be yet another ""Russia attacks US with nuclear missiles because of some misconception"" kind of a story. Also there wasn't enough detailing given which left holes the size of craters in the plot.<br/><br/>On the plus side however is the cinematography which is spectacular. From Kremlin to Dubai to Mumbai, the cities have been captured beautifully which made it feel more like a Travel show. the acting is decent too.<br/><br/>However I must say I did not watch it on an IMax screen and I guess that did take away some charm.<br/><br/>So finally I'd say you can watch it if you're easily amazed. But honestly I'd watch the Bourne series again instead of MI."

","*** Spoilers ahead ***<br/><br/>From the awful opening scene with Josh Holloway from 'Lost' hamming it up, you're wondering if this is a joke scene. Maybe it's a ""Turn off your cell phone"" bit. No, it's not, you're just at the beginning of a two hour odyssey of extreme Dell server maintenance.<br/><br/>Having read the general hyperbole for this movie, it's stunning at how thin the plot is and how pointless each action sequence is. This is not Bourne or Bond. If you're looking for a tense build up to all-out global nuclear war, you're better off checking out Wargames (1983). If you're looking for scene after scene of running and looking for codes then get in line here.<br/><br/>If you missed a car tumbling over Ethan Hunt in M:I3, don't worry, you can see it right here in M:I4. If you missed any previous server room break-ins, don't worry, M:I4 brings you not one but two of them. If you love Charlie and the Chocolate Factory you'll love the fan and the tube scene, except Jeremy Renner doesn't know he has to burp! Oh those fizzy lifting drinks are trouble!<br/><br/>This by-the-numbers action flick gets tiresome very quickly as clichéd character back story is spoon fed to us at regular intervals with plenty of explanation. A lost unrequited love? Check. Guilt over an innocent's death. Check. Said lost love resulting in a ten second girl fight? Check. Futuristic super-car that turns up out of nowhere? Check. Character that is pivotal to the first scene and then turns up later for no reason to no avail? Check. The list just goes on and on. It's all mix and match character tropes, did the writers phone this in?<br/><br/>Simon Pegg's character has no back story other than pre-existing in the M:I universe and being English.<br/><br/>Even the nemesis of the entire operation has fairly little screen time or motivation other than being evil and mad. MAD I say! It might have worked for The Incredibles, but this isn't a cartoon. This lack of realism pervades the whole film, the police never show up, America lets a missile get within 500 ft of a West coast city without launching a full on retaliatory strike. Did they not watch Dr. Strangelove?<br/><br/>The classic Mission:Impossible mask reveal is a really weak one too. Secondary bad guy turns out to be oooooOOOoooo...... the other bad guy.<br/><br/>Spy movies need to have unseen before, secret spy gadgetry right? Well hold on to your socks because M:I4 brings you GPS navigation, chain mail and magnets, a USB memory stick and a reversible jacket, casual on one side and Russian formal on the other. OK, the magic gecko gloves were new but they're no exploding chewing gum.<br/><br/>Brad Bird and J.J Abrams must have a ""Get out of jail free"" card because if anyone else produced this movie it would have been savaged. Savaged in the same way as Transformers: Dark of the Moon, yet it will find the same audience and make lots of money.<br/><br/>On leaving, someone said, ""Wow that was intense."" Intensely boring you mean. In what's supposed to be a breath of fresh air in the action genre, this feels like a boat load of the same. Cruise fans should just watch War of the Worlds again or even the first Mission: Impossible<br/><br/>A word of warning, if you see the IMAX version with the 6-minute Batman preview, it only highlights the massive drop in creativity and originality that you're about to watch."

","Some fella wants to blow up the world, or something. We don't know why, but it doesn't matter, 'cos it's that guy from the Millennium films, therefore your argument is invalid. No explanation is needed.<br/><br/>And now Tom Cruise is driving his amazing flashy Xenu 500 to some posh European cocktail party - or something - where all the doors have been unlocked by that British dweeb who used to be funny. We don't learn how he was able to do any of it, but no explanation is needed because OMG did you see that car.<br/><br/>Now let's pause briefly for another snippet of a weird, uninvolving and unresolved subplot about the wife... and straight back to Tom, faffing about on the outside of a big building, scampering around with a pair of customised washing-up gloves. Snore.<br/><br/>No-one looks to Mission Impossible films for detailed character studies, but there's literally nothing here to make us understand the motivations of the baddies or care on even a shallow level about the goodies. This is a crack-force team of androids for whom nothing seems much of a challenge. They have carbon-fibre bones which cannot break, and an electro-magnetic forcefield which repels bullets. And they're not programmed with personalities.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is a strange one. He makes these hugely narcissistic films but doesn't seem to be offering any performances worthy of his own faith in himself. He polarises public opinion and doesn't have the broad groundswell of support to be able to afford to churn out such a lazy film at this point in his career.<br/><br/>Nice sandstorm though."
"dezell6","6","41","72","2 January 2012"," MI-4: Toilet Protocol (w/ spoilers)
","Easily the worst in the MI franchise. It's movies like this that make me wonder how movies ever get made. The story is a badly regurgitated Cold War plot that requires the ghosted IMF team to stop a Russian physicist trained in special forces martial arts from acquiring nuke launch codes and starting Armageddon.<br/><br/>Apparently, since the global economic downturn, a spy organization as sophisticated as IMF doesn't have the budget for foolproof self-destruct phones anymore. The newly assembled ghost IMF team is comprised of incompetent misfits; <br/><br/>Ethan Hunt - As every super hero since Superman and Batman can tell you, personal relationships can be difficult, particularly if you choose a ""civilian"" (non-super hero) to be your spouse resulting in every demented supper villain coming after them as a means of striking at the Achilles' Heal of the super hero - Duh. Ethan was well aware of this danger since MI-1 when Kittridge used coded news footage of his aunt/uncle being arrested to uncover his location. Everything that Ethan hunt did was pointless; he saved a fellow Russian prisoner as future collateral for contacting a Russian connected with black market weapons - unnecessary and he probably could have gotten the same information from a Google search. He infiltrated the Kremlin as an aged but youthfully well built Russian general and failed to prevent a national disaster, resulting in an annoyingly re-occurring cat-and-mouse chase with Russian intelligence. Lastly, he has a wife that he can never talk to - huh?<br/><br/>Benji (the tech guy) - is plagued by delusions of grandeur and suffers from AADD. Even when presented with the opportunity to go undercover in Russia, Benji just can't manage to shut up, even though his ""English"" mutterings might just give away the fact that he is not a Russian officer. Every gadget this guy touches malfunctions. Apparently, the American version of James Bond's ""Q"" leaves much to be desired.<br/><br/>Agent Carter - after leading a failed op that resulted in the death of not only her key agent, but apparently a secret love interest, she battles with a schizophrenic bout of manic depression. When ordered not to kill potentially important sources of information what does she do - she kills the important source of information (instead of properly incapacitating them - what, no knock out serum?). During her one important mission to seduce an Indian mogul, she displays a neurosis that oddly proves sadistically seductive. The goal is to procure his coded access to his satellite in order to prevent the Russian physicist from transmitting his launch codes. Which they ultimately fail to do. But thankfully there is always a backup shutdown switch in a briefcase!<br/><br/>Agent Bradt - another failed agent whose covert mission to protect Ethan and his wife while on vacation ended in a muddled cover-up operation to disguise Ethan's wife' witness protection plan as a faked death. Otherwise, he is utterly useless in preventing his boss from being killed or bad guys getting lose.<br/><br/>Bottom line, the story was underwhelming and lacked a clever/complex layered story, and was instead a sappy, corny, comedic parody of previous MI films. So, if you are expecting hi-octane drama, nail biting suspense, and memorable acting, skip MI-4 and see War Horse."

","How on earth did this get 8.1 on IMDb? I have no idea. Admittedly I haven't paid much attention to the series since the first one, so I assume they've dropped the serious side and tried to go action-comedy, ala The Evil Dead series.<br/><br/>So where does it go wrong? Firstly, the mix of comedy and seriousness is like oil and water. A film like True Lies did it well. Even though the stakes were high, the underlying comedy was well played. In Mission:Impossible 4, there's a weird mix of slapsticky humour, and serious action film violence. It doesn't work very well. Think Mission Impossible 1 crossed with Shaun of the Dead. To be fair, there's a few funny moments, but they're few and far between.<br/><br/>The plot is awful. I have no idea why some random guy decided to start World War 3. There's some weak justification given, but it doesn't make sense. Apparently the bad guy is insane, and that's reason enough. I mean, hey! Why waste time actually telling a coherent story? The dialogue is okay, but the pacing and scenes are shambolic. There's no tension (as befitting the brink of World War 3) in the film.<br/><br/>The action is okay. There's some explosions, the tallest building in the world and so on, but it's all pretty rushed and weak. Due to the fact that the writer decided not to have a decent storyline, everything the team does seems poorly planned and haphazard. There are no twists in the story, and no suspense. Because the audience is never really sure what the stakes are, it makes for a dull film. The characters are worthless, and there's no audience connection to them.<br/><br/>Cruise is in pretty uncharismatic mode; Pegg is miscast (well, no, Pegg is a great comedy actor, but more correctly the role is miscast); Renner is dawdling in the corner; the other cast members are mostly just going through their paces. The bad guy is okay, but he's largely just an after-thought.<br/><br/>I knew that the film would suck; I was just surprised at how much it sucks. The writer was very lazy on this one. The direction is competent without being great.<br/><br/>4 out of 10. I wouldn't even bother til the DVD is off new release and in the weekly aisle at the video store."

Tom is getting a little bit older so it was a good question if he still had it in him to be a great action star since his career is still a little shaky over the past few years, he's proved once again that he's almost ageless. Despite the fact that it's the unrealistic action, in my opinion that's the best kind! I love my Tom Cruise running without losing an ounce of breath, I love throwing every element of surprise at the team and they manage to get around it, I love the explosions not effecting anyone, the car chases, the dust storms, it's just amazing! Mission Impossible 4 is a roller coaster ride of excitement and doesn't let you go.<br/><br/>Jane Carter, and newly promoted field agent Benji Dunn extract Ethan Hunt and Hunt's source Bogdan from a Moscow prison. Hunt is recruited to lead Carter and Dunn to infiltrate the secret Moscow Kremlin archives and locate files identifying Cobalt. During the mission, someone broadcasts across the IMF frequency, alerting the Russians to Hunt's team. Although Dunn and Carter escape, a bomb destroys the Kremlin, and Russian agent Sidorov arrests Hunt, suspecting him as part of the attack. But as it turns out it's a terrorist who is looking to create a nuclear war and to start man kind over again in order to create world peace.<br/><br/>I loved all the action scenes in here. The best by far is when Tom Cruise has to climb the side of this sky scrapper building with these gloves that are magnetic, you know that one of the gloves is bound to slip and it does and he manages to grab the glass at last minute with one hand. He also then has to land back onto the floor but is a little short on slack so has to get a head start, he runs and barely survives! You know they have to put a predictable outing of the plot where he will survive in there, but it's still exciting to watch. I also loved the dust storm chase scene, that was really intense and exciting to watch. Simon Pegg made for some great comic relief. Jeremy Renner made for a great action side kick that held his own next to Ethan. Paula Patton was a great tough sexy chick the group needed and added a great cat fight to the movie. My only complaint is that the villain didn't seem as developed, so I didn't feel as big a threat with him as I should have. However, Tom Cruise never disappoints with the tension and suspense of the situation. I think it's safe to say that I've fallen back in love with Tom Cruise and the rest of America can too, he may be crazy as a nut, but he never fails to entertain when giving us a great action movie. Very much the best of 2011 and I cannot wait to add it to my video collection. If this is what we have in store for the next Mission Impossible movie, I'll be the first in line.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I for the life of me cannot understand all the positive reviews for this film . The action was OK , the plot was completely non-existent as was the villain. Personally the first mission impossible remains the strongest in my view and the 3rd in the series whilst being far from a classic was passable mainly due to Phillip Seymour Hoffman (I will not mention the second for obvious reasons!!). <br/><br/>The film starts off well enough and after a high octane prison break our familiar hero Ethan Hunt is whisked into another impossible mission which results in his and his IMF team being disavowed (already sounds like familiar territory) . Along with Cruise Simon Pegg returns and is solid enough providing the comic relief they are joined by Jeremy Renner who feels vastly underused and lost in this material which is quite frankly beneath him. The gadgets become exceedingly ridiculous as the film goes they are used so much they fail to impress at all.<br/><br/>The last third of the film is where it really falls away completely and the final scene with cruise and Renner where a ludicrous sub story involving Hunt's supposedly dead wife is resolved feels so contrived and clichéd I was praying for the credits to roll.<br/><br/>Personally Mission Impossible 4 is indicative of the blockbuster action film today (barring a few eg Dark Knight), lots of product placement and ipads but zero substance and originality ."

Abrams' third installment gave the franchise a fresh kick start, this sequel doesn't shy away from using the same formula: fast-paced and original action, exotic locations, Tom Cruise working his butt off in pretty much every scene, but also adding a lot more humor than the last film had. Long story short: The recipe still works and delivers one of the greatest joyrides of the year. <br/><br/>The action scenes are excellent. Especially the entire Dubai sequence with the incredible money shot at the Burj Kalifa, the highest building in the world, is brilliant. So is the Kremlin hallway scene. But the most pleasant surprise of the film is that it is not (only) the Tom Cruise show, even though his almost death-defying efforts to deliver as many of the stunts as he can is impressive. His comrades are just as awesome. Simon Pegg delivers the clumsy, lovable humor, Paula Patton turns out to be the strongest and most beautiful female of the series and Jeremy ""I am currently in every cool film"" Renner adds exhilarating adrenaline to the mix. <br/><br/>A fast, exciting, fun thrill ride that doesn't take itself too seriously but delivers the goods in every second and gives James Bond another hard run for his money. Director Brad Bird, specialist for animated films (""The Iron Giant"", ""The Incredibles"", ""Ratatouille"" ) unexpectedly makes a strong case for being among the top action directors of the moment. Impressive. One of the action highlights of recent years."
"A_Different_Drummer","7","11","17","12 July 2016"," I could be sent back to boot camp for this review
","A MI movie starring Cruise co-produced by Abrams and directed by (OMG!) Brad Bird should be a no-brainer.<br/><br/>Literally.<br/><br/>It should be one of the best films of all time and we the viewing public should be grateful it was made in the first place.<br/><br/>But this reviewer begs to differ. Respecfully.<br/><br/>Great opening sequence. And although the remainder of the film is technically perfect and has some of the best special effects ever put on film, the rest of the movie fails to live up to the opener.<br/><br/>You ask why? Because of the mechanical plot, the lack of humanistic connection, and shallowness of the villain (who best resembles the shape-changing robot from Terminator, has only one purpose, keeps popping up, never changes tempo or facial expression and has almost no dialog).<br/><br/>Lets drill down a bit deeper to see where they went wrong? The original TV series (yes I saw them all, I am old) had a plot device which worked at the time. No matter how carefully the IMF plan was, something always went wrong at the last minute.<br/><br/>This astonishingly over-written film has taken that single trope and used it in virtually every scene!! The entire film is essentially about carefully laid plans that do not work.<br/><br/>This is not the way to build a successful film.<br/><br/>This entry, in spite of the talent behind the camera, is not one of the best in the series."

","Well... Where do we start...? The biggest thing I'd like to know, is whose idea was it to make the Mission Impossible franchise into a cheap slapstick comedy?<br/><br/>Cruise does not seem to sit well with the role of Ethan Hunt this time, in this format. He just never looks comfortable with the amateur comedy routines with his fellow cast-mates. It's just a bad, cheesy film. It lacks sophistication; no charisma; the action is B-movie-ish from start to end and style makes all the gadgets seem rather pathetic. There's just no depth to it at all.<br/><br/>After the smooth style of the third instalment, this one drops the baton spectacularly. It feels dis-jointed and never finds a flow which could pull it all together. Even the music doesn't seem to work. You're just left not caring whether this new band of jokers fail/succeed, live or die.<br/><br/>Very poor attempt."
"GoDzReaper93","7","47","92","4 December 2011"," Absolutely Amazing!
","So, this is my first ever review. IMDb readers may not believe this. A review up this early. However, I had the chance to see Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol early, thanks to a competition on the IGN website, at the IMAX theatre in Sydney Australia presented by none other than director Brad Bird and actor Simon Pegg. First off, the appearance of Bird and Pegg sparked enormous applause (with Bird accidentally tripping over stairs and Pegg stating that he almost had a coronary after watching Ghost Protocol and wishing that the audience would not have one). After Bird said to us what an immense project the film was, and that we were the first to view the film in the world (the Dubai premiere is on Thursday) the film rolled. The first thing I noticed, was Bird's directing style. It was different to the hectic camera-work/editing of J.J. Abrams (Although he did Produce the film), different to the styalized work of John Woo. In fact, Bird's directing is closer to Brian De Palma (Director of the first film). After being framed for a ""gas leak"" at the Kremlin, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), Benji (Simon Pegg) and Jane (Paula Patton) are disavowed by the American government, and the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) is shut down, leading the crew to stop a deadly terrorist from launching nuclear weapons and creating global nuclear war. To do this, they must travel to Dubai, Mumbai and Moscow. Let me just say, the movie was amazing in IMAX format. The scene showcased in the trailer with Cruise hanging off the Burj is absolutely fascinating, creating a heart pumping, adrenaline filled sequence. Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt, with Cruise being the usual awesome actor that he is. Patton not only provides eye-candy, but is also a central part to the team. Pegg's character, Benji, plays right into the actors wheelhouse, with both sharp wit and amazing sense of humor. Jeremy Renner's, Brandt, is also another awesome addition to the team, showcasing Renner's acting abilities. Individually, the actors are good, however, as a team, they function amazingly, and this is what must be done in order to achieve success in the latest Impossible Mission. Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is an amazing action film, mixed with elements from the Bond and Bourne franchises, the film does not let up for one minute. Superior to the De Palma and Woo films, on par with the action masterpiece of J.J. Abrams' threequel."

","I really don't know where to start with my criticisms of this godawful movie.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that I want to suspend my disbelief when I watch something, try as I might I failed with this one.<br/><br/>I think the main problem might be that I'm not 13 any more.<br/><br/>It seemed to me like a big budget live action version of Gerry Anderson's ""Stingray"", minus the submarine but with all the crude racial stereotypes. Whilst I loved Stingray as a child, that was the mid 60s.<br/><br/>If I have to deal with the facts here goes. The movie seems to exist in a pre-911 bubble (perhaps pre-90s bubble) where apparently an agent can have millions of dollars invested in order to break him out of prison and then have a choice about whether he wants to accept a mission.<br/><br/>There's an unfortunate death due to someone looking at their iPhone. At that point I was obviously supposed to sympathize with the murdered not the murderer but alas no.<br/><br/>The prison guards appear to be dressed in the uniforms of Russian submariners, I thought that clue might lead somewhere but apparently no, someone just felt that it makes them look more Russian.<br/><br/>I have to stop there because this post would end up being too long. There are just too many holes, too many racial stereotypes, the sleazy Indian was a particularly unpleasant highlight... but wait... there's also the cold and calculating Swede (who appears to have a German name).<br/><br/>The cast have zero on-screen chemistry, the set action pieces are nothing new, the plot is ridiculous, the script is retarded, the score is predictable, the editing is lazy and even the product placement fails.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg is good though, essentially adding the same lightness to the movie that he did in Star Trek.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise, even though he was at the center of most of the action seemed almost invisible. Like a poorly rendered CGI recreation of himself.<br/><br/>I think even if I was 13 I'd feel cheated by this very expensive stinker.<br/><br/>It's ""Team America"" without the satire.<br/><br/>I'm not a hater, I wanted to like it, I failed. I really could go on but I feel there's no point. This movie made me feel diminished as a human being. <br/><br/>The studio and Director really think we're THAT dumb. The box office takings and IMDb rating prove that we are."
"billygoat1071","9","17","29","18 December 2011"," Mission Focus
","Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol abandons all the mistakes from the first three movie and focuses to the mission. Minimizing all the broodiness and the romance. This is what Mission Impossible suppose to be. Non-stop action and more craziness. Everything is intriguing and somewhat innovating. Director, Brad Bird, shows more of his talent as a director. Tom Cruise is cool again. Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol gets it right with its storyline. It's the best part of the movie series and also the best action movie of the year.<br/><br/>The story here moderates all the drama unlike the other Mission Impossible films. The action is the real deal in these films. Throughout the movie is all about the plans, escapes, and thrills. The subplots were little, which is good. The best thing about here is the focus. Keeps things moving. Every sequences are innovating and exciting. Especially the parts in Dubai. The building climbing scene and the running through the sandstorm scene are both ridiculously exciting.<br/><br/>The actors are the gravy to the action.Tom Cruise proves that he is still an awesome actor. He makes all the action compellingly fun. Paula Patton is a good female backup. Jeremy Renner and Simon Pegg gives plenty of personality to their roles and makes a good comic relief. The villains are just being villains. The praise goes to the director, Brad Bird. His animated films proves that he can be a great action movie director. Here, he makes all of the action crazy and fun. Puts jokey feeling in some parts. And with Michael Giacchino's music score, it fits perfectly to the absurdity. The thrills are also there and always there. The CGI is good.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is a satisfying experience. They made it all simple, throw a lot of decently made action sequences. Mission Impossible doesn't really need a lot of drama. It's all about being ridiculous and focus to the mission. I don't know what else to say but this is what all action movie fans strive for. Hope we get more of these in the upcoming sequels."

","I had the opportunity to attend a special fan screening in my city's (Mumbai, India) IMAX theater where stars Tom Cruise, Paula Pattan and Anil Kapoor had come to promote the film. To put it down simply, the plot was almost linear and slightly above average. Well done script, but nothing ground breaking, much better than the 2nd and 3rd installments and I must say almost equal to the 1st. Visual appearance and sound were great, since being the IMAX format a decent job done. Sound was average and not much appealing. Action sequences were overall good, certain key scenes were absolutely well made, realistic, brutal and good fighting, and in between good humour being the icing in the cake. The film was fast and continuous, and less likely one might get bored over some 'filler' on screen, so that is a plus one. So concluding, a must watch which maybe enjoyed watched a couple of times due to the amazing IMAX shots."

","Its not a great film, period. But thanks to its adrenaline pumping  action sequences, a decent story, direction, and acting, it delivers to  its expectations. The awesome cinematography just helps the case. I  would have loved to hear better use of the MI theme though. It's a lil  boring in parts, but you're too engaged to notice these flaws. Its  without doubt the best film of the series so far.  Watch it for sure, and if you do, watch it on IMAX. I've never seen the  audience clap without any particular reason, but they did today for the  spectacular sequences shot using the IMAX camera. They left me  spellbound."
"kenlcc","1","29","55","19 December 2011"," Worst than the 2nd (crap) MI
","MI4 is NOT the best MI, the best is still the first one. Somehow something important is lacking in the 4th. It's got a lot of good scenes, but nothing too breathtaking, i think the director failed to capture the essence of MI.<br/><br/>there are at least 1 scene in every (previous) MI that makes u hold your breath, e.g. the dangling situation in the server room in the first one where a drop of sweat will make u hold on to your seat.<br/><br/>The second one (John Woo film?), don't mention, it's CRAP, so i'm going to skip it. The third one, a memorable scene is when Cruise wants to copy the bad guy's voice in the toilet. Those are really REALLY SLOW moving sequences / paced but it generates so much sweaty palms and high blood pressure for the audiences.<br/><br/>This MI however, everything moves TOO QUICKLY. The scene on the Dubai tower should be one of those moments but it just isn't. It can be made much much better if the director were to slow things down. I know they are putting some effort in this scene but it just isn't THAT exciting. And about the Kremlin, SPOILER: this is another part that can make you hold your coke so hard it'll explode, but they didn't film it right, they made it into a FXCKING COMEDY! I don't want a comedy for crying out loud, I want a proper MI! And there is just one HUGE difference in this MI that missed the WHOLE POINT of the movie. SPOILER: The good guys are the ones who should bring out a great plan to trap / fool / destroy the bad guys in the end, not the other way round. At first of course the good guys will always stay at a disadvantage, and don't know what happened, so they need to play catch up with the baddies, but they will always create a brilliant plan to catch the baddies in the end. This is what MI is ALL about. This MI, the good guys are always playing catch up until the end! I know this creates suspense and excitement but there are so many action movies out there doing JUST THAT, good guys catching bad guys, bad guys always gets away with it until at last the good guys saved the world in the last second. HOW BORING! I'm sorry to say that this really is the MOST DISAPPOINTING MI EVER FILMED, it's even worst than the 2nd one. although the 2nd one is really crap, but at least it's GOT STYLE, LOL :sweat: and creativity (kind of), this MI just copied every other action film out there and make them worst."

","Well, what the hell. I'll give this a 10. Obviously it's not a masterpiece that belongs to the top of Movie classics but as an entertaining action movie is top notch.<br/><br/>M.I. 1 was terrible despite a couple of scenes that became iconic. John Woo failed as the director of M.I.2.<br/><br/>M.I.3 was better mainly because of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman who made a great villain, but still...<br/><br/>This one is by far the best (breaking the curse of sequels) and it's more than obvious that first timer director (with actors at least) Brad Bird had only one purpose in his mind: To please the audience.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is GREAT. Many of his stunts were performed by him. Most notable the scenes at Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world at Dubai. Simon Pegg seems like a good addition and a comic relief to the action.<br/><br/>I admire the direction, plus its collaboration with the editing and the music. All the ingredients melted together nicely.<br/><br/>Almost every scene is fun. Carefully designed to please and entertain. And there is a ""connection"" with the previous installment for those who like to think the 4 (soon 5) movies as a series.<br/><br/>Overall: Get your popcorn. The movie is about to begin..."

","My husband, teenage son and I saw this movie at IMAX, and really enjoyed it. It's a classic James Bond-type flick, with an over-the-top bad guy, a gorgeous girl, a lovable sidekick and a hunky, ripped hero with amazing athletic ability.

I was on that glass with Tom, and - boy - what a ride.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise: Even more gorgeous now than when he was a boy.

"Reel_starz","8","10","16","2 January 2012"," Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is blockbuster escapism at its best
","It's been fifteen years since Tom Cruise first exploded into movie theaters as superspy Ethan Hunt, a role that catapulted him to the upper echelons of modern-day action heroes, and now, with the release of the fourth and arguably the strongest installment of the Mission: Impossible franchise, he shows little sign of slowing down. Directed with aplomb by Pixar's Brad Bird, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is smart, stylish and, most importantly, as entertaining a film as one could ever hope for.<br/><br/>Like its predecessors, Ghost Protocol boasts only the skeleton of a plot, which this time around, centers on a bombing at the Kremlin and rogue Russians attempting to incite a nuclear holocaust for reasons that are never fully explained. Still, for the most part, it's easy to follow, with the team's step-by-step goals clearly laid out, a definite improvement over the nonsensicality of the third movie, and considering that the franchise has always put story secondary to spectacle and extravagant action set pieces (which, frankly, isn't such a bad thing, at least not this time), it's hard to imagine many people coming into the theater expecting a fully fleshed-out, intricate or particularly creative plot. The only genuinely problematic moment occurs at the end with a last-minute twist that feels forced, more like a cop-out than the satisfying resolution it's no doubt supposed to be.<br/><br/>Propelled along by a pulse-pounding score from the always reliable Michael Giacchino, Ghost Protocol features almost wall-to-wall action, punctuated only occasionally by some perfunctory exposition and character development. Fortunately, Brad Bird, who is making his live-action debut here and, with animated films The Iron Giant, The Incredibles and Ratatouille already under his belt, is now four-for-four, is at the helm, and boy, does he know how to stage action. Elaborate and ambitious but grounded enough to never become laughably over-the-top or ridiculous, each sequence is executed with such pizazz and creativity, filled with such tension that the nonstop action never feels tedious or repetitive; it is relentlessly enjoyable to watch. In a refreshing change of pace, Bird opts to not rely on techniques like the shaky camera or slow motion that film-makers seem to employ all too often these days, knowing that such stylizations are more often suffocating than beneficial. Taking advantage of exotic locales like Russia, Dubai and Mumbai, as well as the IMAX format, he lets each stunt and set piece speak for itself, capturing it all with the steady hand and keen eye of someone who knows precisely what he's doing. Each M:I film has had a different director, but if there is another sequel, and there almost certainly will be, Brad Bird is more than welcome to be the first to return for seconds.<br/><br/>Brad Bird has also been gifted with a cast that is more than up for the challenges he throws at them. Tom Cruise and Simon Pegg are the only returning major cast members, though both Ving Rhames and Michelle Monaghan pop up briefly. They are joined by the white-hot Jeremy Renner as the mild-mannered but enigmatic analyst Brandt, Paula Patton, who is surprisingly convincing in the obligatory female role, and Mikael Nyqvist, who is best known for the Swedish version of The Millennium trilogy and doesn't get a whole lot to do here as the villain but is more than adequate with what he has; Tom Wilkinson and Lost's Josh Holloway also make cameo appearances. What the characters lack in depth, the actors make up for in pure charisma. It's a blast watching them do their thing.<br/><br/>Though this movie focuses more on the team as a whole instead of the usual lone-wolf approach, it's still undeniably Cruise's showcase. Despite the crow's feet and bags emerging under his eyes revealing that he is not, in fact, immune to aging, he is remarkably fit and never seems to strain even slightly while performing the high-risk stunts he has developed a reputation for, including the much-buzzed-about Burj Khalifa sequence. It's hard to believe that he's approaching fifty years old. However, age is not the only challenge the actor has faced recently. In the years since the first Mission: Impossible, the star of Tom Cruise has faded somewhat, tarnished by personal controversies and general audience indifference to traditional movie stars, and of late, his public persona has more often than not overshadowed his work. It doesn't help that, with the exception of the underrated Nazi thriller Valkyrie and a memorable turn in the otherwise unremarkable Tropic Thunder, the vast majority of his recent projects have been mediocre. It seems fitting that Ghost Protocol would be the movie where he finally regains some of his old mojo, serving as a welcome, charming reminder of why he's one of the last true superstars left in the business.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is no cinematic game-changer, but it doesn't need to be one. In turning out a film that is simply engaging, exhilarating, carefree, unadulterated fun, Brad Bird, Tom Cruise and co. can consider their mission accomplished."

He is not going to make you do anything you don't want ,you people should decide what is best for you. As for the movie,it was a top notch action thriller with great direction, cinematography, cool stunts and overall a complete package .

"Serengeti83","3","20","37","22 December 2011"," Shirley, you're kidding!
","A good director could have salvaged the barely-there script of this movie and made a tight action film, that thrills even when the plot is non-existent and the characters weak. But sadly, Tom chose the wrong director. Brad Bird may do very well with animation and comedy but an action film director he's not. He clearly cannot create the tension or pace that keeps such a film going. Threads were falling by, new plots were introduced every half an hour, and no character (including Ethan Hunt) seemed motivated or compelling enough. Not to mention, the complete absence (maybe other than the Dubai skyscraper scene) of any edge-of-the-seat action. It was all so pedestrian.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I didn't mind the movie so much. Maybe because I went with zero expectations having already heard that it's pretty bad. But the six action fanatics I went with were sorely disappointed. This film is not a patch on the first in the MI series. It seems quite ironically a ghost of it. <br/><br/>If you were going to spend money on it, don't- it's not worth it even if you're a hard-core Cruise fan (he just looks old now). If it's on the telly, still don't. Unless all other channels have mysteriously disappeared- a feat that may be pulled off by Mr.Cruise who has somehow managed to get a HUGE bunch of good reviews. Even on IMDb which is usually more credible. Was everyone being charitable in the spirit of the season, or are there other reasons? Who knows!<br/><br/>Anyway, i guess everyone has an off day. Even world-saving secret agents."

","I just watched 'M:I Ghost Protocol' this afternoon. At the end of the movie, I thought, 'are you kidding me?' The plot wasn't well written. There were too many useless characters. And the mission couldn't be considered impossible at all. <br/><br/>""There's a Russian police who was chasing Ethan, accusing him and his organization for the bomb in Moscow. IMF was shut down. Ethan and the other 3 formed a team. They had no support and less tools. They were expected to stop a nuclear war and to prove that they weren't responsible for Moscow bombing."" ---which sounds quite difficult and interesting to me. But in this movie, everything was so unbearably easy. <br/><br/>Giving Ethan's team tons of hi-tech tools, They could go in and out every building in the world. They could destroy the buildings' properties or hack their system without being noticed. Without being noticed? that sounds unbelievable, does it not. Oh, yes, villains. There were only 3 villains (fewer than Ethan's team) with, no hi-tech gadgets, even no bodyguards. They shot people but police never came. Simply unrealistic. And let's just forget about the Russian police sub-plot which was considerably meaningless. <br/><br/>M:I Ghost Protocol is somehow watchable so I gave it 5 stars. Although, in fact, I was very disappointed for it couldn't thrill me at all. If anyone asked me 'was the movie good?', I'd say---FORGET ABOUT LOGIC and it'll worth your while."

","Mission: Impossible IV, also known as Ghost Protocol, holds many variations from its forebears. First, is its name. It's edgy, unique and stands out from the previous three. Second, is Ethan's (Cruise) new team. A strong cast backs Cruise. Pegg is a massive breath of fresh air with his light, off-handed humour. He's been upgraded from desk boy to field agent. Patton is the new kick-ass beauty and Renner adds muscle that's not particularly needed because Cruise has all other areas covered. The story is unsurprisingly straight forward; Ethan and co. have a new villain (Nyqvist) to take down who's crippled the IMF (Impossible Mission Force). Nyqvist has been scripted with a bland, lifeless persona. He only shows quality of any worth the moment his life ends. Just one negative point amongst a trifle of goods. Tom is as daring as ever, toppling his stunts in II and III with one that will leave you with clenched butt-cheeks and sweaty palms. The gadgets are incredible and the set-pieces are superb. One in Dubai flowing smoothly into another taking place in a dust storm. Cruise and director Brad Bird have achieved the right level of action and emotion with this MI outing. Let's hope they stick with this formula in future films."

Seriously."
"winstoninabox","4","15","27","1 January 2012"," No premise. No plot. No villain. No point.
","More critique than review.<br/><br/>First, Ethan being rogue was the premise of the first movie. We've been there, done that. Of course it was 15 years ago, so I imagine the writers hoped that most of the target audience are too young to remember that they've paid to see this before.<br/><br/>Second, out on their own is how the M:I stories should be, so there's no point to this ghost protocol guff. The writers have no idea what ""disavowed"" means. The IMF is a secret organization, so there's no reason to shut the whole organization down unless that secrecy has been compromised. It hasn't. They would instead disavow any knowledge of Hunt as a US operative, release some cover story to the Russians that he's a nut or terrorist, offer help in finding him and try to find him themselves. Which brings it back to the first movie's story.<br/><br/>And that bring us to the ridiculous US-and-Russia-could-enter-nuclear-war story. The Cold War is over. Two superpowers, who are even permanent members on the UN Security Council together, aren't going to war because an unidentified person who has no known political affiliations and no known agenda and who MAY be a US citizen was found to have set off a bomb. It's like it should be set in 1981.<br/><br/>This story has such weak justification and gaping plot holes. That the Russians wouldn't change their nuclear weapon activation codes because it will take them weeks to discover they are missing the activation device doesn't make sense. Just to be on the safe side after a bombing like that they'd change the codes regardless of whether they knew the device was missing or not. It makes no sense not to change the codes just in case the device isn't missing. As for plot holes there is no explanation as to how Hendricks knows Hunt's team is in the IMF at the same time as he is, so his broadcasting fake messages makes no sense. And likewise there is no explanation how the attack on the secretary's car comes about. Hunt doesn't even question how the car was found so quickly! It like the writers had the idea of putting a traitor in the IMF (it would have had to have been Brandt), but then realized that that would have made the similarities to the first movie way too obvious, and so abandoned the idea but forgot to remove those elements from the plot.<br/><br/>Third, the premise is abandoned as soon as it's begun. The hook for this film is that Hunt's team are cut off from IMF resources. I'm hoping to see them doing some tricky stuff on the fly; using their skills rather than gadgets to win. So it's a big let down that they are immediately given access to a freight train car full of goodies. Sure, they only take what they can carry, but what they can carry seems to be exactly what is needed. Hunt's climb up the Burj Khalifa would have been better if it had somehow been accomplished without the gloves. His abseiling with improvised rope down the Burj Khalifa is the kind of scene this movie should have had more of.<br/><br/>And bizarrely the equipment is constantly breaking down, putting them in the gadget-less situation that they should have been in to begin with. One glove stops working and Hunt has to climb with only the other. The mask-making machine inexplicably breaks moments before finishing its mask. Maybe the writers wanted the tension of the team without gadgets, but had no idea how to write it into the script, so things stop working at the last moment. Some of it's obviously for the comedy (the phone booth, meeting the broken glove re-stuck to the window), but that just highlights that the writers are padding out the action.<br/><br/>The villain is most vanilla I've seen in a big budget movie since Star Trek (2009). He's a cliché that exists only to constantly escape so that the story can be moved to the next action beat. Die Hard was a great action movie not only because the action was good, but Hans Gruber was a great villain.<br/><br/>Last, for every well filmed action sequence there is a very weak one. The foot and car chase in the sandstorm really didn't look like it was filmed in Dubai. It didn't even look like it was filmed outside. The sandstorm had the feeling of a cost cutting measure so that location shots weren't required. And half of the finale was set in the electrical room of a TV station with a very mediocre fist fight. That it was juxtaposed with the other fight happening in that amazing looking car park just highlighted how cheap it looked. And when will scriptwriters learn that nuclear devices are not exploded at ground level where half of the blast would be wasted into the ground?<br/><br/>M:I-GP is a film that really should have had much more development given to the plotting and script. I was disinterested in the characters and the premise. That is couldn't even manage one twist except for the last minute revelation about Hunt's wife that added nothing to the previous 132 minutes of mediocrity showed to me that the writers not only have no idea how to write action, but no idea how to write the M:I story that they want to tell.<br/><br/>Verdict: Eventually you should rent it if you want to be up to date for M:I5."

","Granted I haven't seen the second one, but from what I hear that's the weakest of the series. Now I did enjoy the first Mission Impossible, it was a little confusing but still pretty fun. The third was better, making the plot simple but not meant for babies. However the fourth movie, Ghost Protocol was extremely well done.<br/><br/>The action scenes were really well done, especially the scene where Tom Cruise was scaling the building, damn to I wish I saw that in Imax. The acting was great, and it didn't take itself to seriously, I laughed quite a bit in the theater.<br/><br/>And there are several twists and turns that keep your mind working, this isn't a movie for little kids. There really isn't much else to say. Brad Bird, you have made the transition from animation to live action perfectly."
"MosHr","4","28","57","15 December 2011"," Mission imbecile. A by the numbers movie with an uninspired plot.
","Here we go again, another spy thriller action movie that looks like it was half made for the car, cellphone and tourism companies, and half made for the superstars to generate talk in the celebrity shows and magazines about how athletic they are, how cool they are, how funny they are. What it certainly doesn't seem to be made for is an interesting plot or a story or anything resembling an opinion. The plot is so generic and predictable that I doubt anyone will remember any of it in a few month's time. It's a bean counter's action movie, utterly predictable and by the numbers, designed for star-power and product placement. It's more of an insult to the movie goer than entertainment.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the other Mission Impossible movies, you'll probably enjoy it too. If you didn't like the older mission impossible movies, don't go to this movie thinking that this one's different or you'll be sorely disappointed."

","Tom Cruise pulls off a cracker with this one!<br/><br/>Ghost Protocol was perhaps the most hyped Hollywood movie this winter in India, because of the presence of Anil Kapoor - our very own bollywood superstar (he was also in Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire). While Anil Kapoor left no stone unturned to make a fool of himself in the short 5 minutes of his role, Tom Cruise left none in making this movie a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The action begins right from the first scene and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. Some sequences (like the ones shot inside Burj Khalifa, Dubai) were so brilliant that they left the whole theater audience gasping. Jeremy Renner is brilliant as Brandt and so is Paula Patton as Jane. In fact Paula looked stunning towards the end. The plot is good and there is not much to complain given the excellent acting and some really amazing shots. Hats off to Brad Bird.<br/><br/>Tom is brilliant as Ethan Hunt and his stunts were awesome as always. If Tom is not getting any younger, he is not getting any older either!

"martinrobertson300482","10","9","15","11 January 2012"," Wow! I Really wasn't expecting this to be this good!
","Yes you've read correctly. The new ""Mission impossible"" movie (number four no less) is truly worthy off a five star rating, and no-one is more surprised by this than I am.<br/><br/>What was great about going to see this recent flick, was that we really just went to see it because we were bored and it was raining. I personally didn't think the first two films were up too much but had been impressed by number three, while my colleague hadn't liked that one, so we really entered this thing with the lowest off expectations. But it turned out to be great. Gotta love when that happens. We both thought this was the best out off all off them by far, as well as being a great film in its own right.<br/><br/>""Mission impossible - Ghost protocol"" didn't feel as over the top as the previous entries, and was relying on more old fashioned thrills. Featuring fantastic stunts and original action set pieces aplenty. The gadgets featured in the film had me saying ""cool!"" throughout (Take note 007) and as a whole the film was clever, with things in it your unlikely to see anywhere else. The once great Simon Peggs presence had me thinking he'd be the annoying comedy sidekick who'd ruin the movie. But the films actually very funny too, partly due too him being here.<br/><br/>All in all this movie is thrilling, very funny and is actually so entertaining it hurts. There was me thinking the fourth film in a series is usually where it dies a death too. Just goes to show that you shouldn't always judge a book by its cover."
"ringfire211","10","8","13","14 January 2012"," One of the best action films in years!!!
","What a bloody thrilling adventure!! <br/><br/>Your assignments, and you all had better accept it, is to check out this amazing film!!!!! <br/><br/>Shoot! I'm chomping at the bit to see it again! It is without question the best in the M:I series, without question the best action film of the year, and probably the best film that I've seen since maybe 2007 - that was LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD. Maybe 2008 with EAGLE EYE. But this is way better than anything in 2009 or 2010 - no doubt about that! <br/><br/>I have to give some praise to the score by Michael Giacchino. I especially love the ""Kremlin with Anticipation"" track - the first opening bars are basically Lalo Schifrin's work from the 60s TV show. Then it transitions into the Red Army choir and finishes off with the classic 60s main theme by Lalo. All in all a great soundtrack from Giacchino! And I love his rendition of the main theme (the track called ""Light the Fuse"") - played during a very cool retro Bondian title sequence. It starts out sounding like something from THE INCREDIBLES and then transitions into the old-school 60s version by Lalo! <br/><br/>As for the movie it's basically the perfect template for what a Mission Impossible movie should be. I love MI:2 but there's no hiding that it was more of an action thriller. I'm fine with that because that film (thanks to John Woo) delivered in spades on a visceral action level! But this film really is the best of both worlds - it's both an adrenaline-soaked action movie as well as a movie that strongly homages the classic 60s TV show! Just perfect!! Even Giacchino's music reveals this. Some of the early stuff (especially at the Kremlin) could have been right out of the TV show. I half expected Martin Landau to pop up! Brad Bird (who would have thought?) really got the right combination here! DePalma somewhat missed the mark with the first one - does anyone still know what the first one was about? Very confusing. Woo thrilled me with the second one as a straight-up action movie but it's no secret it didn't feel like a M:I story. Abrams seemed to satisfy some folks with the third one but to me it seemed a bit convoluted and somehow felt like an extended episode of ALIAS or something. But this one really got it right. Very true to the spirit of the TV series (minus the crazy stunts of course but that's par for the course - like Guy Richie's SHERLOCK HOLMES) and very cinematic! Again - very surprised by Brad Bird's accomplishment here! Really... who would have thought? The guy does 3 animated films and suddenly he's given his first live feature - and it's a franchise juggernaut! Damn!! <br/><br/>P.S. The stunt sequence at the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is worth the price of admission alone. Don't pass this one up, folks! So now let's all get up, power down our computers, and in a single file head down to our local cinemas."

","Great film. The plot makes sense, the dialog is real and funny, the characters are believable even though their exploits are not. Isn't this a good recipe for a two-hour action entertainment? <br/><br/>The stunts are amazing especially the one of Tom Cruise cruising along the glass windows of the tallest building in the world. There are some really funny lines and when hit the characters actually hurt (unlike Angelina Jolie movies where she is wounded but remains unscathed even when hundreds of elite forces attack her). Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is over two hours of action that will keep you at the end of your seat, biting your nails. <br/><br/>If Tom Cruise was trying to compete with, let's say, the Bond franchise, his Ethan Hunt wins by far.<br/><br/>Funny, Cruise's Russian is better than the one of his Russian friend in the movie, acted by a Serbian actor."

","Read this review on my blog: Two Bullets, Five Zombies -> http://wp.me/p1MQmC-5h<br/><br/>From Moscow to Dubai and India, Mission: Impossible takes its viewers on a wild ride! I'm a big fan of Tom Cruise, so, naturally, I was looking forward to watching another Mission: Impossible sequel. And I wasn't the least bit disappointed.<br/><br/>The action kicks off from the very beginning; the ""bad guy"" obtains codes that can launch Russian nuclear heads/rockets, and the Kremlin in Moscow is bombed and the IMF are framed for it. Consequently, The president launches Operation Ghost Protocol; The IMF is shut down; Ethan and his team, consisting of Agent Dunn, Agent Carter and Brandt- the chief analyst, are left to their own devices. With no plan, no backup and no choice, the team's mission is to catch the ""bad guy"", stop him from destroying the world and clearing their organisation's name.<br/><br/>First things first, the stunts are amazing! The stunts were breathtaking; everything felt real and terrifying, Ethan climbs the world's tallest tower (Dubai's Burj Khalifa) and almost falls TWICE. The whole movie was action-packed, it kept me on the edge of my seat, waiting for the action to slow down, just for a while, so I could get a toilet break (didn't happen though,I had to miss a couple of minutes).<br/><br/>The characters are pretty likable. Simon Pegg was awesome as Benji (Agent Dunn), which I found humorous and a bit awkward. While Jeremy Runner played William Brandt, the IMF's chief analyst, a smart and slightly cowardly member of Hunt's team. I liked Paula Patton as agent Jane Carter best as she plays a vital role in the movie and presents a strong female figure. Jane's need to avenge a colleague's, and probable love interest, murder seems to keep her going.<br/><br/>I found the plot to be pretty solid. It involved almost everything from the authorities to hit men (more like woman) that receive payment in diamonds. The only negative comment I can make is that the plot was sort of clichéd; the hero, the villain, his sidekick and the government agent pursuing the wrong guy.<br/><br/>All in all, Mission: Impossible-Ghost Protocol is an action-packed movie that I believe brought the franchise back to life! Don't miss it!"

","It may be more than 5 years since Tom's Cruise previous installment in his action packed franchise ""Mission impossible"" but as with all good things it gets better with time! This is undoubtedly the action flick of the year and it certainly has a lot going for it. Firstly Tom Cruise is at the top of his game right now, he can act, he is adaptable he is in top physical form and this last accomplishment of his confirms that he is a true action hero even though not as macho as the ""Expendables"" star cast. Secondly, the movie delivers with the secondary characters, Ethan Hunt's new team is the greatest as yet, his new ""colleagues"" are all exceptional, Jeremy Renner is great as a man with a haunted past, Paula Patton is exuberant and convincing is her action scenes, and last but not least the returning Simon Pegg is his usual self and all the better for it. Thirdly, as you suspect the movie is inch perfect visually with the exception of the Cremlin explosion scene, and the thing that stands out is that the action is literally non stop. Additionally another interesting aspect is the mystery surrounding Ethan Hunt's personal life -not to be revealed until the very end- and last but not least the director let us indulge our selves with some very interesting cameos indeed. As for drawbacks, inevitably, there are some, the Villains come first to mind, apart from the fact that the actors are not that famous -which didn't bother me personally- they are really not very interesting, character's fault not the actors, as I couldn't find any substantial reason to ""hate"" them. Also the -bad Russians with nuclear weapons threaten to destroy all humanity- is so 80's I sincerely hope they come up with something different next time round.<br/><br/>All in all the movie is fun, entertaining, adventurous and its distractions aren't big enough to spoil a very good film indeed. 8/10"
"jon.h.ochiai","10","6","9","20 December 2011"," ""Ghost Protocol"" is Awesome
","Tom Cruise slashes a side kick at the bad guy's head in a vicious fight in the Dubai Tower Hotel room. Almost 50, Cruise is as intense as ever and looks amazing. He is strong and fit executing deadly impact in his martial arts fight sequences. Under Director Brad Bird's lead Cruise displays distinct gravitas and an unexpected sense of humor as intrepid Agent Ethan Hunt in ""Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol"". I saw ""Ghost Protocol"" in IMAX, and it is visually breathtaking. Given the technology of the medium, apparently 25 minutes of the movie was filmed in IMAX. First time live-action Director Bird (""The Incredibles"") selectively created action sequences for the effect including Cruise scaling the outside of the 160 plus story Dubai Tower, and demolition of the Kremlin. Bird generates amazing style, energy, and emotion. He and Cruise make this the best ""Mission: Impossible"". In fact ""Ghost Protocol"" may be one of the best movies of the year.<br/><br/>The scope of the movie is ambitious. Writers Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec's story spans from Budapest, Russia, Dubai to Mumbai. The plot is often flimsy with Bird throttling through with manic velocity. The character driven story elevates ""Ghost Protocol"" with powerful Cruise and charismatic Jeremy Renner as Brandt. They have an unexpected fun chemistry. In a hysterical scene following a brutal assassination attempt, Brandt argues with Ethan about how he knew that using a flare and a dead body would ensure their escape. Intensity is both their strong suits, and their effacing humor is priceless. Bird always seems to influence the right tone.<br/><br/>As ""Ghost Protocol"" opens Agent Hanaway (rugged Josh Holloway) is gunned down by assassin Sabine Moreau (seductive Lea Seydoux) in failed mission operation—compromising Russian Nuclear Launch codes. Surprisingly, Ethan (Cruise) is captive in a Russian prison. At the conclusion of the last ""Mission: Impossible"" we recalled Ethan heading off into the sunset with his new wife, Julia. What went so wrong? IMF agents Jane (stunning Paula Patton) and Benji (comically ironic Simon Pegg) brazenly break Ethan out of prison, with unforeseen complications. Jane explains the reason for his rescue, and she confesses to Ethan her relationship with Hanaway in her blown op. Turns out anarchist physicist Hendricks (evil dour Michael Nyqvist) also associated with Cobalt, is determined to use the codes to initiate global thermal nuclear war.<br/><br/>Ethan and his team accept their mission which takes them to the Kremlin to stop Hendricks—here it gets a little fuzzy. However, in a massive conspiracy the Kremlin is reduced to rubble. In IMAX this has an eerie authenticity. Ethan, Jane, and Benji become framed for this terrorist act. The President invokes Ghost Protocol on the IMF, disavowing them. Ethan has clandestine meeting with resigning IMF Secretary (great and grave Tom Wilkinson) and ""Analyst"" Brandt (acute Renner). The Secretary offers him an out, but tragedy consumes.<br/><br/>Going rogue Ethan and his team must stop Hendricks. The mysterious Brandt is seemingly more than he appears. Here Appelbaum and Nemec's character play engrosses within the twirling story threads. Renner brilliantly balances his aloofness and courage as Brandt. He more than holds his own with the fighting sequences with Cruise. He is a physical presence. Brandt shares his dark secret with Jane. Paula Patton is stellar as Jane. Patton is stunningly beautiful and strong, but also plays emotionally wounded. Cruise has a poignant moment with Patton warning her that her revenge jeopardizes their mission. His Ethan confesses that he also knows what it is to lose someone you love. Pegg as Benji seems solely comic relief. Fortunately, Bird and the writers allow Pegg to expand and transform into a hero as well. Tom Cruise leaves nothing in the tank. He is awesome. He reminds us of his commanding presence and displays a maturing sense of mortality. And Tom does almost all of his stunts. In the grand scheme this makes ""Ghost Protocol"" soar. The distinction of the hero is that he is someone, who is in action. That is Cruise here. We cheer for him whether he is careening on the Dubai Tower or trying to stop the end of the world. Brad Bird delivers us the killer visual spectacle in his hero story. I love movie heroes. I love ""Mission: Impossible- Ghost Protocol""."
"jdkraus","8","6","9","18 December 2011"," Another great installment to the M:I series
","Walking into the theater I was expecting a good action flick, even if it is the fourth installment of the Mission Impossible series. Seeing this on IMAX, I was not disappointed. The action sequences are intense, fun, and very memorable. One in particular that I cannot help but be enticed by are the scenes where Tom Cruise climbs up and runs down the Burj Khalif—the tallest building in the world. This is truly a beautifully shot and crafted sequence. I will note that for those who are afraid of heights might not want to sit through this part of the movie. <br/><br/>The plot is basic, but it has the charm and wit of the other M:I movies, such as the occasional quirky dialog and the new gadgets that IMF uses. There are even a couple of twists thrown in, especially a good one towards the end. The cast is mostly decent, but I had a problem with Michael Nyqvist as the villain. His character is not developed at all nor does he pose as a hateful bad guy. He's merely a two-dimensional figure that has a Russian accent to make him seem more menacing. Voight, Dougherty, and Hoffman were so great in the other M:1 features. This new guy though, not so much. There are also some relatively hokey scenes that deem Tom Cruise as invincible; in real life, he would have died soooo many times. Then again, Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt; he can do whatever he wants and not die or sustain serious injury.<br/><br/>Overall though, this is a great installment to Mission Impossible series. It's fun, at times intense, and has some stunning visual effects and cinematography. Note, Tom Cruise is going on 50, and he has looked the same for the last 10 years. He either has a really good makeup artist or he has some sort of secret that he's not telling us."

For the fourth time in this franchise, Cruise has shown extraordinary acting skills as playing the fearless Ethan Hunt, and of course not just him.

"rparham","7","7","11","29 January 2012"," Surprisingly strong fourth entry
","After Tom Cruise had a falling out with Paramount following his controversial behavior in mid 2000s from his ranting about psychiatrists and promotion of Scientology, it seemed somewhat unlikely that another Mission: Impossible film would be in the offing starring him. But in Hollywood, time heals all wounds, at least where there is money to be made. So, several years later, here is the fourth entry in the Mission: Impossible film franchise, subtitled Ghost Protocol. And, most interestingly, it is one of the better entries in the series, featuring some strong action set pieces that keep the audience on the edge of their seat at several key points in the proceedings.<br/><br/>Ghost Protocol finds Ethan Hunt (Cruise) in prison in Russia at the opening under mysterious circumstances. Sprung by IMF agents in a sequence that brings to mind the opening of a James Bond film, we quickly learn that Ethan is needed to help locate and stop a former Russian politician named Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) who believes that the only way to achieve global peace is to start a nuclear war and let the survivors sort out the mess. Joined by Jane Carter (Paula Patton), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and a somewhat unwilling analyst named Brandt (Jeremy Renner) who has been forced by circumstances to work with the team, Ethan finds that, after the Kremlin is bombed, that the President has ""disavowed"" the entire IMF by declaring Ghost Protocol, and they must work outside of official sanction to stop Hendricks from detonating a nuclear weapon with stolen launch codes. The trail for him takes them from Russia to Dubai and finally Mumbai as they race against the clock.<br/><br/>At first glance, you might find yourself wondering how three of the four Mission: Impossible films finds the team outside of their support system and being treated as terrorists; haven't the writers seen the other films and don't they get a little beat of wandering down the same road so many times. But, frankly, as with the ever ongoing Bond films, Mission: Impossible is less about plot and more about its action sequences, and this time the film has delivered in spades. Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol features the live-action debut of animation director Brad Bird, who helmed Pixar's hit The Incredibles, and he does a good job of assembling strong, involving set pieces that keep the audience on the edge of its seat. The standout is the middle portion, set in Dubai, where script contrivances lead Ethan to need to scale the exterior of Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building. Bird stages these scenes stunningly, really ramping up the vertigo and tension as Hunt uses glue-like gloves to climb the side of the glass windowed tower. Other set pieces in Russia and Mumbai also have zip to them, keeping the suspense solid throughout.<br/><br/>If Ghost Protocol has weaknesses, they are largely in the development of the villains. Hendricks and his henchman Wistrom (Samuli Edelmann) have the basic makings of some nice megalomaniacal villains, but suffer from limited screen time and some very limited depth. They serve the plot's basic need for villains, but don't really come across as the kind of visceral bad guys you love to hate. As much as the nuclear launch codes Ethan and team are chasing, they fill the standard Hitchcock position of the MacGuffin, and don't make a lasting impression on the audience.<br/><br/>Back for his fourth turn as Ethan, Cruise is dependable as always, giving Hunt that reserved, slightly above it all attitude that keeps him largely cool under fire, but he does have his moments when the guard is lowered and you can see him concerned about the stakes they are fighting for. Paula Patton is attractive in the role of Jane, who the script gives some more personal drive in the search for Hendricks and his cronies, Pegg delivers some welcome comic relief in the role of Benji and Renner, who has been rumored to be groomed for future Mission: Impossible films if Cruise steps down, holds his own in the action sequences, as well as providing the audience with a semi-outsider to empathize with as the circumstances consistently get higher and higher for the characters past what he is used to dealing with in his role as an analyst thrown into the action.<br/><br/>For the most part, Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol delivers a strong, fast, popcorn munching action film that provides thrills without turning into an over-edited explosion fest that you often get from a film directed by Michael Bay. If this is what the Mission: Impossible franchise can deliver on its fourth outing, then it may have plenty of entries for years to come."
"santosh-moodle","8","7","11","23 January 2012"," great movie
","Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol is very great movie. Tom Cruise acting is unbelievable.Ghost Protocol takes the viewer on a roller coaster of a ride from Moscow to Dubai, all the way to Mumbai, never allowing a breathing space, keeping him on the edge of the seat throughout. MI – GP is indeed the quintessential action extravaganza that the ardent lovers of the genre perpetually anticipate to devour upon in order to satiate their ever growing hunger for unremitting action and adventure. Ethan Hunt is back in all his glory with some newly added dimensions to his old daredevilry that had established him as the greatest contemporary to Ian Fleming's larger than life human incarnate. As seen with Bond in Casino Royale, the key men behind the MI franchise have made conscious efforts to make the caricature of Hunt more vulnerable to danger and crises, and hence more human. MI – GP delivers everything that an action-movie lover craves for: suspense, intrigue, passion, daredevilry, razzmatazz, and much more. The adrenaline filled action is well complemented by the dazzle of the geeky gadgets on display and it is this synergy that makes MI – GP an incredibly sublime experience. The tremendous reputation that the high octane franchise carries meant the newly appointed director Brad Bird—mostly renowned for his animation flicks The Incredibles and Ratatouille—had his work cut out for him. Brad Bird has indeed been up to the task and has lived well to the expectations of Cruise and the entire production team led by J.J. Adams, who directed the third movie of the series back in 2006. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is packed with a plethora of action sequences that includes a shootout in Budapest, an escape sequence from a Moscow Jail, a sandstorm chase in Dubai, and a classic brawl in an automated parking garage in Mumbai. However, the sequence that stands out is the one in which Tom Cruise climbs the tallest building in the world, Burj Khalifa by clinging to it from the outside using suction gloves, giving the Spiderman a run for his money."
"dfranzen70","8","7","11","16 January 2012"," Terrific in IMAX - really great stunts
","You never really expect the fourth movie in a series to be very good. The law of diminishing returns usually applies here. You know the characters, you know the premise, you know there will be a plethora of explosions and perhaps some bon mots. And that's all you want out of escapist, popcorn movies. The new Mission:Impossible movie flouts those conventions, though. Sure, its plot is straightforward (only one man can stop the end of the world!), but the stunts and the spectacular cinematography complement the story, rather than point to its threadbare nature.<br/><br/>In Mission:Impossible - Ghost Protocol, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is imprisoned in Serbia. We don't know why, but maybe we'll find out later. Unsurprisingly, he's busted out by fellow agents Benji (Simon Pegg) and Carter (Paula Patton). It seems some bad guy has his hands on a nuclear device and needs only the launch codes, but when Hunt and his team infiltrate the Kremlin to retrieve them... well, the place blows up. The Impossible Missions Force is blamed and disbanded, as the U.S. president (fearing repercussions from Moscow) invokes Ghost Protocol, and the team is left on its own to Save the World.<br/><br/>The events take place sometime after those in M:I 3, in which Ethan Hunt quits the IMF. Well, here we are again, so perhaps that was just a decoy, huh? But it's not a simple matter of trying to make the audience forget Hunt had quit; that plot idiosyncrasy is explained. Luckily for us, it's not a driving force behind the plot, which is just a long-hand way of saying that although this one follows that one and refers to events in that one, it doesn't negate that one at all - it plays off it. Trust me, it'll make more sense once you see the movie.<br/><br/>The must-find-bad-guys-to-save-self/save-the-world plot is not really new, but the way it dovetails with the subplots (i.e., what happened to Hunt after M:I III and other pieces) is surprisingly well done. Added to the mix is an analyst, played by Jeremy Renner, who finds himself sucked into Hunt's mission and who may not be who he says he is. It's a movie in which we're not left guessing about the big things (e.g., who's the bad guy, what's he up to) but rather about the small things (what does X have to do with Y, what does Y know that we don't).<br/><br/>I saw this movie in an IMAX theater, and for once the effect is well used. Here's a prime example. Ethan Hunt needs to get to a computer server room within the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Trouble is, he can't access it from the inside. In case you're not familiar, the Burj Khalifa is 2,716.5 feet tall. That's more than half a mile. Ethan needs to scale it (although, luckily, not the entire height). He uses these suction gloves: thwop, thwop, thwop. And while he's doing this, we're treated to a dizzying look at the skyscrapers below him; because of the huge screen, it really felt as if the theater were tilting, rather than the camera. Excellent work. Every explosion, every pounding is amplified; when glass shatters, you duck - and the movie's not even in 3D. <br/><br/>Cruise is Tom Cruise. He is not, as I am fond of saying, an actor - he is a movie star. Ethan Hunt is a hugely successful character for him, but he's not without some flaws. In fact, I think it can be said that there's more to Hunt in this installment than there was before, and somehow Cruise is able to make us feel, well, concern for him. Sure, he's in charge, but he has his demons. Cruise doesn't overact here. In fact, he even slows the tempo down a bit, as if he's realized that sometimes saying nothing is better than saying something. Sure, he grits his teeth and defies all laws of physics, but he does seem to be bringing a little more to Hunt's character, psychologically, than we'd seen before. Big plus.<br/><br/>Mission:Impossible - Ghost Protocol is a near-perfect action/spy thriller. There is plenty of intrigue, and you shouldn't be able to guess it all at first blush. It is a plausible, if not remarkable, plot. Its stuntwork - some performed by Cruise - is staggering to behold. If there ever was a movie that made your jaw drop at times, it's this one. They even manage to mix in a huge sandstorm, which is in itself a little scary. (Side note: how do real Dubai people deal with these things? In the movie they appear to be driving off the road as if they'd never seen one before.) Tom Cruise updates his usual Action Man character with some mental issues, and it works. He has an able supporting cast - great comic relief from Pegg, as usual, and the delectable Patton as a woman with issues of her own - and boggling special effects to move things along. This is definitely a movie best appreciated on the big screen."
"tavm","8","7","11","14 January 2012"," Tom Cruise does it again in Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol
","This is the third of four Mission: Impossible films starring Tom Cruise that I managed to watch (I only missed the second one directed by John Woo). I enjoyed each one despite not always knowing what was going on and this was no different. Still, with those awesome stunts and those special effects one still gets entertained and doesn't think too much about the plot until they get to the exposition which always provide somewhat of a reasonable explanation of why things happen. And, really, Cruise still has the charisma to sell it in a believable enough way. And the woman playing Agent Carter is sure hot enough, isn't she? So on that note, Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol gets a high recommendation from me."

","I loved the editing and the direction of this movie. The movie kept moving and didn't got boring at any point. Tom Cruise clearly shows wrinkles now but his acting is getting better with his age. It was nice to see Josh Holloway in the movie and Jeremy Renner is very good addition in the Hunt team, Did miss Michelle Monaghan though. The action sequences are done brilliantly, except 1 scene on the highway, they made me jump out of the seat at couple of points. All in All its a very good action movie. I wasn't expecting it to be this good after watching the first trailer of this movie but this franchise is definitely not over."

What's missing in MI4 is the lack of the one, main villain; but it doesn't detract too much. Known for big, elaborate set pieces, this one delivers a couple of the more memorable ones. Decent acting all around, the addition of Jeremy Renner is a welcome one, maybe they will stick with his character going forward, the way they did with Ving Rhames. Enjoyable; I'd be eager for the next one.<br/><br/>P.S.

"Buff2001","2","20","41","31 December 2011"," Absurdly unreal and over the top!
","If you like this kind of action film featuring everything that utilizes the latest in filming technology, then you will enjoy this. Obviously based on the 33,300 plus votes, a whole lot of you rate this right up there with the truly good movies. Close analysis reveals that the target audience is extremely unbalanced with males, especially those age 18 to 44. While people over 45 constitute a large potential audience, only 1264 rated this film.<br/><br/>If you are 45 or over, you might want to evaluate my own review. I am 77 and been a movie buff for 65 years. I have seen black and white, Cinerama, CinemaScope, 360 (as at Epcot), IMAX in Smithsonian, and many other places, and 3-D at a number of amusement parks. I thoroughly enjoyed all of these leading edge technologies, primarily because of the technology plus they portrayed real people doing real things.<br/><br/>I went to our local 12plex because they had remodeled two of the 12 theaters to show IMAX and 3D. Not wanting to see animated films, we finally saw this one because I did enjoy the original MI TV series.<br/><br/>This was in my opinion a terrible script depicting old James Bond movies with regard to primary plot. You have to suspend judgement to even come close to relating to the film.<br/><br/>As it turned out the theater had installed a crystal clear screen and projecting equipment. The real problem for me was this ultra good sound system. For about half of the rather long film the sound system was running at full blast. Most involved showing something on the screen that literally shook the theater. It was impressive , at first, but got to be very old and disturbing.<br/><br/>For older folks I suggest you pass on this. They have 3-D digital TV systems that you have control of. You won't be seeing movies anything like How the West was Won, Sound of Music, etc. in this era and media."

The gadgets were extremely high tech and I seriously doubt many of them really exist. Face scanner in a contact lens?<br/><br/>The opening scene of Cruise in a Serbian high security prison being broken out, was superb. It becomes a mystery that plays constantly in the back of your mind during the film. Who was the man he took with him when escaped? Where is he now? It engages you and puts your mind into the proper framework. Tom Cruise is later written off along with the IMF and must operate rouge to save the US from terrorist named Hendricks who has the Russian launch codes and plans to use them against the US. Cruise's team are the guys that just happened to be with him at the moment...with no masks! Great Stuff.<br/><br/>This is a good old fashion break out the tub of popcorn and enjoy the feature action-comedy-thriller. I didn't see it in IMAX, but clearly that is the way to go considering how the scenes were shot. After seeing it once, I want to see it again on the really big screen. And of course every ""impossible"" scene is made more complex, complicated, or twisted.

","A fourth instalment in a patchy series comes out and makes itself the best. Ethan Hunt is back on the case, ready to take part in another mission, that involves nuclear weapons and Russians. What's most important here are the action sequences. Unlike the recent fad of shaky cam and confusing action, Paramount with with Brad Bird to direct, only previously familiar with animation films. This is what makes him so successful, you wouldn't be doing shaky cam with animation. Instead, Bird cares about framing and being able to focus on every individual action. The scenes are clear and oh so memorable. Whether it's a humorous prison escape scene or a foot chase through a sandstorm. The best part being the climbing of the tallest building in the world. It really does rack up the tension, and continues to introduce complications that must be overcome by a team. Although still the point man, Cruise shares a lot of the great action with his co-stars. Peggis the obvious comic relief, but he isn't unimaginable as a field agent. Patton and Renner are both given emotional hooks to give them something to do and focus on between the action. I was also very happy that the film knows it's a fun spy movie at heart, so we do get outrageous gadgets, the kind that used to make Bond movies fun. Exciting, fun, with enough character moments for the downtime, this is a wonderful action movie."

","Glamor, unbelievably expensive cars and special effects are all stars of the movie, if any. The story is enough entertaining for the video game if you are below 6 years of age. The plot sadly exists but is so banal and shallow that it might fit in one sentence: kill the terrorist, save the world and prove that Americans rule and are almighty! And they so much are since walking into Kremlin is a peace of cake, gathering data there is easier than getting a hot dog on the local kiosk while people from time to time are becoming cats and walking on the outside wall of the tallest building in the world. The same heroes are walking into the worst sand storm and walking out in the most expensive model of BMW. Wow! If we skip all the money invested in the movie and very solid film crew along with the actors, it looks like the core idea for the movie has been written by a very small child. Don't get me wrong, I love fairy tales but even they have to follow some logic and style. Frankly, the only thing that amazes me in this movie is Tom Cruz, this guy looks the same in last 25 years."
"The-Sarkologist","4","13","25","17 December 2011"," At least you can say that you get what you pay for with this one
","I guess the creators of this movie were sitting around a table one day and decided that they would make a movie about the tallest building in the world. When they decided to throw in Tom Cruise, a Kremlin bombing, and a psycho wanting to start a nuclear war, they probably decided that they would make it a part of the Mission Impossible series. I guess you could have used James Bond instead of Ethan Hawk and it probably would have been the same, but then considering that there was only one other person in the cinema when I saw it probably demonstrates that this is a pretty ho-hum sort of movie.<br/><br/>I guess if one likes funky semi-futuristic devices, lots of spy stuff, and maybe Tom Cruise, then I guess you could watch this movie, especially if there isn't anything better on, and you are so board that you want to see a movie anyway. It seems now that despite the fact that this is the forth movie in the series the only things that seem to tie these movies together, other than Tom Cruise that is, is the 'your mission, if you chose to accept it,' and 'this message will self destruct in five seconds' that no doubt came from the original television series upon which these movies were based on.<br/><br/>Granted, it has been a while since I saw the original movies, and I believe that I have seen the other three, but all in all, these are just your typical spy movies that contain action, cool gadgets (and of course Tom Cruise). However this time it appears that they have decided to give him a team, despite the fact that Ethan Hawke is just as capable of completing missions on his own. Further, the plot, while something one would expect from spy movies, clearly seems to be centered around the Burj in Dubai. While the movie is placed in a number of other locals around the world, such as Budapest, Moscow, Bangkok, and Mumbai, the most of the film seems to be set in Dubai, and in particular in the Burj.<br/><br/>I won't go too deep into the plot namely because I don't need to. This is one of those films were the plot, and as is typical it involves some psycho who wants to get their hands on a nuclear weapon and then blow the world up, though the reason behind this is very unclear. Its strange that in a lot of these films, there is some psycho, but there is generally no real method behind their madness. At least in Shakespeare there is a reason why the villain is out to commit acts of villainy, and also a reason for their descent into madness. However, this is Mission Impossible, and no Shakespeare, so I guess we can't ask for much more than that.<br/><br/>As I have said, this movie is okay, and in many cases it appears that most of the plot is revealed in the trailers (which is even more annoying), but I guess it is one of those movies where you watch the trailer, see Tom Cruise, see lots of action, and then decide whether you want to part with your money. However, I guess I wouldn't mind watching the other ones again."

"tedg","Null","8","14","1 January 2012"," The Unused Helo
","I saw this close to seeing the third Transformer movie, and the lessons are clear.<br/><br/>That other film was unconstrained, had no coherence other than the external reference to the world order established by the toy manufacturer. This film in contrast is shaped, pruned from a single vision. Oh, the basic ideas are the same, though this subgenre involves some mental exercises of the audience to interpret what is going on. No matter what a nitwit Cruise is otherwise, he gets the value of control and within a narrow range can support it.<br/><br/>That's why Brad Bird was the ideal man for the job. There are other paths to understanding the challenges of constraining the the world than an apprenticeship in fantasy animation, but that will do. The result is that this does the job of competently filling a couple hours in an empty life, without giving any sustaining value. But suppose you do want to watch this for lessons on constraint.<br/><br/>The final fight, as the genre demands, is a monumental battle between two men with the fate of an entire world in the balance. It has to be brutal, and involve (at this point in the evolution) lots of third dimension action. (Third dimension here means height in the world of the movie.) It has to go on so long, have variety and such and such.<br/><br/>In Michael Bay's hands, this would have involved every excess available. (I am thinking particularly of Arnold jumping onto and wrestling a Harrier.) You can clearly see that the special effects lab brought such a possibility to the production. At the beginning of the fight scene our small guy Tom chases the evil scientist into a parking garage with elevators. Everything about this is designed for the fight: there are no people and elevators go up and down with noir caprice. The thing is open and superbly lit. This is clearly what the CGI guys like and I'm sure what they brought to the project.<br/><br/>But look just as our guys are approaching the garage, the helicopter that we have briefly seen earlier is landing on top of the structure. I have no doubt that storyboards had Tom elevating over the structure after we saw some ups and downs within. Likely, the ultimate drop (which wrecks a car) as proposed would have involved this device.<br/><br/>What we have instead is still pretty silly as reality goes, but it is constrained within a single structure, whose behavior we understand and accept. It is all about decisions my friends, and when there is a steady hand and some conscious steering, we should applaud.<br/><br/>+++<br/><br/>I hate to point this out (because of the hate mail I will get), but this is the difference between Apple products and those of others. Others sell devices based on specs: bigger, faster, cheaper. More, more, more. And people buy those devices because who wouldn't want more? People go to Michael Bay movies because he'll just be more excessive than the last guy.<br/><br/>Apple is all about delighting customers with a well designed experience. A bit slower for massive improvements in battery life? A bit smaller so it can be operated one-handed? Thousands of tiny decisions all guided by a single philosophy, all intended to add something to the richness of the experience.<br/><br/>Is it an accident that Apple products are featured in the Bird movie while commodity electronics firms are featured in the Bay one?<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
"jan_kalina","10","8","14","25 December 2011"," ""Mission accomplished!""
","I have to start with saying that I haven't doubted Brad Bird for a second. I knew he would make an amazing transition from making genius animated films to making genius live-action films. And he accomplished that mission.<br/><br/>This movie is the perfect film for the holidays. They should watch this movie at film schools to learn how to make action scenes. The best, the most amazing scene of this film, of course, is the whole sequence in Dubai. Seeing Tom Cruise climbing the Burj Khalifa, tallest building in the world, will have you on the edge of your seat. It is truly glorious, then it is followed by another great scene of trying to switch a valuable information( I won't specify this] for a wrong one. Genius editing. Followed by foot-chase and a car-chase in a sandstorm. One word to describe this: Mindblowing. You have never seen anything like this.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean that this movie is only about action scenes. As any other Brad Bird film this film is also about characters and story. Mainly about the characters here. Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt gives another amazing performance. I have to say that I have never seen a bad movie with Tom Cruise. And that's something that can't be said about every actor. There is a significant subplot concerning Ethan's past and it tells a lot more about the character. Jeremy Renner as the mystery new character is surprisingly brilliant. I remember when I saw Renner for the first time I didn't really like him, but here he was such a likable character. There are great and funny dialogue between Renner and Simon Pegg's character, who is awesome every single time. I just have to say that I really like Renner now and I look forward to seeing him in this type of role (but not taking over this franchise as was originally intended.) Simon Pegg as the computer and tech go-to guy gets the most of the best lines in the movie and is just absolutely brilliant. Paula Patton as Jane, another member of Ethan's team really brings in the word ""sexy"" into the film. She is essentially the Bond girl of the film but she also gets to kick some ass and it sure is worth it.<br/><br/>This brings me to the main point that this movie feels a lot like a Bond film. The Incredibles from Brad Bird did have Bond/spy film atmosphere. So it was obvious that Bird is a big fan of Bond films. Though, this is the closest he will ever get to directing of Bond like film. Simply put this film is Bond film, but this time Ethan Hunt can't make it on his own and is need of a team.<br/><br/>There are few complaints I've got to make. The film would use a more complex story. The whole story seemed to me as unused concept for a James Bond film. Another thing is a better villain would be good but this film is an example of a movie where the better outweighs the worse. All the actions scenes and fun is a patch for simple but still great story.<br/><br/>This film is an amazing, thrilling ride that the second it starts, it never slows down, never stops till the end credits. I recommend you to see this in IMAX, then you will be as excited from this film as I am. Believe me seeing this film on a giant screen, you will definitely enjoy it to the max."

And when Tom started the series with an excellent cast and a seriously good plot, I applauded the return to the adventures of the IMF. But this film lacks the power and the potency of it's three predecessors. While Cruise recaptures the role of Ethan Hunt well, his supporting team acts as if they have no clue as to what's happening. While I think the director was trying to inject a bit of humor in the incessant babbling of Simon Pegg, the false modesty of Paula Patton, and the hesitancy of Jeremy Renner, these attempts fail miserably, and we are left with a Keystone Kops version of what should be a very dramatic and exciting film. The special effects and stunts are impressive, but that is a combination of money and technology, and with the backers for this film, I doubt either was in short supply. I am sure they were counting on the appeal of the franchise to carry this one to the box office hits column, and they were right. However, if this writing and acting are any indication of the future of this series, I think we would be better off with a remake of Space 1999. Rated PG 13 for the violence and language, rent it if you must, add it to your collection if you have the other three, I suppose. It will not be in mine.

","Say what you will about Tom Cruise (and there's an awful lot that could be said). For me, his name has always been synonymous with, ""entertaining."" For all his shortcomings, including his inability/refusal to incorporate appropriate accents and his wackadoo personal life, he makes wholly entertaining movies. From Top Gun to Knight and Day, he has put together a three decade-long career that is chock full of thrilling excitement. You can't always say that his films are good but very rarely can you deny the man his ability to enthrall the masses. Ghost Protocol, then, serves as a return to form and a pronouncement to the man's detractors that Tom Cruise is still a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>At the outset, we find Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) locked away in a Russian prison. Within minutes (really seconds), however, his old pal Benji (Simon Pegg) and newcomer Jane (Paula Patton) have busted him out in order for Hunt to resume his duties at IMF. He and his team immediately take on a new assignment that unfortunately goes quite bad, resulting in their being framed for the bombing of the Kremlin. Having been disavowed by the US government, the trio, along with the help of William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), an analyst with a mysterious past, is forced to go on the run, one step ahead of Russian operatives who would see them brought to justice. In an effort to both clear their names and, you know, save the world and all, Hunt and his comrades pursue Alex Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist), a nuclear extremist bent on destroying civilization as we know it, using a variety of elaborate and frantic methods in a host of exotic locations.<br/><br/>This is the very rare sequel to a sequel to a sequel that is by far and without question, the best of the group (see also: Fast Five). No longer can this series be relegated to the overcrowded ranks of ""fun-but-forgettable"" action flicks. Ghost Protocol is a clever cross between Bourne and Bond with a touch of cool intelligence that is reminiscent of Ocean's 11. This is a much smarter film than the average action movie, much of which should be attributed to director Brad Bird (Incredibles). ""Smart"" should not be confused with ""complex"" or ""real""; Ghost Protocol has more than its fair share of plot points that could be blasted for inaccuracies and absurd stunts that could never, ever happen. But these potential issues are presented in such an overwhelmingly appealing way that it seems foolish to quibble when it's so much easier to just get on board. The gadgets and technologies used by the team are better than anything James Bond ever had at his disposal and each item is used splendidly. In essence, this is a popcorn blockbuster with a Pixar brain, which turns out to be just as glorious as it sounds.<br/><br/>From the opening shot, Ghost Protocol moves a mile a minute and delivers some of the most ambitious action sequences of the year. The impact of this movie goes deeper than the outlandish stunts, however. It would be easy to film what will undoubtedly be an awesome scene and leave it at that. But Bird and his crew take these shots to a whole new level with impeccable technical work. The cinematography and shot selection are about as good as you can ask for in a blockbuster. Some of the camera work, especially the scenes in Dubai, is absolutely stunning. Likewise, the sound mix is perfect, adding to the impact of each gun shot, car crash, and punch to the jaw. These elements serve to put the audience into the heart of the action and give the impression that Bird cared about creating a great film not just a passable popcorn flick.<br/><br/>The supporting cast around Cruise rounds into form nicely, coming together to make up Hunt's best team yet. Pegg's brand of comedic relief is predictable but nonetheless enjoyable and he displays a little more grit than he has in the past. Patton is a welcome addition and she brings real value to her role, the rare female action hero who actually carries her weight. This is what I think Zoe Saldana is supposed to be and I look forward to seeing more of her in the future. And then, of course, there's Renner who plays slightly against type and, while he's certainly not reinventing the wheel, he displays enough quiet power behind his character's lack of confidence to make his role work very well.<br/><br/>But Ghost Protocol goes nowhere without a strong lead and Cruise is more than up to the challenge. I have always been a serious fan of the man and I feel like he's gotten an unfair shake over the last half-decade or so. What I have always appreciated about Cruise is his earnest desire to make his movies great (whether he succeeds or not). A buddy of mine hit the nail on the head regarding Cruise when he said that he always tries really hard. Every movie, every scene, every shot, Cruise strives to make it the best he's ever done. I think he truly cares about his films in a way that most movie stars do not. Ghost Protocol is no exception as Cruise goes after every scene like it's the one that will bring home an Oscar. For me, it is this commitment to the moment that sells Ghost Protocol as more than just a run-of-the-mill action movie and makes it one of the most deliciously appealing, wonderfully entertaining, and decidedly multi-dimensional films of the year.<br/><br/>Please check out my work at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com and ieatfilms.com"
"its_jimbo","8","7","12","18 December 2011"," An Action Film that Delivers Action!
","The story is fairly typical for a Bond movie - Evil Megalomaniac wants to blow up the world with a Nuclear Bomb - and immediately gets down to work with action scenes in Budapest, Moscow, Dubai and Mumbai. The cast is very effective and the action scenes all deliver. Credit should be given to Brad Bird. He uses excellent timing, makes sure we know that is Tom up there on the side of the building and gives us a few surprises during the scenes. But at the end of the day, this movie works because Tom Cruise sells each scene. He is casual about the action when he needs to be, he is intense when it requires it and he is a truly likable action good guy. If they had half stars I would give this an 8.5. The movie is what it advertises to be, nothing more, nothing less. Fast paced action that flies through to the finish."
"marcuspeerman","9","7","12","17 December 2011"," breathtaking
","I've pretty much enjoyed all the Mission Impossible films- they forced me to re-evaluate my derisive opinion of Tom Cruise. I really, really liked the third film so I'm surprised to be able to say this is the best. By far.<br/><br/>Cruise is on top form in this movie, and against all my expectations turns in an exceptional performance. It's hard to believe that he is almost half a century old. He throws himself into dazzling action sequences that would defeat many actors twenty years younger. Back in the day action heroes of fifty were dreadful old codgers like Roger Moore and the rest of the decrepit cast of Sea Wolves etc.<br/><br/>The story is convoluted but gripping and maintained my interest. The IMF team suffer a series of reverses and nothing works out how you think it will.<br/><br/>The cast are uniformly excellent- Simon Pegg can do no wrong, Paula Paton is sexy and believably tough and after being initially skeptical of Jeremy Renner I heartily embraced his character by the end. I'd be delighted to see them all again in another movie.<br/><br/>Brad Bird is a new name to me- I don't really watch animation- but he gives an impeccable account of himself here. There are some stunning visual sequences, heart stopping moments and a couple of laugh out moments.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour. See this on the big screen. It really is worth it."
"thesar-2","9","7","12","17 December 2011"," That's a Haboob, Baby!
","Let's start with, I LOVED Part III a lot. So this unlikely follow-up due to the poor box office of the third one would really have to show a lot to take over as the best Mission: Impossible entry.<br/><br/>My God, was Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol fantastic. Excellent, even. Funny, adventurous, real, exciting, thrilling and a movie I am dying to see again are just a few emotions I had when I left the theatre. Best Action of the Year doesn't quite sum it up. (Of course, we're talking the worst action-film year in history, so let's say, it's the best action movie since the last Bourne film and James Bond's Casino Royale.)<br/><br/>If you will see this movie, your mission, choose you to accept the alternative – jail time for not seeing it, is to see it in IMAX. And no worries, mercifully, it's not in 3D. The whole movie looks brilliant on the extra-tall screen, but if just one scene will convince you, it's from the trailer: Hunt (Tom Cruise) scaling the World's Tallest Building: the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. That alone is worth the entire ticket price.<br/><br/>Funny about that scene, during super-spy Hunt's accent and decent outside the 130th floor, they say (and show) a gigantic ""Dust Storm"" is approaching. My roommate and I, who both live near Phoenix, AZ were like: ""Eh, it's just a Haboob. No biggie. Go inside, wait it out and wash your car the next day.""<br/><br/>I usually give a synopsis with my reviews. It's just better not to. Let them surprise you. It's a fully action-packed, almost from beginning to end, spy thriller. Let them tell you the story, the twists, the suspense and allow yourself to feel what they feel. Trust me, this is a ride you'll want to take a few times. I know I'm going back to IMAX as soon as possible.<br/><br/>Don't wait for video or Netflix. Don't see the smaller big-screen version. And don't remember your distaste of Tom Cruisewhich, by the way, I never had. See this movie ASAP in IMAX. One of the best of 2011."
"jesussavedjoshua","4","12","24","17 December 2011"," Impossibly Boring with No Plot
","This film is boring right from the pathetic title sequence and never resembles the original TV series ever. Apart from a couple of nice IMAX scenes of Dubai, it is so not worth the additional price to see it at IMAX, or any theater. Definitely wait for a video rental on this one. Also, I actually sorta liked the 2nd and 3rd one but this film has an almost non-existent plot. Come to think about it, what were the other two films even about, do you remember? You will forget this film except for one or two silly scenes involving weather and high places. I would have been more excited by character development and an actual story but I guess that's just an impossible mission to pull off these days when moviegoers seem to be entertained by special effects and glitz. By the way, I kept expecting Daniel Craig to show up and introduce himself as 007. This film is Bond VERY light!"
"Neptune92","8","6","10","26 January 2012"," Best sequel of the series
","I'd rank this movie better than MI2 and just hair better than MI3. If they continue with this franchise, i'd like for them to go back to the complexity of the first MI movie. MI4 is more a step in this direction from 2 and 3. I think what I liked most about the movies was that the villain was not someone who was in the IMF. The whole bad guy from within routine was fine in the 1st movie, but felt repetitive in the 2nd and 3rd. Also, Ving is and excellent actor and it's a shame his character feels like and after thought in this film. They need more of him. <br/><br/>I look forward to more movies in this series with either Cruise or Renner in the lead."

","A great movie worth watching... incredibly suspenseful and keeping you on the edge of your seat. Full of spectacles that can please anyone. It improves from the other predecessors with a great story line, in action sequences, and novel and interesting technology. It has just enough humor that allows a consummate film experience which allows the movie- watchers to feel a certain degree of relief and expectancy for another sequel. Not only is it action-packed but it also has many other romantic moments that can also extend to more avid buffs. Through such romantic episodes it can allow a more powerful and heart-trending experience. With all such genres, MI4 also shows off his impressive gamut in cultures. For me movies are an area of entertainment and novelty. And in this case, this movie was capable of sending me everywhere; it passed all expectations. You can see Russia's monuments, Dubai's Burj Khalifa, and India's lavish and sumptuous parties. Other interesting aspects were the cars; the BMWi8(concept) in this movie was incredibly and stylishly designed. Its a movie loaded with everything movie-goers would want. Highly entertaining...Worth the tickets..."
"jacco59","8","6","10","24 December 2011"," Excellent, almost equal to the first one
","I really wasn't expecting this to be this good, seeing how both parts 2 and 3 were so disappointing to me, but this is a very fast and enjoyable ride. The story is very linear with almost no diversions, as it is supposed to be in a mission:impossible movie,the script is well-written, the acting is also well-done (can you believe Tom Cruise is 50 years old?), the action is amazing, especially the scene in Dubai, which I think is one of the best action/operation scenes in film history. The film really pulls you in and does not let you go until the end. But of course there were also some bad points. One of those is the amount of way-too-advanced technology the they just seem to be able to pull out of their pockets so to speak. Also numerous times there is a 'deus ex machina' kind of thing, with people being saved just in time, that stuff. But other than that this is a very, very entertaining piece of filmmaking that any action fan can't miss, and which is almost equally entertaining to people who aren't necessarily action fans.<br/><br/>To conclude: Good points: Good story, good script, good acting, great action,engaging. Bad points: too much too advanced technology, deus ex machina rescues"
"sanddragon939","10","6","10","16 December 2011"," The best 'Impossible Mission' EVER!!!
","The Mission Impossible film series, while great movies in their own right, have somehow never achieved the legendary status of James Bond, or more recently, the Bourne trilogy. 'Ghost Protocol' however MORE than allows Ethan Hunt and his team to join that exclusive club...accomplishing the near impossible mission with flying colors!!!<br/><br/>MI: GP opens with Ethan Hunt in a Moscow prison, being broken out by fellow IMF agents Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Jane Carter (Paula Patton) just in time for his next mission-infiltrating the Kremlin. But things go horribly wrong and soon, Russia and the United States find themselves at the brink of war and the entire IMF is disavowed. Hunt and his team, which now also includes IMF analyst Brandt (Jeremy Renner) now find themselves being forced to operate without official sanction or support, against overwhelming odds, to prevent a madman from unleashing nuclear holocaust upon the world.<br/><br/>The film has a perfect blend between plot and action, something which few movies in this genre ever truly achieve. We literally begin the film on the move with a foot chase in Budapest, and we are treated to several visually stunning set pieces, including but not limited to a chase through a sandstorm in Dubai...but the intricate plot seamlessly merges with the action. Brandt is truly an enigma for most of film...the mystery surrounding him, while not essential to the central plot of the film, is a little something extra to tickle the back of the viewer's mind! Tom Cruise of course makes a brilliant comeback to the role of Ethan Hunt-with the veteran agent being forced to assume a new role for this film; that of the leader and mentor to an arguably dysfunctional 'family'.<br/><br/>To fans of the past MI movies and espionage thrillers in general-there's plenty of action and intrigue to watch out for. But fans of the 60's TV series too would have plenty to cheer about...with a sequence in the middle of the film virtually a homage of an old episode! MI: GP has something for EVERYONE to enjoy...and if you enjoy EVERYTHING...then this movie has truly succeeded in its mission!"

","The mission impossible series when it started in 1998 brought some good stunts and clever use of make up for the actors disguise""s,with a quick moving action in parts.Move forward to 2012 ,its the same but the stunts are so over the top its ridiculous,at the beginning of the film a spy jumps off a 10 storey building shooting at people and throws a box which inflates to a 10 metre wide stuntman type landing pad,(in the right landing place)and so the stunts began.next cruise find a old phone box that opens into a modern computer interface!no chance it would have needed servicing at some point and the secret found?the phone self destructs too!next cruise gets inside the Kremlin and opens a screen to work behind and fool the guards.no body else walks past all the time he is there.!next he jumps off a ledge 6 storeys up, flys down a telephone wire ,lands on a moving van at 40 mph without a shirt on and falls on a cobble road,not even a scratch!he gets caught and told he will be killed or his mission ,""if he chooses to accept""will keep him alive. I burst out laughing,is this a comedy?The stunts get bigger.and dafter. it reminded me of how james bond has now gone,Just full of silly stunts.The best Bonds are the Sean connery era,The first mission impossible was the best.If you like spy type films just watch the best,the Bourne films and don't waste your time with this"
"joetufano719","9","5","8","27 October 2012"," Arguably the best of the 4
","I've always enjoyed the Mission Impossible films: the first one was very good, the second one was okay, the third was definitely an improvement over the 2nd, and this one... WOW! <br/><br/>Story (No spoilers): Ethan Hunt of IMF finds himself in another predicament when he and his team must act on their own to stop a nuclear war from occurring between the United States and Russia.<br/><br/>Acting: I've always liked Tom Cruise as an actor. He's very talented and always gives it 100%. Say what you want about him, but regardless of how messed up his life is he is one of the most hardworking actors we have on the scene today. Those action stunts he did in this film, including the one when he's on the side of the tower in Dubai had me on the edge of my seat. Simon Pegg does great in this one and I'm glad he has a bigger part than what he had in the 3rd film. He's funny, he's likable but he's also not annoying, and he has some of the most funny lines The other main cast members such as Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton (very easy on the eyes by the way) give great performances and so do the rest of the actors in the film.<br/><br/>Directing: Brad Bird's first foray into live action films actually pays off here. Before he was famous for animation which he does very well, and I never thought he had it in him for a live action film, especially a Mission Impossible film. Well done!<br/><br/>Final Verdict: This is a very entertaining fun film, and for me arguably the best of the 4 films by far, and I'm looking forward to the 5th one."
"insaneguitar","9","5","8","6 October 2012"," The best action film in years
","Plot: After a terrorist blows up the Kremlin and winds up with nuclear launch codes, framing the IMF, it's up to Ethan Hunt and his team to not only clear their names, but save the world from potential nuclear war.<br/><br/>Worth watching?: I always liked the Mission: Impossible movies before. I didn't think any of them were masterpieces, but hey, they were fun enough to watch, and a good way to take you away for a few hours. Having said that, the trailer for this sucker absolutely blew me away for some reason, so it was with hopes jacked way up that I strolled into the theater to see this one. So was it everything I hoped for? Well, in my book, this movie succeeded and then some! You'll be hooked by the narrative right from frame one, with Brad Bird's masterful direction mostly to thank for that. The story unfolds at an easy pace that makes it an absolute thrill to watch, you can tell with each new scene, they're trying to top the previous one. I've read a lot of reviews saying that the plot is one of the movies weaknesses. I actually thought it was one of this movie's charms! The story had a very retro-James Bond feel to it that really gave it that whole ""spy feel"", and it worked for me big time! A lot of people also say that the character development is non-existent. Well, I hate to say I disagree, but,villain aside,... I DISAGREE!!! The player's in the house all had their own personal issues that they were dealing with, and they were engaging to say the least. It also helps that all the actors were very credible in their roles, and had great chemistry together. Tom Cruise is very cool and believable as our hero Ethan Hunt, and it is quite nice to see him in action hero mode once again. Paula Patton earns mucho sympathy, while Simon Pegg, as always, is hilarious. And last but not least, Jeremy Renner's character has an aura of mystery about him that leads to an interesting revelation, tying him directly to Ethan.<br/><br/>And now to the part everyone who hasn't seen it is wondering about: the action sequences. Well, to understate it, they're exhilarating. Don't hold onto anything during the Burj Khalifa part, because you'll most likely break it from clenching your fists so tight. That scene alone is enough to have you on the edge of your seat, but it's then followed up by the beyond mind-blowing sandstorm chase, which is another definite highlight. The movie manages to retain a sense of excitement throughout it's entire running time, and that is a feat in itself.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible-Ghost protocol is one of the best cinematic treats we've seen in a long, long while. Sure, the villain could have been a tad better (not the actor's fault, he didn't have much to chew on), but on the whole, this is entertainment at it's finest, and it's one you definitely shouldn't miss."
"johnklem","6","5","8","22 April 2012"," No-one ever went broke underestimating... etc.
","Lea Sedoux and Jeremy Renner bring a depth to their characters that's at odds with every other aspect of this film. It's an expensive cartoon and if that's what you want, then you'll be quite happy. If, on the other hand, you're over twelve or have an IQ into triple digits, you're in for a disappointment. Moderately smart ten year olds should not waste their (parents') money. It has its moments but they're lost in a welter of ill-judged humor, preposterous stunts and worse plot devices. The first half hour or so is particularly bad as it becomes clearer and clearer that no one has any clue what kind of a film they're making. I didn't think it could get any worse - and then Tom Wilkinson turned up! Thankfully, it's only a cameo role and the film starts to improve. Some of the Dubai stuff is really quite good but then it begins to get silly again. MI was almost in Third Man territory for it's first twenty minutes or so. MI3 proved that the franchise works well as a James Bond alternative, offering a similar mix of locations, glamour, action, beautiful women and fast cars. I wonder what MI5 will bring. By the way, the acronyms are getting confusing. IMF, MI5? A John le Carre financial thriller?"

The Ghost Protocol is a team that is made for trying to stop this attack from happening and there are big explosions on the Kremlin which was exploded in the attack to get the Codes. Its then moved on to Dubai and India were Hendricks is moving to find the codes from a multi-million pound man called Brij Nath ( Anil Kapoor)which has a really beautiful mansion and they Ethan is chasing Hendricks in a BMW i8 Concept Car. I thought this film was brilliant as i loved all the technical aspects of the film with the cars and the computers that they use. Also, the wonderful scenery of Dubai with the Burj Dubai hotel and the great chasing scene with a big sandstorm. The best scene was the in Mumbai when William Brant (Jeremy Renner) jumps from 25ft into a big cooling fan is only held by a strong magnet which is underneath him. I thought the story line was very realistic and original.

","You would think with a title like called ""Mission Impossible,"" that it would be regarded as a failed mission before it even begins. So far we have learned over the last decade that the words ""Mission Impossible"" do not apply to the character Ethan Hunt, and in Mission: Impossible, Ghost Protocol, there is no compromise. Ethan Hunt, played by Tom Cruise, in this action packed thriller, does an amazing job at creating a subtle, but ferocious character. As we've seen through the previous installments, this one being the fourth, it is clear to see the transition from recklessness to maturity by the character Ethan Hunt. He has a certain style that he has adhered to, which has poised a very vibrant leader. The story which begins with Ethan in jail, leads to the mission of stopping a terrorist, by the name of Kurt Hendrix, also known as ""Cobalt,"" from getting access to nuclear launch codes that would start a nuclear war between USA and Russia. Before the codes were to be given to Hendrix, they were intercepted by an assassin female, Lea Seydoux, who held the codes for ransom for the finest diamonds available. Ethan and his team had to figure out a way to intervene and get the launch codes before Hendrix who is planning a terrorist attack on the United States. The movie entails where Ethan, Jane, Benji, and William chase Hendrix from Moscow through Dubai into India. Hendrix had gotten aware of Ethan and his crew, and then he bombed the Kremlin in Russia and framed Ethan. Now without the support of US Government, Ethan and his team must clear their names without being compromised, hence the title ""Ghost Protocol."" The director, Brad Bird, has had undeniable chemistry working alongside with Cruise. The cinematography and careful attention to detail has crafted this particular movie to stand out from the rest. By filming in places such as Budapest, Moscow, Dubai and India, it has really taken to light the monuments and key features of each location. The writers were astonished when Cruise decided to do part of his own stunts, like running down the Burj Khalifa! The camera angles and vivid colors provide great detail and promote Ethan as a saviour by allowing viewers to view him as a hero when the camera angles are shot at a low upward – facing direction to get the full body of Ethan in the frame, monumental so to speak. The technology used in this movie is unbelievable, from futuristic cars, wall climbing gloves, facial recreation tools, and magnetic suits, there is nothing shy of extraordinary here. Throughout the movie, it is easy to recognize hints and clues to previous Mission Impossible movies in the series, from the walling climbing abilities, falling from the ceiling but landing safely, use apple products, and Ethan's wife. Ghost Protocol, which was released on December 21, 2011, has more than quadrupled its budgeted amount at the box office, but don't take the word of the millions who have watched it, and experience the thrill for yourself."

","(Re-review in preparation for Rogue Nation)<br/><br/>After a bomb destroys the Kremlin during a mission, ""Ghost Protocol"" is initiated which disavows the IMF and puts Ethan Hunt and his team on the run. His mission; should he choose to accept it is to stop the real culprit codenamed Cobalt who is on an extremist mission to destroy the world in the name of peace.<br/><br/>""Ghost Protocol"" is the first ""M:I"" film to include a title rather than a number to mark its place in the series and boy is it one excellent movie. Everything about this film is fantastic: the action, the team dynamics, the set pieces and even the humor! In fact, ""GP"" has probably the most humor out of all the ""M:I"" films despite the stakes being so high and that's fine because humor doesn't hurt during an action sequence as long as it's done right. While the plot of a villain trying to destroy the world is cliché, it's the execution that makes the film so great. What's even greater is the fact that not everything goes to plan for the IMF in this film and their gadgets don't always work; adding tension to the action scenes.<br/><br/>The cast does an excellent job with their roles. Each with their own unique personalities. Tom Cruise still proves that he's an action star and the sequence of him climbing the Burj Khalifa is one of the best parts of the film. He shows how much of a leader he has become since the first film. Jeremy Renner before he was on ""The Avengers"" is an analyst with a dark secret. He shares some great banter and quiet drama moments with the team. Paula Patton is a beautiful and capable agent with a score to settle. Simon Pegg reprises his role as Benji from ""M:I 3"" and he makes a great replacement to Ving Rhames as the computer expert and comic relief. His comic timing is impeccable. <br/><br/>Animation auteur Brad Bird directs this film as his first live action feature. Much like J.J. Abrams before him, he breaths fresh life into the franchise. The cinematography is beautiful and the action sequences are breathtaking and pulse pounding.<br/><br/>The only weak link to the film is the villain Cobalt played by Michael Nyqvist. Nyqvist's performance is good but his screen time is minimal and he has little personality or depth other than that of a generic extremist. But this is only a minor nitpick since the rest of the film overshadows this flaw.<br/><br/>A great spy action thriller and one of the best installments in the series. 9/10"
"aaubrey4","4","7","13","22 December 2011"," Style over Substance
","Mission: Impossible- Ghost Protocol follows Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and crew Benji (Pegg), Carter (Patton), and Brandt (Renner), as they attempt to thwart super secret agent, physicist, and psycho, Hendricks (Nyqvist) in his attempts to start a nuclear semi-apocalypse.<br/><br/>To be to-the-point, this movie lacks the substance of the first and, instead relies upon effects and protracted action scenes. The plot follows the standard formula of chasing down launch codes and stopping catastrophe at the last minute. The movie simply moves from location to location with frustrating near misses driving the globe-trotting. The scenery was definitely beautiful and the filming had a grand feel, but unlike MI3, I wasn't intrigued enough to care about what was happening. After a while, I just wanted it to reach its inevitable conclusion.<br/><br/>The characters and their motives were also lacking. Carter was angry over the loss of a partner and hinted love interest and could not control herself—kind of the weak woman stereotype. Brandt was relegated to the position of analyst for a mysterious reason that seemed like it would be shocking—it wasn't. Benji's character reminded me of Jar Jar Binx (probably misspelled). Benji would talk so much throughout the movie as the ""comic relief"" and maybe 5% of it was enjoyable. I really liked the Sidorov character, but they didn't really follow through on him. Tom Cruise played a consistent, well acted, angry/distracted Ethan Hunt. Wistrom was a Bond villain and was not nearly as cleaver and unlikeable as Davian from MI3.<br/><br/>The scenes that were amazing and fun included the Prison scene from the beginning, the hospital, and the entire Dubai section. The gadgets were over-used. The magnet shirt, sci-fi train car, sci-fi super car, and projection wall were just too much to have in the same movie. The characters and story were clumsily thrown together around the effects and made me laugh for the wrong reasons—especially the ridiculously dumb ending with cameos from people that should have been left out if only given that much screen time.<br/><br/>If you liked MI3 for the plot, characters, suspense, and excellent action (expected from Abrams), you will likely find this entry to be a rich man's Mission: Impossible 2. I would personally only recommend this movie in IMAX, or while drunk, or both."

"helmutty","8","14","32","15 December 2011"," Mission: Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol
","This is the first live-action directed by Brad Bird who is well-known for his Pixar movies including The Incredibles. I was particularly interested in seeing how he will fare in his debut live-action movie and it turns out that he proves live-action is not a problem for him. Mission: Impossible 4 is a fun thrilling action-packed ride.<br/><br/>The story: Ethan Hunt is back for a new mission as seen in the opening scenes-he rescues a criminal from prison. And from there, the action almost does not stop. The story is straight-forward but the whole movie is filled with tense action. We didn't even hear the characters talking randomly about other topics other than spy stuff. I never got bored as the movie does not give you a chance to be bored. The tense action is always running to keep you glued to your seat. The action scenes are cool and brutal. I am surprised Brad directs those scenes brutally with bone-crunching sounds. The fist-cuffs are brutal for the franchise. Of course, one of the most notable scenes is when Ethan climbs the tallest building in Dubai. The whole scene is tense as it is real. Another notable scene is the thrilling chase in the sandstorm. Is it intense for someone to chase someone without able to see properly? The humour mostly from Simon Pegg helps to enhance the movie. Acting wise is fine. Music wise is good. It helps to give a more tense feeling to the already tense action scenes.<br/><br/>Overall: It is solid entertainment. It is also a action spy movie to whet fans of the spy genre and James Bond. This could actually be the best Mission Impossible movie. This is actually better than the good J.J Abrams' Mission Impossible in terms of action and tense story. This proves that Brad Bird not only can direct animation but can direct an action-packed movie filled with cool action scenes."

","This is simply the worst Mission Impossible movie I have ever seen, and is among the worst Cruise had acted in. Looks like the production team has run out of ideas to introduce new action scenes and so many things seems dysfunctional. Cruise should stop the franchise, as it is taking away the good memory of earlier MI movies. The movie is bad in action, doesn't seem any thrill in the movie at all and the characters it feels were given the movie script on the day movie scenes were supposed to be shot. Maybe just like some other series like James Bond or The Bourne series Cruise should be replaced, which seems not possible. I really think Cruise is loosing his charm and his age is catching up to him"
"TheClickCityDotCom","9","6","11","26 December 2011"," This Movie Achieved What Other Movies Found Impossible This Year!
","Considering a lot of the movies this year loaded with huge budgets have been utter garbage(HUGO), i walked out of this IMAX screening of Brad Bird's Mission Impossible-Ghost Protocol with a wide smile on my face thinking 'Yeah, this movie deserved the FULL PRICE'.<br/><br/>The story isn't original and not as complicated as the likes of The Dark Knight,it was centered around the implication of the IMF in the bombing of the Kremlin by the villain(Mikael Nyqvist)after stealing the briefcase which could enable him launch a nuclear missile to destroy America. At the same time, the IMF squad disguised as Russian officials try to steal the same information with an fantastic optical illusion device only to realise that their efforts were a little too late and had to abort the mission.<br/><br/>As the Kremlin came crushing down, it was clear that Ethane(Tom Cruise) and his IMF team were going to take the blame for the bombing and with the US denying any knowledge of them, they were suddenly hit with a race against time to prove their innocence to the Russian authorities and stopping the real culprit who was poised to start World War 3, nuclear style.<br/><br/>Besides the see-through storyline, the execution was solid,tense and entertaining. Somehow all their plans which would have worked in the other installments of Mission Impossible seemed to just fall apart at some stage and the characters had to improvise to finish the mission and stay alive.<br/><br/>The new cast(Paula Patton and Jeremy Renner) added some realism, character and energy to the pacing of this action-packed spy movie with Simon Pegg injecting some well timed comic relief to complex clock-ticking situations.Each character was given the chance to shine in their roles and from where i was sitting, they all delivered very convincing and satisfying action scenes. Even the so-called timid Simon Pegg did great with his new role as a computer hacker/field agent.<br/><br/>There were some memorable scenes in this movie,some of which were original; The optical illusion heist of the Kremlin and its collapse, The climbing of the tallest building in Dubai, The sand storm chase scene and the final showdown scene in the vending machine style car park were all riveting and explosive,thanks to clever directing skills of Brad Bird. This talented director finally shows the whole world his creative direction isn't just limited to the mesmerising Ratatouille, The Incredibles and Up; solidly nailing his debut as the man in the driver's seat of real feature films such as Mission Impossible-Ghost Protocol.<br/><br/>Overall this movie delivered what it said on the box,just plain pure adrenaline fuelled action spy movie. See it in IMAX if you can but regardless of platform, Mission Impossible- Ghost Protocol is a solid addition to the franchise showing Tom Cruise as a unique actor."
"marcellopenso","7","6","11","17 December 2011"," All-around fun and puts the team back in Mission: Impossible
","A fun movie with some compassion, that gets the team work 'back into the action'.<br/><br/>Brad Bird and the writers make a number of correct decisions that recall the uniqueness, character and excitement of the original series. Bird relies on larger-than-life live action stunts (particularly thrilling on the IMAX) rather than rely on CGI fakery or shaky camera work. This more traditional but more realistic direction adds to the fun. Tom Cruise has (and does) the best stunts, of course, but the rest of team also contribute much more than in the previous films. This shift in emphasis by the writers also contributes to the fun by allowing all the characters to actually play an important or critical role (best shown in the last sequence in India) rather than just 'be helpers' to Tom Cruise. This too was a compelling characteristic of the original series.<br/><br/>The cast is enjoyable, and the bits of comic dialog add to the fun. The occasional failures of some of the gadgetry also provide lighthearted moments, keeping the film light enough so that it is balanced and proportional, with the correct mix of action, suspense, and relief. It never takes itself too seriously, which is appropriate to the genre.<br/><br/>Best seen while eating popcorn."

When will Hollywood move on from the ""Russian nuclear threat"" scenario? <br/><br/>If I was 16 and had never seen a good action movie (Bourne or the new Bond movies) I might have actually enjoyed this. I thought that Cruise over-acted every scene and the only bright performance came from Simon Pegg. <br/><br/>However, my partner and I are both in our mid-40's and if we had seen this in a theater we would have walked out by the mid-point. Since we ordered it on pay-per-view we watched until the end and only wasted $6. This franchise was strong in the first 2 installments, but III was a weak story and 4 shouldn't have even been made.

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","8","16","27 January 2012"," Ghost Protocol, or ""we finally thought of a cool name for that thing that happens in each of these""
","Ethan returns, sans wife(rendering the third film even more pointless than... it... already was), and after a failed mission(a result that becomes a bit of a trend in this), he and his team(and the entire IMF, for a slight, and unnoticeable, change... yes, there will be no backup, intel or the like in this, remember how heavily they relied on those in the predecessors to this? No? Huh, me neither... well, I'm sure it's in there, or it wouldn't be a big deal in this) are disavowed, and these four people are the only thing keeping an international terrorist from destroying the world(did I mention that this is immensely Hollywood? It is. Very much so). This has been getting a pretty positive response from critics, and one might have feared that this was merely on account of them hoping not to be depicted as a stereotypical caricature resembling an undertaker in Bird's next animated picture. Fortunately, that is not the case, and this is the best sequel so far, being roughly as good as the first one. It's as much a spy thriller as it is an action flick(with cool martial arts fights and chases, vehicular and otherwise), and both aspects work well. This is rather tense and you really get into it(the plot is convoluted, of course, and yet you can follow it well). It's the most visual of these(and do keep in mind that one of them was made by John Woo), as well as the... well, only one with numerous exotic locations from around the world. All in all, it's pretty straightforward(if largely satisfying) and won't be remembered for much, and certainly didn't need to be an entry in this series, but it gains a reason to exist(come on, it's not even altering the formula!) by the interesting and well-explored thematic of spies having to make difficult decisions and live with them(survivor's guilt, Jane(who has a cleavage-off with the female assassin, and they generally both look hot) is dealing with the feeling that she got a fellow agent killed, and you have a genuine fear that she might crack, even in this situation of grand stakes(bigger than the '96 one, and unlike the J.J. one, which had none, at least no clear ones). In fact, the good guys are actual characters(unlike the generic-as-they-come villains, who barely get lines, motivation or distinguishing features), even if Brandt turns out to be much less intriguing(especially with the terrible resolution, this should have ended at least ten minutes sooner than it did) than the trailer suggests, and Benji should not get this amount of screen-time(come on, he's a one-note walking joke, with his quirk). That actually brings me nicely to the humor and dialog, that while this can be fun, are quite hit and miss, they try way too hard sometimes. Also, though the pacing is solid, it gets distracting how terrified this is to stand still(one bit even has them spoiling a dramatic, emotional scene by following it up with a dumb gag). They do keep the full face-masks(if limited this time around), and the iconic ""stopping just above ground level"" sequence is redone, still less effective than in the original if not as bad as in the second movie. For these people running around the globe and supposedly chased and under threat, unlike the Bourne trilogy, I do not get a sense that they are in constant danger of being caught and worse. There is a lot of mild violence, some moderate language and a little disturbing content in this. I recommend this to fans of those involved, and of Summer blockbusters(why was this released in Winter?). 7/10"

","Firstly, those going to watch this film will probably have watched MI1/2/3. If you watched them, this one will be just what you are expecting. High octane action, thrilling chases and nail biting sequences.<br/><br/>The storyline is a bit thin, and the twists don't leave your jaw in the dropped position, but having said that, it is a great watch. It is hard to take your eyes off the screen, with one particular sequence shot high up on the Dubai Tower that took me back to my 'hiding behind the sofa' Dr Who days! Seriously thrilling and flawless special effects.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg brings an element to the film previously missing from the first 3, a light hearted relief. What with all the action, it is a good release valve. Of all the MI films, this was the one I enjoyed the most, though to my mind they are all pretty good value for money."
"Robert_duder","9","5","9","24 January 2012"," Proving that Mission Impossible is still the best action franchise out there
","I think, in my opinion, Mission Impossible simply keeps getting better and better with each instalment. I am relieved and excited this film did so well because regardless of anything Tom Cruise does in his personal life he is still a stone cold movie star and fantastic at what he does. And Mission Impossible is fantastic as what it does. They managed to come back after a five year hiatus as if they didn't miss a beat and bring us absolutely everything that makes this series fantastic. Exotic locales, crazy gadgets, break neck action, edge of your seat thrills, a terrific new team, and continuity to the rest of the series. As always, the series starts right from square one with incredible action, a daring escape and an update on our favourite agent Ethan Hunt. I thought that Mission Impossible 4 had a bit less edge and dark to it especially with the addition of Simon Pegg on the team. But they didn't tone down the action for a moment and Cruise looks as smooth as he ever did doing the stunts and crazy scenes.<br/><br/>I hope that this is a comeback of sorts for star and producer Tom Cruise. This made me see the star quality that made Cruise who he is. He is simply bad-ass as Hunt and there has been a general progression to his character through these films since 1996 and Ethan is a little darker, a little more jaded, but still ready for anything. As much as they'd like co-star Jeremy Renner to take over this series I don't think it could survive without Cruise in some capacity. Jeremy Renner is, however, very good in his role as newcomer to the team Brandt. He has a dark side to him, and a mysterious background that adds to the plot. He has good chemistry with Cruise and doesn't take away from the star of the series. I was a little wary with having Simon Pegg as part of the main team. He was okay as a very small gadgets guy in Mission Impossible 3 and as it turns out he actually fit in pretty well in this one too. He was obviously the comic relief but it was used mostly carefully although I think still just a tad too much. Paula Patton is the newest lady on the team and she does well but I don't think she has quite the same amount of on screen charisma as previous Mission Impossible girls. Michael Nyqvist (of the original The Girl With Dragon Tattoo fame) is decent as the main villain. He certainly looks the part and does his job well enough although much like Patton I'm not sure he was the best villain in the series.<br/><br/>One of the most amazing scenes of the entire series and in action film history is the explosion of the Kremlin which was absolutely mind blowing special effects. As with previous instalments of the franchise there are just a few key scenes that are absolutely riveting and stunning to watch and as action fans you will want to cry out loud at how cool they really are. There is also some great cameos at the end for fans of the franchise that hold together that ever important continuity to the whole series. This is one action flick you can't let pass you by and if you have yet to see the entire series, then you're truly missing out, with the exception of Mission Impossible 2 which was a bit of a mis-step I think. This was one of the greats in 2011 as late in the year as it came. Keep them coming!! 9/10"
"vishalsadaphal","8","5","9","17 December 2011"," Awesome!
","Best action flick of the year!<br/><br/>The awesome cinematography just helps the case. I would have loved to hear better use of the MI theme though. It's a lil boring in parts, but you're too engaged to notice these flaws. Its without doubt the best film of the series so far.<br/><br/>Watch it for sure, and if you do, watch it on IMAX. I've never seen the audience clap without any particular reason, but they did today for the spectacular sequences shot using the IMAX camera. They left me spellbound. I am definitely going to watch it again. Normally, sequels are not that good, but MI3 was better than MI1 which itself was a classic. MI4 has exceeded all of them. I am extremely eager to watch the next movie whenever it is made."

","-- www.Ramascreen.com --<br/><br/>Your mission this weekend, should you choose to accept it, is to go watch MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – GHOST PROTOCOL because it is downright awesome! What a great way to end 2011. It's non stop adrenaline rush from start to end. The IMAX sequences are exhilarating. The best Mission: Impossible movie yet. Tom Cruise is even crazier than I thought. Say what you want but he's still the man! Director Brad Bird's first live action movie is a success, he is after all the director of one of the most creative and elaborate action films of the last decade, The Incredibles. MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – GHOST PROTOCOL is the reason why you and I love going to the movies <br/><br/>I wasn't a big fan of the first two Mission: Impossible movies because the first one had a twist that was irritating and the second one relied too heavily on John Woo's love for slo-mo and doves. Both films didn't have solid stories that I could hold on to and their action scenes only went so far. The previous installment, Mission Impossible III, directed by J.J. Abrams, was a step in the right direction. It was more or less like a movie version of Alias, because it carried much of the spy series' concept, but with Tom Cruise as the star. MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – GHOST PROTOCOL is an upgrade and it's got 'fun' written all over it.<br/><br/>All of the characters in this film have complications of their own, keep in mind that these movies are essentially about teamwork. Even the old series that this franchise is based on was about teamwork. Which is another thing why the first two movies didn't impress me but the third and this one did. Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt may be the leader but Mission: Impossible should not just be about him, he's not James Bond.<br/><br/>To me, Hunt is a daredevil, he's the kind of guy who wouldn't think twice about throwing himself in front of a speeding bus if it means defeating a terrorist's plan. Cruise control is back! Cruise almost always runs or sprints in his movies and boy does he run in this one or what! That scene atop the tallest building in the world, Burj Khalifa, will blow your mind. Any audience who's afraid of heights would grab their seat's armrests even tighter. You'll have newfound respect for Cruise after watching him do his Spidey/Cirque du Soleil stunt. I think it's a brilliant move to have some of the sequences shot in IMAX because I personally think it's a more immersive experience than any post-convert 3D could ever offer.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg returns as the computer and tech geek Benji who is now also a field agent, so Pegg's comic relief job is not tied to his desk anymore, it's more about him being nervous and excited, trying to look cool and badass like Ethan. Should he wear masks? Could he shoot? He's like a kid who wants to try everything. There are two new agents introduced in this installment, the beautiful Paula Patton plays an agent who's dealing with her own thirst for revenge. There's a certain girl fight in this film that's pretty hardcore. Jeremy Renner is a chief analyst with certain skills and secrets of his own. We get to see how all these four individuals eventually come to trust each other.<br/><br/>I love the opening credit and the ending and how they make 'ghost protocol' and Ethan Hunt look ghostly, as if they could disappear into thin air. It speaks about the life of a secret agent. The actions drive the story, what's interesting about this movie is that every mission the team takes on, whether it's in Kremlin or Mumbai or Dubai, something always happens that doesn't make the plan go smoothly so that intensifies the thrill. It takes you to new levels of danger and threat that are ever present and imminent, you wonder how it would all work out, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – GHOST PROTOCOL is an absolute blast!<br/><br/>-- www.Ramascreen.com --"

","Mission Impossible 4 Ghost Protocol: By just having a look to the trailer, one might thought that if this movie would be in 3D then it might be very attractive but I think it was an example of a perfect action movie ever seen. first of all it insulted the Russian Government - second it advertised Dubai and India for those who interested in traveling. but the most interesting part is Tom Cruise himself, because he was the same Tom Cruise as 10 years ago was Tom Cruise. He hasn't changed he is very experienced in playing such roles and he is very successful I think. the movie had many breathtaking scenes I have ever seen especially those explosion scenes. In my view the weak point of the movie related to the last part of the film where Tom Cruise attempted to counteract and neutralize the bomb and fought with the person who hold the suitcase because he fell almost many times from top to bottom but he was fine no injury or no problem it was far to logic :) . but it was fascinating movie and it has worth to watch."

","The first Mission Impossible film disappointed me very much. I was a fan of the original MI TV series. I thought the first MI film stripped everything good about the TV series and made it a one-man show for its star, Tom Cruise. So much was my disappointment that I did not even care to watch the second and third installments. However, the trailers for this fourth installment, with its exploding Kremlin and the hi-jinx in the Dubai glass skyscraper captured my attention. Also, the presence of Jeremy Renner as a new co-star also added to my interest to see this one. And I am sure glad I did.<br/><br/>All the action promised in the trailer were delivered in high style, and more! Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team were accused of blowing up the Kremlin, and were thus left high and dry by the US government. As they move on their own to prove their innocence, at the same time they had to avert a nuclear catastrophe that would bring about another world war. This plot took the audience from Budapest to Moscow to Dubai and to Mumbai as Hunt and his team (Simon Pegg, Paula Patton and Jeremy Renner) follow the trail of mad nuclear terrorist Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist). Tom Cruise does show signs of age here already, but he is as invincible as ever. Simon Pegg is entertaining as the computer nerd, and comic relief. Paula Patton I have never seen before, but she is an exotic beauty and realistic Amazon. Jeremy Renner adds another feather to his impressive acting cap since ""The Hurt Locker."" <br/><br/>Aside from the Kremlin and Burj Khalifa scenes I have mentioned, there were also exciting foot and car chases throughout the film, particularly impressive were those shot in a huge sandstorm. There were also old- fashioned fist-fights thrown in to balance out the hi-tech computer stuff. Of course, I had to suspend disbelief for a lot of the seemingly physically-impossible stunts pulled off, especially on the Burj. But they looked very good on screen! Director Brad Bird was able to achieve his animated-style vision into startlingly-convincing live action. This will surely satisfy any action movie fan, as it did me. The teamwork required to achieve their mission was showcased front and center. That renewed my faith in the franchise and I look forward to their next adventure."

Cobalt, plans to begin a Nuclear War and he hires the killer Sabine Moreau (Léa Seydoux) to steal the Russian launch codes in Budapest while he erases his records in the Kremlin. <br/><br/>Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is assigned with his team to retrieve Hendricks's identity in the Kremlin, but the terrorist arrives first and bomb the Kremlin. The IMF is blamed for the bombing and the President of USA invokes the Ghost Protocol, shutting down the organization. Ethan Hunt and his team travel to Dubai first and to Mumbai later trying to clear the name of IMF and avoid Hendricks from bombing USA and begin the war.<br/><br/>""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" is an entertaining adventure with good doses of action, tension and humor. When I see this franchise, I always imagine if, for example, Gerard Butler were the lead actor instead of the shorty Tom Cruise. Michael Nyqvist, from the original Millennium, is the villain of the story in his second American film. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Missão: Impossível - Protocolo Fantasma"" (""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"")"
"jubisgul","8","6","12","16 January 2012"," Mission Implausible: Suspending Reality
","Mission Impossible brings the concept of Willful Suspension of Disbelief to a completely new level. In the fourth installment of the Mission Impossible series, the plot line of the first movie is brought back: Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is disavowed after a failed mission. In this movie he has his two teammates: Benji Dunn( played by Simon Pegg) and Jane Carter (played by Paula Patton) plus an analyst William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) to help him stop a madman with the ability to trigger a nuclear war.<br/><br/>And if the whole premise seems absurdly unreal, that is just the beginning. During the course of the movie, the team somehow travels between five different countries while on the top of the US and Russia terrorist list, Hunt tracks a bad guy through a sandstorm, Benji hacks into the Kremlin security system, the team remodels the tallest building in the world, and finally Hunt survives a fifteen foot drop inside a car. <br/><br/>Of course, to make it even more realistic, all their equipment is conveniently given to them in a fully loaded train car with everything they could possibly need that was somehow overlooked by the US and Russia. By the way, did I mention the part where magnets affect only the Brant and not the metal screws or actual metal computer that he is maneuvering in (and the computer somehow did not cook him when they turned off the cooling fan.)<br/><br/>In addition to this, somehow America fails to respond to seeing a missile heading toward San Francisco .Finally, there is the part where they use a flash drive to override military grade firewalls. <br/><br/>However, despite all this, Ghost Protocol was entertaining and I spent the entire time on the edge of my seat. And even with the lack of reality, the movie was not two hours wasted. However unreal it was, this movie is a must see. <br/><br/>So remember, WILLFUL SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF: Don't over think the movie.Just enjoy it...because you undoubtedly will."

","Tom Cruise is still good when it comes to action.. he fits the role of a top agent.. this sequel have a good script and was only divulged in the later part of the movie when it was found out that indeed it was Hunt who was protecting his wife all along. All of the actors played their part accordingly, got lots of laugh too.. nice work Mr. Pegg.. ha ha.. Jeremy Renner's role is mysterious and we hope to see more of his character in another sequel.. Paula Patton looks hot in the movie too.. To top it all I like the ""live action scenes"" - no doubles equals much respect to the actors and stunt crew.. there are a lot of challenging scenes featured in the film like the part where Cruise have to climb up the hotel in Dubai.. nice locations too.. very scenic.. a good movie indeed."
"Excalibur27","10","4","7","19 December 2011"," Far surpassed expectations! MUST SEE MOVIE!!!!
","I admit I am a fan of the previous 'MI' films (except for MI2), and I was already looking forward to 'Ghost Protocol'. But even my expectations were blown skyhigh with this EXTREMELY entertaining romp. Easily the best popcorn movie of the year, and quite frankly, one of the best spy adventures in quite a number of years. 'Ghost Protocol' has Out-Bonded Bond himself.<br/><br/>There are eyepopping action sequences, a huge variety of locations and settings, and just enough character drama to keep things bubbling along with tension, humor, and an unabashed sense of style and fun.<br/><br/>The cast are very likable and all deliver solid performances. Jeremy Renner pulls off his character arc with expert subtlety, and his subplot has a pleasantly surprising emotional weight to it. The gorgeous (and I do mean GORGEOUS) Paula Patton brings passion and heart to her role. The returning Simon Pegg adds perfectly timed levity to the often nerve-wracking action scenes. And Tom Cruise brings all the intensity, charm, and old-school moviestar magnetism as the IMF's top agent, Ethan Hunt. Looking amazingly fit and youthful, Cruise still adds an older world-weary dimension to Ethan this time around, that makes the character feel more rounded and interesting.<br/><br/>The ONLY minor nitpick that I have (and I do mean MINOR), is that the villain could have been fleshed out a bit more. Instead, he comes across as a little weak and generic. But director Brad Bird is so assured with his pacing and constantly lights more and more fuses to keep you glued to the screen, that the blandness of Michael Nqvist's baddie doesn't seem too glaring. Plus the fact that all the main characters are so appealing.<br/><br/>Trust me, towards the end, Brad Bird piles on so many different escalating crises on top of each other that the intensity becomes almost unbearable. It reminds us why we love cinema in the first place. This is a movie with a capital 'M'.<br/><br/>There are quite a few surprises in this film for those who have seen the previous 'MI' movies that are very satisfying. And the closing scene will melt even the most cynical of hearts.<br/><br/>So my message to you is BELIEVE THE CRITICS on this one. It has 95% fresh rating on Rotton Tomatoes for a reason. This is quite possibly the best of all the 'MI' films, and the most purely entertaining, thrilling, imaginative, and utterly enjoyable movie of this season. By far.<br/><br/>Oh, I also would say this is a film that MUST be seen on IMAX. It is a ripping good ride on the regular screens, but in IMAX it becomes a true roller-coaster experience. I had never been to IMAX before, and it was so much fun.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"sai_kiran95","9","4","7","18 December 2011"," The best action entertainer of the year. Must watch it on IMAX screen.
","This movie is one of the best action entertainer of the year. I watched the movie on IMAX screen and thrilled by the action episodes. It was very thrilling to watch Tom Cruise jumping from ""Burj Kahlifa"" and running on it(Tom did these scenes with out a dupe and they are superb on big screen). The characters played by Simon Pegg, Jeremy Runner and Paula Patton are fun to watch. The action sequences especially, chase scenes in Sand Storm are amazing to watch. I didn't watch any Brad Bird(Director)past movies but after watching this movie I felt that we can expect some good action entertainers from him. Everyone in the cast and crew excelled. <br/><br/>Don't miss this fun, action entertainer and Please watch this movie on IMAX screen. One word I can say is ""Ethan Hunt is back""."
"grainstorms","6","5","10","19 February 2013"," As always, should you or any of your viewing accomplices be bored or use the movie as a sleeping pill, the Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions.
","""Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol"" is an example of what might be called latter-day ""wowpunk,"" recent movies that make absolutely no sense but are fun to watch, because of their gadgetry, whiz-bang effects and non-stop action. You will need a large screen though to enjoy the circus. There is an actor named Tom Cruise who gets star billing, but he is probably a cartoon, as are all the other ""humans"" to be seen. His part was not written but apparently sketched in. There is absolutely no reason for what his character does or goes through. Other characters talk to him. Sometimes he answers them. More often he hits them or shoots them, or gets hit or shot himself. When he runs, the camera action is speeded up so that he apparently outruns cars, boats, and, of course, helicopters.. You just know that justice will triumph in the end, and that all concerned will go on to another romp based on the ancient ""Mission Impossible"" TV series, where some inventive sci-fi gadgetry papered over bad acting and moronic scripts. <br/><br/>The director, Brad Bird, who up to now has been known for directing cartoons, brings his animation world-view to the job and creates a universe peopled by cartoons composed of flesh – they walk and talk like humans, but their actions, motivations and expectations are strictly those of Road Runner and Elmer Fudd. Things happen to them, bad things similar to those good old Walter Lantz tropes of grand pianos and bank vaults falling from the sky and driving characters into the ground. All of this makes for an adolescent's idea of heaven, with weaponry – automatic guns that are never aimed but just pointed in the general direction of a victim usually find their target as though by magic and rarely run out of ammo; computers – laptops and smart phones, slightly dated in their design, but with great apps for taking over the world; and a backpack of gadgets that Batman would have given his Bat-teeth for, all of which make the job of the good guys simple as pie. The scenery is eye-filling and expensive but slightly seedy, like the world itself today. Characters whip around the world, apparently on magic carpets, to exotic venues to do nasty things to each other. We visit the Kremlin, which seems to have the grandeur of your old high school, a Russian prison populated by easily excitable gentlemen; Dubai, where some great, great effects manage to make this film more than just color and noise (here's where a super-sized screen would be nice to own); and Mumbai, where a grand reception apparently catered by a demented wedding planner (look for a hilariously ill rehearsed though enthusiastic troupe of dancers) provides a background of intrigue, danger and the requisite seduction/assault. This picture commits many sins, including excessive product placement (for long stretches you may think you're in some Best Buy outlet, where they dump their outmoded, unsold electronics ) and an inability or refusal to use the talents of some interesting actors. For instance, Tom Cruise, whose production company gets credit for this movie -- which was a box office smash, the most profitable of the MI series-- is a caricature of himself, and at times is hardly recognizable, even when not wearing the intricate disguises that Mission Impossible dotes on. (Look for an absurd though funny scene where Cruise plays the youngest and most American general in the Russian army ) If not exactly showcases of acting and writing, The Mission Impossible movies can be improbably enjoyable. And should you decide to accept the trouble of watching them, they're also fun to pick apart."
"derek-d-elko","7","5","10","22 January 2012"," Derek's Movie Review
","Mission Impossible IV is everything you've already seen in a secret agent movie. Creative displays of concept technology, gruesome fight sequences, female prowess, personal relationships as side plots, and witty/comedic interjections. Despite you probably knowing exactly what I'm talking about, I left the movie happy with such conformity because of the purity and patience through which these elements were displayed<br/><br/>The plot is very easy to follow and rightfully so. We see these movies for the fighting, cool gadgets, and to see Tom Cruise sprint with 90 degree-bent arms (me and Kevin think he looks funny running). The plot is usually a bonus. But Brad Bird finds a way to let the plot add believability and really understand why certain routes have to be done. In other words, most of the time, these missions seemed necessary;something that the previous MI's didn't have. I left the other three asking why they had to go so far fetched with some of the action sequences and showed so much ass all the time. The same goes with the comedy. I hate nothing more than the pot-brownie mom in Transformers II! At least in MI4 they have jokes that freshen the plot, not deviate from it (frickin' brownie scene in transformers bugs me!)<br/><br/>Yes, to be sure, it had those few scenes that have your neighbors grabbing your forearm and getting nervous in the front row (my mom). The ""slip from the ledge and somehow have the unheralded strength to hold on with two fingers after falling 30 feet"" type of cheese. But, it is a ridiculous premise in the first place, and I was somewhat pleased to know that Brad Bird reminds us not to take it too seriously. As a matter of fact, he makes us welcome it. We're not trying to pull a Batman Begins of comics here. We're trying to make a sequel that sticks to the formula, but takes just enough cheese off the dinner table so that we don't drive home stuffed. 7/10"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","5","10","23 December 2011"," Fourth installment still holding up
","This 4th installment has been well received, and for good reasons. It stays very firmly on course towards its mission: to entertain. <br/><br/>It's little odd to start at the middle but let me show how it makes sense. It's about an hour into the movie when the mission officially starts. It's also a situation that is unlike anything that we've seen before. The IMF (forget the messy debts problem in Europe) is effectively shut down and outlawed, reduced to only 4 people who happen to still have control of a disguised railway carriage that contains a reasonable supply of gadgets and arsenal, but a far cry from the immense backup they used to enjoy from the entire organization. What leads towards this point is important, although not entirely apparent initially. <br/><br/>It goes like this. IT wizard cum comical side kick Benji (Simon Pegg) and beautiful femme fatale Jane (Paula Patton) team up to rescue Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) from a Russian prison, the former he apparently knows quite well while the later he meets for the first time. Later, still in Russia, when his superior IMF Secretary (a brief, un-credited cameo by Tom Wilkinson) and an ""analyst"" assistant Brandt (Jeremy Renne) whom he has never met before are in the process of briefing him on the situation, an ambush kills the Secretary. That takes us to the point cited above, when the four team members who are thrown together, by fate to a degree, plan their mission.<br/><br/>The mission: to stop a mad Russian villain, who believes that destroying the entire human race once in a while is good, from starting a nuclear war. That's all you need to know, although there are of course intrigues, twists, human stories and the rest of them in a standard Hollywood super blockbuster thriller menu. What you are there to see is really the fantastic set pieces, and there are not a few. I'll skip the details. And if you still haven't heard about the scene at Dubai's Burj Hkalifa Tower, you probably don't live on this earth.<br/><br/>The cast is one to boast about. After ""Hurt locker"" everybody knows that Renner is one who can act. Pegg, who can be outrageously black-humour (think ""Hot Fuzz""), is pure fun here. Visible minority beauty this time is Patton who, after launching herself in ""Déjà Vu"", is well positioned for stardom. Playing the villain is none other than Michael Nyqvist from the original ""Girl with a dragon tattoo"", making a convincing show of his dark side here. A delightful find is Lea Seydoux playing a deadly assassin. Those who have watched ""Midnight in Paris"" will remember her as lovely Gabrielle, Owen Wilson's character's new found love interest at the end of the movie. Finally, in addition to Wilkinson, there are two other uncredited cameos: Ving Rhames and Michelle Monaghan"
"zabikhan09","7","5","10","18 December 2011"," Scaling New Heights...
","In this installment of Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol Ethan Hunt is joined by fellow agents Jane Carte (Paula Patton) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), who previously appeared in the third film, and analyst William Brandt (Jeremy Renner). Forced to operate without any official support as IMF is shut down, the team have to stop the codes for a nuclear device falling into the wrong hands while on the run after being falsely accused of committing an act of terrorism.The characters are better built up in ways better than the previous installments, and a real sense of mutual trust emerges amongst the members, having to emphasize on the importance of the teamwork rather than the individual.<br/><br/>Brad Bird (Director) successfully inhabits the film with such technology with the right amount of tech speak to make the audience accept what is being seen. It also helps that most of the devices do have some grounding in the real world.Also there is a strong theme of unreliability of technology throughout the film allowing the action sequences to be inventive and surprising. This extends to the human characters who all have moments of hesitation and nervousness, and occasionally allow emotions to get in the way of their work.This results in improvisation by the characters throughout the film.The Stunts are brilliant and the best is the scaling of Burj Al Khalifa in Dubai, which takes stunting to a whole new level.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible 4 stands as one of the big-studio highlights of the year—it's smart, sharp and stylish fun just in time for the holiday and a Definite watch!"

Jeremy Renner delivered some good performances, but Cruise topped with great performances. I would say, introducing Jeremy renner instead of Jonathan Rhys Meyers to the film was totally a good idea. Coz, Jeremy has got the screen presence apart from JRM. <br/><br/>A perfect choice for the Fall movie.. Majority of stunt sequences are interesting, appealing and thrilling.<br/><br/>This is one of the top movie of Tom Cruise. And i will give 9 out of 10"
"samratrc1417","9","5","10","17 December 2011"," The best ever MI...Beats the first one hands down..
","Ghost Protocol-Whatever that means, has laid down the ghosts of MI-II and III. They were good but not this good. Brad Bird's directorial debut shows that he's equally comfortable in a live action movie as he is doing an animated feature. The script chosen is top notch and the audience really was kept guessing as to what happens next. The locales were exotic-Moscow,Dubai,& Mumbai.<br/><br/>This is a Tom Cruise vehicle through and through. He shows us why he is the biggest star in the world save perhaps a few. He still does his stunts (or so I am told-at this age)and stunts in an MI movie were aplenty. Humor is also thrown in a liberal doses, which makes it refreshing. Simon Pegg tickles your funny bones, Paula Patton brings in the oomph factor - never seen her before but she's hot. Renner as Brandt has some skeletons in the closet but he's the new member in team Hunt. Wonder why they did away with Ving Rhames - he was good. Micheal Nyquist - Those of you who know who he is (Dragon Tattoo anyone?) is good in his character. Wonder where he got his British accent from (He's Swedish)? Or did they do a voice-over? And Tom Cruise is immaculate. The best action movie of 2011 and I am glad they didn't go the Arab terrorist route. Its well worth the watch. Money and time well spent."
"Somak21","9","5","10","17 December 2011"," 'Impossible' to Miss
","At first, let me clarify that I'm a huge fan of Tom Cruise, so if anyone thinks that I've overrated then guilty as charged. If I come to expectations then it will be a total loss of words cause since the news has spread that MISSION IMPOSSIBLE will have it's 4th part, the whole world waited for its teaser or trailer and when it released the movie was hugely expected by many corners of world. <br/><br/>If any of my review readers have watched M: I 4, then they have surely realized that this one's the best Action Thriller of recent times. Mission Impossible Legacy has gone through many experts. Brian De Palma started this high-tech thriller series. John Woo modified the 1st part and instead of using much technology, he concentrated on the thrill part & story. Mission: Impossible III is called as the best of the trilogy as it was triple intense, triple advanced and triple mayhem. <br/><br/>Now, come to Mission : Impossible 4 - Ghost Protocol. The term ""Ghost Protocol"" is used brilliantly and ""why"" will be answered the moment you watch the movie. It's a challenge that this one's so intense that the viewer's mind can't be distracted while watching the movie. And as the story unfolds, we see new situations, new thrills and action sequences. The sequences are so awesome this time that one can't forget them. Some are - <br/><br/>1. The collision of KREMLIN, Russia 2. Ethan's sky-scraping scene 3. The chase in sandstorm 4. The Climax<br/><br/>The story in short is The IMF is shut down when it's implicated in the bombing of the Kremlin and suspects reveal that Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team Jane ( Paula Patton) and Benji (Simon Pegg) are behind this. To save their organization's name Ethan, Jane, Benji and Brandt (Jeremy Renner) setup on a mission to find the mastermind behind this who is Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist). No Plan. No Backup. No Choice.<br/><br/>Brad Bird is one of the finest directors of this time but his experiments were only animated (Though hugely successful). THE IRON GIANT, RATATOUILLE & THE INCREDIBLES - three of them are hugely appreciated all over. His debut as a real-life movie that also the saga of Mission Impossible was immensely tough for anyone. But we can see that he is outstandingly talented as a director and he can handle any kind of movie and very well he does. This Oscar-winner animator has given us the best of him this time. Michael Giacchino, The Oscar-winner yet again gives some nice scores with a great use of M:I theme. Robert Elswit, another Oscar-winner in the crew, the cinematographer was excellent in shooting Russia, Dubai & India and every scene was fantastically shot. His work should be listed as one of the best contributions to the movie. Special Effects by Hamish Bennett, James Bomalick etc. are awesome, just awesome.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is a blockbuster powerhouse himself. His smartness, his acting, his heroism, his intelligence and ability to do deadly stunts ---- from 'A' to 'Z', it's a Tom Cruise flick. At the last scene when we see Ethan's wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) staring at him & Ethan also doing the same, the moment should be called the most beautiful moment in M:I history. From Action to expression, Intelligence to charm - Tom Cruise proves that no one in Hollywood could have done ETHAN HUNT better than him. <br/><br/>Paula Patton as Jane was very down to her role. She did awesome as a IMF agent irrespective of being a woman. Simon Pegg was the real entertainer. Special credits to Jeremy Renner as Brandt. A commendable job by him raised the beauty of the movie. Michael Nyqvist as Hendricks was seen sometimes but that was also a joy to watch. Anil Kapoor, the 'tharki' Indian was a funny fare. Josh Holloway in an extra short role of Agent Hanaway was fine.<br/><br/>Finally, 'Mission Impossible 4 - Ghost protocol' to me is one of the many proofs of why I love Tom Cruise so much? Not only is he the most beautiful hunk but also he is gifted with every quality that a hero requires. Powerful performances by lead actors and eye-popping visual effects make M:I 4 a must watch this season. It can heat your blood this winter if you're a die hard action-movie fan. Most of all, it's a must must must watch for Tum Cruise fans.<br/><br/>As a conclusion Mission: Impossible 4 - Ghost protocol is a super action flick with eye-popping special effects and a terrific storyline which the movie abides by start to end. There was not a single scope of a dull moment and viewers didn't have a single second to divert their minds elsewhere. One of my friends said that ""Bollywood is advancing its standard to Hollywood in technique used in movies and RA. One proves it"". He got a reply from me ""That's a very long way ahead, lad""(and M:I 4 proves it)."
"beanshell081299","1","10","25","27 January 2012"," Tom Cruise is a uneducated man.
","Tom is a man who has no grasp on human nature and the inherent genetical mistakes that happen in human beings. I have never forgiven him for his statements on how we as a people do not need prescriptions for ANY malady of the mind. i.e.. Bipolar, which I am, and yes without my meds I would be a dangerous unstable person.<br/><br/>But I guess this piece of garbage actor is without human compassion and his acting is below sub par. <br/><br/>If I didn't believe in God I would wish some horrible mental issues on him or his children but I'll let God and Karma slap this man in the face.<br/><br/>I did see the movie for the effects and maybe because I can't get past who Tom is in his personal life I hated it. He is a self-righteous, disappointing real piece of work. And since his Matt Lauer interview where he attacks Brooke Shields for having depression and hence taking medication to help her deal with that unfortunate state I will never be able to enjoy his movies, past or future I am guessing.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie is interesting in it's storyline, cutting edge effects and stunts but I cannot get passed the man who headlines this movie."
"darima","5","8","19","19 December 2011"," very unrealistic should be considered as fairytale
","I agree with some previous critics - MI4 is praised much above reasonable. I have noticed that immediately after release almost any high budget movie on IMDb is overrated. Later on the rate decreases slowly. I suppose it happens, when amount of real votes increases. So I believe that there are really some kind of unhealthy promotion of the title using IMDb's resources.<br/><br/>MI4 - is a typical Hollywood movie with it's strong and weak sides. Strong side means a lot of money in budget - so effects and possibilities of shooting is behind imagination.<br/><br/>And the main weakness of many Hollywood movies is presented in MI4 as well. That is a special craft of Hollywood in making almost any non-English speaking nation around the world aggravated, when Hollywood makes a movie about that specific nation. As a terrific example of that you can take ""Anna and the King"" which was prohibited for showing in movie theaters in Thailand for an assault of Royal Rama's dynasty. I have never been in Emirates, but I believe that such kind of sand storms in one of their main cities is impossible.<br/><br/>The movie is full of clichés - such as technically demented Russians, very dull and dark Moscow, Indian party with Indian dancers, unkempt main Russian investigator (for sure it is because every Russian is unkempt, untidy and always drunk). I am already tired of such kind of Hollywood movie. I hoped this one would be better. I was wrong.<br/><br/>So my vote is 5 out of 10. Only because the movie gives some adrenaline rush. But it is nothing if to compare with such 10 vote blockbuster as first ""Die Hard"" for example."

","Few months ago when I noticed that MI4 is launching out this December, I was ecstatic and really looking forward to this movie. Then,when the trailer came out, my expectation of this movie boosted. Beautifully made.<br/><br/>From deep down of my heart, unfortunately it was not as good as I expected. Frankly speaking, it was much worse than I expected. If you ask me or question why do I have such a bad impression? This may sounds ironic but I really can't tell! I can't suggest any concrete evidence. Every actors and actresses did a really good job. Especially, Simon Pegg and Jeremy Renner. They played extraordinarily well. Hilarious and cool. So, how about the plot? Although, its a bit predictable, its exhilarating and lots of small surprises.<br/><br/>I was thinking over and over again with this paradoxical feelings for the past few hours and I finally found a quite suitable explanation for my disenchantment with this movie. MI4 INTENDS to make and create a very tense atmosphere, but it failed. Conversely, it created a dull atmosphere. Both people sitting beside me keep on yawning and watching their watch all over the movie.<br/><br/>Well, thats all my opinion towards MI4, don't take my words for granted, read some more good critics before you decide watching this movie. Probably, I had a really high expectation. But yeah, I would not recommend watching this movie in a cinema. My overall rating for this movie is a 6 out of 10"
"Mr-Fusion","8","3","5","19 May 2014"," Tense and exciting, this is a great entry into the series.
","What's really surprising about ""Ghost Protocol"" is that Brad Bird, its man at the helm, made the jump entirely from animated fare - and he's remarkably capable with action movie staging and direction. Color me impressed. <br/><br/>The disbanding of IMF is a novel approach to changing up the franchise. Without support, these superspies are forced to improvise to the nth degree, giving this movie an unpredictable edge. The core group of actors gel together pretty well (with Cruise continuing his unique brand of age-defying ass-kickery; man, that guy is nuts), and it's a team I'd see again in a future installment. That stuff with Ethan's wife at the end was a little much, but his walk into the vapors more than made up for it. <br/><br/>This series still has some kick left in it. A great collection of popcorn action movie talents.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>Also: my god, Paula Patton is unnervingly good-looking."
"desert-jackets","9","3","5","23 September 2013"," Wow! Best Film of the year, Simply a must-watch!!
","So finally a great and iconic Tom Cruise starred another action thriller. No any clumsy stuff like the last movie, no efforts to illustrate how fascinating Ethan Hunt is, and neither there are any obvious efforts to represent how cool he is. A fantastic action movie with Tom Cruise who knows what he is doing for best: Action! This movie has got everything which an action movie could have; guns, explosions, cool gadgets, hot cars, beautiful girls, sandstorms, jumping off the tallest building, and having one decent enough story. The story I found in this movie was quite firm. Nothing revolutionary but enough to maintain the attention of the crowd throughout the film. The performance was generally good on all sides. Simon Pegg was pleasurable as Benji and Tom Cruise is forever great as Ethan Hunt. Some great performances were given by Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton also.<br/><br/>Every single actor in the film has performed brilliantly. Paula Patton was very usual in her acting, Simon Pegg was amusing as always with his timely liners and Jeremy Renner was amazingly superb as well. Out of all Ghost Protocol, this is the best Mission Impossible sequence mostly because it is unlike from its forerunners. It is packed with action scenes from the very first scene till the last and is packed with great stunts, car chases and cool gadgets.<br/><br/>The acting was very well performed. Returning after 5 years in this series, Tom Cruise still got his secret agent skills in this movie. Paula Patton did a bad girl character and was well-played. Simon Pegg as the awkward but mastermind Benji Dunn was wonderful. Jeremy Renner as the so-called-analyst-but- actually-IMF-agent William Brandt was stunning and great. The performances of the entire team were very strong and persuasive. The best part of this blockbuster movie is the use of amazing leather jackets by Tom Cruise. Anybody will fall in love by wearing this incredible jacket since it is made with genuine leather and has many features. This outstanding jacket and many more are available exclusively at Desert leather.com where there is a wide range of Hollywood style leather jackets. I literally loved all the part in this movie. It showed the mutuality of technology useful these days and their influential abilities of using it. It's stimulated me of ideas of some part in the movie. It also showed some luxurious places and locations which I found very contented. The theme of this movie is amazingly outstanding.<br/><br/>All these elements are very well played and balanced together to form a thrilling, fast-paced, and breathtaking, yet action ride a must to experience. I think we should thank mastermind director Brad Bird for successfully refreshing the movie series. A good 9 out of 10!!"

","Complete in every sense, the film takes you through a fantastic ride. I am not a big Fan of action films but this should be considered a different genre. The film continues vaguely in continuation with the third film. It follows the journey of Ethan hunt with an entire new crew to numerous places which include the climax in India. No doubt the best part of the film is its authentic action.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>The cinematography, stunts, cast, sound, the story, everything is possibly the best in this part of the Mission Impossible series. You again meet Ethan doing death defying stunts, the 5 second messages, the missions to be accepted. Many of these things are now a trademark, but even if you see them again and again, you do not feel bored. The adrenaline rush is going to be high at most of the times. Good to see a story not attached emotionally with family like the third part. Nuclear warfare seems to be the favorite thing for scriptwriters. Well the focus at most of the times will not be on the actual problem but how they actually proceed to solve it.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is looking too old. Now should be the time to find some replacement. But it will be difficult to see anyone else as Ethan.<br/><br/>MESSAGE: ""Plan properly.""<br/><br/>VERDICT: ""A must watch action film."""

","Is the mission really impossible when you have Ethan Hunt on your side? Three blockbuster films later and Ethan has yet to encounter a mission in which he has failed to accomplish. However, this time is different – he's got no backup, no plan and no other alternatives.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible – Ghost Protocol, debuted on December 7th, 2012, is the fourth film of the Mission Impossible franchise. Director Brad Bird, who made his first ever live-action film definitely succeeds by showcasing the stylishly cool moments with the essential character drama and the usual fast paced action scenes.<br/><br/>In contrast to the prior three films, the plot for Ghost Protocol is quite linear. Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt is once again the centerpiece of a cast that includes an array of new and familiar faces. Ethan starts off momentarily confined in a Russian prison. However, he is immediately rescued by two IMF agents, Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Jane Carter (Paula Patton). From there it was only a matter of time before he and his team is caught in a mysterious scheme that results in the destruction of the Moscow Kremlin, as well as the termination of the entire IMF. Now, with the whole IMF disavowed, Ethan and a new team that also includes William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) will race against time to track down Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist), who plays a dangerous terrorist that has gained access to Russian nuclear launch codes and is planning a deadly strike on the United States.<br/><br/>In terms of cinematography, Ghost Protocol does not disappoint. As a matter of fact it may have been at par or even better than its predecessors (M.I. 1, 2, & 3). Starting with the clever scene inside the vault of the Kremlin, where Cruise and Pegg use a virtual reality illusion to deceive a guard. From there, the movie makes its way to one of the thrilling scenes that has Cruise hanging up on the glass windows of the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. This scene is a real nail-biter and will truly bring the audience to the edge of their seats. Add on the car chases and shoot-outs, while using high-tech equipment and the final product is a non-stop action packed thrill ride. <br/><br/>A popular ongoing trend in action movies nowadays is the inclusion of comic relief. With that in mind, Pegg's witty personality combined with the seriousness from Cruise and Brandt draws a similarity to the latest Sherlock Holmes (2011) movie. In term's how Robert Downey Jr's playfully clever personality and Jude Law's humorless character were both able to generate that illustrious on-screen chemistry. Furthermore, the amount of damage that Ethan Hunt's body was able to endure throughout the movie also draws some comparison to one of the James Bond films – Casino Royale (2006). In Casino Royale, James Bond (Daniel Craig) is able to endure a number of action scenes that would just make the audience cringe. Not to mention, another obvious connection that Bond and Hunt share is that they're both highly skilled secret agents. The only difference between the two is their style. James Bond is more elegant and classy because he's always in a suit, whereas Ethan Hunt likes to dress casual and is more nonchalant. So who will win in a fight between Ethan Hunt and James Bond?<br/><br/>Ghost Protocol is by far one of the best action and adventure films in 2011. With a little mystery and a great deal of thrill. Your mission, should you choose to accept it Is to watch the film and enjoy!"
"ummit_sethi","6","23","73","7 December 2011"," Action, yes. Depth, no.
","If you want a mindless couple of hours then sit down and tune out to this which, to be fair, is what you could argue is all that the franchise is really supposed to offer anyway. However, since MI3 took the offering to a whole new level, MI4 fails to get close to those standards. Linear plot, a checklist of stunts and gadgets that feel more like they're ticking boxes than truly complementing a good storyline. Finally, at the most basic level, these films should have great heroes and villains; MI4 gives you the heroes and forgets all about the villain, in doing that MI4 fails to move beyond the formulaic and remains a very single dimensional experience.... disappointing when you're in the position to choose from Hollywood's greatest for a project like this."
"mcoleman1984","5","8","20","27 December 2011"," Even my wife could see through the awful writing...
","I never write reviews, but I had to with this one. This movie was a joke on so many levels. If you have a brain and actually want to know why things are happening and what's going on, please don't watch this. The writers of this movie should have their Screen Writers Guild Memberships revoked permanently. <br/><br/>First I'll start with the Pros: 1.Cinematography and Screenplay: Breathtaking and beautifully done. 2.Nope, that's it! Only one pro!<br/><br/>Now the Cons: 1.Cruise: Was his old self, good as usual but not great. His role was bad because the writing was elementary at best. He was the old Ethan Hunt minus being intelligent, smart, quick on his feet, calculatedetc. He just hit people and jumped off stuff. 2.Female Agent: Horrible casting. She doesn't work, she's not believable. 3.Tech Specialist Agent: Was apparently supposed to be comic relief. He was a joke. 4.Ving Rhames: Not in the movie except for an ending cameo! Unforgivable! 5.Analyst/Other Male Agent: Good actor, bad writing. The story of why he was no longer in the field was weak! You failed a mission and a woman you don't know died so you quit the field? Weak writing! 6.Russian Cops: Ethan evades them like 5 times. Really? Weak writing! 7.Plot: Never developed. We never know who the crazy guy that wants to blow up the World really is, why he wants to do it, and why does he want to make it look like the IMF team was behind it. He wants to start a nuclear war to ""start the World over"". Really? Very weak writing! And why the age old Soviet vs. USA plot? 8.Disavowed IMF team: So we fire all our intelligence, counter- intelligence, espionage and special ops people because a building blew up? We've done a lot worst for a lot less and given people medals for it! Weak writing! 9.Prison Escape: It was too easy and elementary. Especially since we later learn that Ethan didn't know they were coming for him. It looked rehearsed; he knew how to perfectly get through every door. How did he know to wait in that room when the ground opened up? 10.Kremlin: His disguise as the general was weak. The gadget to render the hallway image was cool. He got in and out the Kremlin WAY too easy! Then they blew it up! Come on! Is it that easy to blow up government maximally secured buildings these days? 11.Burj Khalifa Scene: No comment. Just No Comment. 12.Billionaire: Coughs up the codes pretty easy huh? Not to mention he's comical and unrealistic. The female agent is pathetic in this scene as well. She's supposed to be seducing him, but she doesn't, but he's still interested. He's a billionaire at his own party with a whole bunch of rich people and can have any chick he wants, but this bumbling woman catches his eyes? Right! 13.Escaping Death: Ethan AKA Evel Knievel escapes death dozens of times. I mean Mission Impossible, yes, but this stuff was literally unrealistic. Freestyle climbing a skyscraper! Escaping maximum security prison! Surviving a sandstorm! Falling to a steep hundred foot crash head on in a vehicle! All kinds of other jumps! All pretty much unscathed! Give me a break. Did I mention the female agent takes a bullet dead on, but is strong enough to fight on for another 20 min! What! 14.Fight Choreography: A joke! Ethan beats on 2 dozen hardened inmates during his escape, but gets smacked around by a senior citizen with a briefcase in the final fight scene? Why did he have such a hard time getting that briefcase from the guy that looked 20 years older than him! Why did the other male agent have such a hard time with the guy in the electrical room when the tech specialist agent had to come in and shoot him. And the cherry, the chick fight was horrible. It's supposed to be super agent vs. super assassin, but the assassin gets handled pretty swiftly? That sucked! 15.The Launch Code Exchange: The tech specialist agent pulls the old fake arm trick? Really? Really? She conveniently finds the contact lens camera? Really? Horrible writing! 16.Sandstorm: What? First of all, why? What are the odds of this happening precisely when this mission is happening? Then, he runs, fights, and tactically pursues in at 120 miles an hour? What? He just happens to have the goggles? What? The dude gets away? What? 17.The Nuke: This was the most unrealistic of them all. First, you can't just buy warheads, buy launch codes and buy a satellite and poof! It doesn't work that way. If a missile is even aimed at a country, every government in the entire world knows it, it's called counter intelligence and satellites of our own! Even pointing a warhead, much less initializing or launching one is an act of war. This would have never even gotten this far, it's called the Cold War. You're telling me they pointed, initialized, launched and stopped a warhead inches from detonating in a major US city? In reality, it would have never reached the Western hemisphere before being shot down by counter missiles. Who wrote this?<br/><br/>Horrible movie. Just bad."
"Jona1988","8","4","8","8 February 2012"," Best MI movie by far!
","Yes! like my title of this review states this is the best movie in the Mission Impossible series so far. So far because by the success of this I can imagine the producers are eager to make a fifth one. And the success this has been at the box office is well deserved. I can't really say I was a big fan of Mission Impossible until recently, I have never seen the TV show and the first movie has a more classic reputation than it actually deserves. Still the first one was an interesting somewhat different kind of thriller. The first two sequels were far weaker, MI2 was complete crap with almost no story and ridiculously over the top action, number three was a step forward and a pretty entertaining mindless action movie. Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is Brad Birds first live action movie and it almost but not quite lives up to his great animated ones. One thing that this movie managed better than any of the previous ones is the story. The plot of the first one has become known for being complicated while the second has a plot so stupid a retard would be insulted, finally the third film had a clearly flawed but worked acceptable for a mindless popcorn flick. With MI4 they have found the right balance, the plot is understandable without going so far as becoming so simple it's silly, it is serious and interesting without going to the incomprehensible. The story is not Oscar worthy material but it's perfectly considered for this kind of film. The actor's performances are great. I might actually go so far as claiming this has the best of the series. It was great that they expanded Simon Pegg's role. According to me he is better that series recurring Ving Rhames. He supplies some humour without just being a simple comical relief. Tom Cruise is at his best here. He might be a weird guy in real life but as an action actor he is great. Ethan Hunt has grown to this hero one actually cares and wants to follow, his own character not just a James Bond wannabe. Jeremy Renner is a rising star and good here as well. Still his role was smaller than I had thought, it is important but doesn't take any focus away from Hunt. OK the character development might not be chokingly deep for an action movie, definitely not but more than necessary. Mikael Nyqvist as the villain is great. Having seen him in many Swedish movies it fun to see him going international. With this villain I feel they went for the more is less approach and it works brilliant. You don't see a lot of him and when you do short clips. Makes him feel mysterious unlike the over the top Dougray Scott in MI2. I enjoyed the bad guy in the third movie but I must say MI4 had the most memorable in a not easily achieved way. But this is an action flick and that is also where MI4 really succeeds and more than one might have expected. Of course you knew the effects would be top notch but they blow you away not just in that way. Not only are they great visually but it is also very well thought out. There are several scenes that are really clever. Again I must praise the director making this the most well made film in the Mission Impossible series. When I saw the trailer featuring Eminem I got somewhat uneasy. But not to worry this always feels like the MI movie that it is. Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is the best in the MI series in as good as every way plot, character and action. An outstanding action blockbuster!"
"FatMan-QaTFM","Null","4","8","1 February 2012"," Bird Delivers Abrams' Goods
","Brad Bird, oh you masterful animator. You made me cry with Iron Giant, grip the edge of my seat watching The Incredibles, and laugh raucously with the jokes of Rattatouille. Now on to live action, rewarded with the cream of the money crop – the incredibly successful Tom Cruise/Mission Impossible franchise. Bird has the chance to show that animation isn't his only gig.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible 4 opens up with a mission gone wrong and a fun, brutal prison escape that (re)introduces the cast of characters. Once we get that nonsense out of the way – on to the mission. Using high tech gadgetry, fast thinking, and smooth talking, the crack team manages to take down a man set to destroy they world. Once again, the team makes it look easy except<br/><br/>They didn't. Everything went wrong – ""Red is Dead"" – gadgets broke, team members made mistakes, and nothing went quite as planned. It ended up being a major miracle that anything got done at all. It was sort of strange seeing this sort of plot and character development out of a normally polished action series, but I'll give the credit to Brad Bird. Previous Bird films felt very realistic, even when the subject was talking rats in a French kitchen. He has a knack for bringing real issues and conflicts in to otherwise insanely outlandish stories. Maybe I'm giving him too much credit, but Ep. 4 was different enough from most action movies to make me thing J.J. Abrams gave Bird a good bit of leeway in film making.<br/><br/>Beyond the nice bits of conflict, it was very nice film making. I could actually tell who was who and what was going where during action scenes. Smooth camera movement took precedence over shaky cam and ""gritty"" shooting styles. Just how I like it. Top it off with some gutwrenching sound effects and you've got a complete film.<br/><br/>Ghost Protocol wasn't perfect by any means. It had a lot of product placement, some goofy dialog, could have used a trim here and there but it was probably one of the more enjoyable films I saw in 2011. I don't often see movies twice, but when I do, it would be this one."

Now, to the movie I'm reviewing. Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol came out near the end of 2011 and when I heard about I thought about waiting for it to come out on DVD and then a couple of my friends told me to watch it so I took a look at the trailer and thought ""Man, I have to watch this movie!"" And boy am I glad I did. Great action throughout the movie and it is very impressive that Tom Cruise did some of his own stunts in the movie!!

","This is one of the most, if not THE most fast-paced movies that I've ever seen. It's one of the main reasons why I thoroughly enjoyed this film.<br/><br/>Now, I've got to be honest, I haven't really seen the previous Mission Impossible films (I remember seeing some of Mission Impossible III), and I was worried I wouldn't be able to understand this movie, but I did. Brad Bird's live-action directorial debut just worked for me. The action sequences were thrilling and Benji's (Simon Pegg) witty remarks kept me laughing throughout. However, the highlight of my experience has to be the scene involving the Burj Khalifa. For the first time watching any action movie, I was actually scared for a character (Ethan), which surprised me. I was on the edge of my seat, not just for this scene, but for pretty much the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, the film's fast-paced and thrilling action scenes were a big win for me, making this one of my favourite films that I've seen this year."

","Do you remember when we were little, and we went to see a superhero movie, and the minute we get up, we feel like we have lived that adventure? That's how me, a 17 year old guy felt when I went to see Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. I went into the movie theaters excited; for the fact being that I am a huge fan of Tom Cruise's films. But I was also expecting the worse. Time and time again we have slapped in the face with the fact that sequels are just not good. This is one of those rare times, were the films just get better and better. Ghost Protocol, from start to finish made me laugh and jump out of my seat. The intense action sequences and death-defying stunts were incredible. The technology used was so unreal, yet..real! And it's hard to believe it came from such a cartoon crazed director. To create a spy film and make it good, is a task alone. But to push the extremities and make one of the best movies of the year, and on top of that, a sequel to a franchise? It just proves that there is still hope left in Hollywood. There's hardly any films that when you leave, you feel fully satisfied. Well, this movie, definitely should be enlisted in that group! And out of all the Mission Impossible films, this one actually gives impossible feats and makes it seem effortless. At one point in the film when Ethan and the other agent stop the car and realize that they are too late, I actually felt like they really have taken an impossible task. Every time that the group failed at doing something in the movie, they find another way to save the world. With the incredible acting and superior script, this makes the best sequel in the series."

Dell, BMW, Apple, JJ....I'm looking at you!!!! I have nothing personal against Tom Cruise, despite his apparently wacky beliefs and belonging to a rather dubious religious cult. In fact as an actor I think he's great. Tropic Thunder anyone?? Awesome!! But, I think if you're going to be splashing your name all over a big budget movie at least make sure you know what you're getting into. I actually feel sorry for all the actors involved in this movie, except for Anil Kapoor who seemed right at home as a creepy, greasy rich guy as the movie turned into a noisy and confused Bollywood farce. As for some of the other reviewers.... what are you on? ""Better than James Bond"" ""Mission Accomplished"" ""Best in the Franchise"" seriously??? How old are you? Five? or maybe that's your IQ. The plot was paper thin, the continuity was sloppy at best, hell even the laws of physics don't apply in this movie but who cares cause Tom Cruise in it right?

","Ethan Hunt is not James Bond. Ghost protocol is directed by Brad Bird, his first real action venture after Pixar animated movies, and here he failed. The story had flaws but which MI movies didn't, but they were saved by superb action sequences and gadgets. This movie has lots of gadgets but they don't serve the purpose of just being too kinky but overdone. The stunts are nothing new and will not hold your nerves. The thrill is missing and you hear murmurs inside theater on very first show. Tom cruise was also the star and producer of the movie and film is really working on his shoulders. The movie started lacking its grip the moment Tom cruise rescued another lunatic Drug dealer from the unnecessary jailbreak scene. The whole story was plotted against a nuclear submarine launch based in Russian waters which was triggered from India to hit USA. The motive behind this and why IMF got their Intel was never clear.<br/><br/>The movie moved from Budapest to Russia to Dubai and to India, with all the baggage and gadgets required for a complete mission. Knowing that the countries are hostile in some or the other aspects. Dubai city had no weather department to forecast a sand storm and no rescue work. and you hit a car in the middle of sand storm was a way too much. The best carved action sequence of towering Burj Khalifa was a joke as it didn't serve any purpose other that eye candy. Ethan Hunt could have used the elevator instead. Coming to movie's part shot in Mumbai,India:- The cars were shown all left handed wheel and with wrong number plates all over. A shame on the research team . The Mumbai road signs and other boards were in Kannada, which should have been in Marathi or Hindi or just plain English. The characters in movie had nothing much to do other than some cool one- liners and stunts. The movie just looks like another Jason Bourne or Hit-man or another Another."

It has by far the worst script so far, the worst dialogue, the least believable action scenes, etc.<br/><br/>I had a bad feeling about the movie the moment I saw the director's name. The guy is amazing when he makes cartoons, but MI:4 proves that cartoons and films with live actors are two different things.

The emerging nation was cast as a land of humongous population of brainless people - far from truth. Elite hotels in India are not at all overcrowded.

","Greetings again from the darkness. You should know that as serious as I am about movies, I am perfectly comfortable accepting the Mission Impossible franchise for what it is ... a thrilling roller coaster ride of breathtaking stunts, outlandish missions, stunning visuals, bone-jarring fights, and above all else, Tom Cruise. Mr. Cruise is back in his element as Agent Ethan Hunt ... equal parts sleuth, cage fighter and super hero.<br/><br/>This is the fourth installment of the re-boot which began in 1996. Cruise was in his mid-30's then, and is pushing 50 now. In remarkable physical condition, he seems to take great pride in his ability to pull off these fantastic stunts. However, he tops them all here as he hangs from the world's tallest building - Burj Khalifa in Dubai. This is one of the most impressive action stunt sequences ever seen, with multiple camera angles that will definitely jar your senses if you are the least bit sensitive to heights. This alone is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>No need to go into much detail as the plot/mission is as ridiculous as the others in the franchise. Ethan's team is made up of computer geek and walking one-liner Simon Pegg as Benji; Paula Patton (Precious) as Jane (must have a pretty woman); and Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker) as Brandt, the world's most dangerous ""analyst"". This team is chasing after Michael Nyqvist (Swedish version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), who plays Hendricks ... a European loony trying to nuke the world for no apparent reason. To get to Hendricks, the team must go through a filthy rich playboy played by Amil Kapoor (Slumdog Millionaire) and a trained assassin played by Lea Seydoux (Midnight in Paris).<br/><br/>This latest installment is directed by Brad Bird, straight from Pixar via Ratatouille and The Incredibles, both of which prepared him for this first live action thriller. With an eye for action sequences and a feel for lapses in dialogue, Mr. Bird's first live action outing is quite impressive. Plus, he included an endless stream of gadgets, technology, fight scenes and crazy stunts. My only real complaint is that the iconic Lalo Schifrin theme song never really cuts loose like it should. Still, if you liked the first three, you will like this one."

","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>After a massive decline in quality from M:I-1 to M:I-2, MI:-3 picked up the saga again. Is Ghost Protocol able to maintain or even improve the franchise high stakes?<br/><br/>This is the best film of the franchise or, at least, right up there with the original. There are so many great things to write about this movie that I am going to start with my couple of issues since honestly, they are not that big of a deal, and I want to end my review with positive things to transmit.<br/><br/>So, the villain ... Michael Nyqvist portrays Kurt Hendricks, and he is the worst antagonist of the whole saga. The actor is great, no problem there. The big issue is that Kurt is the depthless character in the Mission: Impossible series. He barely has screentime, so naturally, his motivations are null, and there is really nothing to him. He just wants to blow things up and start a war or something.<br/><br/>My only other issue has to do with the action. No, not with the action itself but how it progressed along the runtime. The standout scenes are undoubtedly the shots in Dubai and in the Burj Khalifa building. These moments are midway through the film, so the action of the third act, the one that usually should blow our minds and have all of the tension and adrenaline, feels like a level below.<br/><br/>However, and this is extremely important for you to understand: remember when I wrote that M:I-3 had the best action in the entire saga? Well, Ghost Protocol just surpassed it and in such a phenomenal way! What I wrote in the last paragraph is correct regarding the quality of the action declining towards the end, but bare in mind that I am writing about some of the best action stunts in movie history! The third act's action makes tons of other films jealous, I don't have any doubts about that.<br/><br/>Still, the big adrenaline rush arrives at the one-hour mark. Everything, literally every single scene in Dubai, not only the fantastic Burj Khalifa stunts, are gold. Pure gold. This movie was released in 2011, and the real action displayed in it is unbelievable. I mean, if I was seeing this 7 years ago, the first thing I would do once I got home, was to google which stunts were real or not. Believe or not, a lot of them are. Especially the ones you think are not.<br/><br/>Brad Bird has a great filmography concerning animated films, but this was his first live-action one. He is superb! The cinematography is jaw-droppingly beautiful, every shot is dripping with visual quality, and the score is riveting. However, he shines brightly when it comes to the screenplay. With the help of his writers, he is able to write a simple yet exciting plot, filled with suspenseful moments and high levels of excitement.<br/><br/>The characters have never been better written, and the cast has never had such great performances. Jeremy Renner is terrific as Brandt, and his backstory provides a compelling and secret link to Hunt, which plays a very significant plot twist later on. Paula Patton is charming as Jane Carter, and once again this character is given an emotional motivation to accomplish the IMF's mission, which makes me care about her. Simon Pegg is humorous as Benji, who receives a much more prominent role to play in this movie. He somehow replaces Ving Rhames as the character who brings the bits of comedy and banter, which are always a breath of relief in such a fast-paced film.<br/><br/>Finally, Tom Cruise is incredible as Ethan. I mean, he transcends to a whole other level. When you have an actor who does all his stunts, that's great. But when you have an actor who does all his stunts, being one of those stunts clinging to the side of the highest building on the planet ... That's just ridiculously outstanding! In my humble opinion, I think Cruise is the best action movie star of all-time. I mean, how can someone deny his commitment and courage?<br/><br/>Before I finish, I will address the pacing. Even though it didn't bother me, a lot of people complained about the non-stop action of M:I-3 and I understand their point. However, the balance in M:I-4 is perfect. There is always some sort of transition to the next action sequences. Either the team is discussing the plan, or some character is getting time to be developed or something in between. There is never a dull moment, but the frenetic pacing is better controlled.<br/><br/>All in all, Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol is right up there with the original when it comes to the best film of the franchise. The action is mind-blowing and the best in the saga. The characters have never been better flushed out, the cast is fantastic (especially Tom Cruise, naturally) and the pacing is fast but controlled. Brad Bird directs the hell out of the movie, with beautiful wide shots and exceptional cinematography. An exciting yet simple plot is only injured by the worst villain of the series and by some nit-picky things from my part regarding the third act's action."
"AmyJenson1995","9","2","3","10 September 2015"," One of the best movie I've seen in 2011
","The Mission Impossible series has always been captivating and entertaining. This last settlement is not an exception to this rule. This movie is efficient entertaining and keep us involved from the beginning to the end.<br/><br/>The first reason we should love this movie is the high chemistry and performance of the casting. It's the first movie without Luther Stickell who just made a small appearance at the end of the picture. We see new faces alongside Tom Cruise. Jeremy Renner is taking Ving Rhymes as Tom Cruise unexpected wingman, firstly introduced as a simple analyst but in real is a much more capable agent who we can see the potential being revealed throughout the movie. Next is the amazing Simon Pegg as the team hacker and gadget specialist which had a small role in MI3 and is now in first line. He is bringing a great touch of humor and seeing him as a full part cast is refreshing. And at last Paula Patton, a very capable agent who doubts her abilities after she lost one of her agents she was in love to during a previous mission.<br/><br/>And of course, there is Tom Cruise which is the only survivor of the previous installments. He is less bold than in the previous movies but a lot smarter. He still do some incredible stunts like when he climbs the Burj Kalifa in Dubai with a pair of magnetic gloves. This is the kind of stunt only him has the secret. It gives vertigo as we follow him climbing the floors. He is still sexy as hell and again the main asset of the movie. It was also touching to see him and his wife exchanging a smile while seeing each other. We can feel there is still love between them and I had a small tear seeing that scene.<br/><br/>But the villains are also awesome most specifically Lea Seydoux who under her sweet angel appearance is a cold blooded assassin without any remorse and feelings. She gives chills during each of her scenes and we can see Lea is a very talented actress. I can't wait to see her in Spectre which will be released at the end of the year. The main villain is not as impressive but still do the job. Maybe a switch would have been welcomed.<br/><br/>Once again the locations chosen for the movie are really amazing and really powerful. Ghost Protocol bring us to the Kremlin, a strong and cold place, home to the Russian Ministry of Defense, a perfect place for a spy movie. Then we leave Moscow for the Burj Kalifa and Dubai, a skyscrapers city in the middle of the desert as one of the highest building in the world being used for a breathtaking stunt ever seen. And at last Mumbai in India which is also so enjoyable to see with those Hindu dancers, those nice cars.... That also why I love those kind of movies. They allow us to see places we've never been to and its great.<br/><br/>At least lets talk about the story line. Despite the fact that it's not the first time a plot about nuclear weapons being stolen and used to attack the US is chosen as a main plot, it's still entertaining and captivating. Mostly because Tom Cruise and his team are performing without the back up of IMF to stop that threat. The gadgets, while present, are not really working well. The only thing bringing the team to successfully accomplish the mission is the team skills and unity. A team who can have some failures but is not allowed to fail that very mission in order to save the world from a nuclear war and clear IMF.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I give it a 9 out of Ten and I strongly recommend to watch this amazing movie at least once."
"ThomasDrufke","8","2","3","27 June 2014"," Smarter, More Daring MI Film Than We Have Seen
","Every time you watch one of the Mission Impossible films, or any action movie these days, there is a certain amount of suspension of disbelief that has to be applied while watching. With Ghost Protocol it's no different, but instead the stunts are more realistic and the action is top notch, and the result is quite possibly the best of the film series.<br/><br/>With every MI sequel they have rightfully toned down the out-of-this-world stunt/mask pulling and gave us better effects and a more intriguing story. And even though Ghost doesn't really take the story path I would have liked to see, it does manage to give us 120 minutes of awesomeness. Tom Cruise has never been better as Ethan Hunt, and even looks younger than he did 15 years ago in the first film. The villain in Ghost isn't eye popping and really lacks the back-story that Philip Seymour Hoffman had in the previous film.<br/><br/>This film does give us a more capable and far more interesting crew than seen in the predecessors. Simon Pegg once again shines as the tech junkie of the group and newbies Paula Patton and Jeremy Renner were more than capable of carrying the action scenes. Renner's back-story didn't hit the way I hoped but then again without Michelle Monaghan as Hunt's wife the movie wasn't going to hit the emotional territory the way MI3 did.<br/><br/>There are a few cameos near the end that raised the hairs on my arms but nothing like a Marvel film. As long as the series continues to recruit great actors, we wont have to compare it to the much superior Bourne and Bond franchises. With the 5th film set to hit theaters in late 2016 we have a few years to wait, but if the same crew is on board than it will be worth the wait.<br/><br/>+Burj building stunt was...just stunning <br/><br/>+Useful crew this time around<br/><br/>+Pure entertainment for 2 hours <br/><br/>+Cruise better than ever <br/><br/>-Pretty weak villain <br/><br/>-Wanted more Monaghan <br/><br/>8.7/10"

","Budapest. IMF agent Hanaway is betrayed and killed by Moreau, who takes the intelligence he had intercepted.<br/><br/>Moscow. Jane and Benji break Ethan out of a jail to re-take the lost information. Ethan changes plans to take along a new ally from the prison. This rather complicates things for a bit. The Secretary re-tasks Ethan, Benji, and Jane to get vital information (nuclear codes) from inside the Kremlin. That starts out fairly well, but Cobalt (Hendricks) gets the codes first, and blames them for it. Ethan is captured, and narrowly escapes. He learns from the Secretary that the IMF has been disavowed. The Secretary himself gets killed, but not before telling Ethan what he wants done off the record. The team is cut off from direct support from American channels. Cobalt is out to kill him. The Russian police (Sidirov) are after them on criminal charges. Brandt joins the team.<br/><br/>Dubai. Cobalt sends Wistrom to buy the launch codes from Moreau. The team sets up a double meet, so that Leonid and Wistrom meet Jane, and Moreau meets Ethan and William, but they both think they are meeting each other. What could possibly go wrong? There were some great stunts in this segment, including the chase in the sandstorm.<br/><br/>Mumbai. Cobalt has the launch codes and the satellite uplink. So he needs a 'tactical satellite' as the last piece. That is, a satellite that has Russian military protocols still in it. One is available in Mumbai. Jane goes after Brij Nath, the man who has access to the satellite. Benji and William go after the man's computer security system. Cobalt again interrupts them. After Cobalt takes control of the satellite, Ethan and Jane rush to make a last minute stop. Cobalt gets a Russian missile launched. Jane, William, and Benji race to re-enable the uplink, while Ethan rushes to acquire the case with the command codes.<br/><br/>Seattle. Nice conclusion.<br/><br/>----Scores----<br/><br/>Cinematography: 10/10 Excellent.<br/><br/>Sound: 10/10 No problems<br/><br/>Acting: 9/10 The leads were all fine, as were Michael Nyquest and Vladimir Mashkov.<br/><br/>Screenplay: 10/10 Fast paced action coupled with cerebral interludes for planning. Throw in a dash of humor or twenty, and you've got a very nice script."

","Your mission, should you chose to accept it: Sit back, relax, and try to enjoy my review of Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol This is not just another mission. The IMF is shut down when it's implicated in a global terrorist bombing plot. Ghost Protocol is initiated and Ethan Hunt and his rogue new team must go undercover to clear their organization's name. No help, no contact, off the grid. You have never seen a mission grittier and more intense than this. -- ( Paramount) The movies script is pretty good, other than the mediocre villain it contains a great action packed plot, great dialogue, good character moments, and great humor. The characters, unlike the previous Mission Impossible movies, are now fully fleshed out. They have good chemistry and their banter is a joy to listen to. The fact that the actors do an incredible job portraying them also helps this. Now to talk about the best part of the movie: The action. WOW. This movie contains some of the best action scenes ever on film in my opinion. It keeps you glued to your seat, it is basically a summer blockbuster in terms of thrills, even though it came out in winter. That part where Tom Cruise is climbing that ridiculously tall building is in my opinion the best part of the movie. Great script, great acting, kick ass action scenes, and good directing help land Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol on my top ten favorite spy films ever, which is no small feat. 0 Comments | Send This | Bookmark and Share"
"TC-Batsy","10","2","3","23 April 2013"," Mission Accomplished!
","I'm a huge fan of the Mission Impossible movie franchise and I have seen all of them. In this fourth installment of the successful series, agent Ethan Hunt and his team are disavowed after a rogue terrorist known as Cobalt bombs the Kremlin and frames them for it. Ethan and his teammates have to prove their innocence and prevent Cobalt from using nuclear launch codes to start a deadly war between the United States and Russia in a game of cat and mouse from Moscow to Dubai and Mumbai. In this movie, Tom Cruise did one of the most risky daredevil stunts in his amazing film career by dangling from the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa which left me at the edge of my seat. He's without any doubt a sophisticated actor and stuntman always putting his heart and soul in every movie he works on. I'm also looking forward to see Mission : Impossible 5 in the future. <br/><br/>Mission Impossible : Ghost Protocol deserves 10 stars!"
"aram81","7","1","1","10 June 2020"," The best Mission: Impossible up to this point
","Ghost Protocol, the fourth installment of the Mission: Impossible franchise delivers the goods. It gives the audiences what they expect. The film is full of death-defying and jaw dropping stunts, plenty of action and a touch of humor. The plot is absurd but that is not the point of Mission: Impossible. Its main purpose is to entertain and thrill and for the majority of its runtime it does just that. The cast delivers as well. At this point Tom Cruise was already established as one of the top action stars on the planet and its no surprise that he hit it out of the park one more time. Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton handled their roles admirably and Simon Pegg brought some much needed humor in his role as the brains of the operation. Ghost Protocol does not reinvent the wheel in the action/thriller genre but it gets the job done."
"youyuzhen-07323","8","1","1","8 May 2020"," Cool
","As wonderful as ever. As a casual commercial film that doesn't require too much brains, Mission Impossible 4 is as big a scene and stimulating special effects as ever. Although Atango's acting skills have not improved for so many years, Atango's handsome face has not changed. In general, as long as you are not a critical professional film critic, the Mission Impossible 4S is worth a look"
"ravimirna","8","1","1","19 April 2020"," Ever energetic Tom Cruise
","A mile stone in Cruise's action movies. Proceedings do not drag. There is humour,
good action scenes, breathtaking photography and death defying stunt scenes especially Tom Cruise climbing Khalifa towers. Paula Patton , Jeremy Renner and
Simon Pegg are quite a team . Though the climax a bit over stretched it does not derail the thrill. The stupendous success of this movie set of interesting sequels with Tom Cruise doing ""impossible"" stunts mostly by himself. Man age does not deter him from dare devilry. Had Paula Patton and Jeremy Renner appeared in subsequent sequels, it would have been treat. However , Rebecca Fergusson compensates their absence."

"arjunflamingfeather","10","1","1","27 July 2018"," Rating after years; a must watch
","Single attempt at brotherly affection from 'Ethan Hunt' makes us aware; that the series is not for the light heart which can cease under strain. The movie is a must watch which came back to life after another four years with Rogue Nation. the attempt at being a cinematic masterpiece is the reliability that the movie has been watched. 
The movie title 'Ghost Protocol' has the similar cast with 'Tom Cruise' being the lead actor and the actress being a 'Ghost' or lead. This epic trilogy of series titled Mission Impossible has been filming for nearly two decades after the next: Fallout."

"slightlymad22","8","1","1","1 November 2017"," Best Sequel So Far
","Continuing my plan to watch every Tom Cruise movie in order, I come to Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: The IMF is shut down when it's implicated in the bombing of the Kremlin, causing Ethan Hunt and his new team to go rogue to clear their organization's name.<br/><br/>Whilst Cruise's career was far from finished, his movies were grossing less and less, and having less impact on the box office chart too. So when Paramount wanted to make another Mission Impossible, Crusie didn't need asking twice. Personally, I used to think the third movie was the best sequel, now, I think this one is the best.<br/><br/>I still remember watching this in IMAX at the cinema, and I still can't watch the scene where Cruise scales the outside of the Burj Khalifa, without my vertigo kicking in. The bad guys plan is a bit James Bond, but it's held together by some great performances (I especially liked Simon Pegg) and some terrific action set pieces. <br/><br/>Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol grossed $209 million to end the year the 7th highest grossing movie of 2011. This was the first Cruise movie to finish in the Top 10 grossers of they year since War Of The Worlds 5 years earlier."
"seizetheday-62572","9","1","1","8 August 2017"," the best work of Mission Impossible
","This is one of the most famous movies in the world. There are 5 works in this series. I like this one the best in them. The main character, Ethan Matthew Hunt, played by Tom Cruise sets off on a journey with his party to complete mission which is very difficult to do. There are a lot of difficulties. They were in danger of losing their lives for many times. The scenes of action are very exciting. One of my favorite action scenes is the scene of the desert. The scale of it is so large that the audiences can experience the pressure which Ethan Hunt feels. Not only this series, but also other series are also large scale. I have heard that the hard action scenes do not use stunt man. It means Tom Cruise plays it with no Computer Graphics. That makes the scenes more exciting."
"harrypottervegetaria-423-432372","Null","1","1","15 July 2012"," awesome!!
","Ethan Hunt is back, back with a bang. Car Chases, Gun-toting assassins, Bomb blast in Kremlin, a clever psychopath and the world on the brink of nuclear war- it's time for Tom Cruise to set the stage on fire with his action packed, gadgets riddled new Mission Impossible movie.<br/><br/>Thumbs Up for the plethora of amazing action sequences and the really cool gadgets- the Ghost Protocol is indeed worth a watch without you bickering on the rising prices of the pop corns.<br/><br/>And for those who want to know, yes, Anil Kapoor did have a five minute prime-time spot in the movie. Though not at the best of his acting skills- Anil does manage to make us, young Indians proud over the fact that he was in Mission Impossible- it was much better that the Indian Guy in the James Bond Flick Octopussy!!<br/><br/>This movie is far better than the third installment and the Burj Dubai stunt was paisa-vasool. Though the final scene was in India, I doubt that it was actually shot in India, but its okay.<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt has lost his wife, his agency dissolved and the Russian K.G.B. is after him (they suspect him for the bomb blast at Kremlin) - he has to hunt down the villain before he can drop the nuclear weapon on the American Soil.<br/><br/>The storyline isn't very hot. The movie is a stereo-typical Post Cold War Run-Chase-Stop the bomb saga, before the two nuclear strong heads can destroy each other. But the gadgets more than make up for the okay story. I won't actually describe them- you must go and watch it for yourselves.<br/><br/>Well it was an-all out-boys-show at the theatre, several of them had bunked their schools to watch the movie. I, of course being, ahem, money-conscious, try to watch all my movies in the morning shows. Whistling, shouting and cheering- of course a typical Indian Crowd behavior towards awesome stunts and lovely chicks.<br/><br/>I was lovin' it."

","I saw this movie twice and it was the best movie I have seen in years! I am not into action movies, However, this was the exception. It was so amazing that I had to see it twice! I didn't see the other three films but now that I have seen this one I really want to. However, you do not need to see the other three films to enjoy this film. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors, and as usual I was not disappointed by his performance in the film. I thought Simon Pegg also did a really amazing job as Tom Cruise's side kick. I enjoyed the part of the movie when Tom was climbing the side of the hotel in Dubai. It was so cool that this part was incorporated in the film. It was exciting, exhilarating and nerve racking. I could watch this movie 5 million times and still enjoy it."
"moviefailreviews","8","1","1","8 June 2012"," That sweet, sweet Mission Impossible theme will be playing in your head for days afterward.
","Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol knows it is an unabashedly silly popcorn flick, and it is with that wherewithal that it pulls off its story and characters so ably. That is not to say the film is without its flaws; rest assured, the film makes more than a few missteps. However, while it is far from Brad Bird's best, it is certainly an admirable live-action debut from the director.<br/><br/>One of the biggest issues I had with the movie was its habit of being overly referential. Sure, Ghost is probably a lot of fun for those of us who have managed to stick with the MI series for the better part of the decade. However, some of us, myself included, have not managed to see the other three films prior to MI 4. As a representative of this demographic, I feel compelled to mention that if you aren't up on your Mission Impossible lore, some jokes and cameos may be lost on you. This is not to say the film is in any way unapproachable for newcomers - I only caution that some of these scenes may go right over your head as they did for me.<br/><br/>Having said that, I definitely appreciated many of the homages to the film series as a whole. Many of the Mission Impossible hallmarks are so iconic at this point that I was able to catch the nod-and-wink gags sprinkled throughout the feature despite my unfamiliarity with the franchise. More than that, the new material certainly stood solidly on its own legs, delivering a very entertaining experience overall. If you can make me laugh, I'm probably going to be sold - and this movie delivered in that respect.<br/><br/>So yes, Ghost Protocol was goofy, and quite funny, but it still maintained a solid narrative grounded in the real world. I was mostly invested in Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his spy team as they started their globe-trotting adventure, although character development was clearly not the focus of the film. When the film tried to make this its objective, as it did with the big reveal from William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), it was to no great emotional effect. But a big-explosion blockbuster this remains, and nitpicks like that are hardly a deal-breaker.<br/><br/>Having said that, one thing that may put off some fans of both the franchise and the genre is the ironic lack of major action scenes. Big set pieces are present, but they are far and few between - and almost all of them are entirely spoiled in commercials and teasers. This isn't to say that any of them lack in scale or scope, but they do not occur as often as one might expect from a modern action film.<br/><br/>In the end, Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol did not disappoint and will almost certainly delight fans. As I said, I enjoyed myself immensely - my minor criticisms are the only thing keeping me from giving this a higher rating. If you haven't seen it yet, be sure to get to a theater and see it on the big screen before it's gone forever.<br/><br/>Verdict: Movie Win <br/><br/>IMDb Score: 80% (86%)<br/><br/>~ Søren<br/><br/>A Note on Product Placement: I think it is worth mentioning that the shameless placement of Apple products was obvious to the point of distracting in Mission Impossible 4. I am a big Mac user myself, but I also know computers and the thought of top-tier spy organizations using an iPad as a part of some super-advanced holographic device or a Macbook as the go- to hacking computer is laughable. Perhaps this won't put off all viewers, but it kind of bothered me.<br/><br/>Also, the abundant use iPhones for a solid 5 seconds while they get their new mission before tossing them seems wasteful. They could at least donate them to those of us who are smartphone-less..."

","I found many of these reviews to be much overrated. I cannot believe this is getting 8 out of 10 stars. For God sakes, the Bourne Identity is much better than this movie and it has a 7.8 rating. I almost suspect that these reviews are fake, but I would not be able to prove that. I saw the movie expecting it to be awesome, but it was just more ridiculous stunts and dumb jokes inserted into the movie. The first Mission Impossible was the best. Tom Cruise was nothing special in the movie, and with the invention of CGI and special effects stunts don't impress me anymore. Sorry, I'm jaded. Maybe I just am sick of big action blockbusters in general, but seriously make something more realistic and intriguing. I didn't care about any of the characters in the story, and I certainly didn't care about Tom Cruise. This movie is sh*t. Sorry, but I had to counterbalance the overrated reviews. Stop giving this movie so much praise! It does not deserve it! There *Sigh*."

","WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : MISSION IMPOSSIBLE (4) : GHOST PROTOCOL<br/><br/>MINI-REVIEW : The most amazing on-location sights; the most incomprehensible plot.<br/><br/>RATING : Don't waste your time – unless you love IMAX (Rating System: ""See it in theaters,"" ""Wait for the instant download,"" ""Don't waste your time"")<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke (Tom Cruise) is back and he's in big trouble. His mission went badly and evil enemy Cobalt/Hendriks (Michael Nyqvist) has the codes to fire the Russian missiles. Cobalt wants to start World War Three because well, he's crazy like that. Hawke and the entire IMF have been disavowed because they were framed for blowing up the Kremlin. Now it's up to Hawke and his renegade team (Beautiful femme fatale Jane (Paula Patton), techno geek Benji (Simon Pegg), and rugged analyst Brandt (Jeremy Renner)) to set things right. And we're off . . .<br/><br/>There is so much wrong with this film it is hard to pick a starting point. Let me start by saying that I don't understand why this is a Christmas film. This is an action adventure that is great popcorn fare and appeals to the Transformers crowd. Usually such films come out in the summer and are gone with the first whiffs of the fall.<br/><br/>The plot is completely incomprehensible. Suffice it to say, Hawke and his team flail from one blunder to the next. However, this is a plot device that allows the movie to travel to exotic locations and exploit the IMAX camera (see below). And everywhere they go, there are chase scenes. Because, well, Tom Cruise looks good running.<br/><br/>And for the special effects and plot devices, I feel as though we've seen all of them in other Mission Impossible films. There's Tom Cruise blown across the screen by explosions. Tom Cruise barely escaping flying automobiles, and (this time) Jeremy Renner hovering above the floor of a computer facility while he manages tricky computer magic. There was even a ""Red light, Blue light"" moment reminiscent of the first film.<br/><br/>The film weighs in at 2 hours and 15 minutes – a bit long by Hollywood standards. I saw plenty of places where scenes could have been trimmed and a few that could have been completely eliminated as they didn't further the plot – but were cute bits of special effects.<br/><br/>And while we're talking about cute – a lot of the dialog was just adorable. That is to say, there were jokes interspersed that were supposed to lighten the tension and humanize the characters (especially with comedian Pegg). But they fell flat as they were largely forced humor and not well-placed in the film.<br/><br/>I get the feeling this was supposed to be some sort of ""reboot"" for the Mission Impossible franchise. Tom Cruise and JJ Abrams were producers. You may recall that JJ Abrams is the head of ""Bad Robot"" productions and he directed the reboot of the Star Trek franchise in 2009.<br/><br/>The one saving grace of this film is the on-location filming. I saw MI4 in IMAX and it was spectacular. We start off in Russia with wonderful shots of the Kremlin. Then we are whisked away to Dubai where Tom Cruise does amazing feats of wall crawling in front of IMAX cameras. If you have ever been to IMAX and seen the panoramic views that take your breath away, you can appreciate how impressive Tom Cruise hanging from a thread at the top of the tallest building in the world can be. It successfully engaged my vertigo. Then we are off to India for more adventure and wonderful sights.<br/><br/>I paid $16.50 in my theater to see this film and I balked. To be sure, it was not worth the price. The 30 minutes of IMAX views, while wonderful, are not enough to warrant a recommendation. If you want to get the full IMAX experience go see ""IMAX: To Fly!"" or some other IMAX offering. But there is absolutely no way you should spend even $5 to rent the instant download. So, for a meandering, incomprehensible plot and rehashed devices, I suggest you ""don't waste your time."""

","Wildly impossible but typical action flick of today, and lacking any character development in its break-neck race to the end credits. Tom is his usual inscrutable and unreadable, buffed-up MI self, always in mortal danger while careening under, over, around and through all obstacles and dangers to win the day that would kill a real man in seconds. Why have Superman when Tom does all day just about anything S-man could do? Ridiculous to show a mortal man surviving all that bodily damage, let alone prospering with no ill effects. Sorry, but this movie was no more than mindless, thrill-seeking action of the Stallone/Willis type, but sure seems to be just what some want today for their movie going dollar. Not me, as I actually like a real story with real people in it.<br/><br/>The never-possible-in-a-trillion-years ""story"" was all action, all the time, start to finish, no rest or sleep possible, but rang phony from the word go for the lack of humanity in its players. It was no more than a non-interactive video game that used human actors instead of CGI-created ones, but allowed them the superhuman actions and death-defying nature of CGI. Absurd genre to be sure, but one that really clicks with those wanting only physical and no mental. Read some other reviews here for proof of that."

"Diptoman","6","4","9","18 December 2011"," Try to enjoy what's happening, and don't try to make sense of it.
","In a nutshell: Random Russian dude wants to start a nuclear war (because as we all know it, the most common pastime in Russia is planning to nuke the US), and like always, it's up to our friendly neighborhood Americans to stop them; only this time, they have to go to a variety of places (Dubai and Mumbai for example) for who-knows-what- reason to stop a nuke (apparently to try to appeal to global audiences). Overlooking the clichéd and linear plot, and discarding any logic whatsoever, if you're looking for some nice action sequences and Tom Cruise doing a Spiderman on the Burj Khalifa, this is the film for you.<br/><br/>To expand on that, let's start with the plot. Our hero, Ethan Hunt is being held in a high security Russian prison, and of course, American agents manage to break into it and free him just like that. Hunt with his allies then get a mission to intercept some codes in the Kremlin, and find out random Russian bad guy wants to get his hands on that too because, well, he wants to blow up the world. So predictably, nothing goes right for them and random Russian dude manages to blow a part of the Kremlin up, while pinning the blame on the US because, well, blowing up the Kremlin is that easy. Tensions rise among US and Russia, and the IMF is dissolved, leaving only 4 American agents between random Russian bad guy and a global nuclear war. So thus is the movie's plot, and it follows pretty linearly after that, with our heroes traveling across the world (mainly Dubai and Mumbai) to get hold of the launch key for the nuclear missile. (Yes, somehow USA's security depends on a code in a server room in the Burj Khalifa, and Russians can launch nukes against the US from India with the codes being presumably safe in the hands of a random Indian.) A few stealth sequences later, everyone screws up and the missile is launched, but our heroes still manage to salvage the situation, after a few more action sequences. Not like we didn't know that, gah.<br/><br/>THIS obviously fails to impress as a story at any level, and being linear and predictable, fails to hold our (at least mine) attention to it. But let's not forget this is a spy/action flick, and as much as I would've wanted a good story, that's not all it should be about. <br/><br/>To look at the pros, the action was intense, the gadgets were jaw dropping, and the stunts were (most of the time) mind blowing. Of course that's what most people look for in a spy/action flick anyway, and this being a crowd pleasing film, will definitely do that. The film is very fast paced, and doesn't give you much room to breathe, which is in my opinion, a good thing for such films. The character's roles were given justice, with nothing to complain about acting quality; and in my opinion, Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn and of course Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, stood out.<br/><br/>Overall, if you overlook a good amount of the plot and don't try to apply any sense to what's happening whatsoever, then you might find this movie very enjoyable. To me, it wasn't anything special (because unfortunately, I rate mainly based on story lines), but it wasn't bad either."

","""M:I- Ghost Protocol"" is edge-of-your-seat gripping. The Impossible Missions Force is connected to a bombing at the Kremlin. Therefore, in an attempt to clear its name, it must operate without government help. As in real life, not everything goes according to plan. How the characters improvised in unexpected situations greatly added to the suspense.<br/><br/>The following comments focus more on the actors rather than the storyline or plot. Tom Cruise still shows amazing agility as he scales the world's tallest building without the use of a stunt double. Although he is -finally- losing his boyish features, he is quite appealing in a more mature way. Tom still exudes charm, as does ""Lost"" alumnus, handsome Josh Holloway. As for Michael Nyqvist: his character (Kurt Hendricks) was interesting but lacked depth if compared to his Blomkvist character in the 2009 Swedish film trilogy (e.g. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo""). It was great to see Anil Kapoor in a playful role as the rich, womanizing tycoon. (He was outstanding as the serious President Hassan in the TV series, ""24."") Simon Pegg, as Benji Dunn, gave a seriocomic performance that was scene-stealing, refreshing and relieving in tense situations.<br/><br/>I was easily able to overlook the many ""goofs"" in this movie to enjoy it as a supremely suspenseful, full-throttle thriller."

","The fourth instalment in the Mission Impossible movie franchise sees the Kremlin blown up by mysterious operatives, but blamed on Ethan Hunt's IMF organisation. The US President closes IMF down, leaving Hunt's cell of 3 operatives (augmented by a mysterious fourth agent, Brandt) to halt the plan (of which the Kremlin bombing is simply the first stage) and, in the process, prove their innocence. Oh, and stop World War III.<br/><br/>The seemingly ageless Tom Cruise puts Ethan Hunt through his athletic paces once more, aided by Simon Pegg's comic relief computer geek Benjy, Paula Patton's very able token female Jane, and Jeremy Renner's Brandt. All four are excellent. The stunts and action sequences are spectacular and almost non-stop, the story (which is less complex than it appears) has sufficient suspense to keep you on the edge of the seat, there are a couple of areas where you expect one thing but the film delivers another, but...<br/><br/>The ""but"" has to do with MI3. Numbers 1 and 2 were very enjoyable, but essentially action packed romps. Number 3 rose above this by putting, at its heart, the relationship between Ethan Hunt and new wife Julia: the risk to Julia raised the stakes enormously, and gave MI3 a heart which the first two movies were missing. MI4 starts with Hunt's marriage being a thing of the past so, although we are later given more information about what happened, that heart is missing. For that reason alone, I regard MI3 as superior.<br/><br/>But make no mistake, this is a blockbuster worthy of the title."
"extcontact","4","6","17","27 December 2011"," The franchise is badly in need of a 'Dark Knight' overhaul...
","Turning the franchise over to a TV comedy / action crew had the predictable result - a bad movie that fails even the most basic 'Lethal Weapon' test. Tom isn't Mel or Jackie and shoehorning the otherwise wonderful Simon Pegg into the mix spoiled the whole lot. And the 'Team' never had a ghost of a chance when the actors were all so obviously conflicted between their action and comedic timing. Overall, the Transformer treatment left the whole affair feeling like a wobbly and robotic mess.<br/><br/>The direction also lacked subtlety, grace and the continuity necessary to sustain pace which is admittedly hard to do when you are constantly dropping out of warp drive to do one-off skits. The editing wasn't the best either, but it's hard to say just what they were given to work with so I won't be too harsh on them.<br/><br/>I'd say the franchise due for some serious reinvention and should dump the comedy and head deep into a darker and edgier landscape capable of better supporting the theme and premise. Maybe get someone with an edge like Cormac McCarthy help with the next screenplay.<br/><br/>But if they're unwilling to take a serious turn with the franchise, then they should give Jon Favreau a shot at the next one; at least he understands what he's being tasked to deliver and does so with the eye of a movie goer."

"Ziya90","2","3","7","7 June 2015"," Unfortunately Brad Bird can't adapt his genius vision into M:I world
","I saw the movie at IMAX theater. The technical aspect of the film was jaw dropping at times, but the movie was lack heart and soul in the delivery which was surprising, because the director Brad Bird is a genius director, he brings color to the movies. ""Mathematics"" of his movies is a perfect example of film making, so I had expected something like The Incredibles meets M:I movies, but actually it was not. It was another next generation cliché formula movie which was also soulless. The only remarkable action sequence in the film was the famous Burj Khalifa part and yes it was amazing, jaw dropping, I have seen the scene numerous times and showed it to my friends with enthusiasm, but I didn't enjoy the rest of it. The climax of the film was also very formulaic and cliché. Paula Patton was extremely hot in that green dress, Simon Pegg was a joy himself, despite I am not a fan of him, Jeremy Renner was also good, Cruise was the star of the movie as usual and I just love him as an actor, but unfortunately the movie lacks any spark. As for other M:I movies, the first movie was a stylish, first class spy thriller, but I didn't adore that one either, because it was lack of real action and the plot was a little bit dull. Most people didn't like the second movie, but I loved it. Maybe, they didn't get the point. The second movie was a dream of action movie fans and it came true. It was an awesome action film in John Woo style and highly amusing, but never ridiculous! The third movie had a different style. It was fast paced, dynamic, an action and excitement packed. In spite of its little flaws, I seriously liked the third movie, too, especially because of the director's vision. A breath in fresh air... However, as the new generation superficial action movie, Ghost Protocol is my least favorite in the series. Maybe, it is a solid entertainment movie for general audience and yes most people enjoyed the film, but I just found it insipid and technique over substance. I hope Rogue Nation will be much better."
"Sagsag","6","3","7","3 May 2012"," Great action, nothing more
","As long as you're willing to put your brain on suspended animation for the duration of the movie, there's plenty of stuff to enjoy in the movie - amazing action scenes and stunts, incredible effects, some humor and corny lines, beautiful women etc.<br/><br/>If you do keep your brain active, you're in for some disappointment. There's your standard run-of-the-mill plot, with the tormented protagonist having to save the world with no government backup. Wow, déjà-vu! Didn't we have that back in MI:1? Oh sorry, got totally confused -- this time it's the *entire* IMF disavowed, not just Ethan. Plus, the plot here is even less sophisticated than the one in MI:1, so I can't really compare the two movies.<br/><br/>Anyhow, your brain would probably end up in suspended mode anyway, as a self protection mechanism, after being exposed to the senseless progression of the plot, the impossible stunts, or the shameless, explicit product placements. Even so, after the whole thing ends, you might find yourself wondering, as your brain regains consciousness: considering all of the futuristic, non-existent (not yet, anyway), technologies seen in the movie, how is it that some very important, existent technologies seemed to be missing (e.g. anti-ballistic missile systems?)<br/><br/>Considering the idea of the original MI TV series, where ""impossible"" missions were accomplished with wits, elaborate strategies and a couple of believable gadgets; and considering the idea of the MI:2-4 movies, where Tom Cruise and his associates accomplish missions with loads of futuristic gadgets and super-human abilities, I personally find it's really a shame how the two ideas got somewhere mixed up."

"surajsingh90","7","3","7","15 January 2012"," What you expected... and then some
","Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and the rest of the IMF (Impossible Mission Force - duh!) are implicated in the recent bombing of the Kremlin, tensions between Russia and The States are rising at a Cuban Missile Crisis level and Tom Cruise looks 25 years younger. Only Hunt and the rest of the four-man (per se) group can reveal the truth about the bombing and bring the true terrorists to justice. Sound like a Mission Impossible movie yet? Keep reading.<br/><br/>This movie consists of four main elements: action, comedy, cheese- filled-drama and more action. Those of you who have seen the previous movies know what I'm on about and having just seen The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (the unnecessary Hollywood version) two days ago - I welcomed this mindlessly entertaining roller-coaster ride. <br/><br/>The two hour movie begins with a chiselled IMF agent (Sawyer from LOST) fending off and escaping the clutches of his attackers only to be exterminated by a deliciously cute little assassin who steals his briefcase. Later we find out that the case contains nuclear missile codes that eventually fall in the hands of a terrorist who plans to obliterate the United States. Hunt, in prison for killing his wife's murderers, escapes with the help of the new crew - Jane, William and Benji (Paula Patton, Jeremy Renner and Simon Pegg) - who have been assigned to deal with the terrorist situation and save everyone. Sound like a Mission Impossible movie now? <br/><br/>The story isn't brilliant. Perhaps just a little bit more narrative than an Austin Powers movie, but that's not what you're after. Brad Bird's directing abilities shine via the on-screen action and effects as well as a mixture of subtle and corny comedy. You feel every punch, even the ones thrown by the almost fifty-year-old Cruise. The sound is spot on with the theme tune creeping in at awesomely cool espionage moments. <br/><br/>In addition, Bird blends comedy into a lot of the action. Sometimes in a sort of cheesy one-liner way (think Rush Hour) and sometimes in a more illustrative way (think Ratatoullie - also directed by Bird). The movie doesn't shy from looking into itself as a cheesy action flick and poking fun at it, nor does it exaggerate its silliness. Having Hunt acrobatically swing around a skyscraper in Dubai from a hose pipe to try and reach a lower floor only to have him misjudge the landing and crash into the glass as the backing soundtrack impersonates a record scratch is brilliant.<br/><br/>Dubai isn't the only destination for this entertaining and (partly) meta-tastic action/comedy. The mission also takes the crew to Russia (obviously) and India, both of which become playgrounds for fun action, cool spy-stuff, stylish cars and badass gadgets.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of inspiration in the story, the characters are given the opportunity to develop. Jane eventually portrays a strong beautiful Bond-girl-esque woman, particularly in the hilarious scenes with Brij Nath (Anil Kapoor - major Bollywood actor) who's overwhelmingly sleazy swagger is slapped down and put to rest...literally. In addition, William and Benji are also more than just pieces of the slightly simple puzzle. William is troubled by his performance on a past assignment and Benji is the kid whose dreams of spy field work are eventually coming true.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this fourth addition to the Mission Impossible series is able to stand alone as a fun and exciting action packed movie that doesn't require much brain power. This is not a bad thing and so your mission is to enjoy it without too much effort...should you chose to accept it.<br/><br/>7/10"

The action is perpetual, and it is for the most part well-done. That does not make a movie good by itself, and what sinks this movie home for me is that the director/writers/etc paid attention to the details that would otherwise make every gadget-stunt absurd to a thinking person. Most of them were still pushing the absurdity boundary, but if you have a bit of tech familiarity you won't be shaking your head the whole way through like you would for many, many other movies in this genre.<br/><br/>And as others have said, Tom Cruise still brings it even though his aging is apparent.

","Coming from a guy that hasn't seen any of the previous MIs, ""Ghost Protocol"" was nothing short of an awesome movie. From start to finish, it offers heart-pounding action and jaw-dropping special effects that will leave you in awe. <br/><br/>One thing that bothers me about these kinds of movies is the way that you can never give the actor any credit for being so badass; there is usually (with exception of a few actors) a stuntman who creates what people watch action movies for: the action. I really appreciated this movie because Cruise actually IS that badass. Most of his stunts are actually done himself. Being able to both watch him fight, jump, and free-fall AND see his face at the same time was somewhat special. I really enjoy the little things. <br/><br/>The rest of the actors did an admirable job as well. Pegg assumed his usually goofy character, and as tiring as he was, it was funny. Renner was definitely a great asset to the cast; he also knows his action. As long as you can tolerate a minimal amount of cheesy dialogue (most of which is provided by Pegg) you will enjoy it. <br/><br/>Another recommendation would be to see this one in IMAX if you get the chance. The sound effects in this one are fantastic, and can only be appreciated to the fullest in such an environment. Plus, they will most likely show the prologue for ""The Dark Knight Rises"". Not to take anything away from ""Ghost Protocol,"" but that prologue was the highlight of my night. <br/><br/>In a nutshell, Tom Cruise delivered, and it was much better than expected.

","Shortly after having watched David Fincher's gripping take on The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,me and a friend started to discuss that with the cinema offering ""25%"" off all cinema tickets for the day,and also with New Years Day only two days away,it seemed like the perfect opportunity for us to go for a double bill,of what would hopefully be a fun second feature.Rushing to the box office,I was thrilled to find that tickets were still being sold for the new Mission Impossible film,which was set to start in 10 minutes!.And since being very entertained by the action- packed trailer I had seen for the film a few weeks ago,this looked like the perfect film to send 2011 out with a bang.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Attempting to get hold of secret documents,IMF agent Trevor Hanaway is left bleeding on the pavement,after being killed by an assassin called Sabine Moreau.Realiseing that someone has stumbled onto their plans,agents Jane Carter and Benji Dunn quickly gather themselves up,and help fellow agent Ethan Hunt and his mole escape from a Russian prison.Hoping to get hold of the files again that Hanaway had intercepted,(which are thought to have details about nuclear weapons)the team decide to invade The Kremlin.Sadly for the team,someone else is about two steps ahead of their plans,and before Hunt and Benji have any time to think,a section of The Kremlin is suddenly blown up.Being left confused by all of the chaos around them,the agents woes are not helped when the head of the IMF, (not, the International Monetary Fund one!)tells them all that due to Russia blaming the IMF for what is views as a terrorist attack by the US,the IMF has no choice but to mark the team as ""Ghost Protocol"",and ""unofficial"" rouge agents for any of their activates connected with this ever increasingly dangerous mission.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Looking at the timeliness of the Mission Impossible film adaptations,and the career path of lead star/producer Tom Cruise,it is interesting to see the films act as a very sturdy foothold for him,with the third and fourth film in the series both helping to reestablish Cruise as a ""main event"",either after his personal (the Oprah show) or professional (Knight And Day) choices had threatened his career to go ""over the edge"".For his performance in this strong entry to the series,Cruise introduces a well placed ""imperfect"" side to the character,which help to make the breathtaking stunts and the enjoyable screenplay a lot more engrossing due to each of Ethan Hunts missed-timed punches and miscommunication giving the film a gripping ""rough"" feel.Whilst Jeremy Renner gives a fine performance as new mega-spy in waiting lead character William Brandt,his introduction to the series has a bit less impact then expected,due to the wonderful scene-stealing performance of Paula Patton as Jane Carter.Almost from her first scene,Carter gives a dynamite-exploding excitement to the film,thanks to her showing that whilst the character can dress with style, (the scene with her in THAT green dress being a particular highlight)she also has the wits and intelligent to be the perfect agent for Hunt's team.With how much Patton puts into the character,she ends up leaving audience members hoping that she will follow in the footsteps of Angelina Jolie and get an action film all for herself...Despite working with a script the lacks the twist and turns that made Brian De Palma's take so thrilling,first time (live action) director Brad Bird (who directed the sadly over looked,stunning adaptation of Ted Hughes The Iron Giant)shows an eye for action and excitement which will have you on the edge of the seat.For the centre-piece scenes in the film of Ethan Hunt climbing the tallest building (as of 2011) in the world,Bird delivers brilliant camera moves which pull the audience straight into the action,with his 365 degree camera move showing Cruise performing the stunt being one that looks almost impossible to shoot!,which along with some well measured visual gags, (a fight scene involving an assassin and a ""missing"" window being<br/><br/>an especially good gag) make this a stunning ""first"" effort,for what should be a very promising live-action career.<br/><br/>Final view on the film:<br/><br/>A strong,action-packed instalment for the re-booted franchise,filled with charismatic performances,well executed directing and stunts which will leave you breathless."

"artalmarcelo","8","3","7","7 January 2012"," Long live MI franchise
","Hat off to Tom Cruise, who bought the rights to keep this franchise going on the big screen 15 years ago, and did nothing but make it better and better since then. MI 3 was already a blast to me, but it's really amazing that a franchise keeps it so fresh in the 4th installment. Seriously, how many franchises in the history of movies got to deliver so well in their 4th attempt? Well, MI 4 does. There's no easy money here. There's no use of the brand to fill the arcs and give a damn about the product. There's hard work from producers, actors, directors, scriptwriters, screen players, a whole orchestra trying their best to deliver fresh and top notch entertainment. New characters, new gadgets, subtle twists and a whole lot of unbeatable action makes MI one of the best action franchises ever in the history of movies. Ghost protocol is what every action movies fan is expecting and more. It's a long movie that seems like half an hour, it's fun, smart and highly rewarding. Tom Cruise knows what movies are about. As an Indiana Jones and Steven Spielberg's fan, I gotta say I would have loved to have a 4th chapter that was what Ghost Protocol is to the MI franchise, instead of the crap we got. It really does not get better than this. 2012 action movies have a hard benchmark to compare with. Keep it coming, Ethan Hunt."
"Christian_Dimartino","10","3","7","7 January 2012"," One of the year's best!
","Remember the good old days of action movies? When Bruce Willis would let gas spill from an airplane, light a match, and the plane exploded? Or when Mel Gibson tied a rope to a stilted house and knocked it down? Or lines like ""Yipee ki yay, mother fu**er"" ? Or when action movies had a lead that we grew to love, and a plot that we could follow? I do, and that was brought back to me yesterday when I saw Mission:Impossible- Ghost Protocol, an action thriller with action sequences to look forward to, action sequences that are bubblegum for the eyes, a fun plot, and a lovable hero who is played by Tom Cruise. It's a thriller that really puts you in the movie.<br/><br/>Cruise reprises his role as Ethan Hunt again. A lot of people take Cruise for granted, and it's a real shame because he really is a marvelous actor, and here he gives one of his best performances. Cruise is an actor who can really do anything. He will climb up the tallest building in the world without a stunt double. Go figure. He will completely transform himself to where he is a bald movie producer who constantly shouts at people. He's a terrific actor who hit a rough patch, but I think he's back.<br/><br/>This time, Hunt and his IMF(Impossible Mission Force) team are forced to go rogue after they are sent on a mission into the Kremlin and it's bombed. So they are forced to stick together and prove their innocence.<br/><br/>The team includes Benji(Simon Pegg), the brains, Jane(sexy Paula Patton), the beautiful one who can also kick a lot of ass, and Brandt(Jeremy Renner), an analyst who may be hiding something about his past.<br/><br/>First time live action director Brad Bird(who directed such animated marvels as The Incredibles and Ratatouille) works wonders with the action sequences and special effects, while gifted cinematographer Robert Elswitt brings them to life. I mean, the scene where Cruise has to climb the Burji Kalhifa, the tallest building in the world, is stunning. As is the final showdown in the parking lot.<br/><br/>M:I-GP is the best action movie in years. Maybe since Casino Royale(I would say The Dark Knight but I don't count that as an action movie). It's an action film that really got to me(especially in the skyscraper scene because, well, i'm afraid of heights), and Cruise is just one of those actors that you should really invest in. It's one of the year's best. And it's a shame that action movies and comedies are overlooked during awards season, because this one would take home the gold.<br/><br/>A"
"facebook-124-955845","9","3","7","7 January 2012"," Mission Impossible 4 = possibly the best
","It's been five years since Tom Cruise had starred in a Mission: Impossible film. In those five years Cruise has made Lions for Lambs, Tropic Thunder, Valkyrie, and Knight and Day; each film successful in its own right. Cruise also made headlines with a couch-hopping declaration of love for his much younger girlfriend, Katie Holmes, on the Oprah Winfrey show. Although Mission: Impossible was a successful franchise, expectations for Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol weren't high. <br/><br/>Brad Bird, known for Pixar's Ratatouille and The Incredibles, was Director on Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, his first live-action film. Surprisingly, the transition from animation to live-action was an easy one; Ghost Protocol was an extremely well made film. Josh Appelbaum and André Nemec, both writers with a proved record of producing quality scripts for television, wrote a fantastic screenplay for the film. The storyline isn't necessarily original; I mean how many different ways can you expect terrorist to do what they do? However, its how the story is delivered that makes it work so well. There's nothing difficult for a viewer to follow or understand. The film is paced by the many high octane action sequences, as well as the elevated level of energy displayed by the characters. Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, performs most, if not all, of his own stunts, and is at the top of his game. One scene takes place in the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, which is located in Dubai, and is intense; but when you realize that Cruise did not use a stunt double for the sequence, it gives you an all new appreciation for the man and his abilities. Simon Pegg returns as Benji, and adds light humor without turning the movie into a mockery. Jeremy Renner, who was rumored to be taking over the franchise from Cruise, is a welcome addition to the IMF team as William Brandt. Renner continues a run of brilliant performances, which began with his Oscar nominated performance in The Hurt Locker, followed by another Oscar nomination for The Town. I think Renner is extremely talented, however I wonder about his being involved in too many franchises as he's been cast as Hawkeye in the upcoming The Avengers, as well as appearing in the forthcoming The Bourne Legacy currently filming. Paula Patton makes her Mission: Impossible debut as Jane Carter. Patton does a fine job, and holds her own alongside such experienced actors. The only disappointment for me, was that Ving Rhames, who appeared as Luther Stickell in the prior three films, only makes a short cameo. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise has re-established himself as an action hero and shown he is capable of moving the franchise forward; no passing of the baton is necessary. Brad Bird has put himself in position to be a well sought out Director, and deservingly so. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is not only a welcome addition to the series, but may just be the best of them. If you like well constructed action sequences, stunt work impressively choreographed, and an all around fun film to enjoy; then make seeing Ghost Protocol, mission possible.<br/><br/>Grade: A<br/><br/>Visit our site at www.twodudereview.com"
"low_key12","6","3","7","6 January 2012"," Expected More
","Well, I have noticed others have given this movie a high rating. To the contrary I expected way more from this movie. I even watched in Ultra AVX. I always considered Mission Impossible movies to be James Bond knockoffs, and where Tom Cruise gets all the credit. Regardless, the movie had a mediocre plot but had a nice flow. However, parts of the movie were just outright unrealistic, and half the time Tom cruise came out unscathed. I know that he performed all the stunts himself, but there should at least be tidbit of realism in action movies which make them just a bit more enjoyable.<br/><br/>I wish this movie had more visual effects and was in 3D that would be have been awesome."
"nabeel1127","8","3","7","6 January 2012"," It's a Mission Impossible... they did what they do
","I want to start off with my usual disclaimer on action flicks: This is not a movie with a whole lot of story, character development and super believable anything. That being said, the movie did have a fairly typical story line ""Terrorist trying to steal bombs to start a war."" That's not a spoiler, you find that out 10 minutes into the movie. <br/><br/>This movie is action packed! I really don't think more than 5 minutes pass without at least a 10 minute action sequence. Every sequence is filled with over the top stunts and technology and it is awesome! Tom Cruise looks pretty aged in this movie, but that's forgivable given his age. Paula Patton looks absolutely gorgeous and Jeremy Renner and Simon Pegg are great supports... and the BMW i8 is a beauty all in its own. <br/><br/>There are a few twists in the movie when you're look ""oohhh."" But they're not necessarily earth shattering. There are quite a few laughs though and the movie is fairly well made. My only beef with this movie is with Tom Cruise's pants... he knew he was gonna be running and completing impossible missions but still wore Size 0 skinny jeans the entire movie! Because of that, he looks very funny when running."

","""Mission: Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" Rated ""PG-13"" for Adult Situations, Adult Language, Adult Scenes, Violence & Mild Gore. Running Time: 2hrs&13mn. Three Stars (Out of ****)<br/><br/>This summer (as of this writing it is 2012) Tom Cruise will turn 50 years old. Seems unbelievable, doesn't it? Has it really been 29 years since he first made a name for himself by dancing around in his underwear singing along to Bob Seger? As a box office marquee headliner for nearly three decades, he shows no sign of slowing down at all. In fact, Cruise's latest movie would have you believe the man has discovered the fountain of youth. After all, he's rumored to have done a majority of his own stunts in his latest action picture including a brilliant sequence where he actually scales the world's tallest building in Dubai (albeit in multiple safety harnesses, digitally erased).<br/><br/>""Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol,"" the fourth entry in the ""M:I"" series, is an extraordinarily well-made high octane action picture. There is international intrigue, a sleek sexy J-Crew looking assassin, multi-layered political agendas, action, suspense and the fate of global dominance hanging in the balance. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise reprises his role as Impossible Missions Force (IMF) super agent Ethan Hunt. His team is tracking the elusive Hendricks in the Kremlin archives, who is believed to have Russian nuclear launch-codes with ambitions to launch a missile strike against the U.S. With Hunt's team on the scene, a bomb destroys most of the Kremlin and Hunt's group is framed as the terrorist masterminds behind it. Formally, the U.S. government will hunt (pun?) them down to bring them to justice. Before this can happen, the President initiates ""Ghost Protocol,"" the covert black operation of the IMF. Under the ""Ghost Protocol,"" Ethan Hunt's team is cut off from all resources and the U.S. government has disavowed the entire IMF. <br/><br/>Hunt has only his wit, team and allies to help him save the U.S. and subsequently the world from disaster. He is joined in his quest by the lovely, yet hard as nails Jane (Paula Patton, ""Precious"") and his globe trotting I.T. expert Benji (Simon Pegg, ""Shawn of the Dead""). IMF analyst William Brandt (Jeremy Renner, ""The Hurt Locker"") joins their quest after the head of IMF (Tom Wilkinson, ""Batman Begins"") is assassinated. <br/><br/>""Ghost Protocol"" boasts two of the most memorable action sequences in multiplex cinema in recent years. The first remarkable action sequence is by itself the crown jewel of the entire ""Mission: Impossible"" film franchise in terms of conception and presentation. I understand this sequence is presented in the 1:44 aspect ratio during the IMAX showings. No doubt in IMAX, this scene will trigger virtual vertigo in some audience members. The other sequence involves a futuristic-looking multi-level parking garage. My compliments on the originality of that scene. Finally, something audiences haven't seen before or, at the very least, haven't seen with this level (pun?) of sheen. <br/><br/>This is an amazing live action feature film debut for director Brad Bird. He is best known as the director of animated fare like ""The Iron Giant"" (1999), ""The Incredibles"" (2004) and ""Ratatouille"" (2007). All of those animated movies are planned and storyboarded to perfection before being set to film. It is apparent Bird's initial concept planning of ""Ghost Protocol"" was conducted in a similar fashion to his animated works. No doubt every action scene was storyboarded with exceptional care and on the big screen it clearly shows. <br/><br/>Interestingly, the ""Mission: Impossible"" film series has had an quite an array of film directors: Brian De Palma (""The Untouchables"" 1987), John Woo (""Face Off"" 1997), J.J. Abrams (""Star Trek"" 2009) and now Brad Bird. Each director has painted their distinctive style on their individual film canvasses. All four films are a little different: the first movie was suspense driven, the second was over-the-top action, the third a crowd pleaser and the latest venture is a live-action cartoon crossed with James Bond.<br/><br/>Though I recommend this picture, I feel it necessary to point something out. This movie is very high gloss on craftsmanship, style and execution. However, like its predecessors, it is deficient in the character department. It is also a little dry. Not by much, but enough to notice. Maybe that doesn't matter. The ""Mission: Impossible"" series exists to entertain us in the here and now. You may enjoy these films while watching them, but once they're over you tend to forget about them. Ethan Hunt does not stick with you the same way Jason Bourne, John McClane or Indiana Jones do. Yet the ""M:I"" films are fun movies to watch ""in the moment."" That is where they reign best. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise and Paramount Pictures seem pleased with the current box-office returns on ""Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol."" A fifth film in the series is currently planned. Though for Cruise to continue his role in future ""M:I"" entries is in question. The introduction of Renner's Brandt character is part of a deliberate failsafe plan from the studio behind the picture: should Cruise opt out of future ""M:I"" films, Brandt would become the central protagonist to carry the torch of this series. However, that would really surprise me. Tom Cruise is currently in the early talks to appear in the proposed ""Top Gun II."" I'm sure that film won't be light on action. Also, he hasn't shown me any signs of slowing down yet. I think he has a few more years in action pictures. Time will tell.<br/><br/>Speculation aside, ""Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol"" is a great example of how a meticulously well-thought-out thriller should be. The style, pacing and elaborate action sequences are expertly pieced together. It's easily the best film in this series to date. Just sit back, let the movie do its thing and enjoy it ""in the now."""
"EmmaDinkins","9","3","7","3 January 2012"," Chix Chat on Film review: Mission Possible: Great Action
","After having experienced all the previous Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) chronicles, I knew this would be an action adventure treat and I was not in the least bit disappointed. This was the best film of the year for action, not once did I lose interest in what was taking place on screen. The journey to Dubai with the scaling of the skyscraper was still very intense even after having seen bits of it numerous times in the trailers. Mr. Cruise is amazingly brave or just plain retarded to do his own stunts, either way the action scenes have a credibility that exceeds pretty much everything else that's comparable when extreme stunts are featured. Jane Carter (Paula Patton) was an awesome new addition to the Mission Impossible team. The name is very generic but there was nothing generic about Ms. Patton holding her own as an action star. This was a very good look for her, she was very convincing kicking butt. Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) the newly added tech wiz was exactly what I expected, great comic relief and finally the enigmatic William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) completed the team that put a smile on my face as I exited the theater. I only had two issues with this film, first the opening credits with the fuse was cheesy and secondly the Ethan and Jane kiss was totally unnecessary, but I just figured that Mr. Cruise could not resist capitalizing on his star power to get a lip lock with Mr. Thicke's wife, she is very beautiful after all. I was very pleased with the story and how it bridged the time since the last mission so that we quickly get caught up with what had been taking place in Ethan's life. The shock and awe sequence that put Ethan and William together and the pretty bow that tied everything up in the end was superb. I know that the whole car flipping scene from the trailer is computer generated imagery, but it looked really good. I know that Dubai is in the middle of the desert and sand storms occur, and the sand storm most likely was CGI too, but it was some kind of awesome. It looked so real I had to keep sipping on my drink, I started to feel parched. This is a movie that I would actually pay to see in the theater again, it was worth the price of the admission. It gets a bright green light."
"Foxbot","8","3","7","3 January 2012"," Decent Action Flick. Fun, yet Predictable Story
","I have been a fan of the Mission Impossible movies since the first one and I have enjoyed them all. I must say that I liked the third Mission Impossible much better. Ghost Protocol was simply an action film with some cool stunts and scenes and zero story. There was not a point in the movie which I didn't see coming around the next corner. Most of the best scenes were in the trailer and I kept waiting for a twist that never came.<br/><br/>I did not see this movie in IMAX, although I'm sure it would have made the movie visually more entertaining, though it still would be lacking in story. It was your basic fun action flick. Tom Cruse did well as usual as well as the rest of the cast. Everyone did a great job and made the movie a lot of fun to watch. But again, story was lacking in my opinion. There was a thing with his wife, which never really materialized into a good twist or story. It was just confusing and we really didn't figure out what really happened until the very very end. Jeremy Renner (Hurt Locker) did a great job as well as Paula Patton (Déjà vu) and Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead). Michael Nyqvist (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Swedish version) was a nice surprise role, as I didn't know he was in this.<br/><br/>I must say that the locations and scenes were well thought out and take us out of the usual locations in many movies. That was one of the most interesting aspects of the film; the locations. Another fun aspect of the film was the team's gadgets and gizmos. There are many times in the film where their gadgets don't work as well as planned and greatly add tension and a bit of thrill to the situation.<br/><br/>Over-all it is a very good action flick with a little less of a story than one would have hoped. Yes I love action, however action mixed in with twists and character development is always more fun. In the theater there were times when everyone laughed and other times where everyone cringed as they watched Tom Cruse climb the exterior of at glass building or drive around in a sand storm. It is a fun movie and I do recommend a watch, however don't expect to be blown away by the average nearsighted story or the silly sweet ending. Watch it for the action and suspense and leave your thinking caps at home."
"MarcusJ13","7","3","7","3 January 2012"," Formulaic fun
","So we get another Mission Impossible film and by this point I have pretty neutral expectations. The series has been on a see saw trend with a brilliant first film, a dire second film and a decent third. By that logic this one would return to the dire or dire like nature of the second. It doesn't. 'Ghost Protocol' certainly makes for a fast paced film that knows by now that too much exposition outside of 'your mission if you choose to accept it' is not going to down too well with an audience hungry for action and already familiar with the concept. It starts at a decent pace making for interesting viewing as we see Ethan in prison. From there on in action en sews and you don't need me to tell you too much about it. <br/><br/>If you have seen any of these films before you'll get the gist straight away. It does make for a decent introduction and gives us our lead character Ethan once again well played by Tom Cruise. Of course it is not where the main plot takes place but rather kicks in at the Kremlin where it really starts to go down and Ethan and his team must clear the IMF's name after a bombing. When I say formulaic it kicks in at the beginning but nonetheless it is very fun. From here on in the action is well shot and to be fair there is plenty of tension. Performances wise they do a decent job, this time with four leads only really Paula Patton who was weak in some areas but to be fair made up for it in others. Jeremy Renner being a good newcomer to the series and Simon Pegg of course providing the comic relief. He was very annoying in parts, probably due to the fact he has a much bigger role this time round. You can more or less guess what is going to happen at various points but it is still a good action film. It is some of the best in the series and didn't feel too over the top. It certainly looked like they had learnt their lesson after the second film. To summarise it is decent, although by now it knows what sort of film goer will see it and provides a good enough ride for those who already know what they're getting into."

","MI:4 Exceeded my high expectations for a powerhouse action sequel. The story was complex, but still clear enough for most to follow. The high-wire building sequence is heart-pounding and the new members of the cast Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton add some unique angles to the story, with Simon Pegg adding excellent comic relief. Much of the film was recorded on IMAX cameras--so IMAX theaters are the best way to see this visual spectacle. The fast and smart pace of the film keeps you fully engaged thanks to director Brad Bird. Many of the action heroics push the envelope on believability, but they are so well executed that you can suspend disbelief enough to thoroughly enjoy this dynamic popcorn action film. As much as the pop culture world like to rough up Tom Cruise--he's at his best in this film. He's a solid performer as an action hero, does his own stunts and co-produced the film. He's got a mega hit on his hands here and we worked hard to make this film a great one."
"carla1308","8","3","7","2 January 2012"," Dear Mr Cruise, See? You Can Act!
","I walked into this movie a) not having seen any of the previous Mission: Impossible films, b) not being a fan of Tom Cruise, and c) bracing myself for the worst. Surprisingly (incredibly so), this film rose way above all my expectations and offered a thrilling and entertaining afternoon. First of all, Tom Cruise was great. Seriously, this is the first time that I actually thought ""Hey, this guy can act!"" He was very convincing in his role as Ethan Hunt, and the fact that he performed all of his stunts by himself left me speechless. If nothing else, throwing himself off the highest building in the world earns Cruise a few brownie points. The supporting cast was very good, especially the always superb Michael Nyqvist playing the crazy evil dude who wants to blow up the whole world. I have nothing but praise for all the actors.<br/><br/>The plot...well, it's not original, it's been done countless times before, and yet it works. Evil genius wants to start a nuclear war, only one who can stop him is our protagonist, no-one is on his side except his small team, all the while he's dealing with the loss of his beloved wife, etc. It's cliché, but it's fun. The action sequences are brilliant and the stunts are simply breathtaking. A large number of scenes left me leaning forward in my seat anxiously and rooting for Cruise. And the gadgets are amazing.<br/><br/>The film accomplishes everything that it set out to do. It's one of the best action flicks that I've seen in a long time, and it kindled hope that maybe Tom Cruise is finally becoming worthy of his celebrity status. Girls, this is not strictly a ""guy"" movie: I promise you'll enjoy it. Go watch!"
"ed-421","8","3","7","2 January 2012"," Do your own stunts for the win
","Sherlock Jr, The General, Modern Times -- lots of the great films feature actors like Jackie Chan, doing their own stunts. Nothing works better for getting me there with the actor. Also, it's become vital for the audiences to never know for certain when a special effect is being used.<br/><br/>Except for an exploding parking lot early on, everything in this movie seemed real enough for me to get into the action. The Burj Khalifa tower, in particular, was awe-inspiring. Now, they could have stayed safely in Los Angeles and done everything with special effects, and it would likely have looked pretty good. Spiderman movies have similar scenes, but there is no comparison. Tom Cruise here or Harold Lloyd there (Safety Last!) really brings out the tension.<br/><br/>On missiles -- under a treaty, Russia and the US inform each other ahead of time on all launches. Also, all missile launches are easily detectable. The missile would have taken much longer to reach the target. NORAD would have been just one agency aware of the rogue missile launch.<br/><br/>I loved the acting, the set-ups, and the solid grounding in reality. The sandstorm gave a great follow-up to the tower. Wonderful stuff. About the only scene I didn't like was a non-eventful one involving the main characters sitting around a table talking."

Bird's credits are with TV series, and animation on television and the big screen, but he is best known for his work with the Simpsons. That he handles the action so well is a pleasant surprise, the delight is the humour he brings to the film with Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn being given a full supporting role, and injecting a comic element which freshens the story considerably. In several scenes he steals the glory from Tom Cruise, and this enhanced role will surely be an essential ingredient in the next film. He plays Dunn as a youthful Q in the James Bond series but more dynamically than simply as a techno-geek.<br/><br/>Hollywood's desire to penetrate emerging markets is much in evidence here. A substantial chunk of the film is set in Moscow, Russia is not the bad guy (nor is the United States the good guy per se)and there are enough Russian sub-titles to facilitate a Russian language version with English subtitles. Almost as much screen time is devoted to Mumbai too where the film reaches its climax in a shameless attempt to woo Russian and Indian audiences.<br/><br/>Particular credit should also be given to the role of women in this film. Paula Patton, as Jane Carter proved playing opposite Denzil Washington in ""Deja Vu"" that she was a very accomplished actress. Here she has a wonderful role as kick-ass agent resolved to avenge the death of a colleague and honey trap. She looks absolutely gorgeous in a powder blue shift dress and jacket, but is deadly too when she kicks off her heels to get down to business. Lea Seydoux, fresh from her success in Robin Hood, has an equally satisfying role as Sabine Moreau, an icy cold assassin on the bad guys team.<br/><br/>The set pieces are uniformly excellent, the opening break out from a Russian prison is particularly well choreographed and staged. Mid film Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt takes stunts to new heights literally, with a human fly scene at the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai and the film ends with two action sequences in India. The latter, although well played cannot trump the Dubai stunt, but then again there are a lot more people in India to watch the film than Dubai! A justified criticism is that the plot is pure James Bond, the bad guys steal Russian weapons codes to start a nuclear war with America putting America in the frame by setting up Hunt and his team as fall guys. Furthermore Michael Nyqvist's role as chief villain Kurt Hendricks is utilitarian rather than character driven so we don't get a convincing good v evil showdown, but the story itself works satisfyingly enough. Curiously Ving Rhames briefly reprises his role Luther Stickell for a couple of odd minutes at the end which add little to the story, perhaps more was left on the cutting room floor? In summary a faithful, action-packed and buoyant return to form with a very welcome new comedic dimension to it. Cruise's maturity in giving Simon Pegg more space in the story, and a willingness to be prepared to act his age, rather than a screen twenty five, does him much credit. I also applaud the fact that the iconic theme tune remains unchanged and the message , should they choose to accept it, still self-destructs in five seconds. The standard for the next instalment has been set high!"
"mvedprakasha","6","3","7","30 December 2011"," The Review
","The entertainment and the action is in pure form to all the audience. The Technological advances represented are at its best. Story though fictional in its approach, hope to see such technological research in reality. The opening of the movie where we see the silent killing, is reasoned in the mid of Ghost Protocol, which is something special unlike any other movies. Technical issues are also handled at its best. But I guess story line up could have been more critical than shown. Story does not even reason why is it India not any other country, as it is no way consent with either USSR or America. Just bringing up Burj or countries like India without reasoning, makes the movie down to that level. The eminent and experienced actors Tom cruise and Jeremy Renner have given their best for the success of the movie"
"DJAkin","10","3","7","27 December 2011"," Move over JAMES BOND - Ethan HUNT is in town!
","First of all, this was the best Mission Impossible out of the franchise. The other ones were too complicated to understand. This was was simpler. Basically it was Tom Cruise trying to stop a nuclear war. I really loved how this movie embraced a beginning, middle and the end. There was a protagonist and an antagonist. I loved how Tom Cruise kept his cool no matter what. He was in that Russian Prison yet didn't fall victim to pressure or dogmen. I was impressed how Mr. Hurt Locker was in the movie. From the second I saw him I was certain he would be a ""bad guy"". However, he turned out to be pretty cool. That once scene where he reminded Tom Cruise that his line was too short and Tom responded by saying ""no sh*t"" was funny. As Jake mentioned, Hurt Locker should have told Tom Cruise that he was just trying to help. I also liked that sand storm. It was neat when Tom was chasing the bad guy through the storm and was unable to catch up to him. I also loved how the Secretary was shot in the back of the head right in front of Tom. The one thing about the movie that bothered me was how quickly Tom drew a picture of a man on the palm of his hand. He drew a pretty good image of a face in about 4 seconds. That was kind of weird. Also I was not sure why Hurt Locker fell 25 feet just to hover across a spike shaped fan. Was he doing something while down there? I was not sure what it was. As for the guy who owned the satellite, he had quite the Pompadour haircut. It was around three inches high. The best part of the movie was the appearance of Ving Rhames. I was expecting him to reply ""ugly"" when asked how the retrieval of the satellite out of the San Francisco bay went. LOL. Tom Cruise continues to be the ""perfect actor"". His hair was perfect the entire movie."

","So, here we are. Ethan Hunt is back again after 5 years. And yes, he's back on screen with a bang.

He broke out of that prison with the help of his teammates, Benji Dunn and pretty lady Jane Carter. The mission goes with bang boom after the death of Ethan's boss. The mission is all about the codes and nuclear war between Russia and one of the supreme power of the world. This flick or say this mission is a fun and entertaining ride with Mr. Cruse and his teammates in the flick. Jeremy Renner also done pretty well in this part of the famous franchise. All I can say that this is the best part of the MI series. >>>>>AWESOME is the word....."
"theindustry","9","3","7","25 December 2011"," Great action film on the whole; fast-paced, fun and an action-packed frenzy.
","One might argue that the whole nuclear war theme has been used a bit too often, but Brad Birds latest film is well worth the exception.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt in another action-packed suspense film. Together with Simon Pegg, Paula Patton, and Jeremy Renner, he travels to Moscow, Dubai, and Mumbai in order to prevent nuclear destruction. Each act in each country gets better and better, and the suspense never ceases to thrill. Great gadgets, gizmos, stunts, action sequences, CGI, and acting make this a must for anyone craving a high-octane, yet still family friendly adventure.<br/><br/>I found it to be the most interesting of the 'Mission: Impossible' films. Others might disagree. It has a thick plot, but director Bird communicates it very well from start to finish. I appreciated the score of the film as well, which includes a nice title sequence with the theme we all know. It wasn't without its flaws, but most will pass unnoticed.<br/><br/>Overall a 9/10. Get a ticket as soon as possible because this flick is one 'Mission: Possible.'<br/><br/>Enjoy."

","Me and my dad just went to MI:4. It's Christmas day and I want to tell what I thought of it.<br/><br/>First I'm going to list the things I didn't like:<br/><br/>-The explosions in my opinion were a bit fake. And the desert by Dubai looked really CGI. And some buildings looked like they were not there.<br/><br/>-The Gadgets they had where super sci-fi like. Like floating suits, floating touch screens and such. They felt a bit out of place.<br/><br/>These are minor issues and I'm just nitpicking with these flaws. They didn't ruin the experience or the movie.<br/><br/>Now the things I really liked:<br/><br/>-Tom Cruise was perfect in the roll. Of course he was in Mission Impossible 1-3 but he did his job really well. <br/><br/>-Simon Pegg was great as the 'Comedic' part. He was funny but not that it took the atmosphere out of the movie. And he is a Bad ass when he needs to be (: <br/><br/>-The actions scenes were amazing. The speed and filming of these scenes were exciting and sucked you into the action. Great chase scenes. <br/><br/>-The Dubai Tower scene was one of the most spectacular action scenes of the year. Just that he's on the highest building in the world makes the scene ten times more awesome. <br/><br/>-The sound of this movie was mind blowing. You must see this movie in IMAX and in the cinema. When this comes out on Blue-ray/DVD it will not feel the same.<br/><br/>This is an excellent Spy movie. Must see in cinemas. Not a perfect movie but a fun kick-ass action flick. I would give the movie a solid 8.5/10. But because I'm nice I will give it a 9/10. Peace Off."
"rogerdarlington","Null","3","7","23 December 2011"," Cruise is back in control
","It was 1996 when Tom Cruise first took Ethan Hunt and the Impossible Mission Force from the small screen to the big screen and 15 years later this is his fourth outing, but he still looks good at 49. For this operation, he is accompanied by Jeremy Renner (""The Hurt Locker"") as Brandt, Paula Patton as (a fair from plain) Jane, and British actor Simon Pegg as IT specialist Benji. Locations jump from Budapest to Moscow (although the Kremlin scenes were actually shot in Prague Castle) to Dubai and finally Mumbai, so neatly maximising the global appeal of the movie.<br/><br/>The villainy is on an epic scale. I thought that ""Sherlock Holmes 2"" - which I saw shortly before - posed a big enough danger: a first world war. But ""Ghost Protocol"" tops that by threatening the last world war. The evil Hendricks - played by Michael Nyqvist (the three Swedish Millennium films) - wants to provoke a nuclear conflagration that will wipe out all of humankind and give evolution a chance to start all over again which would indeed be homicide of a special order and render the inevitable ""M:I 5"" literally impossible.<br/><br/>The pacing of ""Ghost Protocol"" is furious and the whole thing is a real adrenalin rush. The scaling of the Burj Klaifa skyscraper is the highlight (sorry for the pun) and I saw the movie - before its general release - in IMAX on the biggest screen in Britain (London.s BFI) which made this scene truly awesome. More than the previous three episodes, there is some humour, but the best lines go not to Cruise but to Pegg who delivers them in characteristically wry fashion. As with all the other films in the franchise, what is missing is an intelligible plot and an intelligent script and, as with the last one, the ending is weak. But, heh, Cruise is back in control."
"henry_yan","10","3","7","23 December 2011"," Tom Cruise is back, and it's good to be back.......
","If ever there was a film for an actor to resurrect his flagging career, this would be IT. This film has action written all over, and the tension never lets up from the first moment. The viewer will first be transported from cold Eastern Europe, to the magnificent Middle East, and then exotic South Asia, all within the space of just over 2 hours. I would compare this film to be like a roller coaster ride, where you are slowly ascending up the ramp (building the plot) which is then followed by a dramatic breath-taking drop (the supremely spine chilling climb scene outside Dubai's Burj Khalifa...mind blowing), then a couple of twists and turns (the policy wonk who knows more than writing papers), all of which climaxes in a double overhead loop (the end scene at a high tech car park) and finally, the relief at the end of everything. The wonderful thing about rollercoasters is that after the ride, you'll want another round to feel the adrenaline again. This is how it feels like when you finish watching it. You want to see it again. After a summer of fighting robots, talking cars, it is great that 2011 ends the film going year with what I consider a classic thriller."

Yet, it has the most brilliantly conceived and choreographed action gags, very much in line with what you would expect an animation writer to be exceptional at.<br/><br/>The production values are high, but it's not just a bunch of mindless action and karate chopping thugs that bore you to tears; it has a story involving launch codes. It's a fun ride, wonderfully edited. Very hard to tell the real shots from the fake, except in one obvious visual effect scene, where I personally would have chosen to combine miniatures or models and combine it with CGI, instead of just going all-digital. Enagaging, without being unfamiliar or taxing. NOT a Cruise fan, but he does a nice job.<br/><br/>Great cast including Anil Kapoor for you ""24"" fans, and Slumdog admirers.

","A career comeback for an over-the-pinnacle mega-star is always gladly received (haters excluded) as it contains somewhat palatable subtext that the precious second chance will eventually arrive (good luck Eddie Murphy! Or maybe Meg Ryan?).<br/><br/>This latest Mission: Impossible vehicle is an utter treat for the eyes, especially for the IMAX screen audience, I watched it in front of a regular-sized one, still it is as diverting as any action/adventure film could ever proffer! All the locales are prudently chosen, Moscow with the part of a concealingly disguised Prague, Dubai and Mumbai are the three main settings, with all the action sequences come visually gratifying and sometimes eyes-opening (the Burj Khalifa Tower scenes in the trailer alone is tempting enough and the actual outcome is more stunning and breathtaking), prompt quips and one-liners in-between are effectual and measuredly conjured (Simon Pegg is the capital scene-stealer, and the new protagonist of a fourth Bourne feature, Jeremy Renner, also register quite amusing deadpan rib-tickling moments here, the new female agent Paula Patton is a delight too).<br/><br/>The nucleus of Mission: Impossible brand could be recapitulated as one sentence: everything is possible as long as one's imagination can reach, which has been steadfastly proved again by the plot of a last-second foiled nuclear missile. But generally speaking, the storyline is yet willfully implausible, which is a hot potato thornier than any special effects hiccups for the overall action genre. A more sensible remark should be that it is the film itself rescues Tom Cruise's descending career, and apart from the stunt-free acrobatics outside the highest building in the world, Cruise hardly renders anything new in his veteran character, Ethan Hunt."

","The entire premise of this film is that the IMF is falsely implicated in a bombing and the US condemns their alleged actions while Tom Cruise' character tries to catch the true culprit who is planning to nuke the US. The acting is OK and the action is good but the story is not credible and is pure programming.<br/><br/>In reality the IMF is infamously known for steering global politics, much like the US funds terrorism indirectly and sometimes directly to achieve political goals.<br/><br/>They motivate ""rebel"" leaders to seize power. Then they are given the ability to request massive financial aid, pay it out to themselves and their cronies, and pass the bill on to the country's citizens as 'taxes'.

"rishijai","4","4","11","9 January 2012"," A bad movie with a lot of advertising hype
","I saw mission impossible 4 on Imax and I must say this movie is crap. I was duped by all the hype and high ratings given. Rotten tomatoes which is usually good at reviews gave this movie a 93% rating??? I don't even check IMDb anymore since it generates more false positive reviews than anything else.<br/><br/>This movie is really bad and a waste of 2 hours. The CGI effects although elaborate did not impress and seemed irrelevant at some times. The acting was average, the plot seemed hard to follow and baseless. Why would a spy use an Ipad with a periscope? A spy supposed to have gadgets which are inconspicuous not lugging around a big ipad. Contact lenses or eyeglasses with screens would be more practical than carrying iphones and ipads.<br/><br/>The stunts look terrible. Tom cruise hanging at over 100 stories outside of a building and is hair is neatly in place. The wind would be blowing at you as if you were riding a motorcycle. The fighting scenes are even more ridiculous, Tom Cruise and all the spies beats everybody mercilessly without much effort or any skill. The best acting was actually done by Anil Kapoor at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is a waste of money to make and to go and see. Tom Cruise did not make a convincing mission impossible spy. I could not even follow the storyline: something about the Kremlin and stopping a nuclear war. The Russians did not look authentic or how their accents sounded. The mission impossible TV series was more entertaining and realistic than this movie. There was not a good piece of theme music so you could at least enjoy this 'piece of crap' movie. I gave this movie a 4/10 rating. I actually enjoyed Tower Heist better than MI4."

","I am flabbergasted at how this movie got such positive reviews and somehow managed to get a 7.3 on IMDb. <br/><br/>First of all the acting was horrendous. Simon Pegg was meant to be the ""goofy"" character who's jokes seemed fit for an 8 year old. I was disappointed by this as I liked his other movies and felt this movie was beneath him. Jeremy Renner made the best attempt to act in this movie but frankly it just seemed faked and shallow. Sadly, Tom Cruise probably issued the best acting in the film but it was nothing to get excited about. All the actors never made me feel a connection to them and honestly I couldn't care less about what happened to them. <br/><br/>The plot of the movie was a boring ripoff of the Call Of Duty video games (terrorist attempts to incite nuclear war between the US and Russia). The whole thing left me feeling like I've seen this same plot a thousand times before. <br/><br/>Basically don't pay money to see this movie. If you must see it wait till it comes out on netflix or something because financing this terrible movie is just embarrassing. Instead watch the other Mission Impossible because they are at least somewhat engaging."

","Money makes the world go round and it also gets movies made. Wow and wow. The action is intense. It's big in the sense that it's just that, really big budget, and, at the same time, it keeps you on the edge of your seat because it's nerve racking in a good way. Action and Suspense. That's the Movie. The story, ah, who cares, it's dumb really. I know they try to pass it off as being high tech but whatever, it's not. It's a little spy stuff thrown in there with some tech stuff, as in the paperwork can magically print in the suitcase and the contact lenses can act as a camera (lol). I'm laughing because in the end everything they do technically falters in the end and it reverts back to big action and suspense. For example, the woman notices the contact and it ends up in a big shoot 'em up anyway. Will give it that the suspense leading up was great, but in the end it's about the shoot out... and of course the girl fight ... and then the chase. Even the ""spiderman"" gloves don't work in the end, and it comes down to Tommy boy winging it, just like in the end and when the guy is in the vent and that plan doesn't work out in the end either, so Tommy boy, with the Latin chick (who changes in the carnicehaha) have to go and that ends up the action and suspense route. And losing contact in the elevator and so on.It's kind of let's do this elaborate scheme that if we do this carefully and time this right out to the minute ah, never mind, the wiring has gone faulty, back to brute force strength, I'm not complaining, I went there to see action and suspense and got my popcorn's worth.

","If anything Mission:Impossible has been a fickle series of quality among its movies. Some people had give up the hope before M:I3 and were, like me, positively surprised when it turned out to be a good movie.<br/><br/>This time Brad Bird of Pixar fame was on the helm the movie and I do have to say, that the result is quite entertaining. The plot itself is pretty typical ""stop the terrorist nuclear attack""-deal and the action scenes are as ludicrous you'd expect, but the style of the movie doesn't venture too far in the direction of M:I2, which is thought was idiotic beyond silly. Also the final act of the movie lost a quite lot of steam as it did felt like a try to make the movie a bit longer.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is in a good shape and does his part as Ethan Hunt with such a vigor it's just enjoyable to watch. Personally I've never though him as a good ""good guy"" actor, his better roles have always been the bad guys, but this time he actually made me feel, that he is in fact a hero.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast does quite well with the material they are given.

It was partially shot with IMAX cameras which helped to capture some death defying and vertigo inducing stunts for audiences. No special equipment was needed, unless you count Simon Pegg, to make this a funny film in parts too. Some of the special effects will be remembered as quite memorable for the series. Some SFX, such as the magnetic belt seem a little far-fetched and desultory.

Paula Patton is great, the addition Simon Pegg to the main cast was a hit too, and Jeremy Renner is also amazing. Regarding to cast, probably the only thing that you could say was ""missing"" here was Ving Rhames, but I don't, they might have had a good reason for that.<br/><br/>And, you knew what was coming, we need to talk about the stunts here.

And really, this movie opened up the path for what we saw in Rogue Nation, and will probably see on Fallout, just and increasing amount of mind blowing sequences shot by Cruise (WITHOUT STUNTMANS). Really, where will this franchise end up? Movie by movie, I just can't imagine how they will improve from the last one, and they always do!<br/><br/>Well, probably the main issue here is the villan. There isn't much to say about it, it's just a bad guy, that is bad because... he is. There isn't depth at all, and well, this is probably what the franchise has showed us is its main difficult, the only great villan we had was in MI3, and besides that, you kind of forget the other movies' villans. But the rest is great, so it holds up.<br/><br/>To sum up, Ghost Protocol is a great movie. The Mission Impossible franchise is fantastic.

","Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol is a film directed by Brad Bird. After the third one, I was eagerly waiting to watch this one. And one again, the M: I series didn't fail to surprise me.<br/><br/>Plot: Ethan and his IMF team, now disavowed, must stop a Russian strategist who wants to start a war between the US and Russia.<br/><br/>Story and direction: Knowing that Brad Bird (his first live-action film) was going to direct the film, I had huge expectations from it. The story is takes the basic idea of US vs. USSR and spuns it into a complex and diversifying one. The film has so many layers and interesting characters because of which there were no dull moments. The new characters introduced have such interesting back stories that it is interesting to watch them. Each scene is just full of tension and suspense. This film very nicely balances the action and thriller aspect of the film. Full credit goes to Brad Bird on proving that he can give a good film whether animated or live-action. The action scenes and VFX are just spot-on especially the one in Dubai where my heart just skipped a beat several times. The cinematography is just awesome. Since IMAX cameras were used in some scenes, it feels quite good. There are many wide-angle shots that do enhance the beauty of the film. The editing of the film is wonderful. Michael Giacchino has again done wonders with the BGM of the film. My only issue with the film is just the villain. He has no such motivation or arc. He is just a guy who wants to destroy the world. I can very safely say that he is the least impressive villain of the entire series.<br/><br/>Performances: Tom Cruise has just synonymised himself with Ethan Hunt. It is juts difficult to imagine this series without him. Jeremy Renner delivers a great performance. So does Paula Patton. Simon Pegg returns in this film with a much meatier role as compared to the previous venture and he just impresses. Michael Nyquist was good on the acting department but nothing the story did to move his character forward. Ving Rhames and Michelle Monaghan do return in smaller roles but it is always good to see them both. <br/><br/>Favorite Scene: Apart from the Dubai Sequence (which is almost everyone's favorite scene in this film), I would say the film ending was quite good. Ethan says that however difficult the mission be, it is the team that makes it successful. I liked the fact that the scene stressed on the importance of a team and teamwork.<br/><br/>Verdict: This series never fails to impress me. I can't thank the makers enough for raising the stakes of the film in terms of action and storyline in each and every film a notch higher. Can't wait for ROGUE NATION.<br/><br/>I am going with a 9/10."

Not a movie that was actually just an action one that pretended to be a spy movie but really wasn't. Not only that but Tom Cruise really does give it his all. He probably is better in this movie than he has been in a movie since the early two thousands.

","Very different than the first MI...far less serious. I liked the humor and light hearted JJ Abrams feel but a few things would have made this far better...and they are simple fixes. 1. Much more Josh Holloway! He was coming from LOST and very popular...his role needed to be far greater.<br/><br/>2. When you hit a prison guard with your hands who is wearing a full face guard he shouldn't fall to the ground like hand-to-hand combat! Come on...these details matter.<br/><br/>3. When you go to the proverbial tape scene...""Will you accept this mission"" have a guy with a deep resonating voice...distinct, unique, powerful, strong--not just any guy! These details matter JJ, you are projecting legacy here!<br/><br/>4. The MI Theme needs to amazing! This was weak...much more effort! This needs to be over-the-top production with huge drums and bass...your audience should be singing the theme when they exit the theater...you are setting a template for the next generation JJ! Come on...again!<br/><br/>I was living in the UAE when they filmed the tower scene...HUGE event...as in the greatest rock star visited your country...TC outside of the US in places like the UAE is like Michael Jackson...they LOVE stars there!<br/><br/>The female lead was perfect...she is super hot but intelligent in looks...you believe she could be a school teacher, that her beauty is not her identity...she has a mind of her own. <br/><br/>Jeremy Renner is gold...always. Not Hollywood Josh Holloway good looks, but like Tom Hardy, believable is everything he does.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise: Do the nose experiment with him. Just stare at his nose and you will be stunned how huge it is. His features distract you because of his looks, but that nose grows by the second once you focus on it. He handled the comedy well...yet, with Mr C, his Scientology crazy will always be a stamp, a distraction to overlook. Leah Remini isn't doing him or his ""faith"" any favors.<br/><br/>Overall, a good installment. Take the franchise very seriously, but allow the movie to breath. Maybe the next time more intense drama, but this was a nice addition."

","Maybe it's because I've watched the first four M:I films in the last three days, but I'm starting to tire a little of the formula. I had high hopes that director Brad Bird's fourth instalment would continue the upward trend set by the other sequels, building on what had gone before, but it merely offers more of the same—which doesn't make it a bad movie, just not as satisfying as it might have been.<br/><br/>The film starts with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) escaping a Russian jail so that he can join an IMF team on a mission to infiltrate the Kremlin, which holds files that can identify the Russian extremist known as Cobalt. While they are there, Cobalt detonates a bomb, and the blast is blamed on the IMF agents, who are immediately disavowed. Hunt, accompanied by agents Jane (Paula Patton, supplying the eye candy), Benji (Simon Pegg, supplying the comic relief) and Brandt (Jeremy Renner) must now find Cobalt without the backing of the IMF before he can attain the codes needed to launch a nuclear missile and start WWIII.<br/><br/>As with part three, the pace for Ghost Protocol is pretty fast, with plenty of spectacular action scenes, but at 133 minutes long it all becomes a vacuous blur of high speed chases, shootouts and far-fetched stunts, with Cruise flashing his s**t-eating grin at regular intervals. The much touted sequence atop the Burj Khalifa tower is worth the price of admission alone, and the final smack-down in an automated underground multi-storey garage is rather ingenious and suitably gritty, but the other action set-pieces are largely forgettable.<br/><br/>Fans of the series thus far will no doubt have an enjoyable time with this undemanding slice of big-budget escapism, as did I, but don't expect anything truly outstanding."

","Reviewed December 2011<br/><br/>Way too much hype undid the movie for me. It didn't have the mean bad guy the other missions had and the stunts are only as good as MI3. But still it is a fantastic ride and a welcome addition to the franchise.<br/><br/>It starts with a delivery intercept gone wrong where some top secret information has gone to the wrong hands and a macho prison break of Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) from a high security Russian prison aided by his team consisting of computer guy Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Jane Carter (Paula Patton). On accepting a mission to recover secret tapes from inside Kremlin, things go wrong as vested interests uses IMF team as bait to distract and steal the Russian nuclear launch codes. IMF is implicated in the blast and theft and a number of people are looking for them. His team with limited ammunition and support, has to clear their name and save the world. <br/><br/>The screenplay is breezy but the script is far from tight. There has never been a mission where Hunt works from inside IMF and this one is no exception. What lives up to the hype surrounding the movie are the couple of fantastic thrills involving Burj Dubai. Tom Cruise gets a special mention for his effortless stunts while exhibiting the charisma. The final showdown ends in a hurry (though not void of some exhilarating stunts) but the conclusion of the movie takes its time. Scenes involving Anil Kapoor and Mumbai are shoddy and extravagant. <br/><br/>MI3 is definitely a better movie elevated by Hoffman, but MI4 doesn't do too bad either. Don't believe the hype and watch with a clear mind, there is a chance you might like it."

","It doesn't top the opening for the third installment, but the opening sequence of this film when the IMF crew is trying to break Hunt out of prison is very-well executed and action-packed, which is no surprise coming from the very ""fun"" director, Brad Bird.<br/><br/>I don't know if I ever saw the trailer for this installment in the Mission: Impossible series, so I'm not sure if this moment was shown in the trailer, but when the Kremlin explodes in the background while Ethan is running in the foreground, it startled me a great deal on my first viewing. It was a very simple, yet shocking moment in an action movie, at least to me.<br/><br/>This sets the premise for the rest of the film: Hunt and his crew have to go rogue since IMF is implicated in the explosion of the Kremlin.<br/><br/>The Macguffin - the launch codes - is easy enough to follow, as a Macguffin should be, but in the scene where they are making the false transactions - one for the female assassin, one for the men who need the launch codes - I never clearly heard Hunt's reasoning for giving the two men the actual launch codes. Also, I didn't understand Jeremy Renner's special contact lens - from what I understood it was able to encrypt the launch codes into a different sequence, but for who? This confused me especially since I knew they were going to supply the actual launch codes to the men who wanted them.<br/><br/>The scene following is a phenomenal action sequence which is so tense since we, along with Ethan, cannot see what is going on in a sandstorm, and have to keep our eyes peeled to Ethan's tracking device to realize how he cuts the villain off and is about to cause a head-on collision. It still doesn't stop the villain, but it is smart to put us in the dark just like Ethan.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the film that was a little difficult to follow - and a little boring as well - was the explanation for what happened to Ethan's wife. With film, there is usually a ""show, don't tell"" principle to follow, but when Renner's character and Hunt talked about the events and what really happened to Hunt's wife, it could have used this principle instead of making us rely on every detail spoken to discern what they are talking about.<br/><br/>This film reminded me of the first in that it was more pretentious than it should have been, but the action was much more exciting than in some of the previous films.<br/><br/>3.0/4.0"
"danielloe","7","0","0","13 July 2015"," Fun, lots of tension, and some good performances really sell this
","*WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS* Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, the fourth M:I movie, combines a lot of the good elements of the previous three movies. There's a smart story, with the on-the-run aspect that we've had so many times in this series, but this one does it probably the best. They really do have some weaknesses, they don't have all the resources the usually do. One thing that bumped this movie up a few points is that the plans the heroes lay don't actually work, they have to improvise, lots of bad stuff happens, and we get to see Ethan Hunt and crew come up with new plans on the fly. That was really fun to see, especially since that hadn't happened before in the M:I series. I thought the main cast gave really strong performances, as well. Not like Oscar winning performances, but for a spy-action movie these performances were pretty good. Out of all four of the movies, this was the movie where Cruise gave the best performance, and Jeremy Renner was a nice addition as well. And then, there's the stunt. The stunt to end all stunts, the most famous stunt ever. I am of course, talking about Tom Cruise climbing up the side of the building. I don't know all the technical stuff about how they shot it, and I don't want to, what I do know is that it looks amazing. This will sound fake, but this is 100% true. My hands were sweating throughout this entire scene. I don't know why, I mean, I know he won't die, but still, it's just like... yeah. Probably one of the tensest scenes in any movie ever. There's some good action here, that's just y'know, standard spy martial arts kind of fighting, but what really makes this movie so exciting was all the tension. I already mentioned the climb, but there's also the finale, where they're trying to stop a nuke from blowing up the U.S., and they're just in four different places, trying to stop all these things from happening. For example, Cruise is trying to get a case back to stop the missile, and it keeps getting shifted onto different platforms going up and down, while he and the villain fight to get it. Eventually the villain gets it, and leaps to his death with it. The whole scene is really tense, and the conclusion is just like... oh no, how...? So in the end, I had a lot of fun with this movie, it's action packed, very suspenseful, has great acting, and even has a pretty good story. Like every other M:I movie, aside from the third one, this has a pretty weak villain, but aside from that, this movie is really good."

","I watched this 4th Mission Impossible instalment immediately following the 3rd and in all honesty I was a bit underwhelmed. I can't quite explain it but this just fell flat for me somehow. That's not even the right word I mean its an excellent movie; gripping, stylish, fast paced with a big budget and multiple globe trotting locations as well as the incredible action scenes and stunts. -Yes this is the movie where Tom (actually) climbs the world's tallest recorded building in Dubai -and yes that an awesome sequence. But something was still just off for me. <br/><br/>I immediately missed the old team although I did like the addition of Jeremy Renner. Simon Pegg on the other hand, (as much as I adore him) I preferred in a smaller role, as his slapsticky sidekick routine got old fast here. <br/><br/>As a whole I didn't find the story as gripping as I'd expected and there were a lot of long drawn out scenes without dialogue, just stuff happening, like when they're in the Kremlin with the screen. Cool but it went on too long. There were also lots of subtitles and newscasters or voiceovers. It was just a totally different vibe than the other movies, which I guess can be a good thing, to keep a franchise fresh but it took me a while to get with the program here.<br/><br/>The story opens with superspy Tom being busted out of a Russian prison, then the Kremlin gets bombed with the blame falling on the Impossible Mission Team. Ethan Hunt then assembles a new team who travel the globe using every high-tech trick in the book to uncover the truth. <br/><br/>A few random thoughts: Where's the old team, doesn't feel the same without them I'm feeling a bit bored. His wife is what, just gone? Nice explication for her absence ""after his wife, well you know."" Where do they keep getting all these gadgets from along the way? Its not like they're small and fit in their luggage. Yay more robot like Tom running super fast. Cool sand storm never seen that done before. Okay that was awesome insert heart back in chest(re the building climb and swing back in the window) None of these magic gadgets are working very well Yay an explanation on Tom's wife And some cameos from the old team.

"Cnerd1993","Null","0","0","12 September 2012"," I Think My Standards Were Too High
","Coming into this movie, I didn't quite know what to expect. To give some background, I've loved Mission: Impossible ever since I was seven years old. I really loved the first movie, despite some of the elements that have been criticized. I also still love the original TV series with Peter Graves and company.<br/><br/>Now on to the actual movie, when I first saw it, I was a bit nit-picky and expecting a lot more out of the whole plot and tone, and now after letting some time pass, I think I was a bit too harsh. Brad Bird is a capable director and I thought it was pretty neat to see his name in the credits, and it even gave me some clue as to what to expect. Many of the big action scenes were well done and exciting (the building scaling scene was really great, as well as the prison scene.) I suppose my main complaint was that the characters seemed almost invincible. Like when Ethan is using his rappelling rope to swing back into the hotel room and smacks his face. I think it's pretty safe to say that he would be unconscious or, at the very least, have some serious bruises. That scene, combined with the other numerous times where he probably would have been seriously injured, are what most caught my attention.<br/><br/>You might say that those things are common in action movies, and you're right, but compare it to the first movie where there is almost no huge epic action scene (save for the train scene, which is also highly implausible, but you still feel the tension and suspense of it.) My point is, there aren't a whole lot of scenes where he gets injured and quickly recovers. Case in point is where he gets in a fight with Phelps and is knocked down after getting hit only a few times. But in spite of that, I guess that doesn't really matter because in terms of action, the Mission: Impossible movies never really had a consistent style to the plot and tone (and yes, I realize that MI: 2 was definitely the worst of the series.) This one was done more tongue-in-cheek and with more humor, and I guess I wasn't quite expecting that. That doesn't make it a bad movie; it was a pretty fun experience, not to mention the gadgets and stunts were great as usual. Like I said, I probably shouldn't have been so strict, and I should have just enjoyed it for what it is: A decent movie with good scenes and worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>So, my verdict: I recommend going to see it once or twice, or perhaps more. If you like action movies, you'll most likely like this one."

","I like Tom Cruise as a film actor, he can go from that despair look of ""the world is about to end"" to intense determination in a split second. The music helps too, and through-out the movie the music is a real blood pumper. The only thing I can think of that could make someone think that the movie is not so great, is the plot which is contrived and nothing new. Its Mission Impossible, however, and no other television franchise has been able to pull off as successful a following (outside of Star Trek) as this one. Sometimes it is hard to get over the ""Tom Cruise is a nut case"" thoughts, but what actor is not a nut case ? If you let yourself get into the picture it moves at a very rapid base till the last scene which moves very slowly till the final moments before the credit roll. Mr Cruise also acts as producer of the film and that means he will be pulling in the dollars...and thats a good thing for the soon to be ex Mrs Cruise and Scientology too.."

I enjoyed the part Ethan Hunt jumps over Burj to get back to his Hotel suite wherein the sequence ends with a good laugh.

"DICK STEEL","10","4","12","15 December 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol
","Does Brad Bird, whose resume reads The Iron Giant, The Incredibles and Ratatouille have what it takes to deliver a Mission: Impossible film, especially after what J.J. Abrams had done with the third installment? You bet your last dollar Bird pulled it off with aplomb, giving us the flavours that makes M:I distinct and unique, while shaking things up a bit to prevent us from lulling into plot complacency. It's a worthy addition to the M:I cinematic mythos, and may I say the best M:I film yet, and coming off the trail left by Abrams, John Woo and Brian De Palma, does say something about the quality Bird brings to the table.<br/><br/>From the get go you know Bird had it down to a pat and all done right, mixing stylish, elaborate action sequences with a dash of deep drama, leaving room for characterization, as well as entertaining with comedy stemming from laughing at the impossible at times. Credit must go to scribes Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec for what I felt was a large combination of the right ingredients from the first two films - with the threat on a global scale (MI:2 on a pandemic, and here it's nuclear annihilation), while having the IMF agents very much crippled without a support network, although they do remember this time round that it's team effort, compared to M:I where Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt was very much a one man He-Man.<br/><br/>And hey, we have new agents too, such as Paula Patton's hard kicking Jane who has to battle her own personal urges to avenge her partner and lover's death at the hands of an assassin (Lea Seydoux), and the shady Brandt (Jeremy Renner in one of many franchise roles - M:I, Avengers, Bourne) who comes off as a bookish analyst but harbours a deep dark secret that I thought played out really well when the pace had to take a logical pause in the eye of the storm before having the characters getting all bruised and battered again. And Simon Pegg returns as the affable tech whiz Benji, here given an expanded role since obtaining the go- ahead to operate as a field agent, and showing his rookie jitters.<br/><br/>There were many elements here that went right and aced it in the hole. There's the characters who were all properly built up in ways far better than the previous installments, and a real sense of camaraderie emerges amongst the players, having to emphasize on the importance of the team rather than the individual. And when it did have to do so since Cruise's Hunt brings about a certain degree of undisputed star power and character experience (after having to save the IMF/World thrice already), it did so in such perfect terms that it rolled into the narratively so subtly, that amped anticipation, and grows on you why Hunt is considered the best of the lot. That scene alone at Burj Khalifa was well worth the price of an admission ticket, leaving you breathless with that real sense of danger since it's widely publicized Cruise did the stuntwork himself, while yet also toning down on Hunt's super-human ability. I'd bet you won't see a particular moment coming, although it did leave one wondering if Hunt has bones made of adamantium.<br/><br/>And that's not all, from an action junkie perspective, Hunt and team have to battle natural phenomenon in sandstorms, explosions, car chases and stunts (oh Santa, I want that BMW), more chases on foot (you'll know by now Ethan Hunt runs, a lot, in the missions he chooses to accept), fisticuffs in some of the most amazing landscapes and structures, and plenty more death defying stunts in each of the exotic locales the team have to travel to. What made it more interesting rather than to rely on the same old formula, is that this mission left our operatives fairly on their own, with limited resources to work with. While the earlier missions may have them almost always on a tactical advantage, this time round they're more reactive than proactive, severely testing their street smarts and abilities to see the mission through, though at each milestone you may think they would have lost more than gained, with plans having to get altered on the fly.<br/><br/>Which suits the story just fine. There's no complacency here, with everything being fair game. If there's a gripe, it'll be how unremarkable the villain, a rogue Russian physicist Hendricks (Michael Nygvist) seemed to be after Philip Seymour Hoffman's excellent turn in M:I:III that it's a hard act to follow, but the trade off is of course having the focus put on the evocation of Ghost Protocol and how that would severely challenge the limits of Hunt's IMF team, with everyone else being disavowed. Anil Kapoor had a bit role here as a rich Mumbai playboy which was more comical than threatening, and Tom Wilkinson takes over the mantle as IMF chief from the likes of Laurence Fishburne and Anthony Hopkins in previous installments.<br/><br/>Signs will point to another Mission: Impossible, and whether or not Jeremy Renner will take over the helm from Tom Cruise will remain to be seen, especially since Cruise has yet again stamped his mark on this film and will be a tough act to follow. With each installment we see a different side of Hunt, and here is for once only with the slightest of a romantic subplot in the film, with emphasis on the team's race against time in one grippingly paced action adventure. Brad Bird brought about that sense of scale and danger fitting as a Mission: Impossible, and without a doubt the best in the franchise so far. A definite must watch!"

Of course it makes it's adversaries look like idiots and has a really annoying comic relief electronics man. I really hate when script writers think that making everything go wrong builds tension. Tension is built by having smart characters do smart things and still the hero comes out on top. This movie makes it look like spies go into the field with lots of faulty equipment.

","For those of us who didn't see MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL on the big screen but bought into the rave reviews that this is the best of all the MI pictures this 4th installment is a big letdown. Brad Bird as director may be part of the problem: his credits prior to this assignment include Up, Ratatouille, The Incredibles, The Iron Giant, The Simpsons, and such like - films that depend on the animation magic they bring to cute stories but somehow don't transfer well to the use of actors in a 'serious' film. Writers Josh Appelbaum and André Nemec based this script very loosely on Bruce Geller's original television series, but in this film they seem to opt more for inserted comedy lines when there is anything vaguely beyond the minimal conversations that occur. The film is like a ship without a sail and headed in a direction full of sidetracks.<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise in a Tom Cruise Production) and his team Jane Carter (Paula Patton), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) are racing against time to track down a dangerous terrorist named Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist), who has gained access to Russian nuclear launch codes and is planning a strike on the United States. An attempt by the team to stop him at the Kremlin ends in a disaster, with an explosion causing severe destruction to the Kremlin and the IMF being implicated in the bombing, forcing the President to invoke Ghost Protocol, under which the IMF is disavowed, and will be offered no help or backup in any form. Undaunted, Ethan and his team chase Hendricks to Dubai, and from there to Mumbai, but several spectacular action sequences later, they might still be too late to stop a disaster.<br/><br/>It all starts in Budapest with the assassination of Trevor Hanaway (Josh Holloway) by Sabine Moreau (Léa Seydoux), proceeds to a prison breakout (Ethan Hunt has been imprisoned for killing some Serbian guards), the Russian secrets are discovered, aborted plans lead the team form the Kremlin to Dubai (for Tom Cruise's reportedly self performed scaling of a glass tower) and subsequently to Mumbai and on and on an on for well over two hours. The movie is fast moving and the booms and blowups and car chases and pyrotechnics and absurdly one-sided fights (yes, the girls get to fight and kill each other) manage to keep our attention because of spectacle. There are a couple of moments where we get to learn just a bit about some of the characters an their motivations to be part of this invincible team, but in the end we care very little about any of them as they talk their way through a soupy ending. OK to see on television on demand but not a film to own. But that is just one opinion from a viewer who likes story in a movie. <br/><br/>Grady Harp,"

","Brad Bird went from animation to live action as director of MI4-Ghost Protocol and i must say this transition clearly went very well, the set pieces in this film were excellently shot, they really sucked me in, almost to the point that I did have a serious feeling of vertigo during the Burj Khalifa scene. As always Tom Cruise performs his own stunt work and this makes the experience all that more intense. <br/><br/>but despite the set pieces being visually stunning, especially the sandstorm chase, i couldn't help but feel the movie was lacking something. it seemed that everything in between the action was filled with unrealistic gadgetry, product placement (you know who you are!) and filler jokes from Benji (Simon Peg). Now I must stress that i am also a huge Simon Pegg fan, and without sounding like a complete hipster me and many of my friends have been be advocates of Simon Pegg for a lot longer than he has been mainstream so i was very disappointed that i didn't warm to his characters extra screen time in this movie.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast put in solid performances, Paula Patton was excellent and i enjoyed the scenes with Anil Kapoor the Indian Playboy who finds out that money does not always guarantee you a good time! I found the character Brandt interesting and i enjoyed his back story that links in with Ethan's past , although the twist to this particular story was a little easy to predict. I wouldn't want to see Jeremy Renner take on Ethan Hunts mantle future MI movies, i am more than happy for him to just take on the Bourne franchise. Where i thought this movie really let itself down was with the main antagonist, when you watch an action movie there is always the goodies and the baddies, the later is normally someone you really either route for because their plan is so dastardly that you just want them to succeed or they are so evil you just have to see them get taken down in epic style by the hero.<br/><br/>With MI4 i really didn't even notice the bad guy, had their plan not been force fed to me during one of the earlier scenes with the remaining IMF agents i really would not have <br/><br/>A. known who the main bad guy was <br/><br/>B. actually cared what their plan was if it didn't result in some excellent action that they invariably didn't even take part in or actually had any impact on the plot.<br/><br/>After one watch i was able to remember that MI had Phelps, MI2 had Ambrose and MI3 have Davian MI 4 had......hhhmmm i don't know? Cobalt or someone, what i do know is that he does commit some rather unnecessary suicide in some very funky kind of car park that sure beats anything we have here in the UK.<br/><br/>All in all to say that this film was not entertaining would be a lie, it was if only for the beautifully shot action, however to quote myself after the films finale ""I'm glad i didn't pay to see that at the cinema"" <br/><br/>Not as good as the rest but certainly not terrible."

I expected much more excitement, but stopped paying attention to the movie after the opening credits.<br/><br/>Spoiler: Reason I lost interest of this film so fast during the opening credits was due to the fact it reminded me of the last two final destination films here is why, If you pay attention to all the sequences of the opening credits of MI:4 you will have watched the entire movie in like 2 minutes. The Entire Plot is entailed inside this short segment which ruins the movie in my opinion. <br/><br/>Conclusion is that besides the film makers telling you everything that is going to happen before hand... the film did have its moments and the gadgets were completely awesome if the film had had more of a twisting plot instead of the one that you can predict what will happen the whole time then maybe it would be a lot more interesting and would have a higher rating in my eyes..<br/><br/>Those of you that see this film will most likely be just as disappointed as i was..."
"siderite","6","3","8","6 April 2012"," Nothing special at all
","I usually rate average movies with a 7, but this one felt under that bar. Of course, it has to do with expectations. People have told me that this fourth part of the Mission Impossible franchise was better than all the others and I expected something nice. But, since I haven't seen any of the others for reasons of suspension of disbelief, or lack there of, for me it was a big step to just watch this one.<br/><br/>Well, fancy action scenes abound, with cool gadgets James Bond would die of envy for, but that defy the laws of physics and common sense. Agents that look beautiful and smart, but they are almost neither. Tom Cruise does a lot to save the film, but the wooden dialogues and silly script overwhelm him.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Like an old hooker with lots of expensive makeup, it is just not worth it."
"rianbahadurji","4","3","8","31 March 2012"," Bad
","What a disgraceful way to end such an enterprising action franchise. You cannot fault Tom Cruise, this film was definitely not worthy of what he has achieved. You will enjoy it if you're white and make 30 000 a year.But for people who understand movies, its terrible. Its watchable, but it is also a disgrace that the Mission Impossibles before this got worse IMDb ratings. Its disgusting in my opinion. MI 1 2 and three were great, this is gross.. f**** you franchise whores. At this stage of the game MI was expected to redefine the cliché action movie style. Instead it digressed into a lazy wh**e of a movie. Everyone involved should be ashamed. And by the way I have read some reviews which state that there were some nice aerial shots of Mumbai. Just for the record, the Taj Mahal is in Delhi, not Mumbai. How can a film crew expect to pull that off. They were clearly filming Delhi instead of Mumbai. And the stupid final scene, in what was seemingly a car factory, really are you kidding me? No factory in India is anything like that, and im from India. Secondly, the sand storm in Dubai. I have visited dubai 13 times in the last 7 years and let me tell you no such ""sand storm"" ever occurs. Whoever enjoyed this movie this year is the same type of person who will enjoy the movie ""Think like a man""."
"lilmandecicco","9","3","8","2 March 2012"," Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol - A movie viewers Review
","Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is SUSPENSEFUL. I capitalize suspenseful because it is NOT an all out action adrenaline rush movie. It has action sequences in it but it is more of a suspense thriller.<br/><br/>The visual effects are amazing, especially when he's hanging on one of the tallest buildings in the world, and that's because they didn't use ANY special backgrounds or anything. Tom Cruise performed his own stunts and he only used bungee cords and other special equipment, but NO green screens.<br/><br/>Like I mentioned earlier, this is a THRILLER. Do not get this mixed up with an action movie. It is a movie that is meant to tease your mind until the end.<br/><br/>I did enjoy this movie, HOWEVER, they could've put a little more action in it. For a movie, though, it does enlighten future movies towards more of having story than nonstop action."
"onumbersix","5","3","8","3 February 2012"," The formula as usual.
","Having seen most of the films playing that I wanted to see and not being impressed by the new offerings, I decided to go for eye candy and leave my brain at the door. Unfortunately, the latter came to join me anyway and at that point everything unravelled. Critics claimed that this 4th outing in the series was the best, which doesn't bode well for the previous ones which I didn't bother to see. As a teen, I loved this TV series with often well thought out stories. What I liked most of M-I on TV was the way they used every day objects in innovating ways to great effect. But in this film, we are in super effects to fill the eye, especially in Imax, along with doubtful tools. Everything in fact to try to mask an improbable story. Tom Cruise shows us once again his depth by playing Tom Cruise as usual, as he did in so many films before. It gets tiring in the end. He plays this intrepid and invincible American hero who fears nothing, save pretending the fear of heights to pretend to be comical. I could hardly wait for the end of this."
"a-ozornin","9","3","8","17 January 2012"," Action in its purest
","I do not consider myself as the great fan of Mission Impossible franchise. The first part, released in 1996 (!) was action at its purest, with the small intrigue set up by the question ""Who betrayed the group?"" and the soundtrack which pretty soon was installed on 95% of mobile phones as the alarm clock signal. Since then Ethan Hunt became iconic spy, even though the franchise overall was going downhill. The second part was an absolute failure, already too surreal for a serious action movie but still not surreal enough for Matrix-style movie. The third part improved a little bit but generally it was still laughable.<br/><br/>Little surprise, I expected the 4th installment to be at approximately the same boring level. My low expectations were even reinforced by the fact that Tom Cruise was getting older and, as evident in Knight and Day, where the stunts were repetitive and boring. However, I was walking out of the cinema with the smile; Mr. Cruise managed to beat the expectations.<br/><br/>No doubt, the plot is silly and, from time to time, even stupid. Seriously, terrorist acting alone is trying to launch the nuclear attack? Why not mammoths waking up after the Ice Age and trying to crush all the world capitals? Do not expect the depth of the plot out of this movie. Even the jokes that were included to keep the plot together will entertain only those who have not seen the other parts of the franchise. But this movie was created to amuse us by the dynamic action, wasn't it? And the action part is something that is done well in this movie. I was watching it in IMAX, and the adventure outside the Burj Khalifa is breathtaking when shown on the huge screen. Faster heart rate and round eyes are guaranteed when the screen is large enough or when one is too afraid of the height. But even if we do not consider the episode, there are quite a few stunning scenes, chases and fights to keep the viewer busy holding on their chairs tight.<br/><br/>It would be pretty weird to expect some outstanding performance out of the cast. Tom Cruise is simply doing his job, and doing it pretty well – it requires little acting talent but a lot of effort in performing the stunts. Simon Pegg is always good, he is very convincing yet again as the computer geek (Paul was the movie where he trained the role, I believe). Paula Patton as ""the Hunt's girl"" needed only good figure, which she has, just watch out the party in Mumbai. Jeremy Renner who played William Brandt requires a line as well. He was absolutely up to speed with Tom Cruise, perfect action figure, I was surprised (in a good sense) with his performance. There are rumors that he is going to replace Tom Cruise in future installments of the Mission Impossible, and I can stay reassured – he will be a good spy.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Much better than the previous ones, breathtaking action featuring forever young Tom Cruise WATCH: if you want to give your brains a rest and simply want some dynamic stupid action.<br/><br/>m-picturegoer.blogspot.com"
"dtucker86","Null","3","8","26 December 2011"," Hold onto your seats
","With his Scientology preaching and couch jumping antics, its hard to take Tom Cruise seriously isn't it? He has just coasted so long on his pretty boy looks. As far as I'm concerned he hasn't really earned his paycheck since A Few Good Men, thats the last time he really ""acted"" as far as I'm concerned. However, who am I to quibble. Fans of Mission Impossible don't pay to see Ethan Hunt and his agents do Shakespeare or Tennessee Williams, they pay to see lots of action and we get it in spades here! This movie would have been a lot more effective if they had made it during the Cold War since it involves an attack on the Kremlin. There is a lot of action to keep you on the edge of your seat especially the one where Hunt Spidermans down the side of the world's tallest building. People with fear of heights should not watch this movie. Jane Patton does a wonderful job as a ballsy female agent with a score to settle."
"abhikum-cool","7","3","8","25 December 2011"," Nice, but no match for MI-2
","As I summarized, it has nice kick-ass action sequences, extra-cool gadgets, but this film is no match for the MI legacy, which I believe, started from MI-2.<br/><br/>To start with, there are many inconsistencies in the film, especially in the India sequences. e.g. Brij Nath was located in Mumbai, which has Marathi as regional language. But there is no mention how agent Hunt and his team land in a place where Billboards are in Kannada language, which happens to be the language of Mumbai's (read Maharastara's) neighboring state Karnataka, immediately after kicking Brij Nath's ass!!! As for the Indian connection in this film, Mr. Anil Kapoor, he was a real disappointment. You deserve better than this Mr. Kapoor.<br/><br/>But if we leave these ""minor"" inconsistencies aside, this film is a good watch. It has really cool gadgets, sexy concept cars from BMW, some really nice action sequences, the best and the star of the movie being the Burj-Khalifa action sequences, and nice one-liners (especially from Benji) which make you laugh.<br/><br/>All in all, do watch this movie, in theater, but don't take your brains with you. :)"

","It was Brilliant idea to hire Brad bird for MI 4 ....the animated guy brought the fun which we are luxury to watch in animation. The MI 4 was smart and very funny. Simon Pegg was jewel for me in the movie. His comic timing and personality made the movie lot of fun to watch. Of course it will be of obviously Tom Cruise movie with most of the actions involved around him. The fast space action was the 2nd reason i loved the movie. The Khailfa scene was beautifully directed and acted by all the team. Though special mention for Tom cruice here for his bravery act the Khalifa scene on its own. I gave very little importance to story as such, since story lets say in MI and other action movies too much fictitious for my taste. The gadgets and cars were Awesome. Though Anil Kapoor role was very cheap and he should have considered taking that role, but Hollywood limelight is hard to ignore. All in the end a very good movie and a must watch for many."
"cooljalz","9","3","8","19 December 2011"," What an outstanding Movie!!!!!!!! This 'Mission' is 'Impossible' to resist!!!!
","Believe me action or stunts in any form can't get any better than this. Ghost Protocol takes us to witness the zenith of human physical potential. This is the best movie in action genre I have ever seen and it might remain at the top of my list for my life. It is a relentless thrill packed ride which kept me on the edge of my seat and finally when it ended I seriously wanted Tom Cruise to pull out one last stunt in the closing credits. <br/><br/>The plot is seemingly straight throughout the movie but Brian Bird has kept some mind boggling twists which makes it one hell of a movie!! Every aspect of this movie is simply awesome, be it bird's direction, use of globally important locations as proving grounds for 'nothing is impossible', acting, dialogues,cutting edge technology and what not. Bird has brought in his imagination enriched by his experience in animation to give some everlasting scenes. Be it the opening sequence, the prison scene ,the burj al arab daredevilry, the missile scene or the climax which is a masterclass. <br/><br/>It will be a sin to reveal any detail of the plot because watching it on screen is once in a lifetime experience which I don't want any of you guys to get spoiled. Everyone involved in this movie has given their 100%. But to leave it without mentioning the super cool cast will be silly. Paula Patton has essayed her role of the tough yet loving agent wonderfully. Simon Pegg, just brilliant in bringing comic reliefs in the serious missions. Jeremy Renner, as the mysterious and complicated analyst is just superb, in fact his character is the best written one. Michael Nyquist as the bad guy has that cool menace around him and he proves himself as the unbeatable, smart, savvy villain with ease. But I thought he was given less screen space. There should have been more one on one scenes with the hero. Anil Kapoor has a very small role but has performed it well. <br/><br/>But the real star is Tom. He has given everything in his body for this role. He has really cheated death in this one. I feel pity on those guys who compare Shah Rukh Khan with him. Its Nonsense!!! Tom Cruise has comeback with a bang after the failure of Knight and Day and has shown that when it comes to versatility he is the best. He has portrayed a fragile, vulnerable, more human but relentless, master strategist and having never say die attitude Ethan Hunt which is why it makes this character more believable and more likable. Brian Bird also deserves some credit for that. <br/><br/>So to summarize, I am giving it 9/10 just because of some minor flaws and also because I thought some human and weapon action should have replaced some technical scenes when it comes to the mission. The action takes the cake for being the show-stealer. But Tom Cruise, I bow several times to you for the amazing for doing this impossible mission because after all difficult is just a walk in the park for you!!!!!!!"

"mokhatib","9","3","8","16 December 2011"," A roller coaster thrill ride !!!!
","Power, adrenaline, thrill, rush, are many of the pure ingredients of Tom Cruise's formula for Mission-Impossible-Ghost Protocol. Well I can assure you MIGP will take you for the roller coaster ride of your life and you will just wish the movie never ended.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise returns as Agent Ethan Hunt thrown into a plot not related to the third installment. I am not going to spoil the movie since not a lot of people have watched it yet but it is more than safe to say that the acting performances are superb, a solid script, Cruise is 'the' super action star, Jeremy Renner is a magnificent action addition to this cast, the female touch in this story is both sexy and lethal as portrayed by Paula Patton, Simon Pegg does a wonderful job with his subtle comedy without overdoing or exaggerating it and yet being serious and responsible when need be.<br/><br/>It is clearly evident that the writers this time relied heavily on lesser action scenes, or lesser action in the suspenseful scenes especially lesser fight scenes, in comparison with the previous three parts, in favor of more wit, suspense, and gut-wrenching challenging twists and turns in the plot that persistently and truly make this mission for Ethan and his team impossible to accomplish and this is obvious in the final scene when Ethan says:"" the only thing that functioned in this mission is this team"".<br/><br/>Two things did not really sit right with me about this movie, one, I found that the first scene in this movie, the prison scene, action and suspense wise was not up to par in comparison with the commencing scenes of the first three parts, I guess the writers introduced the new ""less action, more wit and suspense"" formula from the beginning of the movie and carried it along, I think they should have begun with the old formula and then kicked in the new mode after the credits. Two, the first thing that comes to my mind and I am assure to a lot of people's minds when the name Dubai is mentioned, is images of beautiful and spacious landscapes full of extravagant buildings, constructions, and towers yet the writers decided to introduce Dubai in the movie with desert and camels ?!!!!!???!?!?!? As an Arab and a Lebanese I found that to be insulting, especially when Ethan swerves off in his car to avoid hitting a group of camels walking in the middle of the road; two elements here caught my attention the camels and the road, reflecting to me the idea of regression and primitiveness that some Arab people are still using camels to get to their destinations, and again the Western's and especially the American's image and idea about the Arab people associated with camels and desert is repeated here and I feel the color of the sand of these deserts was exaggerated or increased to give it more an oriental desert look and not the usual color you would see in other non-Arab countries, I lived in Dubai for one whole year and never in those days, as far as I can remember, have I seen so much camels, if any at all, like I saw in this movie, and this is not the right color of sand found in the UAE, it is much lighter in tone. Still in general I enjoyed this movie a whole lot, I had a childish smile on my face throughout and got the occasional goose bumps from time to time.<br/><br/>MIGP is an intensifying, action-thriller, watch it or miss out on the ride of your life."

","I think Ghost Protocol is the best Mission Impossible of the lot. It grips you from beginning to end with high octane fuel filled action. The acting was great and is really quite funny at times especially with 'Sean of the Dead' Star Simon Pegg. The Scenes on the side of the tallest building in the world are breath taking and keep you on the edge of your seat. Put your reservations of Tom Cruise aside, he did really well in this action packed movie. The only flaw I noticed was, where were the people as Ethan Hunt scaled the side of the glass walled building, surely someone would have noticed? This is one movie in a series that has got better as they progress and not worse."
"kill-segfault","9","5","17","15 December 2011"," It is what it is - a perfect action movie.
","100% on RT and I told myself I'll have to watch it and I am glad I did. MI4 has everything that you would want from a perfect action movie - from bombs to guns to WMDs to blow 'em all ups. I watched it at the IMAX here 1.5 hours ago and here I am compelled to write a review. <br/><br/>I am glad they've put those IMAX cameras to good usage - part of what makes it such an impressive and immersing movie is that 25 minutes of IMAX footage. Taking a leaf out of Nolan's book, director Brad Bird, shows you grand shots of places in Russia and Dubai. <br/><br/>It's only natural that you compare it to MI3 ( I don't want to compare it to MI2/MI1 coz MI1 was the trend setter and there was nothing that I liked about MI2.) MI3 worked better at drama level - It had a strong villain - It made Ethan Hunt look vulnerable (kind of how Casino Royale made Daniel Criag look). MI4 kind of brings you back to MI1 - You don't get to see a lot of drama, but the action keeps you at the edge of your seat. Sure, the screenplay is nothing write home about and you can almost tell what would happen to the end, but some of the action sequences in Dubai are those that keep your eyes glued to the screen. <br/><br/>Cruise was at his natural best - No Sweat. Surprise packages: Simon Pegg and Jeremy Renner - throw in the best British comedian and the best modern generation actor - saves your action movie from the usual Hollywood cheese. Paula Patton is getting old and you get to notice that even more when you get to see Léa Seydoux. <br/><br/>All in All, a fun and action-jam-packed action movie. 9/10"

"nestortrinidad","6","4","13","17 December 2011"," Ballistic Missile Scene Totally Unrealistic
","I found this 4th installment of the Mission Impossible series very well made and entertaining. However, the last few scenes concerning the launch of the nuclear missile from the Russian nuclear sub and its ballistic journey were completely UNREALISTIC and nearly ruined the whole thing!! The movie had it that the USA defenses for a ballistic missile attack were virtually non-existent. I've seen too many movies and read too many books to know that NORAD would have detected the missile launch and initiated warnings to the USA's nuclear forces. Then comes the alert to the anti-ballistic defenses notably the patriot and the AEGIS ABM systems to shoot down the missile before it re-entered earth's atmosphere. At the very least, the USA would've launched a corresponding retaliatory attack on a Russian city and on the sub once the missile trajectory was determined. All this would take place in a matter of minutes. So I can't figure out why the movie screen writers didn't take this into consideration and just opted for a james bond type of near miss scene. Anti-ballistic technology is no secret - been around for years.. If Michael Bay directed this he would've had space based defense platforms with ABMs and lasers shooting down those bad nukes... On another note, i like how they tied up the loose ends in the movie's closing scenes especially that info on Ethan Hunt's wife. I give this movie 6 out of 10"
"lesdroits","3","3","9","28 May 2012"," bad writing, no acting, no story, no expert team
","We'd just finished watching MI3, which was entertaining if, of course, wholly improbable--still, fun, so we thought we'd now watch this latest.<br/><br/>Especially compared with previous MIs, what a let down. **Hereafter may be spoilers, in discussing what does and does not happen, so beware *** For starters, and unlike all good MI story lines (movie or TV) -- this movie contained not one single -- I repeat, not one single -- successful, coordinated team effort, you know, where they all do their own parts with incredible (genuinely incredible) agility and precision to culminate in a successful mission. Did I mention, NOT ONE? Instead, apparently to be funny, rather than a good team, it's just a miscellaneous woman plus that computer geek from MI3 (about which more below), and some analyst guy (Jeremy) added in, I guess, just to add him in. NO TEAM --At least, no competently trained team. Instead, these character rarely acted together, rarely followed any plan reliably (but often did other than as planned, out of stupidity or just untimely questioning), etc etc So -- never gave that fantasy jolt of a team of super slick folks doing what they do best together. Never. <br/><br/>To make my point, compare MI3 party scene (where they replace Huffman in the Vatican) with this party scene which you can't even make sense of. Villain there, villain gone, Tom kisses woman, villain back. I think the comparison between these scenes shows it all.<br/><br/>What this film DID have were poorly written attempts at humor. MI3 had some clever lines (like Cruise, when asked how he is on ammo, looks, says he has enough, takes one successful shot, then says, ""now I'm out""). This flick had none of that but instead silly, childish banter by that computer geek who has now lost weight and is elevated to being part of what passes for a team in this movie -- but he won't shut up! Banter, banter, banter -- like listening to the conversation of R2D2! Again, I GUESS the writer thought it would be funny, but it's just annoying. He's not, by the way, giving any important info in this banter -- just banter, presumably to be funny.<br/><br/>And lastly, and perhaps as importantly as the total absence of any well-executed team mission is the absence of a meaningful storyline. Oh, sure, there's a necessary bad guy and his side kick, plus a woman assassin thrown in apparently just so they could have a scene with two women fighting because she wasn't otherwise important to any plot. Perhaps they just replaced dialogue with explosions and the storyline got lost on the cutting room floor. Lots of explosions. Yeah, high wire act, but this time, as with this whole movie, NOT done with the sense of precision and inevitability, but just a mess. <br/><br/>Bottom line -- writing was terrible, acting rather non-existent (thought Cruise did some good emoting in MI3 -- really wasn't here this time, just the smirk), and overall a terrible movie. Who on earth ever gave this movie even a 5, much less a 7.5, must have never seen any well done MI or Bourne movies. This was closer to a spoof."

","I Llked mission Impossible 1 and 2, but 3 not as much has 1 and 2. But this one I think out does them all. The action has never more intense, the characters all shine, and it has a great sense of humor.<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt and IMF team(Paula Patton and Simon Pegg) are framed for blowing up the Kremlin. They all go on the run, with Analyst Brett(Jeremy Renner) coming along for the ride. They all must go undercover, and prove there innocents, and hopes of preventing another disaster. Before it all comes crashing down on them all.<br/><br/>Brad Bird who is known for directing such animated films like The Iron Giant(1999), and The Incredibles(2004), really does well, when it comes to directing the action. Tom Cruise is good here too, but I like the way it never becomes like a Tom Cruise vehicle, cause everybody gets there chance to shine, Cruise never hogs the spotlight too much. Paula Patton and Smon Pegg shine quite perfectly in there roles, so does Jeremy Renner. And the action is far more intense than ever. you'll get your moneys worth."

","Trying to stop a renegade plutocrat from launching World War Three is quite a hoary old plot, used in more than one James Bond movie and many rip-offs. But the sheer pace of this MISSION IMPOSSIBLE outing and its thrilling 'set-piece' action scenes give it the illusion of originality. The stunts on the outside of the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai are dizzying, and there's a splendidly choreographed fight scene in a state-of-the-art electronic car park. Fights, car-chases, a nail-biting climax: with all this - and Tom Cruise's dazzling smile - what's not to like? The lad seems to be enjoying himself hugely, and so did I!<br/><br/>The last 007 enterprise, QUANTUM OF SOLACE was woeful. GHOST PROTOCOL seriously raises the bar on this kind of movie.

","An enjoyable ride? Certainly. But MI4 has lost a bit of edge that was already eroding in MI3. The franchise has pumped everything up again so that the set pieces require not just suspension of disbelief but downright expulsion. The action crosses the line and plants a foot firmly in cartoonville.<br/><br/>It reminds me of the Bond franchise in the Roger Moore years. The stunts became more ludicrous, the flippant one-liners more corny, and any tension that might have been there evaporated as a result.<br/><br/>Recently Bond has rebooted with more realism and more tension and still manages a couple of funny moments. <br/><br/>MI will lose its way if it goes any further down its current path."
"secondtake","6","3","9","26 December 2011"," Should you choose to read this review, heads up that it's no slam dunk
","Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol (2011)<br/><br/>There's no question this is a well edited, dynamically filmed movie. And the personalities are important--the characters, and the actors, too, for fans (for example) of Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>It's a great ride, a great thrill ride, but I don't think it's a great movie by any measure--unless relentless chasing and twisting from the enemy is the goal. The special effects are good--some of the scenes with Cruise climbing the tallest building in the world with some magic sticky gloves are flawless--and the normal scenes in gritty places ground these and give it all context.<br/><br/>The plot, for what it's worth, is sort of predictable, over the top stuff--the bad guy (and girl) is going to blow up the world, more or less, unless the good guys (and girls) can stop it in time. And in good classic fashion, the clock is clicking from the get go--something like 36 hours to doomsday.<br/><br/>What does the movie lack? Well, originality is one. That's not something to brush off--a movie like Iron Man or even (going back in time here) Raiders of the Lost Ark have an element of the fantastic that makes them unique. Among the supposedly grounded movies that still play games with reality, like the recent James Bond or Jason Bourne films, you still feel like ""Mission Impossible"" is stuck in some kind of re-tread rut. <br/><br/>The other drawback is characters. Alright, they are buddies, and they have a camaraderie that's great, and some good come-backs. Nothing is terrible. Still, the good guys are formulaic types--the one thing that keeps you interested in them, as characters, is the one addition who is unknown and a wild card. The bad guys are pretty boring, unfortunately, and this might be the killer problem overall. The bad guy has to be someone you really hate, someone you think is distinctive in their evilness, someone that makes you perk up and watch. Think of the evil-doers in ""Die Hard"" or ""Spider Man"" or ""Batman"" (take your pick). <br/><br/>Director Brad Bird pulled off some kind of magical coup with ""The Incredibles"" and you can actually feel the lingering effects here--the great small talk as the world is going to pieces, the believable normal people facing huge odds. And that's good. Tom Cruise is up to his usual form, or actually he's more buff than ever, but he acts in the usual way, which I find a little plain but it isn't bad. See the first, second, or third version of this series (yes, this is the fourth with Cruise), or see ""Minority Report"" from the same era, and you'll know what I mean.<br/><br/>Anyway, I enjoyed the movie, saw it on the big screen with good sound, and was taken in by the wow of it all.

","I thought this was MI 3 (laugh). At the end of the movie, I said to my girlfriend ""get ready for MI 4"". I'm happy she didn't catch that. Could Tom Cruise fail us? I don't think so. From the beginning of the movie the action was right on point. Keep in mind this movie is over 2 hours, I wanted more when the movie ended. What really got me about some of these stunts, was that Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) never got hurt. Whoa! Please make the super hero human. The title ""Ghost protocol"" - isn't he always chasing a phantom? The plot was magnetized, until we knew why he was chasing the Ghost. What's great about this MI is that you don't have to see the other sequels in order to understand MI4. Great movie for couples."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","3","9","18 December 2011"," Fine, if you're able to take it as a sort of silly James Bond flick.
","The way I have always looked at it; the Mission: Impossible movie-series is the American answer to the popular James Bond franchise. That means that it's also featuring plenty of gadgets, exotic or far off locations and a typical spy-thriller plot but only all done bigger, though not necessarily better as well.<br/><br/>You can't exactly call the series the most consistent. Every movie so far has been quite different in style and tone. I thought that this movie did a pretty good job at combining all of the best elements out of the first three movies, into this one. It has the sort of spy and thriller elements of the first movie, the action of the second one and the more realistic approach of the third movie.<br/><br/>Then why isn't it the best movie out of the series you might wonder. Because it's still suffering from the same problems as the previous two movies did; It has a far too simplistic story in it. Yes, I wasn't that big on ""Mission: Impossible III"", while the rest of the world seemed to absolutely love it at the time and lots of people called it one of the best action movies ever made. But as things turned out later, more and more people start to see and realize ""Mission: Impossible III"" wasn't all that perfect at all and most already seem to have already forgotten about that movie now days. Why is that relevant for this movie? Because I think ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" will suffer the same fate. People are praising it and all loving it now because it's all good and spectacular looking on the big screen but I just don't think this is a movie that remains fun and good to watch, over and over again, or in couple of years from now, when multiple other similar genre movies will have been made. The movie, as it is, just doesn't have enough to offer for that.<br/><br/>I said that the story was simple but what I perhaps meant more was that it was totally secondary for the movie, it seemed. The story itself was actually quite hard to follow because you simply often have no idea what is going and the movie forces you to take a lot of things for granted. You'll just have to accept Ethan has to climb up a building, they have to disguise themselves at times and people HAVE to jump down an air vent to get the job done. Why was this all needed for the movie? No reason, other than making this a spectacular movie to watch.<br/><br/>And yes, this is simply a good and spectacular movie to watch. Director Brad Bird obviously has a talent for action, big and small. Yes, the movie is featuring plenty of explosions and other CGI action sequences but it's being just as great and spectacular with its little moments, such as all of its hand to hand combats. In that regard this simply is a great popcorn flick and a movie to enjoy.<br/><br/>What could had definitely improved the movie was a better villain. Seriously, there hardly is any focus on any villain at all. After having seen this movie, I still have no idea who was supposed to be the main villain. A good, more visible and present villain would had possibly improved the story as well but it appears that the movie deliberately tried to put all of its emphasis on Ethan Hunt and his team members. And they do have some good chemistry together and are all a joy to watch in their own way. Lets hope that will all be back for more Mission: Impossible movies. Fore if there is one thing that this movie made apparent, it is that there is still plenty of potential- and a bright future for the series, with Tom Cruise, Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg and Paula Patton all involved.<br/><br/>It appears to me that you can really enjoy this movie for what it is, when you choose to do so but when you look more beneath its surface, it's a far from perfect movie.<br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is the forth film in the franchise and sees Tom Cruise(War Of The Worlds) reprising the leading role of the globe-trotting super spy Ethan Hunt. Throughout the series Hunt has evolved from team player to lone wolf and now in Ghost Protocol he must become a true leader of a team that, for the first time, he didn't choose.<br/><br/>The film blasts off into overdrive from the minute the gates open and rarely lets up, it's one hell of a ride and there's enough action and gadgets here to please any fan of the spy film genre. The plot is fairly straightforward; the bad guy obtains the key to the ultimate weapon and plans to destroy the world with it. Hunt and his team, working without the support of the IMF, must stop him at all costs. It has enough twists and turns to keep you engaged but it never gets so complicated that you risk getting lost while you're immersed in the mind- blowing stunt sequences. One thing fans of the series will probably notice this time around is that Hunt is more 'human' when it comes to the action than he has been in most of the previous outings. Not everything goes to plan and if he gets hit or falls down it hurts. Sure he's still a super spy and can do things most mortal men would never try in a million years but the added vulnerability and consequences of those actions gone wrong lifts the film to a new level.<br/><br/>but in Mission:Impossible-Ghost Protocol that level of personal rivalry between protagonist and antagonist was a bit lacking. It's not that Michael Nyqvist (Abuduction) didn't deliver a good performance in the few scenes where he interacts with Hunt, it's just that there are so few of these moments that he is, in many ways, almost like another one of his own henchmen and I mistook him for other characters on a few occasions.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg (Hot Fuzz) reprises his role as Benji Dunn from MI3, the computer whiz behind all the action. Dunn has now graduated from a 'behind the desk cameo' to a fully qualified field officer and as a result gets a much beefier role in this mission becoming one of Hunt's rogue team. Pegg's natural comedic timing and likable charm adds a much-needed element of lightheartedness to the franchise that could have easily backfired had this role been miscast.<br/><br/>Rounding out the new team are IMF agents Paula Patton(Precious) as Jane Carter and Oscar Nominee Jeremy Renner(The Town) as William Brandt, and both actors deliver solid performances. Carter is as sexy as she is deadly and Patton slips between these two persona's with ease while Brandt hides a secret past allowing Renner to show a vulnerability we're not used to seeing in the roles he normally plays.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol delivers exactly the type of entertainment action fans crave and as a result it is perfect popcorn movie. If you don't enjoy this ride then entertaining you is a mission: impossible. Amazing music by Michael Giacchino (Lost), Costume Design By Michael Kaplan(Fight Club) and Direction By Brad Bird(The Incredibles)The Best The Mission Impossible of all time I doubt MI:5 Can Top it. 9/10"

","It didn't have a strong story line for MI, and it was let down severely by bad casting choices. It could have been a much better MI movie with different actors. <br/><br/>Simon Pegg was the exception, while he wasn't one of my favourite actors, he did a great job with a bad script. I left with a positive impression of Simon Pegg, and it definitely makes me want to see more of him. <br/><br/>Unfortunately I was disappointed with MI-GP as I really enjoyed MI 3. I didn't warm to the characters and in the end, I felt like I should have chosen a different movie."

","Fourth installment in the series, this time following Cruise and his spy-team—joined by Patton and Renner, and rejoined by Pegg—trying to clear the IMF after a framed-bombing while at the same time trying to stop dangerous terrorist Nyqvist from striking the United States with missiles from Russian nuclear launch codes he gained access to. Yes just like any MI film, the plot is a little too complicated for its own good. Still, the entertainment is there and non-stop, perfectly building itself up and never becoming dull. This sequel has the most returning cast members, the majority of which are cameos (Rhames, Monaghan and, perhaps the most rewarding subtle nod, Wisniewski, who forces Cruise's character to wear a bag over his head yet again). The Burj Khalifa sequence alone makes the movie worth while—likely the best action sequence of 2011, and possibly one of the best action sequences involving skyscrapers of all-time. The following dust storm sequence is the cherry-on-top. Nyqvist is an excellent villain, and both Patton and Seydoux are more stunning than Bond-girls.<br/><br/>***½ (out of four)"
"tieman64","Null","2","5","25 September 2013"," World's shortest man climbs world's tallest building
","Directed by Brad Bird, ""Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol"" stars Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, a pint-sized secret agent who struggles to stop a nuclear detonation. Unlike previous films in the franchise, Bird plays things for laughs, his film opening with a funny sequence in which Cruise breaks out of a Serbian prison to the tune of Dean Martin's ""Ain't That a Kick In The Head"". Moments later, Cruise is infiltrating the Kremlin using a funny holo-projector and a GIANT MOUSTACHE. Why? Why the hell not.<br/><br/>Incredulously, Cruise is then blamed for blowing up the Kremlin. This, naturally, leads to Cruise journeying to Dubai. Here he climbs the Burj Khalifa (the world's tallest building) and is menaced by both a GIANT SANDSTORM and a MISCHIEVOUS GLOVE. After much commotion, Cruise journeys to India, where he infiltrates a hotel using MAGNETS. Afterwards, he fights the film's chief villain within a futuristic car park comprised of....moving platforms? Yes. Moving platforms.<br/><br/>Brad Bird's directed a number of animated films for Pixar Studios, all of which have traces of screwball. His ""Ghost Protocol"" is itself part action movie, part screwball comedy, the film filled with gadgets which comically break down, action sequences which resemble vaudeville routines, and funny jabs at both Cruise's age (he's 50), and the absurd situations Cruise's character is called upon to resolve.<br/><br/>Aesthetically, ""Protocol"" resembles Bird's animation work. The film is slick, well lit, classically shot and framed. And unlike most modern action movies (Nolan, Abrams etc), Bird's tone is playful, his action sequences make spatial sense, are immaculately composed, and his shots tend to flow with a certain classy style resemblant of a Hitchcock, De Palma or Spielberg. The film's tongue-in-cheek tone, combined with its formalism, itself resembles a number of Hitchcock pictures, most notably ""To Catch A Thief"" and ""North by Northwest"". On the downside, the hyper-control afforded by CGI means that Bird's live action work here can't quite match the aesthetic highs and kinetic rushes of his animated features.<br/><br/>Thematically, ""Ghost Protocol"" is fairly anonymous, though the film's nuclear plot strongly recalls the atomic paranoia of Bird's ""Iron Giant"" (Bird's films all take place within a retro fantasy land). Its climax, featuring moving platforms, also resembles a number of Bird's Pixar action sequences. It's the film's Burj Khalifa sequence, however, which really elevates things. As handsomely directed as De Palma's CIA heist in ""Mission Impossible 1"", Bird's Burj Khalifa sequence carefully juggles suspense, comedy and clean lines. Remarkably, the scene was shot on location, without stunt doubles and with Cruise really scaling the sides of the Burj Khalifa. Whilst De Palma tops his CIA heist with an audacious EuroTunnel sequence, however, Bird's film struggles to climax. ""Ghost Protacal"" co-stars Simon Pegg and Paul Patton as a token biracial.<br/><br/>8.5/10 – One of the better action movies in recent years. See ""The Next Three Days"". Worth multiple viewings."
"safeerexus","4","2","5","22 June 2013"," Anti-climax finale
","A Mission Impossible movie creates a lot of 'explosive' expectation from movie buffs & 'Ghost Protocol' doesn't disappoint in that respect. Tom Cruise reminds us of Christian Bale but without the superhero costume, with all his high-flying antics. The cliff hanger sequences in the Kremlin & tallest building are heart stopping (BTW the massive dust storms shown in the movie don't really occur in Dubai). The movie was superb until the point where the plot moves to India. The entire movie surprisingly loses direction from here on. Firstly I suspect many of the India 'scenes' were actually filmed in China or Japan as many cars shown like the BMW 1-series aren't available in India. Also the actor playing the 'Indian Rich Guy' deserves a Razzie award for worst actor! Quite pathetic actually. If you're put off by movies that take you to a high & then simply bring you crashing down in disappointment,don't bother watching this. On the other hand if you'd like to experience what a heart attack feels like, watch the Dubai sequence. The second MI movie is still the best IMO. Thanks for reading!"

","As the franchise has previously portrayed, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) embarks on a fanatical trail around the world in an attempt to salvage the planet from war intent or total terrorism. Although producer Cruise has succeeded upon his previous effort with Cameron Diaz, one cannot help to think that the Top Gun Maverick is running out of formidable roles to play. Playing it safe despite performing his own original stunts. Ghost Protocol achieves spectacular visualisation but the narrative suffers at a dispense of this. Although MI4 glamorises the beautiful nature of Budapest, Moscow, Mumbai and the heavyweight Burj Dubai, in correspondence to the efforts of the previous two outings for Ethan Hunt this 'mission' achieves supplementary recognition. Impressive gadgetry and high flying action sequences do relieve Bird's first non-animation outing of total embarrassment as it achieves an average viewing.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg's position as the technology nerd degrades the roles played by Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton, for who have bright career prospects, suggesting that Pegg doesn't fit the bill of being a recruit of the government within the secret service field. His performance consists of dry humour, possessing an overrated tone that distinguishes all motive of seriousness despite the film's cheesy overtones.<br/><br/>MI4 implements regular inductions of the twisting and turning techniques, keeping you engaged within the plot, diverting itself away from any potential deviances that may complicate the narrative whilst you're completely indulged by the re occurrence of Tom Cruise leaping from brick to brick. In comparison to Ethan Hunt's counterpart, Mr Bond, Hunt possesses a vulnerable tone which elevates the film to a new level. His team also band together their feelings; in particular William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) of who possesses a dark secret that has been bullish on his personally but ironically connects him to the central character. Hunt's nemesis Hendricks delivers an adequate act in contrast to Philip Seymour Hoffman's threat in MI3, perhaps of no fault of his own as the camera scarcely captures Michael Nyqvist characteristics as the rival protagonist.<br/><br/>Overall, despite MI4's triumphant first few weeks since its release, Tom Cruise's new blockbuster lacks multiple components to be remembered as one of the greatest foundations of the Spy-hero genre. Although Bird's effort possesses and encapsulates the characteristics of the genre and employs a relatively reliable cast, it somehow reminds us of one of those releases when placed onto the market on DVD format it perches itself on the shelf with moviegoers having difficulty contemplating whether or not it is an essential buy to add to their ultimate film collection."

","The 4th installment of the Mission Impossible franchise is a thrilling ride from the opening scene, and unlike its predecessors its story line doesn't out think itself and topple over. Although many of the action sequences could only happen in the world of Hollywood make believe, it actually felt more plausible compared to the other moronic blockbusters such as the Fast & Furious flicks or Michael Bay's Transformers crap-o-rama. I'm not sure if that is necessarily a good thing, but at least I didn't walk out of the theater feeling dumber for watching it.<br/><br/>Cruise vaults himself back into the role of action film king after his recent duds Valkyrie and the snooze fest Knight and Day. Jeremy Renner follows up his Academy Award nominated performances in The Hurt Locker & The Town with a strong performance and continues his rise to the top. Paula Patton in the exact opposite role from her performance as a teacher with a heart of gold in Precious is a steamy, kick ass bombshell, and Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead & Hot Fuzz) delivers his usual dry wit laughs without taking it over the top.<br/><br/>I wouldn't place MI:4 at the top of my greatest movies list for the year, but it does exactly what is sets out to do.

","So I watched Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. I have to say, it was insane fun; however, by the end, it all felt familiar. Although they did through in some original scenes, the plot followed the mold of all the other spy movies from the last 20 years. It didn't feel special or unique. <br/><br/>The acting was mediocre, not exactly bad, but not praiseworthy, with Tom Cruise still sporting that obnoxious expression that he has plastered on his face in nearly every one of his movies. <br/><br/>The action scenes were well done, but nevertheless didn't bring anything new to the table in the way of cinematography. These scenes provided good thrills; however the lackluster climax was unbalanced compared to the preposterously high-octane middle section.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, whose theme song is one of the most recognizable in cinema, unfortunately was quite forgettable.<br/><br/>Overall, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol was a fun ride, but it didn't take any risks; it fell into the forgettable action movie rut. And trust me people, that is where action movies go to die. This movie did do some things right, providing some very original scenes, like Tom Cruise hanging off the tallest building in the world, or the car chase scene in a dust storm. However, it bungled up the most important part of any movie-the ending. For that, I think this movie will be forgotten, to be replaced by the next action movie that comes along with bigger explosions, and crazier CGI.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol was a new engine on an old car. It tons of fun in it, but it's still, just an ordinary, old car that will, in a few years end up in a junkyard."

It's not a film I will ever watch again unless stuck on a plane.<br/><br/>The acting is perfect for the genre, the direction and effects very good. However, there is nothing that inspires and allows the imagination to work. I can only assume Simon Pegg was cast to provide light relief but his character, whilst well played, is out of place and belongs in a Johnny English film.<br/><br/>If you really want to buy it, wait a couple of years as it will be heavily discounted in the supermarkets.

"blackmamba99971","10","2","5","4 April 2012"," Another great addition
","Tom Cruise produced along with JJ Abrams for this fourth instalment to wow us again. This time, Ethan Hunt is found in a prison in Budapest by a new IMF team where by breaking him out is a necessity. It was all part of his covert operation to dig out a man simply known as Cobalt. A man who is trying to purchase codes for a nuclear set of warheads in order for a first strike to be made against the US. In Ethan's everyday job, he finds the means to look in the archives of the Kremlin for the codes, but finds they are missing, or at least placed in another location. When he finds it is a set up, he aborts, only to look back as the Kremlin is blown to pieces. Now on the run again, the secretary of defence helps Ethan reach his goal by allowing him to secretly find out who is behind this plot. With his team in place, he begins his trek to find Cobalt. I love this film. With grandiose abilities of high tech gadgets, weapons, cars, locations, music. All of which sends this film over the top to give long time fans a much needed boost for action. I do like the new team member (William Brant) (Jeremy Renner) who by chance is hand picked by Ethan during an earlier mission in Croatia to over see the safety of his wife. But in that mission, William believes the sudden death of Ethan's wife was his fault. Low and behold, later told that she is fine and healthy at the end of the film. His character was by far a much finer addition to the team. But Simon Peg being the tech brains of the bunch adds that extra funny bit which gives the audience a more comfortable feel. Like the series often gave us. Tom Cruise has done a wonderful job in delivering with Abrams a better punch to the genre. And to know that Brad Bird who is the creator of The Incredibles was also involved to make this film a reality. Hats off to the cast, crew, and those missions we love so much. Brilliant movie, highly recommended."

","If you need a good movie to see for the holidays, look no further - Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol is for you! Tom Cruise returns from the demolished train-wreck that was the third installment in the MI Series with a vengeance not seen in quite some time.<br/><br/>This installment in the series is just as down to earth as the rest of them, which means to say that the most plausible thing is the impossible. The plot is pretty strait forward from the get go: After a botched mission results in the Kremlin being bombed and the IMF blamed, the President invokes ""Ghost Protocol"" aka the entire IMF is disavowed and fired. This unfortunately leaves a soviet madman with the capability to incite global nuclear warfare and so Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) must lead another motley crew to save the day.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie you will notice that the entire cast really enjoyed their time making it, the acting is great, none of the lines have that cliché ring to them, the music is perfect and the special effects are top notch while still believable. There is a good combination of serious moments and urgency, the plot is explained without giving too much away and without ever making you want to check your watch, and they even managed to mix in the humor effectively; instead of cheesy overused jokes Tom Cruise simply smashes his face into some inanimate objects four different times (Possibly referencing that its the fourth movie?). The action scenes are well performed and every character that appears has depth and you can't help but actually care about their plights.<br/><br/>All in all, the cast and crew successfully revived an old gem in a desperately stagnant age of cinema, bringing us a fun thrill ride for the whole family and proving that whoever said ""when you take any old classic and make a sequel or remake of it, its going to suck balls"" was wrong - it can indeed turn out a grand success.<br/><br/>Let it be known, when I hit the enter button I shouted ""Mission Accomplished""!"

Somehow, most of the turn out to be complete garbage, like:<br/><br/>The Avengers Get Smart Transformers 2 Beverly Hillbillies Yogi Bear The Smurfs Doug The Last Airbender (shudders)<br/><br/>But, that's not to say there have been a few decent ones, like:<br/><br/>Ninja Turtles 1,2, & 4 The Adams Family Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Batman Beyond: The Return of the Joker The A-Team G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra Transformers 3 Transformers: The Movie Most of the Muppet movies<br/><br/>Many have had hit and misses over the past thirty years now, but today we're going to be talking about the film series, based on the TV show, Mission Impossible.<br/><br/>Now, bear in mind, I haven't actually seen ONE episode of the TV show, so all I can really do is look at the films as films along. I might as well give my synopsis on the other films first then. The first film, directed by Scarface director, Brian de Palma, is about IMF agent, Ethan Hunt, played by Tom Cruise, framed for the murders of his comrades and selling government secrets to the villain of the film. Now it's up to Cruise to get the files back and clear his name. For what it was, it was a cheesy action film, with Cruise doing what he does best. For what it was, it was pretty good, thanks to Ving Rhames delivering a pretty good performance. The second film, directed by John Woo, was not as good as the first, but somehow did a very creative job at bringing forth an okay film. Cruise was still Cruise, Rhames was still bad-ass, and Anthony Hopkins in the film was nice in it too. Now the third film, directed by Super 8 director and creator of Lost, J.J. Abrams, managed to make it the superior film. The plot of it, was Ethan was getting married and about to retire as an IMF agent leader, but when his team tries to get rid of an object dubbed 'The Rabbit Foot', he and his team have to fix things up, with his marriage on hold, and him returning. Simon Pegg was a nice addition to the film, and gave a well done performance. For a while, it was a good finish to the franchise, and for what it was, we would remember this trilogy to be cheesy...That is, until today, when Iron Giant and Incredibles director, Brad Bird decided to bring forth another film.<br/><br/>So how does the new film stand out?...well, I gotta say...I now understand WHY it's got a 95% on Rotten Tomatoes.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol takes place five years after the last film, as Ethan Hunt is broken out of jail, and learns from his team that someone is planning on starting a nuclear war with Russia and America. Soon, the IMF is down to Hunt and his team, along with William Brandt, to finish off this mission and clear the IMF's name. For being his first live-action film, Brad Bird managed to make this Mission Impossible film, not only good, but fantastic! I enjoyed a LOT out of this film, from beginning to end, and it really stands out as the best of the Mission Impossible film series. This is definitely one of the best action film that I've seen this year, and it stands out as one of Tom Cruise's best work. The acting is great, the action's great, and the story is, surprisingly, well done. But, apparently, it does have it's cheesy moments, that even Ving Rhames finds to be stupid.<br/><br/>Overall, MI4GP is great, might have it's moments of stupidity, but I found it great. If you're looking for a good action film or a good Brad Bird film, I highly recommend it, but if you don't like Tom Cruise or the Mission Impossible films, then you probably won't like it."

America and Russia are on the brink of war and when the director the IMF (Tom Wilkinson) is killed, Ethan and his team, Julie (Paula Patton), Benji (Simon Pegg) and Brandt (Jeremy Renner) have to go rouge to stop Hendricks.<br/><br/>Ghost Protocol is certainly a fun, action film with great car chases (the BMW i8 was absolutely glorious), fight scenes and stunts like the climbing of Burj Khalifa, where you really got to feel the height and the wind (which is scary to because I have a fear of heights). This is a film that uses it international setting even, using related music, for whether it was in Russia, the Middle East and India. The locations made scene to the context of the film, countries that are important or emerging on the national scene. Brad Bird made the leap from animation with good moment of success, delivering a fast paced film with a lot of humour and great action. The only real problem was the CGI was actually pretty poor and looked cheap: even more surprising because of his great work at Pixar. Lets hope Bird's next film is his long awaited film about the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake.<br/><br/>Whilst Cruise leads this film, a strength of Ghost Protocol is that the rest of the team play more of a role and this film is not the Tom Cruise show. This will help the series distinguish itself from Bond and Bourne. They are all got there own skills and show themselves to be more capable as fighters and agents. They are smart and resource and Bird does get a very interesting cast. Cruise who is a competent action star, showing he can fight, do stunts and is willing to get hurt, which makes Ethan more fallible and you could actually route for him more. You felt the pain. Renner is an emerging actor, getting the big roles he should have gotten 10 years ago. He is more convincing when he is able to be a hard action man then the seemingly weak, nervous character thrown in over his head. Simon Pegg is given a bigger role and his character was the comic relief with good jokes and interaction but he is not a fool, he is competent and can at least handle himself, even if he is the weakest fighter. But the rest of the cast is made up from more independent film stars, Paula Patton (Precious), Michael Nyqvist (the Millennium Trilogy), Lea Seydoux (Inglorious Basterds), Anil Kapoor (Slumdog Millionaire) and they were all very strong. Patton was great as the female member of the team, hard, resourceful but also has some demons and it was great fist fight she has with Seydoux (who has a small but fun part). Nyqvist is as a good a villain Phillip Seymour Hoffman but that is because is such a great actor and Nyqvist was made out to be a mad man with a crack pot idea. But he is physically tougher and could actually handle himself in a fight. But he is not as menacing or had great moments like Hoffman had.<br/><br/>Whilst Pegg did provide good comedy I think Ghost Protocol did over use it. I hope that the fifth film can takes a darker turns and be more serious, showing innocent people getting hurt or agents that we know getting killed. Also the plot itself possibly would have fitted more if it was set during the Cold War or was able China and America heading towards war (but it would have also been more like Tomorrow Never Dies and X-Men: First Class). Plus the team do over use advance technology throughout the mission, particularly because the team was meant to have no support from outside. It would have shown the stakes were even higher if they did not have the resources they normally have. And the product placement did go a little overboard, particularly the use of Apple products.<br/><br/>Overall I think M:I III is a better film overall, Ghost Protocol is a enjoyable film, filled with entertaining set pieces and at least shows some consistence for the series, acknowledging events from the previous film and kept a similar tone, world and feel. It also shows that IMF stays on as a similar intelligence body."

","Going into this movie, I expected a good 2 hours of entertainment and initially, wasn't disappointed. But as it progressed, the quality started to deteriorate. <br/><br/>The story is interesting enough. Ethan Hunt, after breaking out of a Russian prison, is sent on a mission to retrieve vital information about a Russian terrorist from a Kremlin. Things go wrong and the entire IMF is shut down. Now, on the run and lacking the resources they once took for granted, the team has to stop a plot to kick-start a nuclear war. In short, your typical action movie. <br/><br/>Now, sad as this sounds,""Salt"" and ""A-Team"", both movies released in 2010, and operating on a similar basic premise, put this one to shame. There is awesome CGI like the Kremlin's destruction and the sandstorm in Dubai and some cool chases and a few interesting stunts(Tom Cruise climbing the Burj) but there is not even a small amount of tension. The IMF team operating in the dark without resources yet we feel no real desperation or urgency even if the one-liners are good. The climax in India, the one thing that could have saved this movie, is far less life-threatening than even the first 2 films in the series. The movie also does not pause to give itself rest and the scenes don't blend as seamlessly as they could have. <br/><br/>In essence, while this movie might be praised as the best in the mission impossible series, I found it to be a very ordinary movie pretending to be something more, it's many negative qualities cleverly disguised by witty one-liners and impressive CGI. Yet it could have been so much more as it starts off well.<br/><br/>My Rating-5/10"

The action scenes and special effects were thrilling. We loved the stunts!

This time the movie was what a MI movie is all about: good story, suspense, fun, special effects, secrets revealed, nothing over the top. Everything was perfect. I was on the edge of the chair since the beginning. A couple of time I jumped on it. That's what I was expecting from the latest MI movie. Tom Cruise, brilliant and in good shape! Simon Pegg, hilarious at the right time. Loved Jeremy Renner. Hope this is not the last. Actors seemed not to have used too many stuntman which made even more interesting."

Following all of these virtues faithfully can lead us to only one conclusion. And that is, there is not ,uch resemblance to the old series.<br/><br/>OH SURE, THE basic premise is there. The story revolves around a super secret group of covert operatives who work for some yet to be determined Department of the Federal Government. The recorded instructions always finish up with something like, ""......as usual, should you decide to accept this assignment and you or any of your operatives are discovered, ""the Secretary"" will disavow any knowledge of your activities.

Once we have divorced all of the old feelings, we can measure this, or any other film, on its own merit.<br/><br/>AS FOR ITS star and executive producer, Mr. Tom Cruise, we find his performance amidst all of this outrageous action, exploding vehicles, devious plot twists and super-energized stunts to be most competent, appropriate to this genre and even believable. (We recall that this is the same guy who worked so well dramatically with Dustin Hoffman in RAINMAN.<br/><br/>UNFORTUNATELY, WE HADN'T seen the previous MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE outing at the time of this writing. Stubbornly, we refused to believe that there was anything of interest for us (ME!) in it.<br/><br/>OBVIOUSLY """"WE"" WERE wrong! We apologize, Mr. Cruise and I'm sorry!"
"padiyark","7","2","5","29 December 2011"," Better than MI2, on par with MI1
","OK, a few things before the review: a) I hated MI2--the MI series went from team mentality to Tom Cruise as James Bond outing; b) enjoyed MI1 for its team ops, but ended becoming a little too much of a Tom Cruise vehicle; c) skipped MI3 as this was during Tom Cruise's Scientology head-trips; d) was convinced by my friends to watch MI4 after someone bought my ticket.<br/><br/>MI4 is definitely better than what I expected for the Tom Cruise MI flicks. Yes, it still is a Tom Cruise love fest, but definitely much more team dynamics than I expected. If there was a real star here, it would be Jeremy Renner as Brandt, the IMF analyst with a past; he is tough, but brings humanity to the character he plays. Also, glad to see that Paula Patton was great as Jane, another IMF agent, without being the romantic object of Ethan Hunt--plus, it's great to see a female hang as tough as the other IMF agents. Simon Pegg does bring in the comic relief, but sometimes could be a little annoying. While I like Michael Nyqvist from his role in the ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" series, his role here could have easily been played by another actor (Stellan Skaargard comes to mind). That being said, action got to the point that it got a little too overwhelming at times. The Burj Khalifa scene, while fun to watch, had so many twists and turns (as well as big holes--who (guest included) wouldn't notice a guy going up all these windows or glass falling from it)) it became humorous. The race scene in Mumbai was a laugh--if you've been in Mumbai, you know that traffic is so anarchic, any vehicle in a chase would end up in a crash. At least it got realistic when there was a big pedestrian crossing.<br/><br/>In the end, for me, this was a better MI than I expected, but still the emphasis is on making Tom Cruise look great. As my wife, who is from India said: Tom Cruise is the ""Govinda"" of American films. For the uninitiated to Bollywood, Govinda is an popular Indian actor-dancer who will find himself in the most unlikely and impossible of action scenarios, but will always pull it off with a smirk of his pearly whites."
"chaz-28","7","2","5","29 December 2011"," A creative script & stunning acrobatic stunts produce a worthy addition to the Mission: Impossible franchise
","It is rare in the Mission: Impossible franchise for Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) to be assigned an agency tasked mission and enjoy support both from his home office and regular team members who he has worked with in the past. In fact, this has only happened once, in Mission: Impossible II. In the other three films, including the latest, Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol, Ethan and/or the entire IMF are accused of disloyalty, treason, and rogue operations while try attempt to thwart global villains. Taking down the bad guy is always much harder while being pursued by your own government. In the first and third films, Ethan was personally labeled a traitor, now, the entire IMF organization are disavowed because both the American and Russian governments are going to blame them for blowing up the Kremlin. How is that for having the backing of your boss? The man responsible for blowing up the Kremlin and framing the IMF is also the franchise's most far-reaching, intellectual, and dangerous villain yet – a sort of nuclear philosopher who believes that only global nuclear annihilation will evolve the human race. Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) appears just as capable as Ethan Hunt at pulling off intricately detailed capers, breaking into impossible to break in buildings, and being especially useful in lightning fast car chases, fist fights, and any other form of covert espionage. He leads Ethan and his team to some extremely exotic locales including Budapest, Moscow, Dubai, and Mumbai. If there is one asset of chasing a wily villain focused on blowing up the world, he will give you a thorough tour first.<br/><br/>The hodgepodge IMF team this time around features the girl (Paula Patton), the geeky tech guy (Simon Pegg), and the unknown variable with a hidden past (Jeremy Renner). They also bring along the most cutting-edge technology which, in theory, should help them infiltrate, evade, and assert control over any situation. What makes this iteration of the franchise so fascinating is that time and time again, technology lets them down. Masks, a staple of these films, fail to come together, climbing equipment fails when it is needed the most, and even car chases in the world's most advanced automobiles are slowed down by pedestrian traffic jams. It is refreshing to see action heroes have to reset and troubleshoot technical glitches just like the regular folk do.<br/><br/>I highly recommend you spend the extra surcharge and experience Ghost Protocol in its intended IMAX setting. The large screen is the perfect fit for the outrageous stunts being performed almost every minute and the surround sound truly has an impact on the theater's audience. The Kremlin explosion and the acrobatic scenes performed in and on the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, should be appreciated with state of the art film technology. I realize after seeing it in IMAX that watching it on my home entertainment system would noticeably diminish the impact of the film's stunts and artistry.<br/><br/>I have yet to decide where Ghost Protocol ranks in relation to the other Mission: Impossible films, but it is far from the least of them. The script is detailed and well thought out, the action scenes are stunningly captivating, and the tension felt as the villain moves step by step towards his goal is real. The team sidekicks are not to the level of the first Mission: Impossible film, remember Ving Rhames and Jean Reno, and the set-up with false accusations and treasonous allegations are a plot device which is growing ever staler as they use it once again to make the spy team perspire that much more.<br/><br/>However, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is worth the time and money to experience what felt like a very pleasurable movie going experience. It is never dull, does not get too carried away with itself, and carries on a fine franchise tradition; Ethan Hunt will perform the craziest and gut-churning stunts to stop the bad guy."

"kunalkhandwala","7","2","5","23 December 2011"," Scaling dizzying heights - not so impossible
","Brian De Palma revamped the TV series from the 60s by adding complexity, conspiracy and some revolutionary action. Four years later, John Woo used skillful stunts to showcase some great action that overshadowed whatever Chimera was all about. J.J. Abrams then directed the weakest film which mostly dealt with explosions on a bridge and Tom Cruise jumping off a building. The mission of continuity has now been passed down to Brad Bird ('The Incredibles', 'Ratatouille'), who now ventures into the real world from Pixar's nest, to give us a semblance of the franchise's trait of an easily decipherable plot that basically fills the void between various action sequences. With little to offer in its characters, emotions or complexity, 'Ghost Protocol' simply provides astounding action and thrills with the Mission Force having to travel the world in pursuit of a mad scientist who seeks nuclear Armageddon. What made this mission almost impossible, was the Burj Khalifa in Dubai..... almost.<br/><br/>Following a chaotic jail-break sequence, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) reunites with Benji (Simon Pegg) and the vigilante agent Jane Carter (Paula Patton) in Moscow where they are informed of their mission to secure the launch codes to nuclear warheads from the vault in the Kremlin. Upon gaining a conniving entry into the vault room, Ethan and Benji utilize a hi- tech flexible screen that projects the background in real time and space through a camera that is constantly updated through an Ipad App. There is dead silence during the scene and you cannot help getting absorbed by this gizmo's magic. Unfortunately, the scientist Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) steps up, quickly stealing the codes and planting a bomb at the Kremlin. Ethan's team is then blamed for the explosion and the President was forced to disband the Mission Force, thus activating Ghost Protocol. Thereafter, Hunt's mission is to trace Hendricks and prevent him from activating the launch sequence that would trigger a global nuclear war. Supposedly, his team was to accomplish this without any resources, back up, plan or hide-out. However, they did manage to travel half the world in private jets and concept cars, using 22nd century gadgets and an unlimited supply of cash to book for indulgence. Speaking of which, their next phase takes us to Dubai. Before they can intercept a deal involving nuclear codes and diamonds, Ethan had to gain access to the Burj Khalifa's server room – from the outside. This sequence is by far, the best IMAX experience one can get enthralled by. As Tom Cruise gradually ascends the dizzying heights of the 130th floor of the tallest structure with his electronic sticky gloves, the authenticity depicted by Robert Elswit's cinematography is what one truly stands in awe of. There isn't a moment when you would doubt Tom Cruise scaling the building for real. The malfunction of the gloves can literally give a weak heart an unrecoverable attack while others who are already on the edge of the seat, will fall off it when he swings across the breadth of the building to make it back. As pulses race, hearts pound and tension sweats out, one feels the satisfaction of having spent the extra bucks on IMAX just to enjoy those 20 odd minutes of cinematic excellence. The ensuing sandstorm turns out to be a thrilling follow-up, before the Force heads out to Bombay to obtain vital information from Brijnath (Anil Kapoor), whose satellite will be used by Hendricks for the nuclear attack. Hotter and more ravishing than even the BMW concept i8 is Paula Patton's seductive beauty that simply floors the horny Indian businessman. The film's climactic sequence is in a custom-built parking structure where Ethan accomplishes the mission in an impossible manner. <br/><br/>Simon Pegg provides the lighter side of this action-packed adventure with his occasional one-liners while Jeremy Renner's straight faced intensity gets easily ignored. Paula Patton is a stunner and a suitable bond girl, capable of nailing the sidekick down herself. Anil Kapoor in his cameo is flamboyant and over-the-top but is enjoyable nevertheless. Michael Nyqvist's weak characterization never permits him to come in true form as it has been common with this franchise. In all 4 movies, the villains have never been evil enough for us to remember them. Watching Hendricks as an international terrorist right after Jared Harris' Moriarty, is quite a downer. Tom Cruise enjoys his stunts, the cool cars and action in his career defining role as Ethan Hunt. Cruise doesn't portray the character's burden of loss as Daniel Craig successfully did as James Bond. That makes it difficult to get attached to Ethan Hunt even though he can scale the Burj Khalifa. There is a major element of imperfection about Hunt that will never make him a true hero. He will always be lost between being a Jason Bourne and James Bond. <br/><br/>Ghost Protocol thus leaves us with a feeling of muted satisfaction that wouldn't result in any major applause. The film's true achievement is going to be the audience reaction during the Dubai sequence but apart from that, the lack of an intriguing plot, insipid narrative between action sequences and a predictable climax sum up director Brad Bird's shortfalls for an otherwise enjoyable action thriller. <br/><br/><ul><li>8.04 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"

","Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is a whiz-bang, breezy fourth installment to a storied franchise that has never been quite as good as James Bond, but has always managed to deliver entertainment, and this fourth installment does just that, but little else.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt, whose IMF team is now having to do the true impossible, when they are believed to be behind a bombing at the Kremlin in Russia. The biggest difference from the other three films in the franchise is that director Brad Bird treated Hunt and his team, just as that, a team, working together to prove their innocence. From Simon Pegg to Paula Patton to Jeremy Renner, Bird made sure that Cruise would not be stealing the spotlight from the rest of his team (even if he is still given the best action bits).<br/><br/>There are plenty of laughs throughout the story, and the plot unfurls at a nice click, constantly keeping the viewer on their toes. However, there is not much emotional depth to the movie, with a subplot involving Ethan and his wife only hinted at in a handful of scenes until the end, and when we are supposed to have an emotional payoff, I was left cold. But seriously, this is Mission Impossible, not Shakespeare, you watch it for the impossible action and adventure, right? So what if the villain is an underdeveloped psychopath who only gets like two lines of dialogue (and I am not joking, we see his face and are told he's evil, but we never see or hear him do anything evil). When you get right down to it, the action is well directed, Pegg is on top form here, Michael Giacchino reworks Lalo Schifrin's theme into a score that is clearly his own whilst paying homage, and Cruise still proves that he isn't too old to hang off the tallest building in the world. If these things do not allow one to switch off their brain for two hours of simple fun, then you shouldn't accept this mission.<br/><br/>I give Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol an 8 out of 10!"

","MI-4 is a very intense action movie that is quite unique in the action genre. The MI-style of infiltrating, being undercover and performing mission-based activities has been brought to a higher level. This is also applied in a more constant way during the movie. These MI-stylish activities are more genius, fun, exciting and spectacular than ever.<br/><br/>You won't lose sight of the storyline, like in some more complicated action-movies. After a while, you will still know what is happening but it's not too simple either. There is a feeling of realism in this movie. You can get easily get drawn into the experience as it is not even near 'overdone'. <br/><br/>I thought of MI-1 and MI-2 as amazingly good movies. I cannot compare those to MI-4 because it's just too different. Eventually, i would still prefer MI-1 and MI-2. MI-4 however, is definitely way and way better than MI-3. MI-3 was simply a terrible flop in comparison to MI-4. Everything that MI-3 tried to accomplish was very successful in MI-4.<br/><br/>I would suggest that you watch this movie as soon as possible."

Paula does a great job as a fellow agent who seeks out revenge in working with Cruise.

"Keberon19","8","2","5","22 December 2011"," Definitely recommended
","Just saw it tonight. If you're looking for a movie with a lot of action, this is definitely the movie for you. The acting is good, the plot is a little cliché (pending nuclear war between the United States and Russia over a misunderstanding), but it's portrayed in a fashionable, exciting manner, so I was satisfied. Very visually pleasing as well.<br/><br/>I was also impressed to hear that Tom Cruise did many of his own stunts (including hanging from the side of the world's tallest building). Regardless of your personal opinion of the actor's beliefs, you cannot deny the courage it must take to be able to pull that off.<br/><br/>There are a couple of improbable sequences in the film. The amount of times Tom Cruise can take a blow to the head and still retain consciousness is unfathomable. I don't believe there are a lot of sandstorms around Dubai, and I'm still not sure why they had to be in India in order to launch Russian nuclear missiles. Also, the idea that you can stop a nuclear missile from detonating within a time period of about 3 seconds is stretching it a bit. If you're a bit cynical towards things like this, I would not recommend this movie. However, I would like to remind you that this movie is a work of fiction titled ""Mission Impossible"", so the idea that some of the plot-line is a bit adrift and, well, impossible shouldn't be so surprising.<br/><br/>Regardless of some of the errors pertaining to the possibility of these events ever occurring, I found it to be a very enjoyable flick. I'd recommend seeing it in IMAX: the sound quality of the movie adds to the excitement. You can literally feel the vibrations when the Kremlin was destroyed. However, if you're hesitant about spending the money, it should still be enjoyable in the regular theaters as well (considering that only a few scenes were shot using IMAX). Definitely one of the better action films I've seen in a while. 8/10"
"rkcrawf-2","7","2","5","22 December 2011"," BY far the best Mission: Impossible film
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would rank it somewhere between Casino Royale and the 2nd Bourne film. As much as I enjoyed the movie, I couldn't really rank a film of this genre higher (would kinda like Denzel getting an Oscar for Training Day). However, for it's type of movie, I'd put it close to the top. The movie is really in a different class than the other MI films (i.e., no where near as cheesy). My guess is the film makers kind of figured out that audiences are pretty smart and know what to expect. It took some of the usual crutches from the first films and broke them. The cinematography and locations were beautiful and there is so much eye candy (background, cars, Paula Patton, effects). Of course there are some plot holes and a few of the characters are shallow (it's been so long since MI3, I didn't remember where things left off), yet I actually found myself sucked in and reacting to the action...which is all I can really ask for.<br/><br/>Also, I saw it in IMAX and it was well worth it. I hope they make more."

Ethan Hunt(Cruise) is back in action with a whole new team(Renner, Pegg, Patton)and a new terrorist with a bomb. I loved the creativity of the weapons and items that were used in the movie. There was technology from the older movies and new technology in this one. There definitely was a lot of good comedy lines and phrases.

They said I was going to love and I would be more than glad to do a review on this movie. Honestly the first thought that came to my mind is; ""Simon Pegg is in the movie?"" What is he doing in a movie like this? After that it looked like a must see movie! I just want to start off saying that the gadgets and technology in this movie was off the chain! The gadgets that were displayed in this movie were by far the best I have ever seen in a movie. That invisible wall that they put up so the guy couldn't see them break into the room was simply amazing. That was my favorite one! The fight scenes were also done well! When some one got hit the sound effects was on point. You definitely turned your head on some of those hits because the sound effects were eye openers! The Action in this movie was on point too. Sandstorms, crazy stunts, crazy jumps, Tom Cruise is simply the man! When you have movies like these you often say to yourself, what can the mission be now. You have seen so many movies and so many missions in movies that it doesn't even make since by now. The overall mission was a kinda repeated, but what they had to do to stop it was different. They made the mission very good! I always look for the difference in missions with theses kinds of movies. To harp on Simon Pegg's role in the movie, he was great because of course he was the comic relief and he was funny. If your a Simon Pegg fan you are going to love him in this movie. Its a little bit of a different role for him, but he shows some versatility. Overall, I thought this was a great movie! If you haven't scene it yet, go see it! Matter of fact, go see it again so we can talk about the gadgets(smiles). It is definitely movie theater worthy and it is DVD worthy! I give this movie a 9 out of 10!"

","Ethan is back with plenty of thrills, and this time the action comes fast, with few distractions and in some pretty exotic locations, from Russia to India, with a little side trip to the tallest building in Dubai.<br/><br/>Just when you thought we couldn't have any more nuclear threats, one crazy fanatic is on way to start the last nuclear war, and it us up to our gang to stop those evil agents from launching the deadly missiles. As usual, there is not much depth to the background and characterization, but that is the not the main point. We're here so we can enjoy the technology, the gadgets, the stunt work, and there are many reasons to rejoice, as we see Cruise, Pegg, Retner, and the rest of the cast, engage in all type of risky actions to save the world. The scenes in Dubai will certainly have the audience catching their breath, as Ethan has to find his way in and out of many suites a few thousand feet above the ground.<br/><br/>It is indeed one of the most entertaining times I had at the movies this year since this film works with a genre that several directors have managed to ruin. In here, the style is simple with the camera following our heroes through some wild car chases, a desert storm, and other unbelievable settings. Overall, there is very little opportunity to rest, and your blood pressure levels will remain high throughout the film.<br/><br/>Get ready for a fun time at the movies again. Unlike the other films out there, this one shows that it's truly elementary, and keeping it simple sometimes does wonders for the magic of the movies."

","Driving on a totally flat, totally straight road in the middle of a desert with miles and miles of visibility, empty of all other traffic, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has to swerve his car violently to avoid driving in to a herd of camels walking alone the road in a neat formation that he hadn't been able to see for the past five minutes until he was literally tailgating them.<br/><br/>One can draw one of several conclusions from this: a: Ethan Hunt is registered blind. This would normally be a disadvantage for a super spy, but we live in an age of equality, so hey, who needs 20/20 vision? b: Logic doesn't exist in the Mission Impossible Universe. In MI1, they flew a helicopter into the Channel Tunnel. In MI2, Ethan Hunt kept a pair of nesting doves in both of his shoes. In MI3 something happened that involved Philip Seymour Hoffman being a douche and a McGuffin called the Rabbit's Foot that was so McGuffin that they never even made an attempt to explain it on screen. In MI4 they turned Simon Pegg into an IMF field agent. Alright, James Bond has lapses in logic too, but at least they haven't cast Simon Pegg yet. c: The MI series doesn't care about your intelligence. It just wants to take your money, wham bam, thank you mam and get rid of you, you might have a smile on your face for two minutes, but ultimately you'll be left unfulfilled, depressed and addicted to narcotics as your life slowly gurgles down the drain of the plughole of life as you return again and again to these crappy movies, hoping against hope to even get that two minute smile back, but knowing that each visit just makes you unhappier, lonelier and more abused by cinematic franchises that don't love you and only care about your wallet. While you lose your capability for social interaction and sit there, slack jawed, dribbling to yourself.<br/><br/>Go back to the sixties with Jim, Rollin, Cinnamon, Barney and Willie. Not only will it make you a better, happier, more productive person, but it will also improve your sex life, make the sun shine and boil the kettle for you when you get home from work."

"moonvine27","4","3","11","28 January 2012"," Completely overrated
","Seriously, this movie is rating 7 right now? The plot is ludicrous, the acting is not compelling, and the writing is just blah. I mean, the stunts are nice and all, special effects are all dialed out, and we get some pretty travel shots but the plot is so over the top that we found ourselves giggling in parts that were clearly intended not to be funny. I did not expect verisimilitude and was prepared for a certain amount of suspension of belief (this, after all, is a ""popcorn cruncher"" sort of movie and that's what we expected) but let's not strangle Credulity and leave it corpse to cool out in a dumpster, OK? <br/><br/>I didn't find the acting too engaging, either, much as I usually like Simon Pegg. Certainly, this sort of movie does not require the entire gamut of emotions, just A to B, to paraphrase Dorothy Parker. Even so, I would have hoped for a little more chemistry, though I suppose considering the dialogue available to the actors they did what they could."
"dekadent","5","3","11","27 December 2011"," Worst movie of entire MI franchise
","I can't say you should not watch this latest installation of MI series. In fact, if you have 2+ hours to kill, if you like beautiful set pieces, spy gadgetry and BMW product placement and if you want something that has Tom Cruise in it - this is your movie. Except that you need to remember one thing – Ghost Protocol is lacking everything that made 1st and 3rd MI movies good, and 2nd - bearable.<br/><br/>MI series have always pushed the believability envelope with outlandish spy tech, but that played only second fiddle to the moments of true tension, thrilling action sequences, and all of it was glued together with somewhat acceptable logic of the events. Mission was well defined, the enemy had the depth and the reason, and the conflict between good and evil felt real.<br/><br/>Sadly enough Ghost Protocol fails on all these counts. <br/><br/>The story is extremely bad, even dumb, I could literary come up with a better plot in 15 minutes.<br/><br/>Despite lots of action there are no intense moments here, you never feel Ethan Hunt is one step away from death or that he is under the enormous pressure of making a critical decision.<br/><br/>If there is a room with a door that good guys want to get access to, it is guaranteed they will choose the most absurd, most expensive, most pseudo-hi-tech way to do it using most ridiculous gizmo they could find. In fact the amount of unnecessary tech toys and super-duper spy stuff is so over the top here the movie looks like the parody of itself.<br/><br/>The major flaw (and the amazing one at that, since no experienced production team would ever overlook this) is that the villain's character is not developed at all, we're given almost no explanation of his actions or motives. Actually he barely speaks two words during the entire movie, which is such a mind-blowing contrast to Philipp Seymour Hoffmans's stellar portrayal of Owen Davian in MI3. <br/><br/>As always everything taking place in Russia looks retarded, which is a common Hollywood's problem, it's a mystery to me why it is so hard to avoid stupidity when showing Eastern Europe. <br/><br/>Movie locations feel more forced than ever, like Burj Dubai, that has no business being in the movie other than for the picturesque purposes.<br/><br/>The lack of logic in everything that takes place is quite impressive, I actually suspect someone at the studio had a bet regarding what level of idiocy movie audience will tolerate without starting Occupy Hollywood protests if only they infuse this moronic script with multi-million dollar budget.<br/><br/>Brad Bird was clearly a wrong choice for a MI director, considering that the only action comedy he ever made was The Incredibles, which is my favorite cartoon, but still just a cartoon, and much more of a comedy than action. In comparison, MI1 was directed by Brian De Palma, MI2 - by John Woo, and MI3 – by JJ Abrams. I have a feeling Paramount executives secretly wish for MI series to go out with a lame fizzle, and doing their best to achieve that.<br/><br/>To avoid descending into spoiler hell I will not delve into multiple WTF moments where either laziness or lack of common sense resulted in directorial decisions that poorly translated to the screen.<br/><br/>To sum it up – if you decide to go watch it – come in with low expectations, that will make Your Mission a success."
"coljam21","3","2","6","19 July 2014"," Nonsensical action flick
","This movie was filled with nothing but impossible stunts and action sequences. But I guess they had to add a ton of car chases and explosions to distract viewers from the lack of chemistry between the wrongly cast actors. Tom cruise is getting too old to play these roles. Climbing cliffs and scaling buildings with no safety equipment? And we're supposed to buy that bull?<br/><br/>Paula Patton has zero charisma and is not a skilled actor. Rennes on the other hand is a skilled actor but somehow did not fit in. The casting was just off, even bizarre. We all know that the sand storms featured in the film were grossly exaggerated like everything else. The only thing missing from this movie was a good script."
"theskylabadventure","4","2","6","22 May 2012"," Disappointing
","My hopes were high for this movie, maybe too high. Being a huge fan of Brian de Palma (at least as far as 1996), I still love his film and still consider it the best of the bunch. John Woo's offering is perhaps his worst film (absurd plot developments involving removable faces, terrible casting, tiresome action sequences) and, even factoring in the high-octane focus of Missions 3 and 4, still seems totally out-of-place. The third film was a huge surprise; tremendous fun and a more evidently tongue-in-cheek approach to the necessarily ridiculous plot. It also featured Phil Hoffman as one of the most quietly bad-ass villains of recent years.<br/><br/>Ghost Protocol is closest in tone to the third film, but the balance of gravity and levity JJ Abrams brought to the proceedings has eluded Brad Bird's grasp. The main problem for me is the cast. In Abrams' film, Hoffman anchored everything so that everyone else could just have fun. Even Laurence Fishburn seemed to be winking in a ""we really don't want you to take any of this too seriously"" way.<br/><br/>In Bird's film, the usually dependable Jeremy Renner seems to think he's not allowed to have any fun at all and appears to be taking his role far more seriously than it demands, making it painful viewing. Renner is a great actor, so I'm tempted to blame Bird's direction. Simon Pegg simply doesn't work. Ironically, they've toned down the jokes and given him a more substantial purpose in the story, which seems like a total waste of Pegg and an otherwise credible character. The bad guys here are all totally forgettable, to the point where I really can't come up with anything more substantive to say about them. The same goes for the dialogue and plot; some Russians, some codes, some camaraderie....<br/><br/>The action sequences are pretty fun but, by the time the bullets start flying, you simply won't care enough about the characters or their dilemma to really enjoy the show. By the time we hit the two-hour mark, I was just willing it all to end. I was then made to endure a totally unnecessary, tacked-on ending.<br/><br/>Essentially, the problem boils down to the fact that the film can't seem to decide how seriously it wants to be taken. If it were just balls-to-the- wall fun, fine. If it could muster a fraction of the tone of, say, the Bourne movies (which it clearly tries to emulate), I would happily let myself take it seriously. Sadly, it falls short of its own apparent expectations. And mine."
"theantifox","9","2","6","11 March 2012"," And just as we thought Tom Cruise was past his prime.
","In 1996, Paramount Pictures released the Brian De Palma flick ""Mission: Impossible"", starring Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. The film was a huge success, and was followed by an even more successful 2000 sequel directed by John Woo, and a third movie directed by J.J. Abrams, released in 2006, which was somewhat of a flop.<br/><br/>And after that, we thought Tom Cruise would never make another comeback. And then, there came this movie. Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol.<br/><br/>Let me just tell you, as a fan of Brad Bird's movies, and the fact that this movie was in IMAX, I knew I just had to see this movie, and I haven't even seen the first three movies yet. So, when this movie opened in select theaters, I went to the theater to see this movie. And it was the best 133 minutes I have ever spent watching a movie, thanks to heart-pounding action, amazing cinematography and a sometimes comedic performance by Simon Pegg.<br/><br/>This movie has about a half and hour worth of scenes shot in IMAX, particularly, the scene where Ethan scales the Burj Kalifa as a sandstorm approaches. Whenever it switched to the giant, 70mm view, I was blown away, both by how amazingly it filled the screen, and by how crystal clear it sounded.<br/><br/>Speaking of sound, I almost had a heart attack while watching once scene in the movie, the scene where Ethan's in the car with the IMF secretary, and the secretary says ""I've always considered you a friend"", and, suddenly, there's this huge explosion. It really startled everyone in the theater, including me.<br/><br/>Finally, at the end of the movie, they left an opening for a fifth movie. And let me just tell you, I can't wait to see it, if they ever get to making it. Because now, because of this movie, I bet Tom Cruise is now back to his former A-list status."

"brendonbasiga","7","2","6","20 February 2012"," Great movie - well worth it!
","I have a man-crush on Tom Cruise, and after watching Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (i.e. M:I4), I am not ashamed to admit it. That being said, I dare say that there are more of us out there, that share this infatuation, than we dare admit. After all, M:I4 did gross over $197 Million (as of January 22nd, 2012, according to IMDb.com's numbers). For my part, Cruise-mania aside, this bankable action star still knows how to put out a good product. Is there much of a storyline? No. Is the predictable? Of course. But, is the action well worth the money spent on the ticket, popcorn, over-sized-pop, and sticky floors? Hell, yes!<br/><br/>In a nutshell, M:I4 does not veer too far from the standard Hollywood action flick formula: bad guy blows-up the Kremlin and is threatening the world with nuclear warfare; good guy and his team are setup to take the fall for everything; bad guy gets within inches of accomplishing his evil plans, but good guy and his team save the day at the very (very) last second. The world-wide locales throughout the movie range from Budapest to Russia, and from Dubai to Mumbai, with panoramic screen shots that rival most modern-day James Bond movies. All the while having its main focus on an all-American team, counter-balanced with a group of Russian villains, and it even included one upper-level US Politician (played by the brilliant British actor, Tom Wilkinson, no less).<br/><br/>The movie's political machinations were a thinly veiled mirror for those in reality. In fact, the overall plot of the movie, itself, was somewhat gaunt. However, the action sequences, stunts, and graphics do not disappoint in the least. Yes, at least according to IMDb.com, that is Tom Cruise himself, hanging from the tallest building in the world (the Burj Khalifa). And yes, Tom Cruise, at 50 years old, still looks better with his shirt-off than I ever will!<br/><br/>In addition to Cruise reprising his role as Ethan Hunt, Simon Pegg returns as Benji Dunn. But in this latest installment, Jeremy Renner is brought on as William Brandt and Paula Patton signs on as Jane Carter. With the exception of Pegg's character, the other three members of the team are given a backstory to infuse their characters with a level of depth. Hunt is supposedly haunted by the memory of a loved one; Renner is guilt-ridden over the failure of a critical mission that is coincidentally related to Hunt; and Carter is driven by revenge. Admittedly, these character stories would be interesting in a novel adaptation of this movie. But in a movie that unabashedly promotes itself as an ear-drum rattling action flick, this psycho-analytical character development is far better suited for a much slower screenplay. <br/><br/>Pegg does an excellent job of bringing back the comedic relief that made me a big fan of his Shaun of the Dead cult classic. Although retrospectively, I felt remiss that Pegg's character did not have some level of angst to deal with, his comedic timing is flawless, as usual. Patton's sex appeal leaves no question as to where her real-life husband (Grammy Award Winner musician, Robin Thicke) finds his inspiration. Her butt-kicking abilities give an entirely new meaning to the phrase ""badass"". She is as stunning as she is perfect for the role of Agent Jane Carter.<br/><br/>The real question comes with the introduction of Renner's character, William Brandt. The denouement raises very subtle questions about whether or not Ethan Hunt will, in fact, continue to be part of the IMF. Could Brandt be his replacement? Is Renner being introduced to the audience as the new leading man of the M:I franchise? If that is truly the case, Renner is well-equipped to handle the part. After having seen Renner in The Hurt Locker, he definitely has the action ""chops"" needed for the role. Beyond being a fan or Renner's work, I respect his famous (or infamous) independent streak. So, here's hoping that Renner's Brandt is the replacement for Cruise's Hunt.<br/><br/>Please check-out my blog at: http://brensmoviereviews.blogspot.com/"

","'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – GHOST PROTOCOL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>The fourth 'Ethan Hunt' adventure is both the most financially successful of the 'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE' series as well as the most critically acclaimed. It was directed by Brad Bird (former Corvallis High School graduate and Oscar winning Pixar director), in his first live action outing, and written by Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec (two TV writer vets). 'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' director J.J. Abrams produced the film along with star Tom Cruise and Bryan Burk and up and coming actors Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton joined returning cast members Cruise and Simon Pegg. The result is an exhilarating action thrill ride. Not quite as classic as the original but perhaps the best of any of the sequels. <br/><br/>This time around Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is on a deadly mission to stop a terrorist known as Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) from attacking the U.S. with stolen Russian nuclear launch codes. He and his team, Benji Dunn (Pegg) and Jane Carter (Patton), first attempt to stop the madman at the Kremlin when a bomb goes off and the IMF team is blamed for it. The president cuts off Hunt and his team, issuing 'Ghost Protocol' against them. They do find aid from a intelligence analyst named William Brandt (Renner) though, that seems to know more about Hunt and his team than he lets on. <br/><br/>The movie is filled with spectacular edge of your seat action scenes and visuals. Cruise and the rest of the cast are adequate but there's definitely nothing too memorable in the form of acting. It's Bird that shines in the director seat as well as a smart and fun script and excellent work from an awesome technical team. The movie is not nearly as nostalgic or engaging as the original but, like I said, it offers a little more fun than the last two installments.

"troy-manatunga","5","2","6","30 January 2012"," Not quite on par with what was expected!
","I could not score tickets to the premier; hence I waited out the rush and finally against many negative reviews on MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL I am watching it. When news broke out that Tom Cruise and J.J Abrahams were on the lookout for a director never did I for a moment expect Brad Bird to land himself on the project. It is no secret that the MI franchise is indeed the Tom Cruise mobile. However will it continue to be so is only a question Tom Cruise can answer?<br/><br/>MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL is Director Brad Birds' first full length action production behind the camera. Bird who is a wizard with animations somehow seems to have impressed the producers and Paramount pictures in order to gain the main seat behind the camera. Did he fair well? I think he did. Did the movie work as a revamp for Tom Cruises' career? It would be acceptable to say 'yes'. However did the movie as a whole create that experience we would expect out of this overrated franchise? I think not. It is in fact an average production which I found more to have been tipped onto the funny side with Simon Pegg than onto some thrilling action.<br/><br/>When the Kremlin explodes in the background and Ethan Hunt is covered by the debris all I was thinking was why they could not have done a better job with the cinematography? INDEPENDENCE DAY which was shot back in 1996 was awarded for its effects and almost 2 decades down Cruise, Abrahams and Bird messes it up! The scaling of Burj Khalifa from the outside, the futuristic BWM and Simon Pegg saves MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL from being rated any lower than at midpoint! The action sequences apart from the Burj are the types that could have been done or seen in any movie. MISSION IMPOSSIBLE is a name that on its own sets a certain standard. Although personally I believe it is overrated, it does set the benchmark on many levels for its gadgets and stunts since 1996. Apart from the gloves and the car, nothing else seemed Ethan Hunt to me. The MI franchise is always known to move from director to director since it does not want to be like the one before. However I sense the flaw isn't in the direction or the cast. It's in the screenplay. It is too basic. In Fact its basic enough that I can skip a synopsis if not I may have to spoil it for the lucky few who have not watched it yet. It is not a bad script at all however it indeed isn't espionage material enough for a MI revamp. Ethan is assigned a mission, should he wish to accept it the message self-destructs (that line is way too old for 2012!) Ethan locates the villain, hunts him down and saves the day. This is exactly the concept since 1996. It is evident that MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL is indeed a very hard fought battle by both the cast and the crew. It saddens me as a fan to see the movie fall short of what I expected. <br/><br/>A humble request to Tom Cruise , if you chose to accept MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 5 please reconsider the entire concept of the franchise; if not your fan base will self-destruct without a doubt!<br/><br/>Title: MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL Directed: Brad Bird Starring: Tom Cruise, Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, Paula Patton, Michael Nyqvst and Tom Wilkinson Rated: PG13 Rating: 05/10 133 Minutes"

It did not present a great remember-able villain, but at least it gave it time to focus more on the hero cast. Now for the but... There is a plot hole here so huge i could park a DC10 in it, there is a major part of the plot revolving around launch codes. The MI agents have a device which scrambles the numbers, they make fake copies and give them to the bad guy, they can trace the copies since they have an isotope on them. So the bad guys get away with the Fake copies, they never know or see the real launch codes but are being chased by the heroes as if they do, and then use the fake codes to launch a missile.

"dreamflix","8","2","6","30 December 2011"," Cruise Delivers Again
","Tom Cruise really delivers in this action sequel. He's 47 and is as fit as a fiddle. He can continue to make more MI's as long as he wants as far as I'm concerned. We need to see more actors who aren't in their twenties or thirties doing action (like Liam Neeson) and can still deliver. Charles Bronson and Clint Eastwood held on for a long time, and drew in audiences of varying ages. When we want to see action, let's see the actors we like to see doing it and not age them out because they hit a certain age. By then, they've evolved as actors. Cruise really hit it hard with the action. To see him running as he did in the previous movie says this guy knows how to stay in shape. The story line was okay. The previous editions had better character development. This one didn't have the ""feel"" of the previous ones. Yet, I do have to say that I didn't go in there expecting an awarding winning script. I went to see action. Paula Patton held her own, as she was fun to see in ""Jumping the Broom"". This may open doors for her into another venue. Jeremy Renner has the quality of being a good or bad guy and we weren't sure until about the end where he stood. And, yes, thanks for bringing Ving Rhames in again, and letting us know he is still in action. The locales were beautiful and the cinematography was good. This is a good movie to see, and Cruise can keep making then as long as he can continue to deliver, as he usually does."
"Mikeboy0001","8","2","6","30 December 2011"," Great Entertainment. The First True Modern IMF
","I loved the 60's series, and I always thought the movies adaptations where either dull (MI1), ridiculous (MI2) or OK as a movie but poor as an MI adaptation (MI3). When I heard a 4th MI was coming up, I thought, ""Why do they even bother?"". Then I found Brad Bird was the Director, and it was ""Hmmm, that could be good. He's great in animation, but can he do it in real motion?"". The good reviews started coming up, and when it was mentioned that the action was bit old school, I thought I would give it a go I'm glad I did, because the result was fantastic. For a long time have I not been in the Theaters watching a more than 2 hours action flick without having felt the time go by. It's engaging from the first minute, it has a great rhythm of action and tense scenes, and it's the best Blockbuster action flick I've seen in the Theaters for several years (in terms of pure entertainment, that is). The action is kinetic, in the sense you feel it's real, and not a bunch o CGI thrown in making it a video game. It also feels authentic, original, never a bad copy of Bond or the Bourne movies. Although it isn't a thriller like the series, as it could never be, it has right amount of tense moments that are as good as them, not letting you even blink an eye when they're on. Tom Cruise finally seems to have born to be in MI, and the rest of cast, specially Jeremy Renner, are great too. In the end, I think it's the first well made modern Mission Impossible adaptation, with a right balance of action, story and tension, good acting and a great direction. Well done!!!"
"mp326","8","2","6","30 December 2011"," Cruise lights up the screen once again aided by a hugely likable supporting cast. Thrills, laughs and action aplenty make for solid popcorn entertainment.
","Not one of the Mission Impossible films since the very first in the series back in 1996 have managed to compete or even really get close to having what most people would call a plot. But where 'Ghost Protocol' rises above the previous two sequels is in its inventiveness and sense of fun. Cruise has always been a likable and charismatic lead and really breathes life into the character of Ethan Hunt but it's mainly thanks to Brad Bird (that's right! – the man behind 'Ratatouille' and 'The Incredibles') that the series has really found its feet again. Word is that Cruise has now decided to break the mould of choosing a brand new director for each movie due to the unique visual panache that Bird has brought to his brilliantly executed set pieces and has already signed Bird on for the fifth movie. Deservedly so methinks. <br/><br/>15 years after the first movie and Cruise is still very much the star of the show, having barely aged since the series began he's certainly showing no signs of slowing down – quite the opposite in fact. Here, we see him in peak physical fitness doing more death defying stunts than the first and third movies combined – sprinting, leaping over cars and off staircases, side kicking bad guys at head height, zip-wiring onto the roof of a moving van and even finding time for a brief kiss with Paula Patton's seductively capable Agent Carter, Maggie Q's equally attractive replacement to the IMF team. But most impressive of all is of course what some would argue to be the movie's climax – Cruise scaling the tallest skyscraper in the world, Dubai's Burj Khalifa. For real. Yep. – Filmed entirely in IMAX this one sequence alone is worth the price of admission and is so thrillingly effective that you'll have dropped all your popcorn down you in disbelief of how much vertigo you'll be feeling if not for yourself then at least on behalf of Cruise. However, before and after scenes involving a rather comic but tense infiltration into the Kremlin and a car chase taking place in a blinding sandstorm are certainly worth no less in the entertainment department.<br/><br/>'Ratatouille' composer Michael Giacchino re-collaborates with Bird and continues the scoring from the previous movie, his unique style being instantly recognisable and in contrast to Hans Zimmer's more reflective but no lesser take on M:I-2's set pieces, provides us with a greater sense of urgency adding to the shock of the sudden bursts of action which are aplenty.<br/><br/>Like the first movie, all the characters are well rounded meaning we actually care about newcomers Paula Patton and Jeremy Renner - welcome replacements to the IMF team. Simon Pegg is back and as likable as ever providing much of the light relief to Cruise's daring exploits and it's good to see his character has evolved from the last film, now having become a competent field agent who can shoot straight without flinching.<br/><br/>In fact, the supporting cast all ooze talent with the likes of Anil Kapoor (24), Michael Nyqvist (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), Vladimir Mashkov (Behind Enemy Lines) and Léa Seydoux (Robin Hood) making for a highly talented bunch for Cruise, Pegg, Patton and Renner to play off. Even brief cameos by Tom Wilkinson's IMF secretary, Josh Holloway's field agent and Ving Rhames' return as Ethan Hunt's long term sidekick are made memorable and really elevate the profile of this fourth entry in the franchise. The happy endings are also still here but with an additional plot twist that's hard to see coming, even for an IMF agent.<br/><br/>Verdict: Cruise, his fellow leads and supporting cast alike are all on top form complemented by Bird's competent and flamboyant direction. A hugely enjoyable spy thriller which has softened the blow in waiting for the release of 'Sky fall' and is without a doubt the best Mission Impossible since the first in the franchise. See it.<br/><br/>Review by MARK PAYNE"
"EUyeshima","8","2","6","29 December 2011"," Bird Brings Visual Zing and Cruise Again Delivers in the Exciting Fourth Installment
","I honestly didn't know which number sequel this was before watching the 2011 entry into the franchise. In fact, I had only seen the original 1996 ""Mission: Impossible"" prior to this viewing and heard rumors that the two previous sequels in 2000 and 2006 were simply retreads of the first movie, which was in itself a reimagining of the popular 1960's TV series, granted an extravagant, multi-million-dollar reimagining directed by Brian DePalma. This one showcases an older yet still agile Tom Cruise returning to the role of intrepid IMF agent Ethan Hunt, and even as he closes in on fifty, he demonstrates the same unparalleled commitment to dangerous, high-flying derring-do he displayed in the first one fifteen years ago. This time, the reins have been handed over to Brad Bird who makes his live-action directorial debut after scoring with a couple of Pixar's megahits, ""The Incredibles"" and ""Ratatouille"". The results are fortuitous because Bird brings great visual flair to a film that demands gasp-worthy action sequences.<br/><br/>In fact, the action is so propulsive that the convoluted plot takes a decided backseat. Written by André Nemec and Josh Appelbaum, the story feels like a throwback to the days of Soviet spy-versus-spy intrigue and A-bomb secrets. This time, it all revolves around a briefcase with Russian launch codes that are prized by a brilliant Russian madman named Kurt Hendricks, code name Cobalt, who wants nothing less than using them to destroy the world. He is so feared that Hunt has to be sprung from a Russian prison where it is unclear why he is incarcerated until the very end of the film. A small IMF team has been assigned the duty, consisting of sultry but tough Jane Carter, tech wizard Benji Dunn, and unexpectedly, the IMF Secretary's chief analyst William Brandt. They need to track down a French assassin for hire who has already killed one of their own in cold blood for the briefcase. The team ends up in the Kremlin where their plans go fatally awry. The CIA points the finger at the IMF team for the disaster and invokes the dreaded Ghost Protocol.<br/><br/>The now-rogue agents make their way to the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, where Hunt has to scale the outside of the building to manipulate the building's computer system. A botched transaction with the assassin leads to mayhem and then a final stop in Mumbai where there is the inevitable race against the clock to save the world. The movie is really all about the set pieces – the Russian prison escape, the Kremlin break-in and explosion (an excellent special effect), Hunt's gravity-defying climb in Dubai and an overwhelming sandstorm, and the movable multi-level parking lot in Mumbai which sets that stage for the final showdown. Performance are secondary in this kind of movie, but they are mostly workmanlike. Cruise is inarguably in his element as an action hero, and he appears to perform most of his death-defying stunts. Jeremy Renner (""The Hurt Locker"") also shows the necessary chops as the initially mysterious Brandt, and it is clear he will be playing a larger role in the next installment.<br/><br/>Paula Patton, a long way from the inspirational teacher she played in ""Precious"", brings the requisite sexy strength to Carter, in particular, in a no-holds-barred fight scene with the assassin played by Léa Seydoux (whom I was surprised to discover is the same actress who played the shy antiques dealer in ""Midnight in Paris""). Simon Pegg (""Hot Fuzz"") initially tries too hard for laughs as Dunn until he finally settles into the film's more tongue-in-cheek tone. Michael Nyqvist only has to convey relentless menace as Hendricks, which he does just fine. Anil Kapoor (""Slumdog Millionaire"") shows up as a wealthy Indian tycoon, as does Tom Wilkinson quite briefly as the IMF Secretary. The actor who plays the Russian intelligence operative, Vladimir Mashkov, bears such a striking resemblance to SNL's Fred Armisen that for the longest time, I thought it was Armisen in an impressive change-of-pace. Veteran cinematographer Robert Elswit (""There Will Be Blood"") does excellent camera-work in the various locales – Budapest, Moscow, Dubai and Mumbai. Fans of the franchise shouldn't be disappointed."

","Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is undoubtedly the best instalment in the franchise with gripping action loaded scenes which will never let you relax at any point of the movie.<br/><br/>Brad Bird's animated style of physical humour is instilled in this and it works big time with comical moments coming in even at the edgiest instants.<br/><br/>From the opening credits segment onwards, he stamps his authority over the genre intently. With dazzling action and matured performance by Tom Cruise, it easily becomes our favourite MI movie when the film hits the end of the first house mark with a hot-headed Dubai sequence which will make everyone shout at the cinema. The mission tactics are also ingenious and the comedy acts as a breather for them.<br/><br/>Verdict: In overall, a greatly balanced, action- entertainer.<br/><br/>Rating: 8.5/10"

This movie is about the action, the stunts, the gadgets and even the humor. A brilliant blend of all of that!<br/><br/>There was probably ten short minutes towards the end of the film where the movie seems to drag a bit. But other than for that brief spell, there is hardly a minute in the movie when you're not feeling delighted that you decided to watch this movie.

","Do you remember when we were little, and we went to see a superhero movie, and the minute we get up, we feel like we have lived that adventure? That's how me, a 17 year old guy felt when I went to see Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. I went into the movies excited; for the fact being that I am a huge fan of Tom Cruise's films. But I was also expecting the worse. Time and time again we have slapped in the face with the fact that sequels are just not good. This is one of those rare times, were the films just get better and better. Ghost Protocol, from start to finish made me laugh and jump out of my seat. The intense action sequences and death-defying stunts were incredible. The technology used was so unreal, yet..real! And it's hard to believe it came from such a cartoon crazed director. To create a spy film and make it good, is a task alone. But to push the extremities and make one of the best movies of the year, and on top of that, a sequel to a franchise? It just proves that there is still hope left in Hollywood. There's hardly any films that when you leave, you feel fully satisfied. Well, this movie, definitely should be enlisted in that group!"
"premium90","9","2","6","26 December 2011"," Mission Impossible back on track+++++++++
","I'm not going to make a big statement about this film as it was actually very enjoyable. I would recommend that people watch this in the cinema as we did just now.<br/><br/>I was rather disappointed with the last 2 mission impossible and this film is back on track as the best. The film has a feel of the '007' franchise with a twist.<br/><br/>With the amount of designation and the bad guy to chase. This is old fashion action film which is back on track of the franchise.<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt is back and doing crazy stunts like never before. The funny Simon Pegg is brilliant in the film. <br/><br/>It is difficult to go straight into describing the film without giving out too much. The action scenes are great but one thing I would say is that the film keeps up the tempo! Not one scene is boring. The film keeps going and going without stopping about some boring love scene or a like.<br/><br/>This film is definitely the best Christmas 2012 film of the day. I was surprised how unpacked the cinema was. Maybe because it is boxing day, people are spent up or just going out for the night out. Maybe next time, these blockbuster films should actually come out a week or two earlier to attract the audience.<br/><br/>Anyway, watch the film. Brilliant. If you don't watch in the cinema (you are crazy - don't forget IMAX), definitely get the blu-ray version when it eventually comes out.<br/><br/>Good film. Back on track."

","I'm blunt so I'll just get right to it. Yeah, the plot was very overused. I'm part Russian and I laugh at almost every action movie because the bad guys are Russian. The plot is weak, but while watching the movie you shove the plot aside and say, ""Shut the f*** up plot, I'm trying to focus on the ACTION!"" The action was amazing to say the least. It had my heart beating, I was on the edge of my seat, and when Ethan Hunt was dangling from the freakishly tall tower in Dubai, I just about fainted.

"scarletaka","9","2","6","22 December 2011"," Short review with minor spoiler
","I actually liked this movie. I haven't cared for Tom Cruise's work for a long time too much smiling instead of real acting. This time he has some grit to this role. At his age he is still in fantastic shape and the character Ethan Hunt spends a bit at the first of the movie silent and his acting was really good at that with face, body and hand gestures. Simon Pegg to me is always great. But Ving Rhames as Luther was missing it would have been great for the two Ving and Simon to play off each other.<br/><br/>So, not much to say but I enjoyed it and will definitely pick it up on DVD/BRay."

"michael-neichl-904-632888","7","2","6","20 December 2011"," Your average, typical okay action film
","Before I give a piece of my mind about Phantom Protocoll, a quick sum up of my thoughts of the other Mission Impossible movies: Part 1: nice and good Part 2: forgettable Part 3: really cool, due to Philip Seymour Hoffman so all in all, I wouldn't go as far as to call the trilogy great or fantastic but it definitely has its moments and overall is pretty entertaining. And the same can be said about Part 4.<br/><br/>First lets talk about the things that work: the story, its your typical agents go on a secret mission story, its no inception but it works fine for the film. Then the cast (for the most part): even though i'm not a huge fan of Tom Cruise (still loved him in minority report though) here he is okay, plays his role pretty subtle and the same can be said about Jeremy Renner and Simon Pegg. The only minor problem I have is that Peggs role is a bit too over the top since he is the typical comedic flick who has to be in every movie nowadays. Not bad, but not necessary ether. The last thing that works really good is the action. There is a good use of CGI, the scenes in Dubai are amazing and the movie is never too overblown with effects so you can't take a break from it (go and tell Michael Bay that).<br/><br/>Now the things that don't work for me are as I said the role of Simon Pegg, the length of the movie because i think it could have been cut a bit but most of all the quote unquote drama back story of Jeremy Renner. Even though I really love this guy and the fact that i wanted to see this movie because of him I think he was the weakest link in the chain. His back story is beyond clichéd, there are some mayor plot holes in it and he was absolutely unnecessary for the main plot.<br/><br/>But still if people ask me should I see Phantom protocol I'd say yes, as long as you just expect some nice action with maybe a bit too much forced humor, you're in for a ride, even though it doesn't revolutionize the genre of action films."

"athena24","6","2","6","17 December 2011"," Entertaining enough.
","It seems that all the franchises in Hollywood have become mixed up in the past ten years. Die Hard IV and and MI2 have disguised themselves as Bond movies, while the Bond series have shifted to a new role model, the Bourne franchise. I would actually feel more comfortable, if this movie would be sold for Bond (from Pierce Brosnan Era), then being MI4.<br/><br/>MI4 is too exaggerated, much things left to chance, and it's unnecessarily funny.<br/><br/>MI movies were always walking on the brink of reality. Having ""maybe existing"", ""probably existing"" or ""could be existing"" gadgets. And same goes about the personal skill. MI4 has taken the clearly unbelievable path, having gadgets designed for Bond, and agents with Batman skills.<br/><br/>When a man hits his head from a 1 story fall, he would probably end up in a hospital, skull fractures. With such logic chain, Ethan Hunt should have died several times during this film. This fact alone will give away the credibility for this movie.<br/><br/>The chance factor has too much weight. There was actually no mission that was executed as planned. Too many faults occurring. One of them is actually accepting Benji as a field operative. Though he's funny, that's not what I've expected from MI4.<br/><br/>Another, unusual detail in this movie, is that Tom Cruise character doesn't get angry. Showing his anger is one of Tom Cruises characters' trademarks, and appears in most of his movies (and all of the previous MIs). Most of these were because he took issues personally, which doesn't seem to exist in MI: Ghost Protocol. It also looks as if despite Ethans age, the action takes less effort from him, so he doesn't look so tense. On the other hand, maybe it's because he knows that the stunts are so unreal, and he's not trying to be too serious about it.<br/><br/>Beyond the said above, it's entertaining and never boring. The Dubai scene is amazing. Both the mission plan and the action looks cool. And though the light, funny mood doesn't suit, based on previous installments, my expectation from MI, it is funny. So compensated fairly.<br/><br/>MI3 was my favorite, having interesting missions, amazing action and a superb villain. MI2 had nothing beyond it's relatively good action. MI1 had great missions, an OK action but was too complicated. Considering, that the MI movies don't have a certain standard, MI4 is fine and worth it's cinema ticket."

","The Mission Impossible (MI) series has had a chequered history, from an impressive opening salvo, the series had meandered it's way through two further films with mixed results.<br/><br/>Think of this film as similar to the ""Casino Royale"" or ""Goldeneye"" of the Bond Franchise, a real re-invention.<br/><br/>Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, more focused, committed and believable than before. He has along for the ride a different accidental crew in the form of the unlikely Simon Pegg as ""Benji"", computer technician, brand new field operative and comic relief. Pegg must wonder each morning when he will wake up from the sudden dizzy heights he now occupies, now starring in two mega franchises including the new Star Trek.<br/><br/>Jane (Paula Patto) adds some glamour to the proceedings but can beat up bad guys with the best of them and Brandt (Jeremy Renner) provides an increasing amount of support as the film progresses. Tom Wilkinson adds yet another high profile film credit to his resume as the IMF director.<br/><br/>We start in Russia with an exciting jailbreak, progressing to a very neat extraction in the Kremlin albeit book-ended with some slightly dodgy FX.<br/><br/>Nuclear launch codes are missing and the usual rogue Russian elements, in the form Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist), are behind an insane plot to launch a nuclear missile, thus cleansing the world of it's sins and allowing it to be reborn.<br/><br/>Following the Kremlin event, which the US naturally gets blamed for, the whole IMF corp are disavowed, leaving Hunt and his team to go it alone and save the world. Luckily they still have plenty of cool gadgets and toys to play with.<br/><br/>In Bondesque fashion, we then globe-trot through Budapest, Dubai and Mumbai as the hunt for the codes and the means of delivery through a spare satellite, hots up.<br/><br/>The action sequences are fast and furious, notable set pieces in Dubai are exciting and with plenty of real stunt work, albeit undoubtedly enhanced with FX work. Is that really Cruise hanging 120 floors up on the Bhurj Khalifa building, we are told it most certainly is. The car chases are expertly done within a simulated sandstorm, clearly with BMW's exclusive assistance, many cars are destroyed but all in spectacular fashion. Another scene in an automated car park in Mumbai is expertly choreographed and leads to an exciting and unexpected climax.<br/><br/>Pegg actually works really well here, providing some reality and grounding to all the high tech, displaying a suitably audience friendly look of awe, to all that goes on around him, possibly with little acting required. The film is smart enough to make fun of the whole premise without erring into supposed parody error, see Cruise's own weak ""Knight and Day"" effort for details. We particularly liked the ""message will destruct in five seconds"" failure and the obvious impracticality of a retinal scan on a moving goods train.<br/><br/>Like any modern futuristic movie, what is shown as high tech becomes common place within five years or even exists now. If so, security guards will need to be more aware of their surroundings and study that CCTV real hard in the future.<br/><br/>Director Brad Bird of Pixar ""The Incredibles"" fame, makes a highly successful leap into live action and this provides a late entry as the undoubted best action movie of the year. The story is a bit dodgy and fanciful, the ending taking the peril too far beyond what would make any difference as to the intended result. No matter, the MI series has always been about the action, that music and the visuals, none of which disappoint here.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>A globe trotting thriller that truly thrills, mixing the best elements of Bond, Bourne and MI in barnstorming fashion.<br/><br/>Cruise is back on form and reinvigorates the franchise, providing excellent movie escapist fun.<br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/"

"IllusionOfLife","9","2","6","16 December 2011"," Brad Bird Puts Other Action Directors to Shame
","I'll admit it, I've never been hugely passionate about the Mission: Impossible series (in fact, until I re-watched the movies this week I hardly remembered them), and when I first heard that a fourth Mission: Impossible was in the works I couldn't have been less interested. That is until I read the words ""Brad Bird has signed to direct."" Those six words instantly rocketed this film up to the top of my most anticipated list, and his live action debut does not disappoint. Not one single bit.<br/><br/>The Mission: Impossible series has had a bit of a rocky past. The first film is a decent spy thriller with a clever twist, the second movie is borderline self-parody with it's over-the-top antics, and the third movie was the previous high point of the series with exciting action blended with strong characterization. With each new installment a new director has brought a new element to the series, and the element that Brad Bird brings to M:I-GP is scope. Massive, exciting, jaw-dropping scope. This is easily the biggest, boldest, and most ambitious Mission: Impossible film to date, and as far as I can recall at the moment, the biggest, boldest, most ambitious action film in general since Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.<br/><br/>Brad Bird handles his first live action film like an old pro and puts many other ""veteran"" action directors to shame. The pacing is impeccable, moving seamlessly from massive action spectacles to more downplayed character moments without ever losing momentum; the action is big without being silly; and the action sequences are breathtakingly shot and choreographed and constantly leave you picking your jaw up off the ground. The marketing has really played up the scene in Dubai in which Ethan Hunt scales the Burj Khalifa (the tallest building in the world) from the outside, and I began to worry that the scene wouldn't live up to all the hype. It does. Especially in the expanded IMAX aspect ratio, this scene is an absolute masterwork in tension, and while this may be the high point of the action in the film, the other sequences stand nearly as tall. From a chase scene during a sandstorm, to a fist fight dodging loading and unloading cars in a parking garage the action is fast-paced, hard- hitting, and fun.<br/><br/>This is Brad Bird we're talking about, though, and so he's not content with putting contemporary action directors to shame, he also makes sure that the story and characters get their proper focus and time to shine. The story of this movie never reaches the emotional heights of Bird's previous works like Ratatouille or The Iron Giant, but this type of movie really doesn't call for that. The story hearkens back to Cold War tensions and old-school spy scenarios while still feeling modern and fresh. It's the perfect pairing of classic storytelling with modern polish and style. As for the cast of characters, everyone in this movie is great. The previous movies have all focused the attention on Ethan Hunt, and while Hunt is definitely still the ""lead"" in this movie, the ensemble cast is much more important than they've ever been before with each member of the team getting almost equal screen time and a strong sense of purpose propelling the story. Simon Pegg steals the show with his brilliant comedic timing, but Paula Patton and Jeremy Renner both give strong, multi-faceted performances, and their characters are invaluable to the film. The villain this time around is not quite as memorable as Philip Seymour Hoffman's character from M:i:III, but the story is much more focused on the IMF team this time around and having a major heavy like that probably would have made the focus of the film uneven.<br/><br/>Brad Bird has already proved himself to be a brilliant filmmaker with three of the best films of the last decade, but for anyone foolish enough to think he couldn't handle live action just as well Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol should drive the point home. Bird handles the movie with the grace and assuredness of someone who has been making films like this for years. This is one of the year's best films and one of the best action movies I've seen in quite a while. I definitely recommend this movie, and also encourage you to see it in IMAX. While nothing I have seen in the format so far has quite matched the level of awesome that was The Dark Knight in IMAX, M:I-GP uses the format very well and the action scenes that take advantage of the full aspect ratio are incredible to behold.<br/><br/>Now, let's just hope the execs at Warner Bros. take note of this and give Brad Bird the budget he needs to make 1906. That's a movie that I cannot wait to see green lit.<br/><br/>A"
"Troy_Campbell","8","2","6","15 December 2011"," Massively enjoyable.
","Like a fine wine, Tom Cruise's spy franchise is getting better with age. After the return-to-form with M:I3, the Cruiser is back better than ever as Ethan Hunt, this time teaming up with Jeremy Renner's enigmatic analyst Brandt, Paula Patton's revenge-driven Jane and Simon Pegg's comedy relief Benji to stop terrorist and all-round crazy man Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) from sparking a nuclear war. The plot – although featuring a handful of twists and turns – is fairly standard, but it's the action that elevates this to 'awesome' status. Impeccably shot and employing some inventive special effects, Ghost Protocol boasts some of the best set-pieces put to celluloid this year. The Burj Khalifa sequence – which sees Cruise execute all of his own mind-boggling stunts on the outside of the world's tallest building – is the single finest example of pure, unadulterated cinematic joy 2011 has offered up. With a stereotypical villain, unexplored subplots and an underused Josh Holloway, this fourth instalment into the Impossible series may not be perfect, but it's massively enjoyable."

","Sooooo long story short, go see this movie. Pretty much as soon as it comes out.<br/><br/>As for the unabridged review: it's the best Mission Impossible yet (Tom Cruise versions, of course). More of the cool gadgets, super awesome fight scenes and secret spy stuff we love. Plus some spectacular locations. We've got Dubai, Mumbai, Moscow. I mean, the movie is just visually stunning, though I saw it at an IMAX theater, so the highest quality of visual and sounds is to be expected. Did I mention it's a funny movie? We can mostly thank Simon Pegg for this, though Cruise, also one of the movie's producers, is pretty snarky, himself. The plot is a standard Mission: Impossible plot but it keeps you engaged from start to stop. Nevermind all the details and technical-speak you may get lost in. Just go with it.

"TheHonestCritic","10","1","2","17 February 2020"," This is the first live action movie that Brad Bird had directed. What kind of effect does that bring to the ""Mission: Impossible"" film franchise?
","""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" (2011), this is my second favorite ""Mission: Impossible"" film in the saga. This film series is based off a classic TV series created by Bruce Geller. Usually, you can't top the original TV series or film(s). However, with this film, and a few of the others in this franchise, I have to say that these movies are better than the original ""Mission: Impossible"" TV show. As much as I love the original show, the movie series honestly is overall much better. ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" is no exception. It may not be my favorite movie of the franchise, but it is still a fantastic movie, and a very close second! Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack. Just like ""Mission: Impossible III"" (2006), the story is very creative. This one keeps you thinking, there's plenty of action, comedic moments, and it keeps you on edge from beginning to end. All of the actors and actresses put on stellar performances. But, once again, Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt steals the show. The villain, Kurt Hendricks played by Michael Nyqvist (R.I.P.) is a great villain. His plan for nuclear destruction is actually pretty diabolical! As for the rest of the actors and actresses, they are flawless. The only actor in this film that gives a questionable performance is Paula Patton as Jane. Don't get me wrong, her performance doesn't hurt the film and it doesn't ruin the performances of the other actors and actresses. But, she just looks like she's pompous and full of herself. I'm just up in the air about it. The sets/locations are fantastic, and really help to set the tone for the movie. As far as the special effects go, they are well done and hold up to this day. However, the only thing that could have been a little better was the explosion effect of the Kremlin blowing up. It kind of looks like it needed a bit more rendering. But, that explosion shot is still passable. Finally, we have a phenomenal soundtrack, once again composed by Michael Giacchino. The soundtrack was well composed, really ties the film together and definitely brings the movie to life! ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" is a thrill ride from beginning to end. Brad Bird, you did an incredible job directing your first live action film! I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you have not seen ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"", go see it. Go rogue if you have to!"

","This seems to be the general favorite among a lot of people I talk to. Its got a great sense of pacing and rhythm, it just flies by fluidly and with great style. The set pieces are gripping and imaginative. Ghost Protocol really established the template of what Mission Impossible is. Not just a Tom Cruise vehicle, but a globe-trotting, exotic, action spy adventure that really emphasizes the team effort as a whole. Brad Bird brings his trademark colorful energy and retro style to the table, Giacchino delivers a big exotic and fun musical score to match, and Tom Cruise proves to the world that he isn't going away anytime soon in what was at the time the biggest box office hit of his career."
"tabuno","8","1","2","18 January 2019"," Almost at Great Action Thriller
","25 December 2011. The high octane, tension-wire, electrified action bursts into an almost great action thriller this fourth time out. The use of two predictable twists, one in the very beginning action sequence with the lady and then with the male assistant were more lazy than well written, executed sequences, then humor especially in the beginning portion of the movie bordered on inappropriate overly done mood distracting tonality of the movie, and at least one sequence was overly complicated and difficult to understand narrative that threatened to slow the pace of the movie. Nevertheless, the riveting action sets were among the hottest this year and may have set a new level of finesse when editing and pacing hot action scenes. With not as crisp Bourne elements, the shocking surprise reminiscent to the Bourne Supremacy (2004) or Harrison Ford's scene in Clear and Present Danger (1994) really hit the action thrills button perfectly. The female vs. female scene missed an opportunity for some nice emotive conflict slo mo action. Very entertaining, overall well executed especially in keeping a dizzying web of James Bond storyline plot points together, except for one scene noted above."
"Alex_Kladis","7","1","2","20 December 2018"," Quick Review
","Brad Bird's take on M:I, is a fan, fast, funny and action packed thriller. The camera work of ""Ghost Protocol"" is exceptionally good and manages not only to take some amazing shots but also transportes the emotional height of the Picture.<br/><br/>The action, although over the top, it's mesmerising and that's in par with Tom's performance. Overall, the acting it's ok (with its highs and it's lows), but the script is pretty weak and even cheesy from time to time (especially the last scene)!"

","The stunts and sequences are even better than that of its stellar predecessor (see the hotel con and climb, insane parking garage fight), but the characters are not (Pegg's comic relief aside) and the main plot starts to get a little silly, morphing into a bit of a cliche end-of-the-world deal complete with Euro villains. To its credit, it does embrace some of its ridiculousness (see Hunt's failed ""Mission accomplished!""). Not to its credit are the terrible placecards (Verdana of all fonts??)."
"zkonedog","5","1","2","10 March 2017"," Not My Cup Of Tea, But Good At What It Does
","Of the hundreds of movies I have reviewed so far, ""Ghost Protocol"" is one of the most difficult to assign a star ranking. Why? At its core, MI-4 is an action movie through-and-through. Judged solely by those characteristics, it is probably a four if not five-star effort. The problem? I'm not a big fan of films that feature action and little else.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Ghost Protocol"" sees the IMF shut down due to a failed mission and operating under ""ghost protocol"" (no government involvement whatsoever). As such, the team of Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), Jane Carter (Paula Patton), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), & William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) must go it alone in foiling a Russian nuclear plot.<br/><br/>What this movie most certainly does right is that it captures the essence of what ""Mission Impossible"" really is...action, adventure, crazy stunts, gadgets, and intense special effects. From its TV beginning, ""MI"" has always been strictly rooted in ""spy film"" characterization, and director Brad Bird (along with producer JJ Abrams) really nail that tone in ""Ghost Protocol"".<br/><br/>At the same time, though, this movie has a very limited scope. Either you like that kind of film- making...or you can only appreciate what it is trying to do (hence my three-star ranking). I mean, in terms of plot, ""MI-4"" is about as generic a spy plot as one can concoct. It is the type of film where the plot serves only as the vehicle for the next chase/fight/explosion/cool gadget. Again, it comes down to personal preference.<br/><br/>One thing that made the movie quite bearable for me, though, was the superb acting performances (especially from the auxiliary cast). Cruise is solid, but is nearly upending in the acting department by Renner (who I wish would have been given more screen time) & Pegg (the spot-on comedic relief that a film like this so desperately needs). Paula Patton? She proves that she can kick a little butt as well as seduce the high-class gentlemen with the best of them (!).<br/><br/>Overall, I appreciated what ""Ghost Protocol"" was trying to do in terms of movie-making, but because of personal preference I can't bring myself to truly enjoy it in a thorough sense of the word. I liked the ""little stuff"" (acting, comedy, etc.), but the ""big picture"" (no plot, all action) made it nearly impossible for this one to vault to the top of any ""best of"" lists of mine. Enjoy it for what it is worth."
"BeneCumb","8","1","2","19 November 2015"," Stylish and definitely better than other similar movies
","I have determined to watch all the Mission-movies: characters are elaborated, performances are at least good, the script is frisky, the venues are diverse and action scenes do not create blah! feelings... Of course, there are lots of references to many more famous movies, including the James Bond ones, but I like that the attitude/mood is non-serious, not ""bulked out"", even in respectable or posh places. And inclusion of formerly locally known character actors, e.g. Michael Nyqvist, Anil Kapoor and Vladimir Mashkov, and places, e.g. Budapest (as I visited this beautiful city recently, I was eager to see how many places I visited were available in this movie), Mumbai, Moscow, Dubai, provides the movie with broader background, bringing the viewers away from narrow despondency; true, were did not see much of surroundings or panoramas as operations took places in the buildings and chases were too fast. <br/><br/>And - last but not least - all the cast is great again, even smaller parts are played by non-random performers. Here, unlike in the most recent Mission, Tom Cruise was not yet overshadowed by Simon Pegg, as his funny side and ""nerdiness"" was included not so often."
"andrewshieh0712","9","1","2","9 August 2015"," Definitely not a one-man show.
","Since Rogue Nation is just released, I decided to start watching the previous installments since I haven't watch any of them. So here I am with Ghost Protocol which I chose to watch it since it has the highest ratings among all Mission: Impossible movies. <br/><br/>Ghost Protocol is actually one of the most intense action movies I've seen for some time. Mad Max: Fury Road was very action-packed, but it's not the same kind of movie and I guess you all know what I mean, so let's just put Fury Road aside. Other than that, most action movies are either poorly filmed or lack the excitement that one action movie should have. However, Ghost Protocol achieved all of them.<br/><br/>To begin with, I want to first talk about one of the most unforgettable scene in the movie – the scene where Tom Cruise climbed the Burj Khalifa. Not amused with my reaction, that was definitely the highlight of Ghost Protocol. That scene was so breath-taking and after knowing that all the climbing were for real, I'm very impressed with Tom Cruise as an action who do crazy stunts by himself even though he's getting old. <br/><br/>If you're worrying that the Burj Khalifa is the only fun part of the movie, you're wrong. Ghost Protocol is action-packed from the beginning to end. You are constantly delivered action sequences which were handled very well, and most importantly, the tension doesn't stop. After the IMF accomplishes one mission, they are immediately been tossed an even harder mission to complete. Each mission is not likely more difficult than the other, but more intense than the other.<br/><br/>Besides the action, I'm so glad that Ghost Protocol isn't a one-man show. I've seen so many action movies that all of the actions were done by the protagonist and the rest of the crew is only sidekicks. Though we're pretty sure that Tom Cruise is the main character of the movie, the rest of the crew is so important that one mission couldn't be complete when missing one of them. Simon Pegg is superb in Ghost Protocol. He constantly brings some laughs and humors to the serious atmosphere and they're never cheap or leave the audience in that awkward chuckle. Paula Patton and Jeremy Renner are both outstanding while I like how Jeremy is developed as a struggling character. This kind of reminds me of the crew of Furious 7, each character has an important part of the movie, and never is one being over-the-top.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Ghost Protocol is not a flawless movie. One of the biggest problems of this movie is that we got a very weak villain. Yes, we do get action sequences throughout, but we never have a chance to know about him. All we know is that he wants to destroy the world, just like every villain would do. We do not get direct conversations of the villain with Tom Cruise, but chase scenes in some parts of the movie. It's kind of a waste that Ghost Protocol never really developed the character of the main villain. Besides that, Ghost Protocol is nearly perfect."
"Al_The_Strange","8","1","2","2 August 2015"," ""The President has initiated Ghost Protocol. The entire IMF has been disavowed.""
","Mission: Impossible III may be a tough act to follow, given its superb balance between action and storytelling. Who would have thought that there would be even bigger and more daring missions to come? Ghost Protocol takes the IMF team and plunges it into immediate danger, cut off from their parent agency and disavowed. On their own, without backup and support, they rely on what scant leads, tech, and resources they can to stop a bunch of villains from kick-starting nuclear war. In this mission, Ethan Hunt busts out of a Russian gulag, infiltrates the Kremlin (in the coolest way imaginable), and chases bad guys in cars and on foot. One of the biggest and most iconic scenes shows the man scaling the side of the Burj Khalifa Tower, hundreds of stories high, filmed in stunning detail with IMAX cameras. With so many stunts, so much deception, and such high stakes, the mission has never been more exciting and incredible.<br/><br/>This story doesn't have the same emotional heft as its predecessor, largely because Ethan's wife is out of the picture (and there is a nice subplot that explains what's going on there), and because the story's villain just doesn't have that much presence or motivation. What this film does have, thankfully, is a superb cast of heroes we love and can root for. Ethan had teams in all the other movies, but they feel like more of a team in Ghost Protocol, largely because they are all forced to work together without outside help. The conflict and banter between them allows these characters to develop their own personalities, which makes them all people we can relate to and root for. The actual plot retreads the tired old territory of ""we got to stop nuclear war!!"" but it does an apt job of stringing together the setpieces in a logical way, crafting a well-rounded adventure.<br/><br/>This film boasts superb photography and editing. Just about every shot is cool, without too much camera shake (like Abrams' film) and without any superfluous style choices (looking at you, John Woo). Tom Cruise is still quite the action hero, but is still well-grounded in this. I loved watching Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, Paula Patton, and Léa Seydoux. Even though his character wasn't that well-developed, Michael Nyqvist was a convincing villain. Writing is pretty good. This production uses plenty of good-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. Special effects can be a hit or a miss. Music is good.<br/><br/>Even though MI: III offers the best characterization and story, I favor MI: GP the most for its fabulous setpieces, while still retaining a lovable core cast and presenting a thrilling plot to bring it all together. I think it's a total blast, and one of the best spy movies in general.<br/><br/>4/5 (Experience: Very Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Very Good)"
"KineticSeoul","8","1","2","31 July 2015"," You will have a blast with this one
","Since I really enjoyed the third installment. I was looking forward to a sequel and this one disappoint. It plays on that IMF Ethan Hunt team element perfectly. And even has a superb pacing and direction when it comes to the character interaction and action sequences. This movie just never seemed to slow down and I mean that in a good way. This time the gadgetry gets a super upgrade and plays a pivotal part in the movie. It's just a really fun, stylish and cool ride from start to finish. Sure, it goes slightly over the top, but not to the point where it seemed silly. I remember seeing this in the theater and wanting the see it again when it was finished. Even the humor works well in this, and makes the whole experience a bit lighthearted. And the humor can be a hit or a miss when it comes to an action movie. And the humor even works during the action sequences during few scenes. Which is quite an accomplishment. This is movie that just about anyone can enjoy. I personally had a blast with this one. This installment really ups the game for this franchise and it shouldn't be missed.<br/><br/>8.8/10"
"schroeder-gustavo","9","1","2","27 July 2015"," Exceeds expectations
","So a lot of people thought the Mission: Impossible franchise was maybe pretty much done after M:I III, which was great, but many people (including myself) thought Tom Cruise was too old and that maybe the Mission: Impossible movies had shown everything there was to show.<br/><br/>Boy, were we proved wrong. Not only is this a great movie, it is in my opinion, the best in the franchise. Ghost Protocol delivers stunning cinematography, excellent action sequences and great charismatic performances by basically every main character in the movie. Tom Cruise is great, Simon Pegg's return adds so much comedy and charisma to the movie, so pretty much everyone in the team is great. This movie delivers something the Mission: Impossible franchise pretty much forgot about: suspense. Many scenes in the movie, particularly two of them: the prison break sequence and the nuclear launch codes-diamonds exchange are really well executed and very suspenseful. Another thing they did great and brought back was the sense of urgency throughout the film. The IMF is disavowed and the characters really have nothing to rely on but themselves. I love the fact that this is also the first Mission: Impossible movie in which the gadgets malfunction, so the suspense and sense of need is elevated.<br/><br/>There are a few flaws for me in Ghost Protocol, mainly the lack of a compelling villain. It is said that an action movie is only as good as its villain, and the one in this movie isn't really compelling. Philip Seymour Hoffman is the best villain in the franchise so far in M:I III, and in this movie it just feels like a shallow character that is really never explored. Also, the Dubai sequence really feels like the movie's climax, although it's not, really. The climax is supposed to be the India sequence where they abort the missile, and it is great, but after the Dubai sequence, the movie feels like it slows down a little bit, and then it picks up the pace again.<br/><br/>These are only small details, but they cannot deny the fact that Ghost Protocol is a pretty fast paced, action-packed, stunt-heavy movie that is, in my opinion, the best in the franchise so far."

"t-viktor212","8","1","2","25 April 2015"," One of the less-graphic ones
","I particularly liked this entry to the mission impossible series first of all because it's the perfect example of how a movie can be enjoyable and exciting without being gory.<br/><br/>Not going to tell about the plot, that's pretty evidently told in other reviews and even showed out a bit by posters and such. First of all it's good to note that this is Brad Bird (The incredibles)'s first live action film. An enough well-conceived plot, not too complicate, but still interesting, is well brought on by the cast featuring Jeremy Renner as a new entry to mission: impossible (It's ridiculous how he's a secret agent in both this series, both the Bourne series and in Marvel Cinematic Universe), together with already seen faces such as Simon Pegg.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise's stunts, the good choice of locations, and the improbable high-tech gadgets make the whole thing very interesting, with quite a few jokes, though most of things are, in fact, impossible.<br/><br/>I believe that even if you're a Bourne series fan you'll like it. Relation between Mission: Impossible and The Bourne is similar to Marvel and the Dark Knight trilogy. KIn both cases the second series looks more realistic, but the first is still fun to watch.<br/><br/>It's obviously the realism lack that makes me give an 8 and not higher, because I have to confront this with the Bourne series that is quite real, even though I enjoy both almost on the same level."
"Tweekums","8","1","2","14 May 2014"," An entertaining fourth instalment
","This; the fourth in the Mission Impossible franchise opens with protagonist Ethan Hunt in a Russian prison; he isn't there long though as former tech-guy Benji, now a field agent, helps him escape. Once out he joins Benji and new character Jane Carter and learns their new mission they must break into the Kremlin to steal the launch codes to Russian nuclear missiles before terrorist Kurt Hendricks can get them and use them. Unfortunately they are too late and the team are blamed for an explosion caused by Hendricks. After such an incident the president activates the 'Ghost Protocol'; not just the team but the whole of IMF are disavowed. They are helped out of Moscow by the IMF Secretary and follow Hendricks first to Dubai then to Bombay in an attempt to stop him launching the missiles that could start the Third World War!<br/><br/>Each of the films in the series is quite different and this is probably the most comic despite the serious subject matter. That isn't to say there isn't enough action; there is plenty of over-the-top spectacular action including seeing Tom Cruise climbing up the outside of the Burj Khalifa, many fights, chases and shootouts. It is a pity that regular team member Ving Rhames only appeared in a brief cameo but Simon Pegg unsurprisingly provided so good laughs and Paula Patten and Jeremy Renner handled the action well. The story wasn't deep but it served to provide an excuse to visit some spectacular locations and show us some exciting set pieces. Overall this is a fun film with plenty of excitement; there is also little to offend so it can be enjoyed by all but younger children."

"dromasca","8","1","2","14 December 2012"," growth pains
","The Mission Impossible the Bond series share growth pains. They are both making huge efforts to adapt and behave nicely in the new millennium.It's not an easy task for series whose characters, rules and conventions have been written originally in novels of the 50s, or in TV series of the 70s. They both answer by building darker stories (in the mood of the pessimist start of the millennium), hiring new actors (with the exception of the eternal Tom Hanks of course), and new directors who put the emphasize on building flesh and blood characters, humans who can feel pain and sorrow.<br/><br/>Directing is trusted in Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol to Brad Bird whose all previous successes were with animated movies. I cannot say that this is felt at all, or at least I did not detect any flaws in the fluency of the story telling or the work of the actors which are as little cartoonish as a MI-series film can be. The story this time has the quality of being well written, keeps the number of characters almost to the minimum needed and thus is easy to watch. We are still jet-flown in a handful of different countries, impossible infiltrations and games of masks are still part of the action, messages self destroy and at least one symbolic building is badly damaged - but there is an overall effort to make the intrigue, the relations between characters and even the extreme situations more credible, and this effort is mostly successful.<br/><br/>Acting is exactly what is expected. The only regret is that Michael Nyquist has no real role and not enough screen time to demonstrate the huge talent we admired in the Scandinavian version of the Millennium trilogy. Tom Cruise who turned 50 this year is more and more involved in the MI series, he is here not only the lead actor but also the producer. One difference between the Bond and the MI series is that Ethan Hunt's role was never undertaken by another actor but Cruise, while at least five actors featured in the 23 Bond films. Of course, Cruise is still in great form, but the problem will be on the table maybe two series and ten years from now and the question is whether the MI series will over-live Cruise's aging. We shall live and we shall see."
"Lejink","7","1","2","11 October 2012"," Back to the future
","I am such a fan of the original 60's TV series and am aware that many like-minded die- hards are down on Tom Cruise's take on it, promoting his star-power fit to burst where the original was all about the team and of course inserting ever-more hair-raising and unbelievable stunts which never featured previously. I see and get both those arguments and can't imagine for a second Cruise's at times almost superhuman Ethan Hunt fitting in alongside Peter Graves, Martin Landau et al from before, but while I still prefer the relative ingenuity and complexity of the TV version, I did at least feel that this newest instalment drew more on the original inspiration than others in the series, which I think benefited the entertainment here.<br/><br/>Yes, it's still all about Ethan, motivated by the apparent murder of his wife and his incarceration in a foreign prison, but touches like him getting his instructions the old- fashioned way, by self-destructing taped messages, re-using Lalo Schifrin's relatively unadorned theme music and the familiar and warming catch- phrases of old as well as his break-out from the prison and the team's first task at the Kremlin, hint back at the gravitas of the TV show although with the two subsequent exotic relocations to Dubai and India we're back in wonderland with out-of-this-world stunts atop the world's highest building and an extended fight between Hunt and megamind Hendrycks in an an automated car-park. While mind-boggling and white-knuckle inducing, these set-pieces find our hero doing the literally impossible, the usual one-handed grab to save himself falling off the high-building, taking an impossibly long breath to escape drowning and lastly having his body thrown about like a rag-doll in the final sequence as he finally saves the day.<br/><br/>There's no denying Cruise's charisma and his physical conditioning in the part. I wasn't particularly taken with the quality of his back-up team, but that could be down to the writers bigging-up the star role, plus I still find Simon Pegg's ""Barney"" role irritating and misplaced. I also never really felt that the villain had enough menace or stature to really challenge Hunt, especially during the climactic fight, but on the whole, I was almost won over by this latest IMF outing and yes, would welcome a succeeding instalment, the likelihood of which was strongly implied at the conclusion."

Slow it down and see for yourself. Also, did anyone notice that in his last movies, Cruise always finds an occasion for showing us how fast he runs? Great movie for fun, don't go looking for great acting. Even though, let us hope that they continue putting money in entertaining movies like this one... and maybe throw some good acting also.

","Tom Cruise's career has been down almost every road it seems, and yet the best road he has ever gone down is the action picture road, and his most successful has been the Mission: Impossible franchise. While I haven't seen any of the other films, I was very impressed by this one. The film has everything you need: comedy, action, suspense, a good plot, and well done performances, which is actually rare for an action film. The only complaint I have is the villain. Not only do we get maybe five minutes of screen time with him, but his motives seem a little questionable and he overall comes off as extremely weak. But the positive of that: we get to know the four team members very well and like each of them and hope they all accept their next mission, which I definitely will."

","It will be hard not to give spoilers.<br/><br/>The good: The movie does pack some realistic mini-scenarios. Almost no magic or unknown science. Almost everything about the methods and gadgets is well within non-fiction science. The whole scenario of the movie is also pretty realistic, with no superheroes or any sign of non-human superiority. Which does make the movie extremely fun to watch, because you know that at any moment things might go the wrong way. Actors also have done a pretty good job (it seems to me, but I'm bad at recognizing bad acting). They have even spoken foreign languages pretty realistically, almost without accent.<br/><br/>The bad: Some unlikely events in the movie were happening over and over and over again. They are unlikely, but till the end it became kind of obvious that it will happen again. Hard to explain without spoilers. Watch it, it's absolutely worth it, and you'll see what I'm talking about. In the scenario, some conflicts would be easier to solve by negotiating instead of risking everything and fighting. Kind of a disappointment from the characters."

I admit I'm not a huge fan of Cruise's - I find him a handsome but external actor.

Another film that showcased him well was ""Collateral,"" where he played a cold-blooded hit man.<br/><br/>Non-stop action will keep you absorbed.

Cruise's consistency as Ethan Hunt doesn't detract from the character's relative lack of development though, although, there was more screen time and attention given to the rest of the crew this time, a welcome change from the film's predecessors. Plausability: Definitely Deniable. Entertainment Value: Impossibly unlikeable"
"moviemanMA","8","1","2","21 December 2011"," Merry Cruise-mas!
","Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is a fun, exciting, and one of the coolest films of the year. It has guns, gadgets, explosions, sex appeal (for men and women), stunning locations, one of the best stunt performances by an actor of all time, and a finale that is so ludicrous it's hard to dislike.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt, IMF's top agent. After breaking out of a Russian prison, he and his team (Paula Patton and Simon Pegg) are sent into the Moscow Kremlin to search for nuclear launch codes. When their plans are botched by another party (codename: Cobalt), an explosion in the building points all fingers at the US. Hunt and his team are deemed terrorists, though the Secretary of State gives them some ""incentive"" to continue their mission and find Cobalt before the launch codes are used.<br/><br/>Hunt, Jane (Patton), Benji (Pegg), and newly acquired Brandt (Jeremy Renner) search the globe for Cobalt, intercepting messages, causing chaos, etc. There's a lot of running around (this is a Tom Cruise movie, right?) and a lot of jaw dropping stunts (honestly jaw dropping) to help keep you engaged. The climax of the film is so intense you will really start to believe that this mission is without a doubt impossible. Just when you think things will work out, the stakes get higher.<br/><br/>I guess I forgot how impossible the missions really are. I was skeptical when they said ""nuclear launch codes,"" at the beginning of the film. That might work for a cold war era James Bond movie, but this far off from that era makes it sound a little corny. After a while though I bought into it. The REAL winner of this film is the action.<br/><br/>Nothing goes to waste. There isn't a punch, kick, or jump that is thrown in just because it looks cool. Every fight, every sprint, and every explosion happens for a reason. To aid the action is a fantastic effort by stunt choreographers, performers, and yes, Tom Cruise himself. After watching some behind the scenes featurettes, I can assure you that what you see is pretty unbelievable. I thought Tom was sorta crazy for a number of reasons, but this film puts him over the edge (only this time in a ""Oh my God did he just do that/that was totally awesome!"" sort of crazy).<br/><br/>The locations are fantastic, the action intense, and the drama over the top. I thought I was going to have a hard time buying into the impossibility of the mission, but I totally bought it. There were a few moments when I honestly thought, ""How are they going to get out of this?"" You'll have to see it for yourself. It's outstanding. Quite possibly the most exciting film of the year other than Rango."
"LloydBayer","7","1","2","21 December 2011"," Best in the franchise but miles behind a true espionage thriller.
","At the risk of sounding biased, I must say that I have never been a true Tom Cruise fan; at least not entirely. There are two reasons for this. One ̶ I am yet to see a really inspiring movie with Cruise in the lead, other than ""Jerry Maguire"". Sure, crazed fans will hit back with the multi-Oscar winning ""Rain Man"", but let's not forget, even for a moment, that Dustin Hoffman owned that movie. Two ̶ I can't recall a movie where Cruise has not played a cocky, or egotistical character. Right from a hotshot 'Maverick' fighter pilot to a self righteous vampire to a pompous Washington DC senator, Cruise has hardly ever stepped out of a 'cool zone' of his own making. Heck, for that matter, off-screen and he really pushes the envelope- ask Oprah Winfrey or David Letterman! With the Mission Impossible franchise, Cruise remains the actor we know him to be and doesn't budge. Reprising his role as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, Cruise is back for another trip around the globe complete with made-to-order disguises, hi-tech gadgetry and a team of specialists to work with. <br/><br/>Following a botched mission in Moscow, Hunt and his team are implicated in the bombing of the Kremlin while trying to identify the whereabouts of 'Cobalt' ̶ an international nuclear arms dealer. Initiating 'Ghost Protocol' or a period of Black Ops contingency, The US President disavows IMF as an organization, leaving Hunt and a team of newly promoted field agents to clear the agency's name while simultaneously averting a cold war crisis between Russia and the United States. With the secretary killed, Hunt and his team are now rogue agents with limited resources, immunity and equipment and the last hope in preventing a nuclear strike on the United States.<br/><br/>For an espionage thriller, this latest installment is a high octane thrill ride right from the opening scene and doesn't let go till the end. Screenwriters André Nemec and Josh Appelbaum keep the plot fairly simple (actually absurdly simple) where Cruise is supported by the voluptuous Paula Patton as Agent Jane Carter, Jeremy Renner as intelligence analyst William Brandt and funnyman Simon Pegg as the team's technical expert. With the fast pacing and extravagant styling throughout, there is little time for performance gauging of the above mentioned actors. However, Nemec and Appelbaum's story is well punctuated with ample moments that Pegg pulls off with ease. For this reviewer, adding comic moments in an otherwise high tension thriller and having Pegg execute those scenes are some of the areas where this film excels over the earlier installments and other spy thrillers. Renner and Patton add individual finesse while building unique contributions towards the plot. As I said before, Cruise is in his own element and you get to see him play another tailor-made character for the umpteenth time. There are disappointments, and my main concerns are weak characters penned for pivotal areas of the plot structure. What worked for J.J Abrams' directorial of MI3 was the dark story and an even darker villain played by the academy Award winning Philip Seymour Hoffman. Sadly, Michael Nvqvist as Hendricks, AKA Cobalt, is never daunting as the nuclear armed criminal mastermind. Playing a telecommunications tycoon cum notorious playboy, Anil Kapoor is not only miscast, his short role is a big disappointment, an unfunny joke and a huge cliché reiterating that Indian romance movies is about running around trees to seduce a woman. Like his overrated role in ""Slumdog Millionaire"", casting Kapoor in this film is another example of why Hollywood can never blend with Bollywood, despite individual world appeal. <br/><br/>All said and done, the real star of the movie is director Brad Bird for making this movie the most appealing as the latest but fourth part of the franchise. Coming from a world of animated films like the Oscar winning ""Ratatouille"" and ""Up"", MI4: Ghost Protocol is Bird's first live action movie as director and has done a good job in the process. Cinematography is easily the biggest visual treat with never-before-seen angles of the Burj Khalifa, some aerial views of the Kremlin and exotic locales of Mumbai and Bangalore. Close quarter fight scenes are also well choreographed considering this is Bird's first live action film and gives these scenes the look and feel of a Jason Bourne or James Bond movie. Although visual effects are top notch without going overboard, I do feel (SPOILER ALERT) the sandstorm sequence is a bit over the top as I have never seen such a huge wave of dust in the city, in all the years I have had the pleasure of living in Dubai. <br/><br/>Produced by J.J Abrams and co-produced by Tom Cruise, Bird takes this latest installment to unprecedented levels as not only the best film in the series but also as one of 2011's above average action thrillers. As filming was done largely using the IMAX format, this film is best viewed in cinemas either on IMAX or conventional screens. Given the overall production value, the cult following behind the franchise, the 'Dubai' factor along with other brand endorsements, there is a very good chance this film will remain in cinemas longer than usual; or at least until every Dubai resident has seen this movie at least once."
"Joshwahr","9","1","2","21 December 2011"," A Film Obsessive's Review of ""Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol""
","Let's start this off by saying that I'm reviewing ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" with my fan-boy goggles firmly on. I went and saw it at the advanced screening on Wednesday the 14th of December 2011 at Hoyts cinemas, Frankston in their EXTREME Screen. I am a huge fan of the Mission: Impossible franchise, except for MI2... Let's just pretend that John Woo never tainted the series with his over-stylized, horribly geographically incorrect and bordering on racist film.<br/><br/>But MI2 is not the reason why we're here! After the series reclaimed it's original panache with J.J. Abrams' MI3, we're now treated with ""Mission: Impossible (4) - Ghost Protocol."" I put the number four in brackets because whilst this is the fourth film in the series, they've decided to go against the numbering in the film titles and give it a flashy new name with ""Ghost Protocol.""<br/><br/>The latest adventure see's Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) in his biggest and nigh-on impossible mission to date. The film kicks off with Agent Hanaway (Josh Holloway from ""Lost"") murdered by an attractive assassin named Sabine Moreau (Lea Sydoux) for a document containing Russian nuclear missile codes, which she intends to sell to a terrorist known only as ""Cobalt"" (Michael Nyqvist from ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" series). <br/><br/>Hunt and his team are sent into the Kremlin to retrieve files identifying Cobalt and this ensues in a very cool, but tense scene in which Hunt and Benjy Dunn (Simon Pegg) hide behind a cloaking sheet as they infiltrate the Kremlin archives. But alas Cobalt was there already and he sets off a bomb in the Kremlin, framing Hunt and his team as the perpetrators. To the Russians, this is an undeclared act of war by the United States and the IMF is shut down and ""Ghost Protocol"" is initiated, which basically means the entire agency is disavowed.<br/><br/>From here on in, Hunt and his team are tasked with catching Cobalt, stopping his plans of world destruction and clearing their names. All in a day's work for Ethan Hunt!<br/><br/>They travel from Russia, to India, to Dubai where Hunt must perform a death defying climb on the outside of the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building. Tom Cruise actually did this crazy stunt! He does all his own stunts and he's nearly 50 years old!!! Actors of today need to take a lesson or two from Mr. Cruise, no need for CGI just go out there and do it for real! It looks much more authentic and real if you actually do a stunt, rather than jump in front of a green screen. Hence why director Brad Bird chose to shoot the film in IMAX, not 3D on Tom Cruise's insistence. Bird says ""It truly immerses the audience. It's really bright, it's really sharp. Big, bright images: they are worth a lot. If your star is going to climb up the outside of a building for real, then I kinda feel as a director, you have a duty to show it.""<br/><br/>Ghost Protocol is Brad Bird's live action directorial debut, with his previous films being animations (The Incredibles, The Iron Giant & Ratatouille). And I must say, he did a bloody fantastic job! I love my movies big and stylish, and Bird delivered on both these fronts. The action is big and stylish, but not stupidly over the top like in John Woo's films. Yet still realistic, but not destroyed by shaky camera like in a Paul Greengrass film. This is a beautiful movie, the cinematography is utterly gorgeous, adding to the slick and stylish nature of the film.<br/><br/>My only two criticisms of Ghost Protocol are;<br/><br/>Whilst the film has a bad guy, he isn't really an arch-enemy for Hunt like Phillip Seymore- Hoffman was in MI3. Michael Nyqvist is a brilliant actor, and the writers could've done so much more with his character, instead of killing him off, he could've returned in another Mission film to make life even more difficult for Tom Cruise. But I guess that wouldn't have worked as each film is directed by a different director who brings their own style to the series, so it could've impeded too much on the next director's choices in how he directs the film (If there is a next one, that is...).<br/><br/>The second is the nuclear missile which Ethan Hunt stops moments before it crashes into San Francisco. It would've exploded before it got to where it was when Hunt hit the disarm button. Typically, nuclear missiles are air-burst weapons, which means they actually explode in the air above the target. This is to increase the effectiveness of the explosion and push the nuclear blast further so that it is not obstructed by things such as large, heavy buildings. And come on, the missile is moments from collision! Talk about last minute much?<br/><br/>To sum up, Ghost Protocol has made me remember why I go to the cinemas to see movies and why I want to be a director. Movies are about entertainment and escapism, and if you can keep an audience captivated for 133 minutes you've done your job. And that is exactly what Brad Bird has done with ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"". He transported me for 133 minutes into the world of Ethan Hunt and his team, where the mission is bigger than ever, and the stakes are higher than ever! I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would go and see it again and again and again!<br/><br/>My rating for ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" is: 9.5/10<br/><br/>The link below is to my blog where the original review can be found: http://joshwahr.blogspot.com"

","Here's another Mission impossible movie. Tom Cruise is trying SO hard to please the audience. And every time he seems to come up a little short. MI2 was just pathetic and MI3 suffers the same problem as Ghost protocol. See below! :) <br/><br/>The action and the production in this movie is great. You can tell they put in a lot of time creating good action scenes that doesn't seem to stop. They just keep going and going and sometimes that's enough to make you say ""Jeeeeeesus Christ""! And there's plenty of good humor. Sometimes in one liners - mostly coming from Simon Peggs character Benji. But there's also some humor in the action scenes.<br/><br/>But why bother? Most of the actors are good but not even Tom Cruise himself seems to be very inspired even though this is his pet project! The characters are just vehicles for the action and I don't really care about any of them. Even though they try to add a little depth with some story it never takes off.<br/><br/>The action scenes are intense but they're always over the top. Sure this is mission impossible. But when everything is REALLY hard all the time, when EVERYTHING goes wrong, and the movie is REALLY exciting all the time but they somehow win anyway...you stop caring. There's very little holding this movie together. In fact, the action scenes are a bit like separate movies in themselves. They move from from one part of the world to the next where new action scenes takes place. And since the plot IS the actionthe movie becomes shattered!! It's a bit like James Bond. Or rathertries to be like James Bond. And even though I'm quite entertained for the moment it just doesn't add up. It's all a bit too polished. Ethan Hunt will never be James Bond who is truly a psychopath! A killer! A womanizer! A man with a dark mind and a sordid past. In comparison Ethan Hunt is nothing but a smiling do gooder who wants to save the world like the true boy scout he is.<br/><br/>Also Mikael Nyqvist disappoints as the villain. I know him from Swedish movies and he talks!! He says his lines but he never acts... which is a pity! He's almost not in the picture anyway and you have to wonder about the motives of his character. His actions are incongruent and ultimately...completely pointless!<br/><br/>I was entertained and I might watch Ghost Protocol again just for the hell of it. But it's no classic! With this kind of production I expect much more. 5/10 stars."

","This movie is not junk. It even has some engaging moments. The problem is the story - it has about as much substance as mush. This story is so simplistic and cartoon-like that it can't be taken seriously and since the movie is not a comedy, that is a problem. An action-thriller does not need to be shallow. Also, the story lacks plausibility. Now, the acting is good and Tom Cruise gives a credible performance, but he doesn't carry the movie. The other actors have to pitch in and they dominate the movie. When Tom Cruise is dangling 2,000 feet in the air and the audience is snickering, that means the movie has a problem because that scene is not meant to instill laughter, and besides the audience already knows that his character will live, so what's the point? Also, the story's plot is ridiculous, especially how it vilifies the Russians, which is really ridiculous, especially given the current international political environment. The movie has a lot of action scenes and moves at a brisk pace, but that's all the is, and that just isn't enough to make the movie worth watching."

","The first scene of Mission Impossible 4 features the niftiest spy gadget ever- a pellet sized object, which, when it hits the ground becomes a full size mattress to cushion the impact of a 50 feet fall, also allowing the opportunity to the agent to take down assailants during the fall. You know from that scene on that you are in for a very special ""cruise"". <br/><br/>Apologies for the pun, but Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is an impossibly fast film, so much so that the first time you get to time to think is around the halfway mark, when Tom Cruise successfully scales up and down the world's tallest building, manages to switch diamonds and nuclear codes, takes on a sandstorm of epic proportions only to let his nemesis slip out of his hand. While we all saw this coming as there were more minutes to the movie, what is special here is the relentless, adrenalin charged pace.<br/><br/>The plot's wafer-thin and incredulous itself- a demented Hendricks (played by Michael Nyqvist), wants to annihilate the world so that it can start all over again, and hence is in earnest need of some nukes. And all that stands between his quest and world obliteration is Ethan Hunt and his cronies. And what a fun gang is this one- Tom Cruise might have been stereotyped earlier in his career as a chocolate hero, but this series has infused fresh life in him, making him a stupendous action star despite his diminutive proportions. Even at 50, he proves he can give the young upstarts a run for their money with his kicks, punches, and manic chases. Paula Patton's Agent Jane is chameleon-esque- deadly one moment, and sexy vixen the other. Simon Pegg's Benji keeps all of us smiling, while brooding Jeremy Renner maybe an Academy Award nominated star, but here he does let down his hair a bit in the second half to go with the unbelievable flow. <br/><br/>The world is the playground for our heroes as the movie, which starts at Budapest, involves a jailbreak somewhere in Russia, an explosion in Kremlin, a lengthy chase sequence on top of the 830 mts Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, climaxes somewhere unnamed that the director wants us to believe is India, and ends quietly in the US.<br/><br/>""Blue is glue and red is dead"", says Benji as he hands over a pair of spiderman gloves to Cruise for a gravity defying, heart in the mouth stunt sequence in the movie, which perhaps bests all in 2011. In fact the entire movie is a showcase for technology- cool gadgets, prototype BMWs, and adds a heady concoction of action in the form of death-defying stunts, fisticuffs, martial arts displays, gunfights, car and foot chases.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the weaknesses- as in most Hollywood action thrillers, everything is sacrificed at the altar of entertainment, with plans and super-plans executed to perfection with impeccable timing, and things going wrong only when the director decides to make life slightly difficult for our intrepid heroes. Anil Kapoor's ""Hollywood"" purported career defining role is perhaps the worst role he has taken up in his stellar resume, its worse than his turn in Tashan ;) And why the need of the India angle is any of the scenes were not going to be shot here? But the biggest flaw would be casting a dramatic actor of Nyqvist's stature in a pure action villain role. Check his intensity out in the Millennium trilogy and you will see what I mean.<br/><br/>Director Brad Bird has incredible credentials indeed, for afterall he directed the Pixar superhit The Incredibles, in addition to the charmingly funny Ratatouille, and what his animation background brings to the table is vivid imagination, so useful in filming the spellbinding action sequences.<br/><br/>To round off, Mission Impossible 4 is not only perfect weekend fare, by shaking and stirring some Bond and Bourne, it raises the bar for big budget action thrillers...Don't fiddle away your time this weekend, go watch,MI-4 and thank me for it later :)"

","This movie is definitely worth a watch.

"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","8","11 January 2012"," Contains One of the Greatest Action Scenes Ever Filmed
","Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol (2011) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>The fourth film in the franchise finds Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) having to clear IMF's name after they're implicated in a deadly bombing in Russia. Soon the agent and his team are trying to track down a madman who has bought some nuclear codes and plans on starting a nuclear war. MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL falls a tad bit short from the third film in the series but it's still one of the best action films to come along in a very long time. Unlike the first two movies in the series, this one and the previous didn't deliver confusing story lines instead they gave us a story that we could follow and some of the most amazing action scenes in the history of cinema. There's a sequence in the middle of this film where Cruise must climb on the outside of the Burj Khalifa building, the world's tallest, and what follows is simply spell-bounding and will have you on the edge of your seats. I'm not 100% certain how they did the stunt but this entire sequence contains one bit of suspense after another and I can't help but think that in future film school classes that they will break this scene apart, study the editing and cinematography and it will become a thing of legend. Yes, that's very high praise but I'd love to hear from someone other than a troll who wasn't impressed by this entire sequence. The only negative thing about this sequence is that it's never topped in the following hour and it somewhat leads the ending a little bit of a letdown because it doesn't quite reach the same level of intensity. With that said, this is an exceptionally good action film that contains the nice story and great action and of course we're given several characters that we care for. Cruise jumps back to the top with some terrific stunts and that excellent performance is always here. The supporting cast includes some wonderful work by Hunt's team, which includes Jeremy Renner, Paula Patton and Simon Pegg. Michael Nygvist is good as the bad guy but I think the character falls a bit short of previous film villains. Still, if you want action and a good time I doubt you're going to find a better place than with this film."
"quinnox-1","6","2","8","2 January 2012"," Not bad
","Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol is a decent action movie/spy thriller (even with an odd title that sounds like some kind of video game) but not something necessarily to see in the theater, would make a good DVD rental I think.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise stars once again but this time with a slimmed down team of only a few associates, with a hackneyed plot about some mad man who wants to set off a nuclear war by launching a nuke and hoping a chain reaction will occur. Really? How unoriginal can they get. Come on already. Surely they could have come up with something fresher than this.<br/><br/>Despite the boring villain and retread plot, the movie shows off exotic locations in a nice panorama and the action scenes are on the whole pretty good, but not mind blowing. Tom Cruise still has star power, but the other actors in this film came off as dull to me and their characters were a letdown. I didn't really care about any of the characters except Ethan Hunt. To sum up - M:I 4 is worth a rental, but not something required to rush out and see right now."

","Went for this movie yesterday with not much expectation. Was an enjoyable flick and a good time pass. But, there were too many down sides..<br/><br/>I'll talk about the good part first: (1) The beginning of the movie was very catchy to keep you hooked on for the next 133 minutes.. (2) Simon Pegg was very hilarious with his British accent in an American movie. His facial expressions were too funny!.. (3) The scenes inside Kremlin and the explosion were very well made.. (4) Every moment of the Burj Khalifa scene was WOW!<br/><br/>Now for the down side: (1) The sand storm in Dubai was a bit hard to believe and the CGI looked fake.. (2) The chase scene after Burj Khalifa showed a different Dubai with people living inside mud houses. It looked very fake.. (3) The classic mask was almost missing in this movie!! We would've preferred to see Tom Cruise wear it rather than the villain.. (4) Almost all scenes in India seemed as a set or made up.. I would definitely like to see a parking place like that in Mumbai!.. (5) Tom Cruise looked aged in the movie.. (6) They could've chosen someone better looking than Paula Patton! Reminded me of Thandie Newton in MI2.. (7) I wish the main villain was Léa Seydoux.. She definitely would've made a better villain than Michael Nyqvist.. (8) Anil Kapoor was good.. But towards the end, his reactions seemed weird!?<br/><br/>What worked: Stunt scenes, Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg What didn't work: Lengthy dialogues, weak villain Would I watch it again: Probably on bluray for the Burj Khalifa scene.<br/><br/>Overall: A good movie to wind up the year, but there were better. I would still rate MI3 the best of the lot."

","When i came out of the hall after watching this movie, i asked myself ""Is it an IMPOSSIBLE MISSION to throughly entertain me?"" My brain and heart answered ""NO"", so why was I not through;y entertained by this latest MI franchise movie? Simple there were very few Crazy Impossible Action Scenes, something like fulcrum in 3rd edition. OK the IMF have digitalized and upgraded themselves, to the extent that the Bond franchise will feel the competition, but what made the MI franchise diff from others was the Action sequence. There were a few OK types action scenes and none of them will make you jump from your seats moreover there is a little overdose of light humorous scenes. My opinion its just another action movie and nothing to do with Mission Impossible."

","I do not even ask how such a stupid movie could make so much money. I'm only interested in why this film is loved by so many people. And why everyone considers him the best ""Mission Impossible"" part. Did you all forget the third film? Anyway, the movie is as stupid as if a five year old had written the screenplay, all plot sort of looks absolutely the same as if the studio had only three sets available, the stereo typical characters in this movie are so embarrassing even Walt Disney itself I would be ashamed and the comic relief if you can call it that way I was totally on the pointer. Of course, not everything was terrible the climbing scenes on the skyscraper was wonderful. And some fights were good. But the whole movie is full of decisions where I had to take my head and screamed out loud why? And the pacing is crap, really cheap so that every five minutes to 99% in the movie I knew what happened next, that's not exciting. (The remaining 1% were just filming stupidity) There are movies you do not like but at least you can understand why other people love it. These movies just do not irritate you but all things you do not like irritate other people. However, this is a movie where it's not just about me personally, but it's about really technical mistakes. This movie is a poorly composed puzzle. (With missing pieces) And I can not understand, I really, really can not understand why this movie pleases people; and that he pleases just so many people disgusts me."

Aside from that, this also more than makes its bones as an argument for why Tom Cruise should continue in this role as long as his knees, and his nerves, hold up especially for very young fans of the new generation of Mission Impossible who unfortunately never had the chance to witness the classic series back in the 1960's and the excellent remake TV series during the 80's.<br/><br/>But if young people get a chance to see the 60's TV series and the 80's remake,I think that they would find those better despite being outdated in technology for it promotes team work unlike to Tom Cruise Mission Impossible franchise that only promotes Ethan Hunt."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" (2011) is a worst movie in this franchise. By saying this, i know i will get a lot of negative thoughts as this movie is ranked the best in the franchise. Please don't get me wrong – it's not a bad movie by any means. Actually, it's the most impressive looking movie if compared to other three. It has gorgeous visuals, top notch settings and heart stopping and jaw dropping sequence with the highest building. Do why do i ranked it weakest in the series? It because of couple of things. First, there is no dread, no suspense in this movie, except for one sequence i already mentioned. Ghost Protocol"" became more family friendly and it's not a coincidence that it was released during holiday season movie. Every good action movie has to got good villain, unfortunately Ghost Protocol"" lacks a true villain, there is only one Russian general who want's to destroy the world. Really? And i don't even wan't to go into a details of scene in which Tom Cruise enters Kremlin with fake mustache and worst accent ever – it's beyond sci-fi. During the whole movie i wasn't interested in plot or where did main characters were going next – it's how uninvolved this movie was.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" is impressively looking empty auctioneer without a simple treat – it's has cool looking plastic"" action scenes and no intrigue at all. This is the most disappointing chapter in of of the best action series ever."

The President is forced to invoke Ghost Protocol and disavow IMF. Ethan is attacked and escapes with analyst William Brandt (Jeremy Renner). Ethan and team pursue Hendricks to Dubai.<br/><br/>This one is a lot more fun and the best of the franchise. It is a new high point which is rare for 4 movies in. The more prominent use of Simon Pegg allow to inject more humor to break up the action. The story is like a well written Bond movie. This is Bond with a team and I like this team. I like the seriousness of the sexy Paula Patton. Pegg is great. Jeremy Renner is playing a little against type. This is just a well made thriller highlighted by some amazing set up pieces."

The one thing I noticed is he is short 5ft 7. Not as short as Robert Redford 5ft 5...(had to put that in).<br/><br/>I agree with another reviewer the most frightening villain by far was the woman assassin Lea Seydoux as Sabine Moreau.<br/><br/>They could have chopped all the chicification parts...especially the last 3 minutes where Cruise's exwife appears. Melodrama doesn't mix with killer thrillers in fact it ruins them.<br/><br/>The story: A crazy Swede wants to start WWIII and IMF wants to stop him...I thought the initial prison scenes were the best and most funny.

","The fourth entry in the popular Mission: Impossible series apparently not only defied my own expectations, but defied most of the general population's. I won't lie, but I thoroughly enjoyed the first three films. I had no idea that the Ghost Protocol would be this good. First off, the director, Brad Bird had no experience with live-action scenes so I wasn't expecting much. But he did a commendable job. Secondly, the stunts are amazing! Tom Cruise does all his stunts and I want to know how he achieved scaling the walls of the tallest building in the world. That is very incredible.<br/><br/>After a prison breakout in Russia, Ethan Hunt, his computer whiz Benji, an attractive agent Jane, and chief analyst William Brandt all join together to stop Kurt Hendricks from creating a nuclear war between Russia and the United States.<br/><br/>The acting is really good. We all know what to expect from Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt and he is better than ever. Simon Pegg added some good comedy. Jeremy Renner is becoming a star and I wouldn't be surprised if he took over this franchise one day.<br/><br/>Overall, this is the best Mission: Impossible yet. The action is fluid and crisp. But the real story is the physics-defying stunts and the transition Brad Bird made from animation to live-action. I would love if he came back if any additional films are being made.

It had a little bit of everything in it. That is what I like to see in a movie. If it is an action movie, I want to see more that just action. Can I see a little comedy, and drama in it as well? This is kind of how Ghost Protocal went. Not going to give anything away, but it had some great scenes in the movie. It's not really a ""Must Watch"" movie, but if you ever find yourself bored, give a try. Whoever did the cast was good. The actors did a fantastic job and actually fit the part.

This time agent Ethan Hunt is after a criminal that blew up the Kremlin and stole nuclear launch codes. Him and his team track him down without the President's approval, hence the title, ghost protocol. The plot was easy to follow and not filled with holes. There was still some BS stunts, like Hunt flinging himself on a tall building, releasing his rope, and landing where the missing window was and being pulled to safety.

"brando647","9","1","3","24 July 2012"," The Best Mission in the Series
","It's strange. I'm never excited when I hear that there are plans to release a new movie in the Mission: Impossible franchise. As far as action franchises go, I've seen and enjoyed all of them, but I can never be bothered to muster any excitement as a new one makes its way to theaters. I guess there's just something wrong with me because they're only getting better. I was worried that GHOST PROTOCOL, released five years after the third movie and rumored to be a ""passing of the torch"" from Tom Cruise to rising star Jeremy Renner, was just a cash grab to keep a profitable franchise alive as they transition away from the aging Cruise. I was so very wrong and realized this within minutes of sitting down to watch the movie. As the latest mission begins, Ethan Hunt is busted out of a Russian prison just in time to reteam with IMF on its latest assignment. Nuclear launch codes were stolen by an assassin during a routine mission and are believed to have fallen into the hands of an extremist known only as Cobalt. Cobalt is believed to be a former Swedish physicist that believes there will come a time when the human race will be devastated and ultimately strengthened by a catastrophic event. He intends to expedite the process through nuclear annihilation and, to keep IMF on his trail, he frames the organization in bombing the Russian Kremlin. Ghost Protocol is initiated and IMF is disbanded; it's up to Hunt and his team to stop Cobalt from following through with his plan while at the same time clearing IMF's name in the bombing.<br/><br/>The M:I series is fast becoming a new 007 series; each movie is helmed by a new director with his own vision and Cruise's character of Ethan Hunt it beginning to be phased out in favor of Jeremy Renner as the new hero. I imagine, as the series progresses, we'll be treated to an infinite stream of IMF agents as actors come and go, and each movie will have it's own style with each director's new take on the series. If I'm right and that's the case, I support it 100%. I have not been disappointed yet and GHOST PROTOCOL proves that the series, and Tom Cruise, haven't lost any steam. The fourth film in the M:I series ramps up the action, set pieces, and stunts and manages to include enough character development to keep it from beginning a totally shallow action piece. Ethan Hunt and William Brandt (Renner) have there own story going on underneath the surface with a connection from the past that isn't totally revealed until the end of the movie, and Jane Carter (Paula Patton) is battling her own demons as she finds herself conflicted between her personal feelings and her duty to IMF when her lover is murdered in the opening mission. Hunt is merely the duty-bound hero and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg, returning) is the comic relief, but there is enough story present without over-developing them.<br/><br/>Director Brad Bird, primarily known for his work in animated features, steps up to helm the fourth film of the series and proves he's down for the challenge by making the best M:I movie so far. As I mentioned, the action and stunts are amped up here with amazing sequences including Hunt scaling the side of the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, and a killer chase through the middle of a sandstorm. The movie is a tad over two hours long but you never feel the length because it never slows down. From the opening mission in Budapest to the final credits roll, the pace never lets up for more than a moment and story bits are fed in gradually between action set pieces to keep you interested in the characters. Michael Nyqvist (from the Swedish Millennium series) is the new villain, Cobalt/Kurt Hendricks. He's a cold-calculating sociopath who never goes overboard, monologues, or hams it up. He's a man who truly believes that he is doing the world a favor by trying to jump start nuclear war. Despite my disinterest in the movie leading up to release, it became one of my favorite blockbusters of 2011. Cruise may be a lunatic in his private life but I can't hate him when he's back on screen as Ethan Hunt. While this may be the beginning of a transition between lead actors, Cruise is still very much in command here and I hope we get another mission or two out of him before Renner officially takes over."

","Anyone having seen prior installments of Tom Cruise's ""Mission Impossible"" series would have simple expectations for ""Ghost Protocol"". Despite the redundancy of both the 2nd and 3rd installments, all of the films, in varying degrees, have managed to satisfy my desire for smart action and minimal interruption. After renting ""Ghost Protocol"" via my cable provider, my only regret is not having paid the extra $5 to see it on the big screen.<br/><br/>There are few surprises, which ultimately is a good thing; nobody really wants a proved formula to be messed with too much, no matter what they say. That's not to say that specific formulas are immune to the dregs of repetitive redundancy, of course. This film's saving grace is undoubtedly the amount of time that came between it and the last installment in the series.<br/><br/>The film itself builds in predictable fashion, into a rather ""safe"" plot line. In it, an evil man with an evil henchman attempt to bring about the end of the world in typical fashion (nuclear devastation), and the only people who can do anything about it are Ethan Hawk (Cruise) and his unlikely but strong supporting cast. A cast that brings a dose of comedy relief and bumbling technical prowess (Simon Pegg), a capable woman who's as gorgeous as she is dangerous (Paula Patton) and a mysterious, unproven asset (Jeremy Renner) who is thrown into the mix rather abruptly, to say the least. The casting was well done, as those who spend the most time on screen command the camera and show both their ability to manage both action and the occasional dose of suspense-building narrative.<br/><br/>""Ghost Protocol"" rarely lets up, letting the viewer catch his breath in predictable spots as the film unfolds in a manner that leaves you expecting twists and turns and getting them, just perhaps not in the order and/or fashion you thought you saw coming. This combination of fast-paced intensity and subtle, but satisfying reveals and climaxes are the meat and potatoes of Cruise's impossible missions, and not since the original has one of them hit the mark like ""Ghost Protocol"". As long as you're not expecting more than the previous installments offered, you won't be disappointed with this mission."
"jonnyfendi","7","1","3","15 May 2012"," Enjoyable Pure Action Movie
","Light the fuse! Ethan Hunt was the one who ignited the fuse. What I remember most from Ethan Hunt's character is that he was the man who killed Jim Phelps! Yes, ""Mission: Impossible"" (1966-1973) was a successful intelligent TV show, Jim Phelps (originally played by Peter Graves) was the leader of thiz highly sophisticated covert team, his charismatic presence had already become a trademark for thiz franchise. Then suddenly, in 1996, Tom Cruise who coming from nowhere, bought thiz franchise and killed Jim Phelps and replaced it with himself as the invincible super whiz named Ethan hunt. At that time, I was very mad and I thought all the fans would do the same. But now, after three previous movies ""Mission: Impossible"" (1996), ""Mission: Impossible II"" (2000), ""Mission: Impossible III"" (2006), including thiz last one, they seem to gradually transform thiz franchise to be a pure action movie, even though still with ultra-cool high tech gadgets. Not just the attractive gadgets, but also high-octane adrenaline stunts, just like thiz time Tom Cruise attempts to climb the world's tallest building ever made so far, Burj Khalifa in Dubai. I heard that most of the dangerous stunts were done by Cruise himself. Thiz time, Ethan Hunt forms a smaller team comprising sexy, seductive and extremely lethal Jane Carter (Paula Patton), humorous computer genius Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and the mysterious co-agent William Brandt (Jeremy Renner). Its mission is to retrieve the nuclear launch codes before it gets into the wrong hands of international terrorists. In the process, instead, they are accused of masterminding the Kremlin bombing. Now the IMF is disavowed and they are forced to invoke Ghost Protocol, which means they are all alone with the limited resources they have. The Director is Brad Bird who is most renowned as one of the fathers of Pixar animation studios. Thiz is his first live-action movie after successful animations like ""The Incredibles"" (2004) and ""Ratatouille"" (2007). By the way, in 2012, Brad Bird's other colleague Andrew Stanton also will be directing another live-action movie entitled ""John Carter"". Coincidence? Maybe. I have to admit that thiz movie has consistent paces since the first minute. I note that Tom Cruise repeats at least three specific actions that he has done in previous movies. The first is running from an explosion behind him, the second is climbing the iconic skyscrapers and the last one is taking cover when he is almost crushed by a car! Although it's a kind of repetition, but oh yeah we still enjoy so much.As time goes by, it seems to be ""Mission: Impossible"" has transformed into pure action movie! The only thing left now is its famous instrumental theme song, or maybe the latex face mask, you must know what I mean. Other than that, thiz movie has always been Tom Cruise's playground. Personally, I'm just OK with that, as long as thiz franchise can maintain its winning formula which is non-stop explosive action scenes. That's all from me.

","Ethan Hunt a member of the Impossible Missions Force (IMF)and his team race against time to stop a nuclear war before they are arrested for a terrorist attack on the Kremlin.<br/><br/>Ghost Protocol is packed with plenty of spy espionage, double crossings, drama, disguises and action (pretty much what the original series renowned for). While the plot is a pretty standard affair it's the leading cast that make Protocol so appetizing, the dialogue is witty, the characters have great interaction and the set ups are less than predicable with lots of things not going as smooth as the character would like.<br/><br/>Stunning Paula Patton is a strong actor and handles the action wonderfully. Tom Cruise's stunt work is breathtaking. The character of Hunt is much more accessible as you watch him stew over the events of MI3. Simon Pegg provides some balanced humour. Notable is Jeremy Renner who shows he's not just a action star but a great actor. Also Léa Seydoux as Sabine Moreau and Josh Holloway as Trevor Hanaway both leave an impact in their small roles.<br/><br/>Director Brad Bird delivers some fantastic visuals, the film is a well executed production and surpasses first two instalments and equals the third in entertainment value and style. The special effects are wonderfully integrated, this coupled with a great score, polished script and great locations allow Mission Impossible 4 to stand out.<br/><br/>Overall, while lighter than the previous instalment and not as enthralling as the likes of Bourne - Protocol is a impressive piece of entertainment."
"TxMike","Null","1","3","5 May 2012"," Yeah, we really enjoyed this movie, great action in an almost impossible mission.
","You know after a while the actual plot of these 'Mission Impossible' movies isn't really that important. I doubt that any of us really care that much about the story. We enjoy these movies, if we enjoy them at all, for the stupefying action and the highly improbably escapes from what seems like sure disaster.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise of course is back as Ethan Hunt, the absolute best I.M.F agent. And even though he is close to turning 50 (later in 2012) he still does most of his stunts and can run with the best of them. Here the mission becomes to stop a terrorist who wants to start a nuclear war, that will deplete all civilizations equally, because he figures that will allow humanity a fresh start.<br/><br/>The pretty girl this time is Paula Patton as Jane Carter. (Is that a take-off from John Carter??) I was not already familiar with her body of work but she turns out quite good for this role. Another member of the team is Brit Simon Pegg as computer expert Benji Dunn. And the fourth is Jeremy Renner as William Brandt.<br/><br/>The villain is Michael Nyqvist (of 'Dragon Tattoo' fame) as Kurt Hendricks .<br/><br/>Can you guess if the I.M.F. team succeeds to get the codes and disarm the nuclear device right before it destroys San Francison? Hint ... San Francisco is still there! Good entertainment, even though ti runs over 2 hours it was thrilling all the way through."

","Not to be taken for granted; your expectations are amped as Tom Cruise returns as IMF Agent Ethan Hunt in this fourth installment of the Mission:Impossible franchise. Notable Brad Bird directs this action/adventure with vigor. ""Ghost Protocol"" goes into effect after the agency is blamed for a terrorist bombing of the Kremlin. Hunt is left out in the cold and must gather a new team consisting of Jeremy Renner, Paula Patton and Simon Pegg to clear the name of the Agency. Hunt suspects members of the new team may have individual agendas; but the group must trust each other to complete a mission with practically no resources or backup. Exceptional scenery and special effects; and becoming the norm, Cruise does his own stunts. But then this project happens to be the highest-grossing film of Mr. Cruise's career. Kudos to cinematographer Robert Elswit. The cast also features: Samuli Edelmann, Michael Nyquist, Lea Seydoux, Josh Holloway and Goran Navojec. You can't accuse this movie of being bland...just pure adrenaline...on steroids."
"nickmesafilms","9","1","3","22 April 2012"," Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol (2011) - Take the Mission, If You Choose to Accept It!
","The fourth installment of the Mission: Impossible franchise, adapted from the original television series of the same name, ""Ghost Protocol"" stars Tom Cruise, reprising his role as Agent Ethan Hunt, who has been assigned on one of his biggest missions yet. After an accidental attack that bombs and destroys the Kremlin tower in Moscow, Hunt and his team are blamed for the attack by the Russians. Then, the IMF has initiated Hunt and his team, 'Ghost Protocol'. This meaning that Hunt and his team are allowed to track down the suspects of the bombed Kremlin, but without any plan or back-up, or in other words, they're disavowed. Hunt's team includes Jeremy Renner, Paula Patton, and Simon Pegg (reprising his role as Benji, from the previous films). Together, with no back-up from the IMF, they must track down the suspects to not only clear their name, but to help defeat a plot to start a nuclear war. That's not just a ""mission difficult"", but that's a ""mission impossible"". Now, I never saw the other 'Mission: Impossible' movies, so I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy this movie, without seeing the others. When watching, there were some moments were I was just confused, and a few of my questions were left unanswered. But, I put all that baggage behind, and respected this movie for how entertaining this movie is. Directed by animation director Brad Bird, in his live-action film debut, ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" is one of the better action movies I have ever seen. The movie provides some of the most breathtaking action scenes in the history of cinema. I was drawn into the movie, on the edge of my seat, from start to finish, right when I popped in the Blu-Ray. It's totally surprising that at almost 50 years old, Tom Cruise is still doing all those crazy action sequences, especially that scene when he tries to climb a glass tower. As for the rest of the team, Paula Patton delivers the sexy charisma from inside, and Simon Pegg delivers some clever comic relief. But, it's Jeremy Renner's performance as the IMF analyst that I couldn't agree with. I felt he was miscast, lost in a movie that's more action-packed, than emotionally dramatic. The visual effects are like none I have ever seen before, and it's quite a thrill to watch, especially involving all the cool weapons and gadgets. But, the plot is kind of a hit-and-miss, and the development kind of got me confused. But, hey, there's nothing wrong with that. It's because I never saw the other movies. This is a perfectly made action movie, that's definitely worth anyone's time. But, this is the type of movie that should be seen on the biggest screen possible. Why? Because the 3-D cinematography is executed in perfect use, and it creates a thrilling feeling of enhancement. Don't even bother watching it on either a portable DVD player, or even an iPhone! ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" is an exciting and enjoyable action romp, even if there are some minor mishaps. ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"", in my review, ""fresh and exciting, an enjoyable action-packed feast""."
"saadgkhan","9","1","3","9 April 2012"," Tom Cruise is the MAN!
","Mission Impossible 4 : Ghost Protocol – CATCH IT (A) MI4 is indeed the most ambitious of all the MI movies before, this movie reinvents the whole franchise. The whole credit goes to Tom Cruise and Brad Bird to reinvent the franchise with a solid story, action and more importantly characterization. The action sequences are the highlight of the movie, every action sequence made me jump off my seat. Tom Cruise climbing the Burj Al Arab will remain the most dangerous action sequence ever done by an actor in history. There are no words to describe in this sequence. All I can Tom Cruise is the Man! Jeremy Renner is a welcome addition in the IMF, he is charming and has the potential to take over the franchise if God Forbids Tom Cruise ever decide not to return. Paula Patton is incredibly hot. Simon Pegg is hilarious. I think IMF finally got a perfect team for Ethan Hunt. Anil Kapoor, Michael Nyqvist, Samuli Edelmann & Lea Seydeux were the perfect nemesis. Overall, MI4 is one of the best heart pumping action thriller I've seen in recent and I just can't wait for MI5 with the same cast."
"JohnRayPeterson","7","1","3","6 April 2012"," It is what it is: Hollywood thrilling action
","Having seen all four of the ""Mission Impossible"" movies, I see no rhyme or reason to the ratings of each, when compared to one another. Each has something different as well as much of the same. That's why we go to see them, certainly why I did. None of the sequels had the depth of the first, plot wise. The second had a musical theme revamped and all around great soundtrack (best), which the following two failed to reuse; the effect of the soundtrack was never so well tailored. The second also started a trend that was unmistakable in all three sequels, the acrophobes know it all too well; Cruise hanging from an overhanging escarpment in The Grand Canyon(just to relax-oh yeah) and jumping from a helicopter into the air shaft of a high rise (II), pendulum swinging from one high-rise to another in Shanghai (III), face climbing the world's tallest building with a sand storm coming towards the building (IV).<br/><br/>The fourth mission, the one which garnered the highest ratings (IMDb + Rotten Tomatoes) was as good as the ones before but, in my opinion, lacked the depth of the original, plot wise, lacked the impact of the best soundtrack, but did capture all the thrill the action in the previous ones had; being mildly acrophobic, I found myself trying to catch my breath and closing my eyes for a few seconds, just long enough to muster the strength to resume watching the action.<br/><br/>I may not agree with the critics and other reviewers as to how well this sequel matches up with the others, but I can say with some certitude that if you liked any of the previous ones, you should like this one."
"s-neaverson","8","1","3","6 April 2012"," Mission Impossible just raised the bar
","Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is the most preposterous, insane and illogical film you'll see this year. Yet it's also probably the most entertaining and exhilarating, with nearly every action sequence bringing something new to the now well worn formula. Brad Bird, the director behind The Incredibles and Ratatouille, really knows his way around a story. The clever script constantly surprises and Bird never misses a beat while following the action. The story literally does not matter(which is lucky because you've seen it before) when the action is this fun. This high octane adventure will grip you from the first minute to the last. Just let yourself go and revel in 120 minutes of pure, unadulterated fun."
"razzy56","9","1","3","6 April 2012"," Best of the franchise and well worth the watch!
","Ever since I watched the Mission Impossible series on television, I had always been very eager to watch the Mission Impossible films that rolled out. The first was very good but as I watched the second and the third films, I was disappointed in how unthrilling the films were to watch. Yes, they did have plenty of action and yes, Tom Cruise's performance in each one were fantastic but there was never a sense of being satisfied.<br/><br/>As the fourth film in the franchise rolled out into the cinemas, I was reluctant to see it, thinking that maybe id be disappointed all over again.<br/><br/>However, eventually, curiosity overcame me and I finally went to watch Mission Impossible : Ghost Protocol.<br/><br/>Firstly, the plot is amazingly good. The action is better still and even the performances by all of the cast were fantastic. It even managed to provide good humour in the film! Another thing which made me pleased is that the original music was still there! At least the producers hadn't decided to discard the original music such as the likes of the recent James Bond films.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is definitely worth the watch. Forget James Bond, he doesn't even come to close to the skills of Ethan Hunt and his team!"

","Brad Bird's Live Action Directorial Debut has made a Dent in my Reality.<br/><br/>Surrounded by Exec Producer JJ Abrams team of crazy thinkers and doers, Brad has No trouble matching Directing Wits with JJ.<br/><br/>And regardless of Tom Cruise' Idiosyncratic beliefs is Alien Motherships and Thetans and such, we can allow him his inanities - Because he is one hell of an Actor and one hell of a Producer. I laugh with everyone at his shocking statements to the press, maybe Cruise is simply trying to ""Shock or Schlock"" us, maybe he likes that his insane statements generate News coverage - Hell, I don't care if he even believes in his own prattle. Regardless of that, people will Talk about Cruise after this film - Cos he's simply damn good, I've admired his acting all the way back to ""Legend"" and here he is Ethan Hunt all the way. He does things here that he's never done before, and he does them well. So I give my High Respect to Cruise, good job, damn good job!<br/><br/>This marks Cruise' Return to High Powered Action films. The Production team of Cruise/Abrams hands us one walloping good tale. Brad Bird's technocratic directing speeds us through Ethan Hunt's Disavowment and inevitable vindication in ways we've never seen before with production value unlike any of the previous MI Films.<br/><br/>Each MI Film has made references to the ones made before. In this film we herald the return of Benji (Star Trek's ""Scotty-Simon Sean of the Dead Pegg) as a full Field Agent. Along with Agent Carter (Paula Patton who was great in ""Déjà vu"") and ""Analyst Brandt"" (Jeremy Renner), the disavowed team once again save the world as we know it while nobody is the wiser.<br/><br/>There is a destruction of a Major Russian Building - So Believable, what parts were CGI and what parts were real practical Effects? I sense a Blending of the two. There is a 5 minute Chase scene through a Sand Storm - After watching the Featurette which shows how they filmed that section, it is amazing that most of the elements in the frame are real items. The scene is edited so well that we are totally fooled. That this whole thing happened in the middle of a desert during a sandstorm.<br/><br/>Cruise must like Heights - Is that building in Dubai real, is was that CGI'd? The Building reads as Real - As do Cruise High-Altitude Stunts.<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt is a combination of both ""The Competent Man"" — and Cary Grant's ""Mr. Lucky"" - But through all of Hunt's competent Stature, we can see real fear in the character's eyes-Cruise makes us believe that the man, although subject to the same uncertainties as we all, just knows by default as well as IMF Training how to ""Make his Own Luck.""<br/><br/>Because, in this film, it's not like James Bond, perfectly executing each gag with NO mistakes - Hunt makes Mistakes - His team makes mistakes, equipment does not work exactly as expected, and there are people who are just not what they seem - Hunt uses each turn of events, good or bad, ultimately for his benefit, he knows what to let go and what to pursue.<br/><br/>Now... To address the use of these iPhones, WHERE do I get one of these, and are they A5's? They've got to be Jailbroken, or at least Altered in some way by IMF. What is of interest here, is that I can relate to the use of the iPhone in this film, as I use mine for just about everything - For shopping, for driving, for watching TV or Movies, it is a remote, it locates things for me, it tells me where I am. But these iPhones even tell you who is going to kill you - Provided you get the message in time! That is the only true spoiler I'll give you.<br/><br/>One thing about these particular iPhones, some of them are slightly larger than mine. Mostly they look exactly like mine-so I love it — iPhone - The Official Phone of the IMF!"
"patyjchoi","7","1","3","4 April 2012"," Memorial work
","This movie owes a lot of its shining value to Tom Cruise. He is getting aged but his soul is backtracking when he shot the first MI. When I heard he did not accept using any stunt and did the action for himself, I could really enjoy his scene at the Dubai Burj Khalifa. But frankly speaking, Ghost protocol is another MI, meaning nothing that special. I think Mission Impossible attraction is on its unpredictable story and brilliant and intelligent chase. High technique such as mask disguise and gum bomb reminded me of classic 007 movie, which I liked. But part 4 Ghost protocol is going way too far. I can't understand all the magics that the IMF agents are using. Well, people are aware of what is MI like already, so that's why I felt boring about those skills. Nevertheless, with only one stunt scene at Burj Khalifa, this movies becomes one of the best action movie in history."
"lewiskendell","6","1","3","2 April 2012"," A franchise that's still going strong.
","After a short hiatus, the Mission Impossiblr franchise is back. And yes, it's still a blast. <br/><br/>Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is the best pure action flick I've seen in quite a while. There were quite a few ""wow"" moments where all I could do was stare at what was happening on the screen in amazement. It's just a fun movie, through and through. <br/><br/>Any Mission Impossible fan will be pleased, and seeing it on the biggest screen possible is a must. It may not can quite match the brutally personal story and ruthless villainous performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman that propelled the third (and still best) movie (both plot and villain are fairly generic, here), but Ghost Protocol tops it as far as the action is concerned and proves that the franchise (and Cruise himself) has lots of gas still left in the tank. I'd love for this cast to stick around and continue the series."
"bob the moo","Null","1","3","1 April 2012"," Looking, not feeling in a film where spectacle takes priority over all else
","There is quite a lot of punctuation in the title of this film and as one would expect there is a lot of action in the actual film itself. The plot here sees the entire IMF disavowed, leaving Ethan Hunt and his team to try and prevent a nuclear war with just the four of them (and loads of clever gadgets). It is an effort that takes them across the globe and puts them in constant danger.<br/><br/>It has been over 15 years since the first Mission: Impossible film was made and it seems that the path the series is taking is set. For all its faults I enjoyed the original film because I thought De Palma's direction was excellent in regards several of the set-pieces, creating tension and a sense of actual danger. Jump forward in time to this film though and what we get is something that seems much more focused on the visual rather than the feel – perhaps due to the direction of Bird, someone who knows a thing or two about how things look. So, just like the first film, we get lots of set-pieces across the 2 hour plus running time and indeed many of them are cleverly put together and have a real look of the spectacular about them. Climbing the tower in Dubai is the most obvious, but a fight in an automated multi-storey car park is just as good. Visually it mostly looks great and this is why you will often find people telling you to go and see this on as big a screen as possible – because the images are by far the best thing about the film, so why not make them bigger (and therefore better)? The only caveat to this praise is that for some reason the back projection of images is awful throughout. There are some large sequences where the cast are on green-screen and all of them are badly done; no idea why, but they stand out all the more when in a film where the images and effects are generally good.<br/><br/>To a point this works; to a point. A film constructed on such images certainly makes it very easy to market in a trailer which samples these many images, but when it comes to the two-hour film more is needed and unfortunately it isn't there. My girlfriend commented at the end that M:I-GP was basically lots of separate action setups but with nothing at all in between, and she is right because that is how the film works. There are some attempts at character-development or intrigue but mainly the whole film exists because of the collection of set-pieces that are evenly spread across it. In between there isn't anything worth noting, the plot is standard stuff, the comedy doesn't really fit particularly well and there is nothing but the feeling of time being filled. This time in between needed to be used to engage the viewer and make us care and because it isn't, the visual set-pieces remain just that – visual. I never felt the team were in danger, never felt there was a risk to what they were doing or that I should care beyond being impressed by the scale of the images in front of me.<br/><br/>The cast are basically just points on the screen to be the focal point within bigger things to look at – there isn't really a ""performance"" here to talk about. Cruise works hard but I am biased because I always find him cheesy and obvious – his final scene with his team is by far the best/worst example of this but throughout he is unable to convince for me (but I know others love him, so each to their own). Renner is capable of much more than this and, although he is a nice addition, he doesn't get much to do. Pegg is quite amusing but needed a bit stronger material to be better. Patton looks awesome – this is her task and it is a task she performs admirably. Various goons come and go without much to tell them apart – again they are furniture, not actors. Brad Bird's direction is strong in the action sequences and he is part of the film being as successfully visually as it is, however he cannot find much below this level and even when the words on the page are saying there should be more, it still doesn't come off.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is not an awful film, indeed it is a fun film to watch on a Saturday night because there is a lot going on but yet very little attention or thinking is required. It is about the spectacle though – nothing else, sadly not even the ""action"" because only once or twice did I find it exciting, mostly I just found it visually impressive. I watched this film – I didn't feel it. It is a big budget franchise so it will make money and they will make more of it and of course I will return for my fix of ""spectacle"", but I do hope the next film puts some content in there and can produce the feeling of tension and danger, not just the look of it."
"tecnogaming","8","1","3","31 March 2012"," Solid comeback for a saga I considered dead after MI-3
","After watching MI-3 I considered Mission Impossible pretty much dead. The lengths that they go there was, too much for me, flat scrips, too much action, too much music, it was not Mission Impossible anymore, it was pure Hollywood crap.<br/><br/>Not anymore.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol revives the saga in an incredible way, for starters they abandoned the full orchestra with dramatic sounds in exchange for a more ""classic"" feel, very Mission Impossible (original) like, I simply loved the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Second thing they got rid of is the excessive amount of special effects and unbelievable scenes were Ethan never misses and missions go as planned, in Ghost Protocol everything goes wrong all the time and they have to improvise, this is a very nice touch to the series and one that allows the characters to prevail because of their will to succeed more than the amount of gadgets they carry with them.<br/><br/>Ghost Protocol follows the story of a nuclear warhead ready to go kaboom and the usual agents trying to stop it, only that this time, they don't have the luxury of all the gadgets, weapons and stuff since they are pretty much dead as an organization, will not speak more about this since I don't want to spoil the movie for you.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say that the movie is A LOT more centered around the characters and their shortcomings rather than special effects and impossible scenes, well, there are a couple of hard to believe scenes but comparing this movie to the defunct MI-3 is like comparing a jet with a bird. Ghost Protocol is very viewer friendly, not boring at all, very good locations selected for the movie and more character development than any other movie in the series.<br/><br/>A very nice touch indeed is the added humor in which some scenes occur, it is evident that the director wanted to relieve tension, MI-3 was full of very hard-to-swallow moments and the theme of the movie was so dramatic that it was almost painful to watch, Ghost protocol is nice and fresh, partly due to the way humor is implemented in the movie, you will experience a mix of modern cinema with the good old fashioned one, a really nice touch that suits the theme perfectly.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful first step to resurrect the saga, I am sure more will come, keep up this level and we will be very happy!<br/><br/>Totally recommended."

","A terrorist gains access to nuclear missile launch code, and launches an attack against San Francisco. IMF gets the order to stop the terrorist and prevent the disaster.<br/><br/>It's highly unlikely that just having the launch code will allow someone to launch a missile. You really have to be a deep insider to be able to do such a thing, so a mere terrorist being able to launch a nuclear missile remotely - and I stress remotely launch a missile from a submarine is not realistic. But that's Hollywood, and Mission Impossible continues its tradition of good action and intrigue.<br/><br/>But such attack may still occur in real life, and for that, this movie gives a glimpse of the reality of Russian nuclear weapons that are traded in the underground these days (such as nuclear warhead from sunken Kursk showing up in Okinawa).<br/><br/>The movie jumps from one location to another with many players involved in the plot. It keeps you on your toes to keep up with what's happening. Believability of the story was low which took away from the viewing experience, but if you liked the previous installments of Mission Impossible, this one will not disappoint."
"clivey6","6","1","3","22 January 2012"," Three or four episodes of Hustle pasted together
","This movie is a bit like the UK series Hustle, only with a big budget, international locations and quite a few episodes and climaxes strung together. I didn't really gel with the characters, they seemed out of my league in a way that other action heroes don't, and I didn't quite believe in what they were up to either.<br/><br/>It's the Cruise brand, it's like an empty battery that gets recharged with new characters around him. I prefer this team to the last unmemorable lot, but for all that you just think, well, there'll be another lot next time. The opener in a Serbian gaol seems to be Cruise auditioning for the Jack Rancher role, all bulked up and knocking out prisoners and guards and so on - convincingly it must be said. Simon Pegg is the boffin but a lot of the humour seems a bit inappropriate because the director doesn't know how to set up the expectation of humour, if feels a bit lame. Also, you can't help thinking that the team are chosen to not be taller than Cruise, at which they succeed.<br/><br/>To be fair, it is exciting and my palms were sweaty, yet it was also a hollow experience, not moving really.<br/><br/>The cinematography isn't too great or lovely to look at, and the Imax experience I can't really get the hang of, the screen goes deep when there's some big vista but it seems a bit tacky to me, plus it destroys the suspension of disbelief. Cruise doesn't have many layers as an actor and the crucial thing is you don't really quite believe any of it and I'm not sure you're supposed to but it's all mighty earnest. At times it's as if this is a Scientology movie: here is another seemingly insurmountable challenge that our hero can surely master before moving on to the next level of enlightenment."

All of the performances are fine, there is not one weak member of the cast. The humour is enjoyable and evolves naturally from the character dynamics within the team.<br/><br/>To set the record straight (spoilers beyond this point ) the opponent in the climax of the film is a formidable fighter because he's a Swedish former special forces commando.

"knowyourmovie","6","1","3","10 January 2012"," ""A"" for the action sequences and the visual effects, and ""C"" for the thin, improbable story lacking a spy thriller flavor
","People often say that somewhere very deep in their cold hearts even the hardest cynics believe or at least want to believe in miracles and happy endings. <br/><br/>I am not a cynic, and I actually believe in miracles, but there is one particular miracle that even I find extremely improbable – a fourth sequel in a Hollywood movie franchise being a great film. <br/><br/>While the history of Hollywood does contain some rare occurrences of great sequels (""The Godfather: Part II"", ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", or ""Shrek 2"" ), and great reboots (Christopher Nolan's visionary ""Batman Begins""), the vast majority of the sequels are notoriously worse than the original works, with the fourth sequels almost exclusively fluctuating somewhere between the ""mediocre"" and the ""complete junk"" levels.<br/><br/>The first ""Mission: Impossible"",tastefully directed by Brian De Palma, was a true masterpiece of a spy thriller, with a strong, believable story full of intrigue and suspense, good acting, and, of course, with the famous ""Mission: Impossible"" theme composed by Argentine musician Lalo Schifrin. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the sequels went straight downhill, quite sharply and quite steeply. After having suffered through a painful experience of watching the barely entertaining popcorn flicks ""Mission: Impossible II"" and ""Mission: Impossible III"" I did not expect much of ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"". Deep inside, however, I still cherished that childish dream, that naïve hope that some altruistic visionary director would become interested in reviving the seemingly hopeless (in terms of the art, not the box office) ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise.<br/><br/>Then events made an unexpected and an exciting turn: the rave critic and public reviews of ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" started appearing in the mass media. Even Roger Ebert called the movie ""a terrific thriller with action sequences that function as a kind of action poetry""<br/><br/>I was almost convinced that a true miracle had happened and Brad Bird, previously known only by the full-length Oscar-winning animations ""The Incredibles"" and ""Ratatouille"" had grown to be a new Brian De Palma. <br/><br/>As a result, I went to see ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" with high expectations and was disappointed, mainly because of the very thin, improbable plot lacking a true ""spy thriller"" flavor, suspense, and tension, especially in the second part of the movie. ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" turned out to be better than ""Mission: Impossible II"" or ""Mission: Impossible III"" but not as good as ""Casino Royale"" from the competing James Bond franchise.<br/><br/>The premature climax of the film marked by the several outstanding action sequences and the full of tension exchange scene in a Dubai hotel happened long before ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" actually ended. What followed the culmination was a forced, unimaginative attempt to arrive to a standard happy ending while not completely losing the dangerously quickly disappearing remains of the coherency and the common sense.<br/><br/>The absence of a solid plot foundation made even the most extraordinary action sequences and the most advanced visual effects much less engaging, suspenseful, and thrilling that they were meant to be.<br/><br/>The heavy focus on the action and adventure elements failed to mask the multiple holes and inconsistencies in the predictable, but hard to believe story. In addition, the movie wasted the precious screen time on the long unnecessary comic scene with the amorous shady Indian telecommunications entrepreneur while leaving the key character – the mysterious villain – sadly underdeveloped.<br/><br/>The acting was not particularly bad, but not memorable either. The only noteworthy exception (besides the nice cameo appearance of Tom Wilkinson) was Michael Nyqvist, previously known for his strong performance in the Swedish version of the ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"". In ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"", Michael Nyqvist quite stylishly and convincingly played the primary antagonist code- named ""Cobalt"". <br/><br/>Taking into account everything said above, it is not particularly surprising that the aftertaste of the movie is bad and that instead of the fond memories, all we are left with are the questions without answers <br/><br/>Attention: Spoilers below! <br/><br/>Were the authors of the movie unaware of the existence of the American nuclear defense shield that would stop any missile long before it could approach San Francisco? Or, did they decide to sacrifice the believability in order to have a cool scene with a missile self destructing just a split second before it was supposed to blow the city up? We will probably never know, but the result was a very silly movie piece, much more suitable for something like ""Voltron: Defender of the Universe"" than for a respectable spy thriller.<br/><br/>We will probably never know how the Russian nuclear strategist, a typical armchair scientist, could possibly become a formidable foe for supposedly the best IMF agent Ethan Hunt in his prime. How the grey- headed pre-retiree from a scientific community could be on equal footing in running, auto racing, and even fighting with a much younger, well- trained special agent? Not to mention that the omnipotent strategist with no military background was somehow also able to destroy the Kremlin, steal the nuclear device, and make IMF (the spy agency) a scapegoat for all of that.<br/><br/>However, let us not be too harsh on the director. After all, ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" was his first live action film and we know that mistakes will naturally happen when we try doing something new. <br/><br/>In my opinion, the main takeaway for Brad Bird should be the following: all the cheesy, fairy tale-like, hard to believe stories that work fine in ""The Incredibles"", ""Ratatouille"", ""Voltron: Defender of the Universe"" and other animations, do not go as well with the more serious, live action spy thrillers. <br/><br/>knowyourmovie.blogspot.com"
"thepsychocritic","7","1","3","8 January 2012"," Does entertain. Doesn't impress.
","Someone has been taking Napoleon too literally when he ambitiously stated 'There is no such word as 'Impossible' in my dictionary,' because someone needs to teach the Mission: Impossible guys the definition of the word impossible. With three movies titled Mission: Impossible that consist of nearly impossible missions that are miraculously accomplished in the end, even the most hard-boiled crepehangers would find it difficult to believe that any further movies would actually comprise of a mission that is really, earnestly and absolutely impossible. What they should have done is named the fourth instalment Mission Nearly Impossible; just for the sake of honesty, if nothing else. <br/><br/>The grudges I bear against the title of the film don't hold true for the film itself. Contrary to the established precedent, where the story was often contorted to resemble scrambled eggs, Ghost Protocol keeps things comparatively simpler. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) returns to his element in classic Ethan Hunt fashion by making an escape from a Russian prison with the help of his associates, Jane (Paula Patton) and Benji (Simon Pegg). Their almost impossible mission requires them to stop an obnoxious Russian badass, Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist), from gaining control of a satellite and nuclear codes that will allow him to instigate a nuclear war. The reason he provides, as any man who has been conked on the head a little too hard would do, is that once life on Earth is annihilated it will lead to the dawn of a new era, where the weak will die and the strong will survive - a result of taking Darwin's survival of the fittest theory way too literally. To stop this lunatic from bringing nefarious scheme into action, the team throws caution to the wind and jumps headfirst into the imbroglio that leads them from Russia to Dubai to Mumbai all the while fighting bad guys with guns, getting smacked in the face by a sand storm, driving flashy cars and occasionally climbing the world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa, with merely the help of sticky gloves. <br/><br/>The action sequences even eclipse Tom Cruise to become the absolute show-stealers in Ghost Protocol. Director Brad Bird, who displayed his penchant and skill in making action films through The Iron Giant and The Incredibles, makes a seamless transition from animation to the real world by charging up the nearly-dead franchise with enough action to resurrect it. The sequences are plenty and all are choreographed adroitly - Ethan's escape, the dust-storm fight and even the finale set in a futurustic parking-lot. The scene which shows Tom Cruise going all Spiderman on the Burj Khalifa not only made me secretly hope that he would tumble to a crushing over 100-story drop and get splattered onto the road as castigation for Knight and Day, but also got the adrenaline glands pounding like they were having a seizure.<br/><br/>The movie also does well on a front where most action flicks fail miserably - making an emotional connection between the characters and the viewers, such that one actually feels lugubrious at the death of a character, instead of mere apathy. Even with the little screen-time some of the side-cast has been granted, you form an attachment with them that makes you want them not to die. That doesn't happen in many movies nowadays - Captain America and the latest Harry Potter movie exemplify this. The only other film that scaled this forlorn peak this year was Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes, and that's because the monkeys were my ancestors. <br/><br/>Ghost Protocol falls rather short on a story-line - it seems like a vessel to flaunt the enviable tools and tricks that Team-Hunt, or Hunters, carry with them. But going to a Mission: Impossible film hedging your bet on an impressive story-line would be as foolhardy as going to the world's greatest hooker with empty pockets and high expectations. Another shortfall that the movie faces is the nebulously characterized Hendricks who wants to blow up the world. He is as generic as antagonists get, having nothing to distinguish in the tide of villains - no battle-scars, no evil-dialogues, no physical peculiarities, no idiosyncrasies - except that he's Russian. Pitted against the Hunters, he seems piteously milquetoast. The real danger is essentially just the nuclear missile.<br/><br/>The film doesn't stumble into the booby-trap of 'I'm-going-to-bore-you- to-death' with the owl-faced zombie-slaying Simon Pegg providing the much needed comic relief, with the accompaniment of Jeremy Runner as a covert, ex-agent named William Brandt. They bring a sense of humour previously unseen in any of the Mission: Impossibles, which includes Brandt procrasting jumping into a behemoth of a fan with only a metal underwear and a disconcertingly minuscule magnet to prevent getting shred to strips. While the scintillating action does make up for the lag, at 138 minutes the movie seems to drag occasionally with the extra minutes hanging by the side of its head like a dead foetus.<br/><br/>And then of course, there's Anil Kapoor reducing all Indians to a rather embarrassing stereotype. Someone ought to put the man out of his misery by giving him a few movies."

","This is an absolutely thrilling and engaging movie from start to finish. It's intelligent and well structured and although wild, not so much so as to make it unbelievable or cartoon-like. For me, this is the best Mission Impossible movie of the four in the franchise. How many franchises can you say that about and mean it? I'm not a big fan of real life Tom Cruise but putting that aside, he proved that he still has the action chops with this late year gem. The nods to the previous film were well done and added depth to the overall experience. It's a very enjoyable thrill ride and one of my favorites of the year. I really didn't see that coming at all."

It's a fast paced, over the top action film with rapid editing and information thrown at you just as fast as Tom Cruise can run and fly through the air.<br/><br/>It's got everything you would expect. It also has good acting, good dialogue, humor, great sets and stunts, breathtaking photography and of course, a cool car near the end. <br/><br/>It isn't something I would watch again. Films like this throw a lot of information at you and after a while I personally didn't even try to keep up with the story or the details. I just watched the film and enjoyed it. It is enjoyable. Just not something to sit through twice unless you need almost 3 hours of mind numbing action. <br/><br/>It sounds so uncool to say this but sometimes I wish they could pull in the reigns just a bit. Just a bit less information, a bit less action and of course, the actors can survive any injury and still go on. A bit overdone but still fun."

","The Opening :- Mission Impossible : Ghost Protocol was a high octane action thriller that will keep you on the edge of seat. This is best among all the series and believe me you will enjoy every bit of it with an urge to get more out if it.<br/><br/>The Story :- In the 4th installment ,Hunt and his team has to race against time to track down a dangerous terrorist named Hendricks, who has gained access to Russian nuclear launch codes and is planning a strike on the United States. During the operation in Kremlin , they are double crossed by Hendrick and soon the Russian Embassy is bombed causing huge destruction to the place. US government launches the Ghost protocol and suspends IMF. This means they will not get any plan , any backup and no action from the government. They have to track Hendrick at any cost before he launches the nuclear attack on US<br/><br/>The review I was very excited to catch this flick in theater and my joy knew no bound after watching the movie. The film is just awesome. The story is very well told along with superb direction by Brad Bird ( The incredible and Ratatouille). The screenplay was handled efficiently along with a strong script. Tom Cruise is back and he is back with a BANG. He is just awesome , to be precise. The actor not only performs his own stunts , he is so enduring in his role that you would hardly think of any other actor doing this role. The rest of star cast do justice to their part. The action sequences are mind blowing and breath taking especially the one where Tom Cruise climbs the Burj Khalifa. Cinematography is eye- catching capturing the locales of Dubai and Mumbai. Art direction is mesmerizing.<br/><br/>The bottomline Go for it if you want to energize yourself , enjoy yourself and of course if you are a Tom Cruise movies fan. Excellent : 4/5"
"theinaniloquent","10","1","3","21 December 2011"," ""No plan. No backup. No choice""
","The IMF is shut down when it's implicated in the bombing of the Kremlin, causing Ethan Hunt and his new team to go rogue to clear their organization's name.<br/><br/>Looking back, I have to be completely honest with you guys. Comparing the others with this, I give the first a 7/10. It was weird, stylized in a strange way, but was actually good for it's kind. It felt like you were you were in a top secret organization, but some things held me back. The second, as stated before in my previous reviews, was HORRENDOUS! It was badly acted, badly scripted, and badly presented. The only thing it succeeds in is it's special effects, which were still not the best. I give that one a 4/10. The third, in my opinion WAS the best, with an intelligent plot and one of the best villains. It had it's flaws, but J.J Abrams knew how to sort out the two, and presented an above-average flick. I give it a 9/10. Now with Ghost Protocol, I didn't know exactly what to expect. The director is an animator, who gave us genius Pixar movies like Monsters Inc. Question was, could he pull off a live action film? YES. Question was, could he actually make the best one of the lot? YES... Ghost Protocol, firstly, has the best plot. It was smart, and once things start going, your not going to drift off (problem I had in the first.) Ghost Protocol also has an amazing soundtrack. I had my doubts about the theme (the second's theme was horrible...) but they actually succeeded with that and the rest. It felt like a James Bond film, honestly. Next we have the characters. I actually LOVED the team, and I'm glad it didn't follow the others. Tom Cruise was being his usual self, but actually did the best job yet. Jeremy Renner is a rising star, who did a very good job in his role. He stunned us in Hurt Locker, and he surely pulled it off here too. But the best is for last: Simon Pegg. I love his sense of humor and style. He brought color to the whole gang and made it loving to watch. The action scenes in this film were just STUNNING! The Kremlin scene was brilliant (although the bombing scene was a bit overdone.) The whole Burj Khalifa was just the best scene in the whole film. Lots of suspense and action, and making me want to re-watch it in IMAX. The last film in Mumbai was pretty cool to and let me point of the intelligence in the film. THE GADGETS! They were spy-tech, and you couldn't wait to see what else the team had up their sleeves. Point blank, I loved this film. It provides everything you want in an action movie, and then some. If your fan of the Mission Impossible series (even the first) Ghost Protocol is suggested. It was easily the best, and one of the best action films this year. Kudos Brad Bird, you made this series last. 10/10."
"musanna-ahmed","9","1","3","21 December 2011"," Should you choose to accept this? Oh yes
","The Mission Impossible series is one of the very few series' I have ever seen in which each film is better than the last. So the latest is the best in the series yet, and it's up there with Fast Five as the one of the year's best action films. Any skeptics who thought Brad Bird couldn't do so good of a transition from animation to live-action have been proved utterly wrong. The direction of the actors is first rate and the star-studded cast reward Bird with super performances, Tom Cruise in particular, who is repeatedly confirming with each film that he's one of the best movie stars and still has the ability to inevitably draw large crowds. And that is for 25 years now. <br/><br/>On the other hand, the technical side of the film, as predicted, is incredible. Especially the Burj Khalifa sequence, which looks to have been a literal Mission Impossible to have created accurately, but the filmmakers did it. The sound is piercing, shots of the several countries in the film are mightily impressive, and the set pieces have been superbly engineered.<br/><br/>The bad bits? Bird has ditched heart (the romantic subplot from the last film) for adrenaline – although this has managed to be a satisfying and invisible change. It's hardly a spoiler but it would have been cliché if Paula Patton's Jane and Ethan Hunt fell in love. The major bad point has to be the villain, Hendricks, portrayed by the Millennium trilogy's Michael Nyqvist. It is likely that if there is another sequel and the talk about the series becomes loud again, Hendricks will be a forgotten villain. It is a virtually impossible mission to solely focus on Hendricks throughout the film because the story's transition from country to country sees more than one threat to the IMF team and the task for the audience is to divert their attention to each one, which results in subtracting interest in Hendricks. In comparison, Owen Davies (I remembered his name in this review, wonder if I remember who Hendricks is in the likely-to-happen MI5) is a much more memorable and menacing villain than Hendricks.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the IMF team win our attention and garner the most interest as we see Tom Cruise scaling the Burj Khalifa, Paula Patton sexily strutting around an Indian palace, Jeremy Renner tackle another complex character – Brandt, the IMF Secretary's Chief Analyst – and Simon Pegg, as in every film, provide the humour. From the teams Ethan Hunt has been prepared for in the past, this is the most exciting to watch. And this is the most exciting film to watch, especially in IMAX, even if only for the Burj Khalifa scene because it is a much more spectacular sequence on a very large screen. A recommended film to watch, thinking of any better entertainment in cinemas right now (or in the past 6 months) is a Mission: Impossible."
"ghost_dog86","9","1","3","21 December 2011"," How did I enjoy this movie so much?!
","Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole Ashland <br/><br/>I should be highlyembarrassed, being the self-proclaimed well respected critic that I am,to say this, but not only did I enjoy ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" but in this reviewers opinion, it is the best action film I have seen in years! Masterfully directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles, Ratatouille) and starring Tom Cruise (Jerry Maguire, Top Gun), showing that he isn't quite irrelevant yet, Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker),delivering a great supporting performance as always, Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead), who brings in some much needed hilarity and Paula Patton (Jumping the Broom), who adds nothing to the movie, ""Ghost Protocol"" is the fourth and clearly the best film in what had been an average action-adventure series. Beginning with one of the most stylized prison-break sequences since ""The Great Escape"", this installment continues to follow the secret agent adventures of Ethan Hunt (Cruise) as his organization, the IMF, is shut down after a compromised mission in Russia results in the unit being accused of bombing the Kremlin. This leads to an accidental declaration of war by the United States, as the ""disbanded"" IMF must find out who really bombed the Kremlin and blah blah blah. Like the others in the series , this plot may seem overly complex and filled with convoluted double and triple agent story lines, but WHO CARES because the film itself is everything an action film should be; entertaining and filled with a plethora of the most amazing and suspenseful stunts. You want to see a high motored car chase through the streets of Dubai, during a sandstorm? You want to see the sultry female agent seduce the bad guy then kick his butt and saving the say, all while wearing high heels? You want to see Tom Cruise literally leap tall buildings in a single bound (well, that is not how it really goes down but anyways)? Well, it's all here! That is not to say that there isn't a valid storyline here. It's more like the action sequences are so good, that the plot seemed to be only a distracting devise to transition from one action sequence to another. And I loved every minute of it.<br/><br/>Aside from the much expected and well thought out action sequences which are customary in a film like this, there are also some very welcome supporting characters that create an atmosphere of levity (Pegg) that isn't seen in its predecessors and a cool factor (aka the Renner factor) that almost single handedly rejuvenates an action series that had become somewhat predictable and uninteresting. Pegg is hilarious here, and may be the biggest reason to see this movie, every so often giving the audience a break from the serious ""straight-man"" domineer of Cruise's character. As for Renner, he is very well cast as an almost Cruise-like understudy, showing that while his potential for Award winning acting is abundant, he is multi-faceted enough to play a very polarizing action hero as well.<br/><br/>Cruise's leading man career, after a series of unfortunate events in conjunction with a serious of unfortunate movies, was thought to be over after it was discovered that he was an actual brash eccentric and not just playing one in the movies. For the longest time it was thought to be that the only films he could get were embarrassing cameo roles (Tropic Thunder), leads in awful films (Knight and Day, Valkyrie) and L. Ron Hubbard Productions. And while the fourth installment of an action series like ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" isn't the set up for a monumental resurgence in his career, (for the few who go see this movie) it should make it clear that Cruise still has that indescribable ""it-factor"" that carried him through his blockbuster film career.<br/><br/>Final Thought: At the end of the day, this movie is simply a stylized cartoonish espiongage film, whose only true merits lay in how extremely well it works on an incredibly high entertainment level (which is far from a bad thing). And even with a film like ""Ratatouille"" on his resume, it is in my opinion that Bird has crafted his best work here and even with the unavoidable sappy ending, ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" stands as one of the only B-style movies which is well worth the ticket price. This is one Hollywood movie that is sure to exceed any reluctant viewer's expectations, garnering immensely more positive reviews than a backhanded compliment such as ""it's not as bad as you thought"".<br/><br/>Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

","Okay, the scene of walking on the skyscraper was excellent but that alone is not going to make this movie rise much above mediocrity. It doesn't have the flair of Bond movies nor even the intensity of the Borne films. The script was thin and action scenes ( with exception of the skyscraper scene) were been there, seen that. The first of Mission Impossible movies starring Cruise was excellent, they have been going downhill since then. While some may think this will help rescue Tom's career from the drought it's been in, I just see it as another missed opportunity. Besides for me the mission impossible scenario should be more focused on a group rather than an individual, like the original series. It's not a terrible film, good for a popcorn night, but very forgettable. I guess I just expect more from this series."

"williampsamuel","8","1","4","7 January 2015"," The best Mission Impossible yet
","Ghost Protocol is not the kind of movie that spends much time on set up. Nor does it go to any great lengths to develop the characters, or the plot, which is really just an excuse for the action scenes. And the heroes of this movie regularly take actions so dangerous, so risky, so insane as to make James Bond look like a realistic treatment of intelligence work. And that's what makes it so much fun.<br/><br/>Barely has the film started when the first of many punches is thrown. And from there it's a practically nonstop series of shoot-outs, chases, explosions, and narrow escapes. Because the whole point of a movie like this is to get the adrenaline pumping and keep the action coming. You know you you're not coming to see mind bending storytelling, Oscar worthy dramatic performances, or deep meditations on the state of international politics or the morality of espionage. You've come to see the big dumb action movie at its very finest, with lots of high tech gadgets and exotic locales thrown in.<br/><br/>And Ghost Protocol delivers. Not only is the action nearly constant, but it's as perfectly choreographed and photographed as anything coming out of Hollywood these days. The scene in which Cruise climbs the Burg Kalif in Dubai is absolutely stunning, and even more impressive for the fact that it was done on location, with no green screen. And speaking of impressive, the sandstorm sequence is incredible. I don't know how they created such conditions, or how they could possibly shoot under them. The action is also varied enough to keep things fresh, alternating heart pounding shootouts and chases with tense rendezvous and infiltrations. <br/><br/>Of course this can be said for a lot of action movies of late. What separates Ghost Protocol from the works of certain other directors *coughMichelBaycough* is that even though the plot is secondary, there's still enough of one that we usually know and care why this building is blowing up or this person is impersonating that one. And even though no real spy would ever do the things that Ethan and his companions do, their actions make sense within the context of the film. If real world spies had the kind of tech and combat training that Impossible Missions did, and if they'd been disavowed and cut off from all support, who knows, maybe they'd act this way to.<br/><br/>Plus there's real acting. Tom Cruise may not be the most versatile actor, but he knows this role, and he makes one hell of a spy. Jeremy Renner also gives an interesting and fairly complex performance as Agent Brant, an analyst who may know more than he's letting on. And Simon Pegg (best known for his independent comedies) adds some excellent comic relief as Benji, the team's techie. This leads to another strong point, which is that Ghost Protocol never takes itself too seriously. It finds ways to slip humor into even the most serious scenes, whether by playing up the characters' idiosyncrasies or adding a little bit of slapstick to the fight. And then there are scenes like the seduction of the Indian telecom mogul, which are outright hilarious.<br/><br/>Bottom line, Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol is a fun movie. It's got action, adventure, suspense, and a fair amount of laughs. The acting is good, the scenery gorgeous, and the thrills nonstop. If you want excitement and entertainment, look no further."
"alindsay-al","9","1","4","27 November 2014"," a fantastic film that really did surprise me
","I really did like mi 3 and thought it was the best of the franchise, however, I was worried that any future films wouldn't be as good but boy was I surprised as this is even better and easily the best of the franchise. The film sees the IMF blamed for the bombing of the Kremlin which sees agent Ethan hunt and the rest of his team trying to stop a nuclear war. Now tom cruise is back as Ethan hunt and I think he does a fantastic job in the role with this performance being a bit more funny then the others but also keeping up with the action he is so good at. The rest of the team are also really good, jeremy Renner is in the film as an analyst and he us fantastic with some really good humour but also his character had more layers to him then what I expected. The female member of the team Jane was really good too and probably the best woman in the franchise. Simon pegg returns to his role and he is really good, his comedic timing is really good and helps give a slightly lighter tone, I really liked all these characters because they were all important unlike some previous team members. The only character that was a bit of a throwaway was that of the villain I mean he is okay but his performance is nowhere near as good as Philip Seymour Hoffman in the previous film. The story has never been the strongest point of these films and that theme continues here with the overall plot not being very strong at all. But as I said I really liked the story of the team and how each of them had a special plot piece. This is probably the best mi script with the dialogue being fresh and funny, also the chemistry between the characters is really good. The style is fantastic especially the Dubai tower as the effects wow and help sell the epicness of the film. Overall this is a fantastic action film that should be seen."

","I once heard someone say the American presidency peaked at Washington and devolved from there, considerably and steadily. The same could be said of the MI films. The writing is lousy, the direction sophomoric, and the screenplay contrived and cheesy. The DePalma directed 1st film was so far superior to this anything that has emerged since. And as I recall, the decision to depart from DePalma and head in the direction the films have gone is all Cruise's. The Tomato Meter gave MI4 a high rating; for what reason I do not know. They must have seen another film. There are so many better quality action films out there. Save yourself the 3 buck rental or Netflix spot on the queue; get the new Sherlock Holmes or Knight and Day, a far better Cruise movie; or I don't know, randomly select one; anything but MI4.

","The fourth M.I.. movie sees Cruise locking himself in a closet and the rest of the cast shouting at him to come out. Hats off to South Park. Whilst 'Ghost Protocol' has a well endowed budget , but it is let down by a number of factors. Plotwise, it revolves around the tired cliché of I.M.F. being framed and the agents having to work 'rogue' to save the world and their reputation. How many films have come out of Hollywood involving agents/agencies being betrayed or framed? Its been done to death and will continue to be rehashed for as long as movies are made. In fact, Hunt's team was double crossed and targeted by the authorities in the first big screen outing of M.I. Dialogue is mundane, only existing to hang the action from. You can guess lines before the characters say them. The lead villain is too weak a character and his motive for trying to trigger a nuclear holocaust is decidedly silly. Quite a come down from having Philip Seymour-Hoffman as the adversary in M.I.3. Simon Pegg's character Benji goes from being incongruous to downright irritating and I would have enjoyed the movie a lot more without him. Samuli Edelmann is a weak link, her acting is pretty dire and she only seems to have two facial expressions. Ving Rhames' Luther manages to be the coolest person in the film in spite of only appearing for less than five minutes. The action is handled well, as you'd expect. My favourite part was the final showdown in the automated car park, one of the best action sequences I've seen for a long time. But action needs to be backed up by the other elements of a movie or else the overall product will falter. This film is also showing on I-Max but I choked at paying the £4.30 supplement (or 'Uplift' as Cineworld call it)."

","I think this is what you'd expect to see out of a Mission Impossible film. I have to say I thought it was probably better than the other 2. I seem to remember the first one being overly complicated, and the second one not really having much substance. Not that this one carries a whole lot more substance, but Simon Pegg was good in it. He did pretty much what he was supposed to do. As I am a fan of his, my expectations of him are high, and he didn't disappoint. I believe he managed to satirise some of the action film clichés, and thus elevate this otherwise fairly ordinary outing. Of course, I don't want to appear stupid, he didn't write the stuff, so full credit has to go to the writers as well. His character is pretty much the reason why this film gets a 6 not a 5 for me. Other aspects of the film are as expected. The action sequences are slick, the bit where the Kremlin blows up is excellent, and the technology is cool. The story line is a little over complicated obviously to exacerbate the drama. To begin with there are few of these obvious contrivances, but as the film goes on there are more and more. I don't know whether it is Tom Cruise, but whenever he is explaining those complex 'mission briefs' I tend to get confused? Like I need the pause button for him to run through it one more time. And in my defense, I don't think that it's me being slow. I think I probably have a 'just above average' ability to pick up narrative, which leaves me one question - what does Cruise or the directors of these films want to achieve by baffling their audiences. Are they covering for nasty contrivances in their plots? Do they want to appear clever? Or do they simply not have the chops to express themselves clearly? Which ever it is, it goes down as a negative in my book. Overall, I enjoyed myself. Everything flowed along, I could ignore some of the 'why didn't they just do that' moments, the humour was well placed (not just by Pegg also from a supporting cast member called Jeremy Renner (I have just looked up). This guy actually manages to produce a mysterious character which was cool. Again, not all his doing), I felt like I got my moneys worth. I think you will get what you expect, and I wouldn't expect you would expect to remember this film in a month. FYI, thought this was the MI3, not MI4, obviously blanked 3 from my mind. That is probably a fair indication of this ones longevity as well."
"tridry","10","1","4","6 January 2012"," A true ""classic"" action film that grips you the whole way through
","I love a good action film. But over the years, action films have tried to be overly complicated with a heavy reliance on CGI for fear they will be too old-fashioned or not entertaining enough. I liken it to the way modern-day chefs take a classic recipe and jazz it up with unnecessary ingredients and impeccable but superfluous presentation. MI:4 seems to go back to grass-roots level. It's like they've taken an original recipe written by Julia Child and stuck to it religiously, and the results are delightful. The opening sequence immediately connects you to the main characters and the action sequence is very well executed and thoroughly entertaining. Furthermore, the addition of Simon Pegg proves to be a sound investment straight away, providing well balanced humor. The title sequence should be applauded for it's retro feel, injecting snippets of the film throughout like the title credits from the A Team TV show. The plot is simple and easy to follow, which is coming from a guy who has never been able to follow the plot of any James Bond movies! The use of smart-phones and tablets as gadgets made us connect with the film even further, and where wacky gadgets had been employed, they were done so with a light-hearted splash of tongue-in-cheek. The film is not all about Tom Cruise, which is a wise move as the 'team- effort' makes us appreciate the action much more. There are some truly gripping action sequences involving heights and I loved how they opted to use live-action stunts over CGI shots. In fact, it's difficult to notice where any CGI is used at all. Whatever opinion people have of Mr Cruise, you gotta agree he has some balls to do all his own stunts. Although there is the generic hot and feisty female member, her role is not as the atypical love interest. That's not to say they have left out such an 'important' ingredient, but rather they opted to have it 'on the side'. When I discovered Brad Bird had directed, I could immediately see the connection with The Incredibles movie as the film flows and is structured in quite a similar way. Overall, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol serves as a fine example of how a failing franchise can be brought back to life by simply sticking to the formula, and not relying on that 21st Century buzz word, 'reboot'."
"xyzthedude","7","1","4","29 December 2011"," Refreshing screen play but poor script
","Let me start of with what I liked-<br/><br/>This version of MI does not take itself too seriously. There are many instances of tongue in cheek humor.. for eg:- The one where the public telephone fails to self destruct. The other being Simon Pegg being able to pass the field test (finally) to get recruited in the team (Tom Cruise is not too excited about it), and the incident where everybody shy away from the getting directly involved in scaling Burj Khalifa!<br/><br/>Also, the chase scene in the sandstorm and breaking into Kremlin or the fight sequence in the automated car parking seemed new and nice.<br/><br/>The things that I didn't like-<br/><br/>The script was blotchy at best. Its not clear how, once they get disowned by their group, they had finances to secure such expensive cars and crash an elite Indian party? The plot about the Indian billionaire having access to a satellite that was acquired illegally so that they could have a fake and not so funny(hardly believable) seduction sequence just to get access keys was not well thought out! Also, the line that ""Indian men are desired by all women"" or something along those lines were over the top and probably patronizing in some way is what I think!<br/><br/>They glossed over many small details and it was evident that the shooting was done in a different place than what was purportedly claimed."
"bigcalkenobi","9","1","4","23 December 2011"," It's the best best action film of the year because of its clean, smooth, and intense action, cast of likable and memorable characters, and excellent direction
","Mission Impossible returns yet again with another intense and action packed adventure for Ethan Hunt(Tom Cruise) with his new team made up of the returning Benji(Simon Pegg) and newcomers Jane(Paula Patton) and Brandt(Jeremy Renner). With Tom Cruise beginning to show his age and Brad Bird(The Incredibles, Ratatouille) stepping in to direct his first live action film; it is a somewhat relevant question to ask if this series really has any juice left in it with this latest installment. Can Ghost Protocol deliver the same intricate story lines and intense action scenes as its predecessors or is Tom Cruise effectively running his career as an action star into the ground?<br/><br/>Check the rest out here: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-7j"

","Stodgy. Attempting to put deep feelings into the mouths of action puppets is always a doomed move. Tom runs funny and his pectorals are abandoning him.<br/><br/>Tom is outshone by the male members of the supporting cast. The female eye candies are on target. The ""Lost"" fellow gets cut out early--the joke they are attempting is that he's ""Not Tom"" by a long-shot.<br/><br/>Apparently I have to ""bla-bla-bla"" a bit more to create an acceptably long review. There are a couple of imaginative sequences and the scene on the world's tallest building is riveting. Ends with a whimpering line, though. Not the usual hero bravado."
"murlimohanrao","10","1","4","16 December 2011"," MI4 ... best in the series. waiting for more
","Saw the movie recently. Had lots of expectations, as usual from a MI movie and believe me, I was not disappointed. I went home entertained. That is what I am anyway paying for.<br/><br/>The plot to start with is not new. But, it more than makes up for it with brisk pace, excellent special effects and mind blowing stunts. Importantly, the way all these have been meshed into the story make an average story into a fantastic movie.<br/><br/>The movie starts off in Budapest with a prison break scene. This scene has some nice hand to hand fights but frankly this portion was slightly overdone. This sequence could have done with some chopping.<br/><br/>After that, its a roller coaster ride... you do not even get time to catch your breath. The story moves to Kremlin wherein the IMF gets accused of an attempt to bomb the Kremlin. Situations are such that all the evidence points towards the role of the IMF in the situation. <br/><br/>In the Kremlin, there is one sequence that caught my attention in terms of gadgetry. The optical illusion thing when Tom and Simon are checking the records room is funny and interesting.<br/><br/>The IMF is disavowed and the mentor murdered. Tom and his team are racing against time to nail the megalomaniac villain who believes that end of mankind is necessary for a new world to start. The villain needed a bit of strengthening ... his character has not been fully etched. Frankly speaking, I liked the female assassin better as she was strong, cold blooded and vicious to the core. I would not like to say anything more ... it is for others to watch and judge.<br/><br/>Now coming to the highlights ... there are many actually. Have already mentioned the optical illusion bit. Then there is the action scene at Burj Khalifa. It just sends your adrenalin rushing. The climax sequence at the automated car park in Mumbai is a fitting finale to the movie.<br/><br/>The hero of the movie is actually not Tom Cruise but the director Brad Bird. He is the real star and its simply amazing the way he has made a transition from animation to a live action movie.<br/><br/>I am definitely going to watch it again. Normally, sequels are not that good, but MI3 was better than MI1 which itself was a classic. MI4 has exceeded all of them. I am extremely eager to watch the next movie whenever it is made."
"fran-ohmsford-417-318109","1","1","5","7 July 2019"," Worst MI so far!
","Now the MI movies have never been my cup of tea, the first one only barely gets a 6/10 from me, the 2nd one got a 4/10 for being enjoyable even though it was a bad movie and the 3rd I gave a 2/10 {I can't now remember a single thing about it and I only watched it for the second time about 6 months ago if that!}....I thought that had to be the nadir for the MI franchise, I'd actually skipped the rest for the past decade having given up on them but now, thanks to Netflix I have finally seen MI-4....And I'm absolutely STUNNED at the ineptitude on display in this movie!
1) The Russian Agent acts more like a detective in a cop movie than the agent he is supposed to be.
2) There is no explanation given of how exactly the villain even knew they were in the Kremlin at that time to piggyback on them and frame them!
3) The carcrash scene and 500 bullets being fired into the water is just asinine....How exactly were the Russians following them in the first place? Again there's no elfin' explanation given of how they know Cruise in the secretary's limo! OR Why they just start shooting! {Until the agent arrived to tell them to stop I thought they were the villain's goons!} And let's not go into just how dead Cruise and Renner would have been without plot armour!
4) The climbing scene up the Burj Khalifa is just straight up FANTASY! Cruise seems to be able to change direction in MID-AIR! And what is it with the constant raising of the stakes!?! His glove fails, He can't finish the cutting of the glass and ACTUALLY FALLS! Then he gets back up to the glass that still isn't cut, without his cutting tool, smashes the glass with his foot and somehow propels himself inside without any of the velocity necessary to do so!
5) Getting back down we again raise the stakes when his line somehow isn't long enough and he has to do another ridiculous flight through the window ONLY FOR THINGS TO EVEN MORE STUPID as He doesn't quite make it, Renner grabs on to him and the woman grabs on to Renner and a Rug and we have Cruise and HALF OF RENNER too hanging out of this window 100 stories up BOTH being held by Renner's trouser leg by a 100 pound woman who is somehow anchored by a rug!!!
6) The plan has to go wrong at the last minute OF COURSE but why is he chasing after the villain when he's already stated to let that guy go for now!?!
7) The Chase through the sandstorm is yet more Hollywood idiocy!
8) That's right, leave the computer guy holding the gun on the world class ASSASSIN!!!
9) The female MI Agent {Carter} is implausibly bad at the seduction of the Indian billionaire yet somehow he accepts her manhandling him over and over again, twisting his arm so he's on his knees at least once! If he's meant to be a masochist who likes women to be the ones with the power TELL US THAT BEFOREHAND! Or at least AFTERWARDS!
10) I don't know what to say about the multi-storey carpark fight other than Aaaarrrggh WHAT THE PUCK!?!
Straight up this is one of the worst ACTION movies I have EVER seen....Possibly THE worst! I've seen worse comedies and I've seen horror movies I've really loathed but I didn't think it was possible for a pure Action Movie to be THIS bad! I really hope MI-5 is a decent film, come on, at least a 7/10 PLEASE!"
"gshortland","6","1","5","23 December 2014"," Good but not quite Carling
","Although I didn't go into this film with high expectations, I was impressed with the non stop action sequences in which Tom Cruise manages to outwit his opponents and get himself out of any situations. They help the narrative to flow and add some much needed punch to this film.<br/><br/>However, this film also lacked the acting and character development of the secondary characters that were present in the first Mission Impossible's and at times, was difficult to follow unless you are really concentrating on what is being said. So if you do plan to watch this film, be sure to closely follow the plot."
"vintkd","Null","1","5","3 June 2012"," Wrong movie - wrong Hunt!!!
","I don't know how about you, but I'm disappointed this film because Ethan Hunt become like James Bond by Pierce Brosnan, absolutely not emotional and boring. If in the previous parts Hunt had very important and personal reasons for his impossible mission like salvation his girl or revenge for betrayal, here I'm absolutely have not worried for him and this is why I have bored in watching time. Ethan Hunt have become too invulnerable, even Bond by Daniel Craig is more human than Hunt here. In this film perfect everything, special effects, stunts, excellent actors, except characters whose stereotypical and lifeless. In my opinion, creators of ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" have done too big emphasis on action, forgotten about their realistic characters, unfortunately."
"estebangonzalez10","7","1","5","3 January 2012"," Plenty of action, but doesn't live up to all the hype
","¨Mission accomplished¨<br/><br/>The fourth installment of the Mission Impossible franchise has finally arrived after five long years. It's been so long that I really don't remember much of what happened in the latest mission, but it isn't that important because these movies stand on their own. The first Mission Impossible film came out way back in 1996 and now fifteen years later the mission continues with Tom Cruise as the lead character once again, although this time they brought in a new director: Brad Bird. Bird is known mostly for his direction in animated films such as The Incredibles and Ratatouille, but he proves with Ghost Protocol that he can make an entertaining action film as well. There are some really great choreographed action scenes in this film with good visual effects. The story is entertaining, although cartoonish at times. One thing is for sure, you won't be bored with this latest installment because there is plenty of action going around. I still don't think the film is as brilliant as many people are saying it is. It works as a summer popcorn movie, but it isn't much more than that. It definitely won't be memorable or even rank among my favorite films of the year, but I still enjoyed this action film. One of the problems I had with this movie was the pace of the film; the story is really long and at some points I felt it was dragging a bit. The final action scene was a little over the top as well and it felt like it would never end. There were also some corny moments in the dialogue from the screenplay which was written by Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec, but the film worked thanks to some entertaining actions scenes, and Tom Cruise proves he's an action star as well.<br/><br/>Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is back in action once again with yet another mission that seems impossible, but this time he will have to work with a different team and without the help of the IMF division because it has been disavowed by the American President after a mission goes wrong in Russia and relations between both countries seem to hang by a very thin thread. At the beginning of the movie Ethan is in a prison in Moscow and has to be rescued by other IMF field agents, Benji (Simon Pegg) and Jane (Paula Patton). Once they free Ethan, the three team up for an important mission in Russia where they are ordered to infiltrate the Kremlin archives, but something goes wrong when someone else steals the files they're looking for and alerts the Russian police that Ethan is inside the building. Ethan manages to escape, but right after he does the entire building blows up and Ethan is the prime suspect, although in order to not stir up the public the Russian government claims the explosion was due to a gas leak accident. This is where the relations between the US and Russia government reaches its boiling point and Ethan must find the person behind the betrayal before a nuclear war begins. The search takes them from one location to the next so we get to see Ethan and his team climbing the world's tallest building in Dubai first and later ending up in Bombay. IMF intelligence analyst, William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), joins the team and embarks in this mission impossible.<br/><br/>There are plenty of thrills and emotional moments during the movie, but despite the fact that it's entertaining I still felt like there were some dull moments that could've been cut out from this over two hour long film. Tom Cruise is back doing what he does best; it's always good to see him in these action roles (despite the fact that he has a peculiar form of running) and he was great in the Dubai scene. Jeremy Renner was also a great addition; he's been on a real role ever since the Hurt Locker. Simon Pegg provides the comedy needed in these action films to break down the tension, and Paula Patton was much more than just eye candy; she could kick some butt. I also liked to see Michael Nyqvist in the villain role after his work in the Swedish Millennium trilogy. Mission Impossible had everything it needed to succeed: action stars, great action scenes, and some comedic relief, but I still felt like something was missing. I don't think this is the best film of the franchise, but it's still worth the watch. You will be entertained, just don't expect it to be one of best action films of the year. I had a lot more fun with Fast Five than I did with Ghost Protocol. I'm glad however that Tom Cruise is back making some entertaining movies and doing what he does best.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","I will always try to make sure no spoilers.<br/><br/>this movie is a great popcorn movie, nothing more nothing less. it starts with a great set piece which sets up the rest of the movie, but you don't find out why the start happened until about 20mins towards the end. The acting is okay with Tom Cruise stealing the show. It seems like he has his energy back but you cant watch him on screen without the baggage he brings from his private life clouding your belief in his character. Simon Pegg does Simon Pegg the same character he plays in all his movies. Paula patton is a pretty filler with a part to play which you just cant believe in. Jeremy Renner just doesn't seem right, it's like he did this part as an audition for the new bourne movie. The biggest issue with the cast is Anil Kapoor he was fantastic in 24, brilliant in slumdog but in this he's just sleazy and not in a comic way, just lucky his part is only 5 mins or so. The locations are fantastic some of which you remember long before you forgot what the movie was about. and i think thats the problem, the locations steal the show. It also has a little to much product placement BMW's all over the place including the new electric sports car the Vision, considering one of the locations it just doesn't feel right. You'll realise what I mean when you watch the movie, not a Italian sports car in site.<br/><br/>A good entry, a fun movie. just what you would expect."

","I'm not a fan of mindless action flicks, which this is. Characters portrayed as though they were made of steel and rubber make me cringe. Art-major-physics I find annoying. I went to see this movie because of Simon Pegg, and he delivers 100%.<br/><br/>I also had a good time.<br/><br/>The movie is not going to become a classic, but it's well made. All boxes are ticked: 4 exotic locations, including ample opportunity for some pretty high drops. One immediately-recognizable landmark destroyed graphically. Cruise to star, Patton as eye candy, Pegg for the British humor. Nods to previous installments in the series. High-tech gadgets that seem ultra-futuristic but still plausible. etc..<br/><br/>The simple fact is that the old-guard of action-movie makers has gotten tired over the years, and these are the people who stepped up to replace them and are currently holding the fort: Brad Bird directed this movie as though The Incredibles was a dress-rehearsal for it; J.J. Abrams gave it that Star Trek feel and brought in the writers of ""Alias"" and ""Life on Mars"" for the extra shine.<br/><br/>It's not going to be a favorite of mine. I will likely forget all about it a week from now. But during the movie's 2 1/4 hours, it felt like watching a James Bond movie for the first time. And I don't mean a new Daniel Craig movie. I mean, that feeling I got when Connery was Connery, Moore was Moore and Bond was Bond.<br/><br/>Oh, and super-cool gadgets were super-cool gadgets.<br/><br/>If you're keen on checking your brains out at the door and having an escapist 2+ hours of good time, this one is a good choice for you.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, you like an original story, believable three-dimensional characters with some development arc, a back-story, emotional integrity, or anything that remotely resembles any of the above: do yourself a favor and choose curtain #2, instead."

Simon Pegg and Jeremy Renner are cool material people in the movie. BUT, the one thing that makes Mission Impossible movie so Mission Impossible are the crazy twists it has through the movie and one big twist. There was nothing like that in this one.

There isn't much plot here but that's okay because it's all about the missions, involving wild and inventive technology and crazy action from beginning to end.

Somehow that did pay off and i do wonder why. One of the changes that i saw was that the movie doesn't revolve around Ethan Hunt or any character for that matter(not going into details). It's completely a new movie, casting couldn't have been better neither could have the story line. Action sequences are too good, and i really mean that, keeps the movie always going just at the right pace.<br/><br/>The best thing that could have happened to the movie was Jeremy Renner, in my opinion at least, for some reason that guy looks like he's born to do such roles; slight disappoint that i didn't get to see more of him in the movie; but the movie does promise a sequel coming up with the same characters continuing from this one, that'll be something to look forward to. All in all, Awesome stunt direction, pretty good story line, commendable acting by all the actors involved(except Anil Kapoor, why was he even there in the movie?). <br/><br/>For those who Love action movies, Go watch it."

Another reviewer pointed out that there is no personal connection with the villain like in MI:3 - good point, in order to keep the action moving, not enough time was devoted to building that character.<br/><br/>Great franchise and I love the Ethan Hunt character, just like Jason Broune/Bond in their own right."

","Mission: Impossible â€“ Ghost Protocol (2011): Dir: Brad Bird / Cast: Tom Cruise, Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, Paula Patton, Michael Nyqvist: An exciting and entertaining action film that is as good as the third film in the series and certainly better than the first two disappointing entries. The film opens with agent Ethan Hunt breaking out of a Russian prison. His wife is reported dead and another agent is killed in the opening when he miscalculates a target who turns out to be female. Hunt assembles a team in order to prevent a terrorist from encoding a nuclear bomb. This is surprisingly well plotted and written with tremendous and creative action scenes including a skyscraper like scene where Hunt is wearing gloves that allow him to suction to the glass. This is a grand and tense scene that ranks among the best of action scenes. Director Brad Bird has had huge success with animations such as The Incredibles and Ratatouille. Here he proves that action is in the cards and he backs it with visual awe that is sometimes too implausible when one factors how headquarters seem to emerge without question. Tom Cruise is in top form as Hunt. Jeremy Renner enters the picture as an analysis who is thrusts into a plot that will have him emerged in mid air above a ventilation fan. Simon Pegg is comic relief as a computer expert. Paula Patton is connected to the opening sequence tragedy but scores at seducing an enemy without crossing the lines. Michael Nyqvist is effective as the villain who is out to start a nuclear war. Pointless entertainment that is creative, visually inspiring and impossible. Score: 7 / 10"
"jadepietro","7","1","6","1 January 2012"," Should You Decide to Accept...
","This film is recommended.<br/><br/>Brad Bird ( The Incredibles, Ratatouille ) was the perfect choice to rejuvenate this languishing series. With his skills in animation and his visual panache, he expertly directs the film as if it is a live action cartoon, using his actors as props to his lavish backdrops. Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol, ( a terrible title, I might add ), is the best installment of the series, which is faint praise for a series that has been lackluster and absurd in its previous re-enactments. Is four the charm? Yes. Does it entertain? Absolutely? Does it make sense? Absolutely not.<br/><br/>This movie franchise is merely one hair-raising stunt after the next hair-raising stunt with very little plot or logic in between the chases, disguises, and gadgetry that hide the gaping holes in the story. In MI4, Ethan Hunt ( Tom Cruise, looking fit and a bit older ) is back with a new team of agents on call ( Jeremy Renner as Brandt, Simon Pegg as Benji, and Paula Patton as Jane Carter ). All are undercover and underwritten as before, and again, the action is fast- paced and the exotic settings slightly more interesting this time around. <br/><br/>It's still patently formulaic: The mission is planned to the nth detail, something goes wrong with the plan, quick thinking and agile maneuvering saves the day. In MI4, the team has decided to accept the mission to track down a terrorist named Hendricks ( Michael Nyqvist ). Only this time, they are disavowed due to an initial failed attempt to stop this madman in Russia, thus giving them the Ghost Protocol status. The IMF team goes on an endless search for justice and to reinstate their standing in the espionage market. This leads our determined and unstoppable agents to Dubai, Mumbai, and other global cities to bring down Hendricks at all costs.<br/><br/>Bird keeps the scenes moving quickly from one highly-charged moment to the next. The film's rapid-fire action sequences are skillfully choreographed and thoroughly suspenseful. Yet this time, they bristle with more intensity and sly humor than any of the other movie installments. <br/><br/>The major set piece of the film takes place outside the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai as Hunt plays Spiderman and climbs the tall exteriors with special gloves that allow him to stick to the windows. That is until...well, that's part of the formula, remember? ( By the way, this specific film sequence is classic and will long be regarded as one of the most breathtaking moments in modern filmmaking. The stunt-work, photography, editing, and use of CGI are remarkable in their staging and execution. ) There are also other spectacular action sequences involving a blinding sandstorm chase and another exciting section at a multi-level parking garage that moves swiftly on many levels.<br/><br/>The new cast has a wonderful chemistry and their individual quirks add to the tension and thrilling results. Also on hand in a small but humorous role is Anil Kapoor as Brij Nath, a rich and pampered playboy who is another target in the team's strategy of foiling the villain. <br/><br/>As always, the Mission Impossible intricate plotting continues to defy common sense and ask its audience to blindly believe in their schemes and goals. So much of the story depends on Hunt's plan to go a certain rational way, never taking into account human foibles and random coincidences. This template becomes troubling and absurd as it always makes the IMF team's best laid plans go astray, making the moviegoer question their professional killer instincts. <br/><br/>The real aim of this film series and Mr. Cruise and Co. is: Reality, be damned! Let the good times roll! Come on and take a wild ride with us! Enjoy the adrenaline rush! Any moviegoer is expected to set aside their disbelief in order to enjoy the film even more.<br/><br/>So, with all that said, Mission Impossible 4 is really Mission Improbable. This is a crowd- pleasing action-packed thriller with strong production values and some of the most extreme stunts ever filmed. Your enjoyment level will vary depending on your acceptance, or lack thereof, with its ludicrous plotting and preposterous logic. Of course, it's not Shakespeare, you knew that going in, but then Shakespeare never hung 130 stories above the ground either like Tommy Boy.

"whataskilltohave","8","1","6","30 December 2011"," Brilliant, but not mind blowing
","This is a fantastic installment to the series, combining action with some great dark comedic lines. The opening sequence is pretty epic, and it plays a part in the story, which is unusual for a large franchise. Tom Cruise does his job flawlessly as always (well, almost always) but the main comedy comes from the work of Simon Pegg. He plays a great role in this movie and with his tech savvy mind delivers some great lines. I am keeping the story talk to a minimum as to not reveal any spoilers but the story was well-rounded and flowed smoothly throughout. The ending was slightly disappointing though, as it felt very stock footage-like with a pretty bad smoke effect. Otherwise a great film, definitely worth seeing if you have enjoyed previous Mission Impossible movies."

","I saw the first one when I was child. At that time it wouldn't have taken much to impress me. I just wanted to see some explosions. I saw the second one when I was in middle school. Still...I just wanted to see some explosions and cool fight scenes. I am a fan of Tom Cruise. I don't bring his personal life into whether it makes him a good actor. I saw three during college. I really liked it because the villain was pretty cool. His lines were great too. Number 4 delivered for me as well. The action sequences were great. I didn't see it in IMAX but I don't have to. People who are not a fan of the series shouldn't watch it. They might expect too much. Someone mentioned the acting in another review. I agree with what that person said. It's not a movie that is supposed to have Shakespeare like lines. It's an action movie! Anyway I really enjoyed it! Tom Cruise is getting old though!! He should be careful when performing stunts!"

","MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 4: GHOST PROTOCOL Mission: Accomplished. Tom Cruise as Ethan hunt, Simon Pegg as Benjie, Jeremy Renner as the helper, Paula Patton as the girl. The first film in the series opened in 96' with the NOC List operation throughout the Globe, spanning from Prague to Berlin to CIA intelligence to Paris to London. The second film was the operation Khimera. Global nuclear war was starting to spread. The third installment got more hypothetical, more challenging and interesting. The fourth film in the franchise is a stunt spectacular and the most complex spy game scenario ever. There's a lot of extremely well played ""pull it off"" stunts that will have action audience fans and geek squad fans talking for months about the new gadgets, the new earpiece technology to play a real good spy game for fans of Bruce Geller's famous Mission: Impossible series. But the one big stunt-scale that people will be talking about is the high jump wired stunt that is 130 stories tall at the largest building in the world in the city of Dubai, the BeLerg Tower. This sequence had some serious aerial dares. It's something to speculate on. Another big stunt which opens the film is lighting the fuse and breaking out of a Russian prison. Another big hit with this movie is foreign language humor. Speaking to a person in a different language so you can crack the codes. You speak Russian especially to get inside the Kremlin, if you are a assassin. If your IMF your in disguise. You have to wear that Russian uniform because your under protection of United States Law Enforcement. The Russian bombing on the Kremlin is a big news deal in this movie. Who do they blame the IMF but IMF doesn't realize this. IMF-Impossible Mission Force thinks there the good guys and the bad guys who are terrorists framing themselves and setting IMF up as the bad guys when then they really coming up with good plans to get after the bad guys. complex protocol and procedure in Spy Commando stuff. Tom Cruise is on his best, most planned mission best behaved mission, yet. Tom Cruise had big hits with Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut, Minority Report and War of the Worlds but he's been making a decline lately ever since his little mishap with doing the jump and down kiddie stunt in his chair on the Oprah Winfrey show. Cruise as Ethan Hunt is a powerhouse in this film. He has a billionaire dollars and accessories to go along with his mission and so does Simon Pegg who seems to be a better technician in the field of robotics. Paula Patton is pretty good as the girl. The girl in this one is a hot tie. Simon Pegg like I said is the geek squad guy. Jeremy Renner is interesting coming straight off the Town and Oscar winning drama The Hurt Locker and other roles he's appeared in.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible 4 is very awesome, very action packed. Those Oscars should have a stunt performance category after this film is finished with the BOX OFFICE run."

Well, I'm happy to report that not only was I fully engaged and awake during MI-GP but I was also thoroughly entertained.<br/><br/>Entertained visually with the stunning cinematography, intellectually with a well constructed plot and even at an auditory level with an excellent sound track and correctly micro-phoned actors that could be heard and understood even during those scenes when there was a lot of background noise (explosions, cars crashing, the usual stuff).<br/><br/>Unlike the prior installments, I found the MI-GP plot easier to follow and the sequences more logical and sensible.<br/><br/>I saw it in the IMAX format (it was worth the extra few bucks) along with around fifteen friends and family.

","Fortunately, there were a lot of things to like in this installment of the M.I. franchise. Tom Cruise, as usual, did a great job in the lead role, the chemistry among the team members was decent, if not great, and the overall look and feel of the film was good.<br/><br/>The negatives for me were few, but nearly overwhelming. The Simon Pegg character's comic relief moments were too many and over the top. The chemistry among the team was decent but not great. The female leads character, when she tried to do the seduction thing, was weak. And, the really big problem, for me anyway, was the fact that any and every thing that could go wrong did. A few mishaps in their strategy, or a few gadgets not working as planned is one thing, but just about every single angle they tried to play went badly wrong in one way or another. I don't know about anybody else, but for me, I have a much harder time suspending my disbelief when the Mission Impossible team is constantly screwing up and having equipment failures and nearly blowing the whole thing repeatedly. Of course, this results in another problem, that every scenario goes down to the absolute last second to barely succeed, really? Plus, the villain was weak and not developed as a character at all. Also, the ending was way long and overly schmaltzy.<br/><br/>Anyway, it was all saved for me by Tom Cruise and Jeremy Renner doing a great job with the action, even if it was over-directed. Otherwise, I would have given this a much lower score."

","Just to give you a baseline I loved the first MI, wasn't crazy about the second and thought the third was above average. So going off that I'm marking MI4 the second best in the series and easily the best action movie of 2011. What I loved about this movie is that it was almost like a James Bond movie as far the 'feel' of it goes. Great action, great spy team chemistry, cool effects and storyline. The bad guy really didn't dominate the movie and that gave us more time to focus on the team and the mission. I have nothing bad to say about this one other than the fact it was somewhat of a BMW commercial at times but whatever, at least it was upfront about selling out. Looks great in IMAX."

There is more comic touch to the movie compared to other MIs. Tom is defiantly is in his mozo and has given another wonderful performance. Overall I enjoyed the movies and didn't get bore at all.

The latest addition is terrible but by no means does it have the engrossing effect of the first and third movies from the franchise.<br/><br/>For me it's biggest flaws were it's villain (Hendricks character is not developed and not played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman), it's supporting cast (Not a patch on previous teams and characters) and the lack of emotional involvement (romance or family storyline, something that you can relate to or care about). I was so excited to see Jeremy Renner after really enjoying The Hurt Locker but his role wasn't developed enough. A lot of the character development felt forced. I thought if Jeremy Renner was the bad guy it might have been better.<br/><br/>It's not all bad though. The action sequences were pretty good and there was some good comic relief from Simon Pegg, albeit not quite fitting in with the franchise and genre.<br/><br/>I guess in summary, all I can say is I was sadly disappointed.

"Legendary_Badass","7","1","6","18 December 2011"," A 2 Hour BMW Commercial
","Operative Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is back in action in Brad Bird's live action directorial debut. The Pixar famed director joins the superstar on this jaunt across the Eastern hemisphere. The Impossible Mission Force is dissolved after taking blame for a bombing. Ethan and his remaining colleagues must attempt to prove their innocence while also averting world war.<br/><br/>Their first stop takes them to Dubai. The team has a brilliant plan ready, but a change put Ethan outside of the Burj Kalifa, the world's tallest building. Not only is it amazing to see a person climbing and swinging across this buildingâ€”screw computersâ€” but that Tom Cruise does his own work makes for heightened suspense. This is even followed by a foot and car chase under the cloak of a sand storm. Either of these make for a memorable signature event.<br/><br/>Beneath the thrilling daredevil action lies a critical problem. The screenplay for Mission: Impossible â€“ Ghost Protocol works to set up chases, gunfights, and stunts. Some of the characters have backstories that stretch back as far as the last installment, which is acceptable, but the villain of the film is nothing but a haphazardly written necessity. Do you need a bad guy for Ethan and co to take down? Yes. Does Michael Nyqvist play this part? Yes, but only to the most minimal of requirements. In Hendricks, a man who made some speech about how nuclear war would bring world peace, there is no gusto. He's a shell with no fire inside. Hendricks lacks a believable motive, has no emotions, memorable lines, etc. One of the first things anyone writing an action thriller should know is to make a quality villain. Without effort in this area, others suffer. Our simple villain has an uninspiring plan.<br/><br/>Product placement is nothing new, but BMW's involvement in Mission: Impossible â€“ Ghost Protocol deserves scrutiny. There have been BMW sponsored Bond films, but that didn't mean that nearly everything he touched became a BMW. In Ghost Protocol Ethan his struck by a BMW, then hops into one to pursue. He even gets access to a prototype concept car (despite his team being supposedly cutoff) and is able to make use of a new Bimmer inside a jukebox- style automated parking garage. Every car serves to show off a safety feature, it's like a 2 hour commercial.<br/><br/>There have been three consistencies with the Mission: Impossible film franchise. One of those is Tom Cruise. Another is the transformative power of masks used throughout the series, allowing spies to take on identities with perfect accuracy. This has always been achieved by having an actor play double, but the process of constructing masks changes with each installment. Here the fun is in not getting around to using them. The last consistency has been Luther, Ethan's right-hand man played by Ving Rhames. Initially I was upset that someone who had survived three of these movies couldn't make it into round four as his name doesn't appear among the cast, but rest assured Luther makes a proper appearance.<br/><br/>Ethan's support staff has the usual stock of characters. Paula Patton is the hot tough chick Jane. Simon Pegg returns to lend comic relief and work gadgets. Meanwhile Jeremy Renner is Brandt, an analyst who falls in with the team but of course has a secret.<br/><br/>Mission: Impossible â€“ Ghost Protocol works to establish spectacle. The stunts and effects are awe-inspiring. Seeing Tom Cruise scale the Burj Khalifa is worth the IMAX enhanced admission price alone. As a narrative, it falls flat. The execution of the plot is amiss. The silly logic of the foe lacks credulity. Even the comedic efforts are underwhelming, particularly from womanizer Brij Nath (Anil Kapoor). Shame there isn't more under the dust storm."
"kgprophet","6","1","6","16 December 2011"," More Bond than Bourne
","Although I have this mild complaint, I give this film a rousing positive review. Brad Bird turned what was a more gritty MI:3, where Ethan's wife was being threatened, and there was a fair amount of violence, into a more light-weight roller coaster ride. This film suffers a bit from the older James Bond films, where a lot gadgetry that could not possibly really work brought down the realism of the film. The newer Bond films wisely disposed of all the gimmickry adding more gravitas to the peril our heroes are facing, such as the 'Bourne' franchise. Throughout most of this film, despite being shot and slammed against hard objects, everyone jumps back up and dusts themselves off. There is also the situation where someone could rappel down a wall with a simple rope, instead wears some magnetic suit and needs a remote rover to be driven around. I felt the film featured these electronic toys too much as a crutch for propelling the action scenes. Another mild criticism is Jeremy Renner's character. I think he deserves the accolades given to him and the film benefits from his involvement. However, knowing him as a far more tougher guy from ""Hurt Locker"" and ""The Town"", it is little hard to believe him as being a little skittish in this film. The third act gets a little over-the-top and Jeremy Renner's big secret turns out to be a little underwhelming. The handling of other character's personal lives is virtually nonexistent. One other piece of criticism that was hard to shake was the very core of the central plotÂ….Slight Spoiler ahead: <br/><br/>The IM team is trying to stop someone from using stolen Russian launch codes to launch a nuclear missile. Can't the Russians just change the codes? <br/><br/>Spoiler finished.<br/><br/>Now the good news. There is a great surge of energy throughout this film. It is a ""blink and you miss something"" type of pacing. I think the co-producer J.J. Abrams can be thanked for creating just about the right tone for a summer popcorn movie (even though it's being released in December). I enjoyed the big screen set pieces and especially enjoyed the incidental bits of setbacks and humour. For instance, there is moment where Ethan forgets to take off his goggles that has a payoff later. The action set pieces are still over-the-top, but designed in such a way as to provide maximum thrills. Normally I would go into greater depth about this film, but the truth is that there is not any award-winning observations to make. The wall-to-wall music is punchy in the right places, the cinematography is nice looking, the sound effects are well done, the acting is fine, etc. I place this as perhaps 2nd best of the franchise next to MI3, only because we get some better character development out of that one."
"WydeOpen","7","1","6","16 December 2011"," A sequel up to par with the others in the franchise (and genre)
","In 1966 there was a hit television show called Mission: Impossible about an elite covert unit which carried out their assignments with high-tech equipment and elaborate deceptions. Some may argue that this show may have drawn the blueprint for most spy TV shows and movies to follow.Â <br/><br/>30 years later, Paramount Pictures brought the Mission: Impossible to the big screen with Tom Cruise as the major star headlining the action which had been cranked up several notches. The gear the unit used was now ultra-high-tech and the deceptions were mind blowing. Almost all spy/action movies that followed, including the two Mission: Impossible sequels were built based on the design of the 1996 blockbuster.Â <br/><br/>But the times, they are a'changin'...well, sort of.Â <br/><br/>In recent years the James Bond franchise was rebooted, making it more ""contemporary"" by casting Daniel Craig as the latest actor to play Bond in a long line of 007's. For the better part of the last decade, Jason Bourne, played by Matt Damon has pretty much dominated the spy movie genre with Hollywood's rendition of The Bourne Trilogy, a series of novels by Robert Ludlum. Damon has gone on record as stating he will not return for another turn as the amnesiac assassin.<br/><br/>I bring up these two points because Mission Impossible â€“ Ghost Protocol, the fourth installment in the Mission Impossible saga that has spanned 15 years, was rumored to be a reboot due to the feeling from critics that the ""franchise is played out and its star over- exposed"" after the Mission Impossible III was released. Well, Tom Cruise is back as not only the star but also a producer along with J.J. Abrams who also directed the the last installment. With that being said, not much is different about ""Ghost Protocol"" (which obviously not a reboot) from the three previous films.<br/><br/>What it is however, is a convincing testament to the capabilities of IMAX technology to capture breathtakingly beautiful landscapes and adrenaline pumping action sequences. Thankfully both director, Brad Bird (The Incredibles) and cinematographer Robert Elswit showcase how IMAX is a serious rival to the over-saturation of 3D movies that have flooded theaters in recent years. As with any successful spy film, the script toes a fine line between being too complex and intricate for audiences to follow and too simple and superficial to adequately motivate viewers into committing their time and money. In this case, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and the entire Impossible Mission Force has been disavowed by the US Government for alleged terroristic acts against the Russians. It is up to Hunt and his team to prove their innocence while simultaneously save the world from a mad man bent on starting a nuclear war.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, not much is different from this film than the others (or any ""good"" spy film for that matter) other than the team of agents whom Hunt works with. Paula Patton (Just Wright) plays Jane Carter, an agent with a personal grudge motivating her involvement with the team. Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker) plays as IMF analyst who gets accidentally gets involved in the mayhem. Rounding out the team, is Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn, the teams technical analyst, a role he reprises from the last Mission: Impossible III. And although Ving Rhames has been mentioned as being the only other actor other than Cruise who has been in all four ""Impossible"" movies, I was very disappointed that he only has a minuscule cameo about the same length of Josh Holloway's (Lost) brief role.<br/><br/>Last year Tom Cruise spoofed his Ethan Hunt character in last years ""Knight and Day"" showing a bit of a comedic side to his often criticized image, but in M:I Ghost Recon, it isÂ Pegg who at many times serves as a welcome comic relief, playing foil to Cruise's stoic demeanor and attitude.Â <br/><br/>Unfortunately, Patton who flirted with an action role in ""Deja Vu"" never looks completely comfortable or convincing in her portrayal of an super secret agent just never comes across as more than her ""pretending"". However there is a scene where she does shine briefly, sharing the screen with Anjil Kapoor from Slumdog Millionaire.Â <br/><br/>Renner on the other hand, may be the one who reveals Paramount's hand as far as the future of the M:I franchise. Once Cruise or studio executives or audiences decide its time for someone other than Ethan Hunt to lead the team, William Brandt will be a capable replacement, assuming the capable Renner is the actor playing the part.Â <br/><br/>Overall, Mission:Impossible Ghost Protocol plays to its strengths; action, action and more action but I cannot understate how much the IMAX experience really enhances the viewers immersion into the film. Not only visually, but the sounds of the film come across as another character.<br/><br/>If you're already a fan of Mission: Impossible franchise, go see this installment which is up to par with the others (and the other aforementioned action/spy movies). If you aren't however, don't be afraid to venture out and be amazed at the technology that elevates this movie to being the most memorable out of the Mission: Impossible movies."

","In director Brad Bird's first live action film, ""MI:GP"" succeeds what it sets out to do. It is a tight action spy film with some great sequences and awesome gadgets. Brad Bird is the director of some truly excellent films; albeit they are animated, but great none the less. His films like ""Ratatouille"", ""The Incredibles"" and ""The Iron Giant"" were all wonderful animated films with a lot of heart and good direction. Bird has proved to this reviewer he has the skill for live action feature films.<br/><br/>""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" brings us back to our hero Tom Cruise while he is locked up in a Russian prison. Of course the inevitable happens and he is broken out of jail in a really great opening sequence. Cruise and team assemble; their mission, prevent a nuclear launch. Unfortunately, their plans are curbed when the team is implicated in a massive bombing. The President decides to initiate ""Ghost Protocol"" which completely dismantles the ""IMF"" and paints Cruise and team as rogue agents. Their new mission, clear the IMF's name and save the world. Pretty basic stuff for a Mission Impossible movie.<br/><br/>Pretty basic, yes, but what a ride it is. First, I'd like to congratulate the scriptwriters on finally making a M.I. film with a tight and aggressive script. There was hardly a dull line in the entire movie. With the writers having primarily a television background they were able to get their points across quickly and effectively. Second, is of course the action sequences. Realistic, invigorating, suspenseful....just downright awesome. It is surely a fun ride and if you have a chance to see it in IMAX you will be blown away during the Dubai sequences. Location is another gem in this movie; Dubai, Russia, India are beautifully shot and give some very nice eye candy. But for me, the highlight were the gadgets and spy sequences, it wouldn't be a Mission Impossible film without great gadgets right!? Ghost Protocol doesn't disappoint. From gloves that stick to glass, visual projections and everything in between there is some really cool stuff in this film.<br/><br/>I can't go without commenting on Tom Cruise doing his own stunts. Regardless of what you think of him on a personal level, one has to admit him doing his own stunts was pretty incredible. There are some really hairy situations he gets into and I was very impressed he went the extra mile, I think it helped knowing he was actually doing the stunts while I was watching. I would say overall the acting was good, but not overly impressive. This isn't a drama film after all so I'm not taking any points away. Why would you go to a Mission Impossible movie for great acting? You go for the action, and if you keep that mindset, this film will be worth your time and money."

Perhaps it is little too long, but there are so many impressive things about it. The plot may have a sense of familiarity about it, but what Mission Impossible- Ghost Protocool does is make the film as inventive and as relentless as possible knowing this.<br/><br/>The visual spectacle is faultless I have to say. The gadgets are suitably outlandish, anyone here love the retina-based video-screen, the film is shot and edited in a stylish fashions, the stunts such as Cruise dangling off the Burj Khalifa tower are amazing and the special effects dazzling. Brad Bird(director also of the wonderful Iron Giant and the excellent Pixar films Ratatouille and The Incredibles) does a very capable job directing, making everything as gripping as possible.<br/><br/>I very much liked the music too which helps to enhance the action and what not. The dialogue is tension-filled and the humour doesn't jar too much, the film is much better paced than the third film(which I found rather sluggish at times) with some scenes going at an exhilarating rate and the characters while not the most compelling ever are much less cardboard than the previous two outings in my opinion. The story as I've said may be familiar, but again much is done to make us not think too much of this, and if there was one thing that it improved over the original it was that it was less convoluted.<br/><br/>The acting was fine, with Tom Cruise giving perhaps his most comfortable performance of the series, Jeremy Renner is a great new addition and Simon Pegg gives some well-timed comic relief. The villain was good as well and solidly played by Michael Nyqvist, if not as well-written or as well-performed as Owen Davian superbly played by Phillip Seymour Hoffmann.<br/><br/>All in all, I loved it and consider it the best sequel since the original film and even surpasses it. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

","I think you're either a MI3 person or a MI Ghost Protcol person and I am certainly the former. Although with the amount that the people I was with were laughing and enjoying, it's easy to appreciate this feel-good, fun, popcorn blockbuster for working its particular brand of magic.
Brad Bird paints in broad strokes with everything, the shots and cinematography, the music, the dialogue and plot and even down to the villain who is easily as bad as 2's Sean Ambrose despite being bland as a box of fluff.
The almost science fiction approach to the gadgets means that this film stands out in my mind, Bird making a stab at a fun Bondian Cold War entry with a Roger Moore vibe. But I'm waiting for some big secrets or revelations following the last film's constant tension and upmanship, and there really isn't. It's pretty straightforward which, with the potential of this franchise to subvert and eschew audience expectations, is a shame.
And then there's the constant japery that I have to say felt wrong almost all of the time to me. And there's the strange collection of fairly anonymous side characters that turn up like comedy versions of leads from other films.
Cruise looks like he's too busy and he's slotting his work into reshoots and then there's the bland Renner and the whole franchise's attempt to slowly wring Cruise from the series that failed so badly it left Renner out of the latest one.
Bird shoots long and interesting scenes that take their time and don't require complex preamble, the Mission structure all play out in front of you and it's easy to follow and heightened at the same time.
Good to see Julia for a short moment but the tacked in ambiguity is annoying.
Unfortunately despite the film's merits, all of which I note, but not many of which I enjoy, I have to say that I find Ghost Protocol to be a big, bold, broad let down. The second half is entertaining and beautiful and the sandstorm sequence is bloody good. But it ain't enough.
That Max reference is baffling, and that bit with the Kremlin is unforgivable CGI though, looks less realistic than something from The Incredibles.
Impossible Mission: I suppose it has to be the Burj Khalifa. Despite the structure of the diamonds scene, the Burj is the big stunt. Ghost Protocol may be the first film in the series to properly delineate between the impossible Mission and the big teaser/poster/flagship 'Stunt'. The Burj is bold in imax and cool but a little contrived. The Winstrom/Moreau sequence is a clever brisk little sleight if hand with a low tech vibe and it escalates to an action sequence pretty seamlessly."

As such it made perfect sense for him to helm a film in one of the biggest spy franchises there is.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, spy master extraordinaire. This time he and his team are on the run as their organization disavows them after a mission gone wrong. So it's up to them and them alone to stop the end of the world by nuclear annihilation.<br/><br/>What I like the most about this film are its locations and how tightly it's written. We travel all across the world and every single location is new, exciting, iconic and filled with superb action scenes. This is a film that makes me think that we should give more action films to animation directors. Bird has this fantastic way of filming stuff that really pulls you in. You always feel like you're there, in the room, with the heroes. And you can follow what they're doing and why they're doing it without the film having to cram it down your throats with exposition. The film's heavy reliance on practical effects only helps.<br/><br/>And it's a superbly written film. From the very first scene we're back in business. The scenes build on top of one another and there's nary a moment or line of dialogue wasted. Very much a movie that rewards its viewers when they pay attention. Once again, the film is surprisingly light on exposition, yet you can follow it just fine. And that's harder to pull off than you'd think.<br/><br/>Fantastic film. Easily my favourite Mission Impossible film and probably my favourite spy film in general. Give Brad Bird all the projects from now on."

","This is my favourite of the Mission Impossible franchise for many reasons. First reason is the suspense, each and every scene is filled with suspense, be it the scene in Kremlin or where Tom cruise and Jeremy Renner board a train or burj Khalifa ascent and the scenes following it or the climax fight in automobile parking. Action is always the talking point of mission impossible but the action scenes have never been this better.
But the movie has it's own share of problems. Anil Kapoor's role was not well fleshed. The Mumbai portions were drag (it only takes a fifth gear in the climax fight) especially when it is coming after stupendous Dubai portion."

With all new practical stunts such as Tom Cruise climbing Burj Kalihfa. A smartly written and engaging story with heaps of new gadgets and locations, the humor is back aswell with that iconic banter between all of the characters.<br/><br/>It is the best action film of 2011 and just has a fast moving and engaging plot with few scenes that drag or leave you feeling bored.

There is a beauty to the structure that is interesting even though there's really nothing beyond that.<br/><br/>I hadn't meant to watch any more MI films after being underwhelmed by the first two, and only watched this because director Brad Bird has made some interesting movies (although he's written his best movies, and did not write this one).<br/><br/>Like the previous movies, the movie is visually monochromatic (even the Indian scenes use a limited color palette) and the characters are bland and muted. There are a lot of very popular action series I would describe this way (like the Bourne movies) so it's clearly something some people really like, but I like my action more colorful (i.e. Raiders of the Lost Ark or something by Jackie Chan).<br/><br/>What made the movie enjoyable was it's intricate action scenes, like a chase through a sandstorm and a fight in an automobile factory. Scenes like these were enjoyable pieces of clockwork, as is the script itself, which is a tightly constructed series of plans turning to disasters.<br/><br/>There is also a solid non-action sequence in a hotel that is the truest thing I've seen to the original TV series, which was not about action but was more of a series of fancy cons.<br/><br/>It's certainly not a great movie, but it is a mindlessly enjoyable one."

Characters are very charismatic and they seem to be the best choice for the movie. The relationship between the team is something very attractive in this movie.
Action scenes are great, they're in their better as well. The movie only lacked a little bit of romance. But that was something kind of good to variety.

","I have seen this film when it first came out, thought it was of mixed quality, but was definitely impressed with Tom Cruise's jogging on the side of the skyscraper...
Having re-watched the film on TV some time ago, I thought what is the matter with casting directors these days, casting Tom Wilkinson as head of IMF? he has very few lines and his scene doesn't exceed 5 minutes, couldn't this role be played by a veteran American actor, not necessarily an A star but someone among hundreds of US aging semi-retired actors in their fifties or sixties? I have nothing against Tom Wilkinson he is a fine actor in his own right, but really, seeing him here, one only sees ""Tom Wilkinson"" and not some tough rugged guy who supposedly had previous field ""impossible"" missions, so, why overlook so much talent out there from Uncle Sam's family who could have been much more credible and perfectly fit the job?"

","The Mission: Impossible series has been on a quality roller coaster over its four-film run. Brian DePalma's original was slightly above mediocre, John Woo's follow-up was just bad, and J.J. Abrams elevate the series with the third installment. The latest, directed by Incredibles and Ratatouille veteran Brad Bird, lives up to its director pedigree with style and substance never before seen in the series. In terms of storyline, this is the most audacious MI yet, by far. There is a man who wants to start a nuclear war to bring about the next mass extinction to advance life on earth. Sounds simple enough, but if you have seen the other films, you know that these are the highest stakes yet. This fact, of course, necessitates big action pieces, with which Ghost Protocol also steals the series crown. Nearly every set-piece moment in the film will stick with you long after they have passed. A jail. The tallest building on Earth. A sandstorm. A party. A server room. A parking garage. Anyone who has seen this movie and reads those words should recall these scenes instantly. The plot is surprisingly deep, especially for an MI film. There are numerous mini-twists, many of which put major characters in a completely new light, something many ""plot twists"" nowadays cannot say they have done. The final one at the end is one that I certainly never saw coming, and ends the film perfectly.If nothing else, this film proves that action films are plenty capable of having substance to match the style. And what style there is! Brad Bird's deft direction and obvious talent is clear everywhere in this movie. His skill at directing animated films has seemingly paid off in spades, because generally, in animated films, no action equals tedium. This does not feel like the director's first live-action film. It feels like he has been doing this kind of thing for years. The final thing of note is the acting. Each of the four main characters does a great job filling their roles of genre stereotypes. There's the hero, the funny-and-smart guy, the sexy woman who's also a hand-to-hand combat expert, and the mysterious one who knows way, waaay more than he initially lets on. They're all here, but the the actors (and actress) do fantastic jobs with their roles and script, frequently making the writing appear better than it actually is. Oh, and one actor from Lost is a surprisingly important minor character in Ghost Protocol. Anyone here who has seen the show (I know you're there) will instantly recognize him. Overall, this was an extremely solid spy thriller that is the perfect complement to something like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Loud, over the top, and bombastic, Mission Impossible is back and better than ever. You don't want to miss this."

"TheGreatMarkukini","8","0","2","24 June 2019"," Tom Cruise unleashed
","As Barney Stinson said the fourth movie of the Mission Impossible series is the best. For me it's great but not perfect, breathtaking but not stellar, terrific but not ideal. The level of dedication to the franchise is unbelievable though.<br/><br/>Well, you might say that I have given a very disturbing description. What is wrong with me? To justify such a vague talk I would say that many moments despite their fantastic implementation left holes in the plot that I had a brief moment of confusion, however, everything disappeared with a gasp coming out of my mouth.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise brings the film to the whole new level with the stunts - showing off his unhuman capabilities in real life while deciding to shoot the unspeakable scenes as close to reality as possible; with the plot creators push the threat to the point where Ethan Hunt just cannot miss. It sounds cool but as always, the Achilles' heel of a franchise is a simple chance - many things just pop up by themselves, and considering that Simon Pegg is from Britain one might think that a sneaky leprechaun made his way from Ireland to boost the team's luck.<br/><br/>Admiring the feats of cast and creators to bring the viewer the never seen before experience I would honestly say that they succeed every time. Still shaking off the intensity of several scenes in the movie that show the perfect atmosphere building and now I am extremely eager to see what waits for Ethan Hunt around the next corner."

","'Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol (2011)' lightens the tone slightly but introduces the biggest stakes of the series, although these do feel slightly 'cartoony' and somewhat intangible while also being perpetrated by a fairly weak and barely present villain. The flick refines the well-established formula pretty much to a tee, becoming a bombastic and action-packed adventure throughout that feels very much akin to a fair-ride, one that knows its audience and gives them as much fun as it can possibly muster. 'Fun' very much feels like the name of the game here, with a throw-back and slightly 'knowing' vibe perpetuating the piece. It almost wants to physically 'wink' at the audience but still plays things pretty much straight, which makes the experience very enjoyable and rewatchable, even with its few problems becoming more evident every time you see it. The most pertinent of these problems seems to be the almost complete lack of personality displayed by the flick's star, which is a strange and slightly disconcerting issue that makes deeper emotional attachment difficult. Still, the 'team' more than makes up for it here. In fact, they outshine our hero, with each cross-cut back to the gang becoming more and more welcome as the run-time goes on. Overall, the movie is always fun and has some fantastic action. 8/10"

","This movie begins in Budapest with an IMF agent being killed and a folder containing Russian nuclear codes subsequently taken from him. The scene then shifts to a Russian prison where ""Agent Ethan Hunt"" (Tom Cruise) is being incarcerated and a new mission to free him is underway. Once this is accomplished he is given a new team with a mission to infiltrate the Kremlin and obtain files related to the person code-named ""Cobalt"" who they believe stole the nuclear codes. Unfortunately, this mission is seriously compromised and results in a horrific explosion which attracts world attention. Not only that, but Ethan is once again captured by the Russians. However, being extremely skillful in escape and evasion he manages to get away and rejoins his team-only this time they are isolated and disavowed due to the aftermath of the disastrous Kremlin break-in. This leaves Ethan's team with few options other than to try to thwart ""Cobalt"" from starting a nuclear war between the United States and Russia-with everybody out to get them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an exciting movie with plenty of action and suspense all the way through. Admittedly, some of the scenes were a bit over-the-top but I suppose that's to be expected from Hollywood in this day and age. Be that as it may, I enjoyed this film and I have rated it accordingly.

","I don't like action movies and I have an allergy to Tom Cruise, ""Mission Impossible"" is pretty much stupid franchise and... this movie is great. It is fast, but easy to follow. The plot is typical for an action, it's almost completely linear, but nicely put and shot. The action keeps you at the edge of your seat from the beginning to the end. What I liked the best is the fact that Tom is not superman anymore. So far he was unbreakable and unstoppable and his plans were perfect. Now we see his plans go south and he has to reorganize as he goes. Also, he gets seriously hurt in tougher fights and he has to move forward with abilities limited by his injuries. That makes the movie more convincing and Tom more likable and the whole movie is a lot more interesting, because you start to worry for him instead of being bored by knowing nothing could happen to him. The best part of the franchise so far.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>I rated it 8, but it is an ""action 8"" and cannot be considered the same level with for example drama rated 8. It is very high on action movie scale, but not so high overall."

","After making three great animated feature films such as ""The Iron Giant,"" The Incredibles,"" and ""Ratatouille,"" Brad Bird now makes his directorial debut on making a live action movie and what you know it he accomplished it. So the movie is about that the bomb when off by blowing up the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia as the IMF is shut down which now makes Ethan Hunt and his team to go after the bad guys that caused the Kremlin for being bombed. This was my first film to see a Brad Bird movie in theaters, because I never saw his other three movies as I mentioned them in the beginning of this review. I know Bird's first film ""The Iron Giant"" is coming back this year on September 30th and October 4th, so that might be the perfect time to see one of his earlier films. With that said, I thought the premise of the movie is well told and I thought the movie does have a good mixture for balancing the action and spy genre aside what the other three movies did. Even though, I enjoyed them but this one balances both, and it succeeds it really well. The cinematography is wonderfully well shot, and really loved how it was filmed. The stunts in the movie are fantastic, especially where Tom Cruise is climbing onto a building. Again, the stunts are fantastic. The cast all did great, particularly for Cruise who is still giving a great performance, and doing most of his own stunts. Always being awesome. Jeremy Renner is in this movie, and I thought he was really good too. The rest all did well. The other actors from the first three movies are in this, but only there for a cameo. Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell from the first three movies only appears at the end, and so does Michelle Monaghan as Ethan's wife Julie. At first, I thought they either broke up or Julie dies, but Ethan tells Brandt that he had to fake his wife death in order to keep her safe and does not want to loose her like what happen in the third movie. Also, I was anxious if both Ethan and Julie would see each other, and they actually have until Ethan continues on with the next mission. Thank goodness that these two did not break up, because I actually love those two for being together and it never got me mad like what I had with the third ""Transformers"" movie where they make both Shia Labeouf's and Megan Fox's character break up. Hated that! So I am glad that they did not break up in this movie. Michael Giacchino's music is also good too, and I may like his arrangement of the theme song more than I had with the third one. Now to the problems that I had with this movie. My only issues with the movie is that I did not see this movie in IMAX. Why is it a big deal? Well, seeing it in a regular theater is okay but I thought it would've been something to see in IMAX as the movie did feature some scenes that were filmed with IMAX cameras. Also, I was disappointed that the Blu Ray didn't have those scenes that were filmed in IMAX. I would have love to see to scenes in IMAX. Maybe this movie might be reissue in theaters or on Blu Ray so I can see the way how they were actually filmed. Heck, I would've love it to see the movie again on the big screen so that I can enjoy those scenes in IMAX. Same thing with Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. My other complaint is the villains. I don't think they were as interesting, nor as entertaining as I had with the other villains in the first three movies. Whether they're three dimensional or not, I still enjoy them. These villains don't have that much of a presence for the movie, nor they add anything new to the table; they're just there and you really don't care about them at all. So those are my only issues with the movie. Overall, I enjoy ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" and I give kudos to Brad Bird on making his first live action movie. Mission accomplished on making a great ""Mission: Impossible"" movie. I give this movie a 9 out of 10."

It's been a while since I saw a climatic fight sequence go on so long and yet never get boring. <br/><br/>It's a popcorn movie to be sure. The few brief attempts at emotional depth and back-story are probably the least successful element. The over-all plot feels like a leftover from a 1980's James Bond film. And it's not a film I can imagine the need to go back to and re-see. I don't think there are extra layers to be uncovered, and the very nifty stunt and CGI work can't have the same rush of adrenaline the second time around. <br/><br/>But the action is deftly handled, the tension level high, the images are cool, and I got caught up in spite of myself. At least in a moment to moment way. As long as I didn't start up my bad habit of thinking about the 'big picture'.<br/><br/>And I'll be honest, I'm not a 'summer blockbuster action movie' kinda guy. I'm old compared to the key audience this is aimed at. I'm more at home with the new Woody Allen movie or some dark drama from Russia. So take this review with the appropriate grain of salt.

I thought someone will now say ""Cut!"" and later the real characters will drive through the set because they are in a high speed chase through the city or something. But NO! The first scene was part of the movie! These were actual characters we are supposed to believe in! .........Hahahahaha! The movie does this a number of times, but thankfully most of the humour is intentional, though there may be just a little too much of it. One of the main characters is played by Simon Pegg who is a comedy actor and he acts as a comedy relief character in this, but he is also very much in the foreground taking up just as much time as Tom Cruise's main character. It doesn't hurt the movie, it's just a different tone than the one I expect from these films.<br/><br/>The main premise is a most cliché and unimaginative ever. Something nuclear weapons, crazy bad guy. In fact, anytime any subplots or background story raised their heads, any time the film tried to be emotional, it was a letdown. But who cares? It's not important. Everything plot related is just an excuse for a particular scene and those scenes are well worth it.<br/><br/>The movie looks really impressive. The technology used by the spies looked very cool, as it usually does in Mission Impossible movies. The action and the locations where the action takes place are diverse, from Russian basements to Middle Eastern skyscrapers. Acrobatics are great and Tom Cruise looks in good shape performing them.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise gives it their best as usual. A cool addition to the cast is the Russian actor Andrei Mashkov, who I am really glad is still active in movies, but the movie did not give him much to do and he could have just as easily been cut out altogether. The bad guy is a real disappointment though. There is no strong villain involved, just a guy who appears on screen every now and then, doing his villain stuff, only saying a word or two.<br/><br/>MI Ghost Protocol is a technically very effective action movie, but shallowness of story, a weak villain and a few corny scenes prevent it from reaching higher. If you are in it for good action and nothing else though then it comes highly recommended."
"maxinbxl","8","0","1","31 March 2014"," classic action with lightening twists of humour and humanity
","Highly enjoyable flick, with a bundle of action interleaved with some lightening humour and some angst-ridden character motivation. Personally, I thought it the best of the MI film series to date (followed by 3, 1, and of course 2 last). Belief had to be lightly dangled rather than completely suspended.<br/><br/>An MI team with a pleasingly diverse background and character is backed up by a very well-crafted and engaging supporting cast (the assassin, arms-dealer, Russian crook, Russian cop). Anish Kapoor and his party is something of a forgivable comic turn. The villain perhaps does not get enough development or screen time; in almost all sequences he seems to be trying to make a rapid getaway (you probably see more of his coat than his face).<br/><br/>Mercifully the only appearance of masks was when one went wrong! OK, a prosthetic arm had a major role, and that nose definitely looked fake."

","It is amazing how the director managed to change the style of the franchise, leaving the film much funnier and violent while changing the plot into something more interesting complex, and of course still starring the brilliant Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>I've got my complaints, of course. Mysterious analyst Brandt's, played by Jeremy Renner, dramatic side story is never fully realized, the plot feels half-baked at times, and Paula Patton's acting is lackluster. Also, one can't help but wonder how an aging physicist can keep up with a young special agent physically. Still though, this being an action movie, it fails or succeeds based on the merit of said action sequences and they deliver in spades. From a chase scene in the middle of a sandstorm to a fight in an automotive production facility, the viewer gets the sense that the filmmakers made a serious effort to innovate. <br/><br/>Rather than seeking to impress the viewer based on the quantity of explosions on the screen at any given moment, they instead do so by building tension and maintaining a bizarre sense of plausibility. There are other good things about this movie, like the colorful locales and effective comic relief, but those elements live to serve the effective action sequences. If you'd like to shut your brain off for an hour and a half and enjoy some of the best original action sequences produced in years, then this film would be a solid investment.

"Leofwine_draca","8","0","3","22 November 2013"," High octane thrills make for a thoroughly decent blockbuster
","I absolutely loved MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 3, so I knew the newest and fourth entry in the series, GHOST PROTOCOL, would have its work cut out to enter the same territory. It turns out I needn't have worried; this is spellbinding film-making indeed, a techno-thriller that sets out to thrill and does it very well.<br/><br/>GHOST PROTOCOL is fast, furious and entirely engaging. It kicks off with an intense set-piece and doesn't let up from there, feeling very much like a recent James Bond movie in its globetrotting scenarios and action-packed set-pieces. The extended sequence in Dubai is the highlight, of course, but the rest of the movie doesn't disappoint either.<br/><br/>Cruise is starting to look his age now but he still cuts it as a leading man and there's no faulting his enthusiasm for his craft. The rest of the cast is more mixed, with Michael Nyqvist struggling and visibly out of his comfort zone and Paula Patton unforgivably reduced to mere window dressing, but the reliable Jeremy Renner is on hand to restore order. I still don't get the fuss over Simon Pegg but I suppose he's not too irritating here.<br/><br/>Anyway, the emphasis is on intrigue and bombastic action and who would have thought that animation man Brad Bird would do such a fine job as director? The explosions are loud, the fight scenes are brutal and if there are occasional missteps that veer into silliness, the film always bounces back. Bring on number five!"
"Sergeant_Tibbs","7","0","3","10 July 2013"," Hits all the spots for its genre. Best Tom Cruise blockbuster since Minority Report.
","It's a shame that the Pixar alumni that are branching out to live action aren't flexing the unique and grabbing ideas they explored in animation, as Andrew Stanton releases John Carter and Brad Bird directs here, the fourth instalment of the series, Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocal. While I can't speak for the quality of the former besides judging from consensus, Bird's MI4 is a good enough effort. While a director-for-hire could have competently translated the mostly sharp script, Bird adds a little something extra that make it more watchable, but not necessarily special. Granted, I've never enjoyed the series. I only remember watching the third in the cinema and I also remember not liking it at all. Otherwise, I know the iconic scene in which Cruise hangs in the air by a rope and then another with some explosive gum. I can't speak for how this film fits into the series' general tone, but I can compare it to contemporary blockbusters, and it can gladly stand on top of the post-The Dark Knight/Inception pile. <br/><br/>Like every actioner we've had the past 25 years, there are thrills and exposition behind every corner. MI4 delivers them thick and fast at a pretty satisfying rate with great big action set pieces. Naturally, it's pretty predictable beat-by-beat and our troupe of heroes spend the entire film trying to evade world destruction and only actually stop it at the very last second. I don't understand why people still go to see films like that as all tension is removed. Unfortunately, my least favourite part of the film were the ""spectacle"" moments, when Tom Cruise is in front of a green screen. Just really flat. Movie science aside (in a world where inserting a memory stick is all you have to do and everything is just a couple of taps away from being hacked), there are some really creative and impressive use of gadgets that were really fun to watch, even if they were used in almost unnecessarily convoluted schemes.<br/><br/>While the last film's style was inspired by the Bourne series' shaky-cam, MI4 is perhaps inspired by Inception's slick look and sense of scale. Bird utilizes the full frame at all times and it's wonderfully colourful and dynamic - the only times that sense of scale isn't achieved is when there's obvious special effects flooding the frame. While it does make it compelling to look at, it does lack a lot of intimacy that would make it more involving. But of course, it isn't trying for that. It could've also benefited from more emotional depth from the protagonist, Ethan Hunt but instead, he was just a character that braved everything (besides one thing for a few seconds). He spent the whole film recovering from the wounds of the previous film which was something only developed during the epilogue and for his relationship with a side character, something I found I couldn't connect to. It was the side characters that made the film, particularly as this film has a genuine sense of humour with great funny quips from Simon Pegg's timing and Jeremy Renner's charm. <br/><br/>On a sidenote, it's awesome to see Josh Holloway on the big screen, if just briefly. He even brought a little Lost with him as some mysteries are delivered the same way as in the show by characters or the camera withholding information but it wasn't as drastic as the show. Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocal is an action thriller that hits all the typical marks correctly, which is refreshing after a lot of unsatisfying blockbusters from the past year or two.<br/><br/>7/10"

The movie is still written with the same formula which made the original a success but with some amazing dialogue, back-story and innovative tech.<br/><br/>Packed with dense scriptwriting, intense action scenes, perfectly timed comedic moments (mostly thanks to Simon Cowell) and amazing sets and direction.

In what appears to be his first adult themed effort, he rarely lets up on the spectacle (to wit, Cruise scaling the tallest building in the world in Dubai with a pair of magnetic gloves that flash blue when okay and red when you're fu*ked) while spinning a story that feels a bit over complicated, failing to get from point a to point b like you should in these films.<br/><br/>Still, it's no less the sum of it's parts than the last three films, with a lively supporting cast including Jeremy Renner and Brit actors Simon Pegg and Tom Wilkinson, a mix of old time and up coming that shows a long running franchise could still have some life in it. ***"

","Tom Cruise should either produce or act, not both. To me the movie came across very self-serving to Tom Cruise and all the other actors were meaningless sidekicks just to frame the next scene with Tom Cruise. The movie did have Simon Pegg who is one of the funniest actors ever and one time Simon was able to break the scene away from the ""Tom Cruise"" show to create a funny exchange with one of the other sidekicks and the phrase ""and I will catch you"" :) <br/><br/>The movie does have decent action and nail biting tension scenes for those afraid of heights. It has good pacing and gadgets just not the good chemistry between the actors because I believe Tom is so overbearing. It is time for him to move to directing and stay out of the movies. It is not a bad movie and for a big budget film, $0.80 on the dollar is not a bad return for the film's enjoyment."

","This should have happened yesterday but the cinema failed to update its website despite the screen being closed for two days! Black marks to Cineworld, Hengrove Park.<br/><br/>We shared the cinema with four other people, which might concern some but delighted me. Give me an empty cinema over excited morons with phones and popcorn any day of the week. I don't need 'atmosphere' to experience a film; I save that for the football & tennis.<br/><br/>The short version is: Fun, flawed and the best of the four.<br/><br/>It's certainly a 'sit back and go with the ride' kind of film and doesn't stand up to a great deal of scrutiny. It's good (in a dark kind of way) to watch the Kremlin go boom instead of yet another rehashed White House wipe out and the scenes on the Burj Khalifa are certainly entertaining as long as you don't look too closely at the sandstorm and the background artistes failing to react to it. I enjoyed the ingenuity with which they did the deed inside the Kremlin (I'm trying not to give too much away here) and, as you'd expect with a Mission: Impossible flick, there are plenty of stunts, lots of action and sufficient noise to drown out most of the cheesy dialogue. Most, not all.<br/><br/>Unless you have bucket, it may be advisable to leave five minutes before the credits to avoid the wave of nausea caused by the schmaltzy metaphorical group hug celebrating the true friendship that carried the IMF team through the dark times. On second thoughts, stay, vomit and send it to Mr. Cruise in protest.<br/><br/>There are low points within the excitement, not least of all Paula Patton's periodic impression of a plank of wood. You won't be seeing her at the Oscars any time soon, methinks. The greatest annoyance for me is Simon Pegg. It's not that he's bad; he's not. He plays Simon Pegg better than anyone else I know. It's what he's required to be, as Benji, that raises the blood pressure.<br/><br/>Why, in an action film, does Hollywood think we are too shallow to cope for two hours without a half-assed smile or a childish comment? Does anyone look back at the Roger Moore Bond years with admiration for his unique brand of spy-humour? Pegg's turn in this is almost as painfully, embarrassingly humourless as (the usually fine) Alan Cumming's Boris in Goldeneye. We do not need another computer nerd/inept agent making stupid, childish, groan-inducing comments polluting our films. He isn't funny, he isn't clever and he's completely out of place.

","From director Brad Bird (The Iron Giant, The Incredibles, Ratatouille), most people probably assumed that the third film was the last we would see of the leading actor playing the famous spy who gets himself into high risk situations, since he was fired from Paramount, but no, here was a fourth film. Basically IMF (Impossible Mission Force) agent Trevor Hanaway (Josh Holloway) has been killed, and it is up to Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his crack team of agents, Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Jane Carter (Paula Patton), to pick up where the killed agent left off. The mission they are given is to break into the Moscow Kremlin archives and find information to identify the villain and Russian terrorist calling himself ""Cobalt"" who plans to detonate a nuclear bomb somewhere, but the mission fails when something goes wrong and the Kremlin is blown up. The Russians are blaming the Americans for an attempted attack, and this also forces the IMF to be shut down, but the President puts them on ""ghost protocol"", basically to continue with whatever missions in secret until pace is made, and the team are joined by intelligence analyst William Brandt (Jeremy Renner). Ethan and the team identify Swedish-born Russian nuclear strategist Kurt Hendricks (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's Michael Nyqvist) as the true identity of Cobalt, but he is not able to detonate any nuclear device without the codes which are with Sabine Moreau (Léa Seydoux), so they go to Dubai to stop him. It is there that Hendricks's right hand man Marius Wistrom (Samuli Edelmann) is due to exchange the codes for some highly valuable diamonds, this will be inside the Burj Khalifa, a very high glass building, but first Ethan has to climb the building and get to the meeting point without notice. After managing to get to the level of the building Ethan and Brandt do not have time for disguises, so they go as themselves, and at the same time the real exchange is compromised to avoid real codes being passed to the real people. The mission does not go according to plan as the real codes are taken by Hendricks, who was disguised as Wistrom, and Moreau starts fighting Jane who kicks her out of the window to fall to her death, and while they try to work out the next move there is discussion as to why everything has really happened the way it has. With the help of Bogdan (Miraj Grbic) Ethan and the gang find out that the villain is in Mumbai, and he plans to use a satellite belonging to Brij Nath (Anil Kapoor) to launch his attack with the missile capabilities. Jane gets the deactivation code to stop the device becoming active and to stop it, but Hendricks uses a virus to stop them from using it, so while Jane and Benji try to reactivate the broadcasting to stop the satellite Ethan goes after the villain. Hendricks makes sure that the missile is launched just before he falls to his death, but he is still alive long enough to see his plan fail as the launch is aborted and the city is aimed for is destroyed, and this also proves that the Americans had nothing to do with the Kremlin incident. In the end, after a quick get together with old friend Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames in a brief cameo), Ethan, Benji and Jane are glad that the IMF has been reinstated and look forward to another impossible mission, but Brandt walks away, but he changes his mind when Ethan reveals his wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) did not die, her death was staged, and we even see her at the end just before Ethan walks away. Also starring Vladimir Mashkov as Anatoly Sidorov, Ivan Shvedoff as Leonid Lisenker, Pavel Kríz as Marek Stefanski, Ilia Volok as The Fog and Tom Wilkinson as IMF Secretary. Cruise still gives the aggressive and determined performance we have seen the other three times, as well as doing even more of his own dangerous stunts, Renner is a great new moody addition to the team, and Pegg is great both being clever and giving comic relief one liners, the film is filled with some of the finest eye-catching material, with moments like the climbing of the high glass building, to the still technological gadgetry to carry out the highly risky tasks, with smooth special effects to help make them exciting, this is definitely a return to basics, a terrific action spy thriller.

"yaykisspurr","8","0","1","23 May 2012"," In Mission: Impossible, it's a job...one that happens to include gadgets!
","I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, still he's a consummate professional, a decent actor and knows his abilities well. He plays to these as Ethan Hunt. A negative of the movie is after the team has completed their objective. It felt like a start of a thing instead of an end of a thing. I guess though that's the pointsuck you in for another movie.<br/><br/>Jeremy Renner as ex-agent William Brandt stood out for me. I really enjoyed the subtle play of his character. He really took his role in a fluffy action movie seriously and went the distance in his performance. I did feel like his arc ended with an abrupt thump of his character hitting cement but if you conveniently ignore that, he's great. The best thing about Renner, though, is that he has a really great presence but it's not so aggressive that it fights with the others in the cast.<br/><br/>I feel like Simon Pegg as agent Benji Dunn added a nice comic relief, especially with the e-screen scene where he really shined. Toward the end of the movie I think the writers phoned in his part leaving him rather limp. This isn't his fault by any means, rather it's laziness on the part of character development. Paula Patton as agent Jane Carter was a great feminine element. While she didn't wow me, I didn't hate her either. So many females in action movies are fluffy so much so I was just relieved she actually had plenty of meaty moments. I appreciated her moment to shine near the end of the movie when she needed to seduce Brij Nath.<br/><br/>Léa Seydoux as Sabine Moreau was a good call but rather underutilized and under wowing. Still I did enjoy the scene where they made the trade and the papers copied into the briefcase. Michael Nyqvist as Kurt Hendricks was a no go to me. His most memorable scene was the sand storm scene where he kept out thinking Hunt and in the end gets away. He wasn't really even needed in that final scenewe could have just watched Cruise falling off cars. While the villains didn't wow me they were at least smart (on paper) and driven. Nothing new really, but since when has any evil been branded as fresh?<br/><br/>I was seriously surprised how into the gadgets I got. They really made the movie. With Agent Hunt there was this sense of reality about the gadgets, like they might actually exist or at least almost exist. The connection between story and use of said gadget was very fluid and in the moment. Adding to this sense of realism is the fact the gadgets frequently failed, only working long enough that the agents could improvise. If pressed I'd say my favorite gadget are those gloves as they were part of the best stunts in the movie. The tension from the ""blue is glue, red is dead"" element really kept the forward momentum up. For me the most breathtaking creation of a gadget though is the e-screen that holograms an empty hallway. So creative and yet so simple, this is gadgets done right.<br/><br/>The best scenes had multiple characters, as the best a movie can offer is seeing one character playing off another. I actually liked the sandstorm scene, it was rather unrealistic with it's lack of sand but the idea of it, of pursuing the villain into whatever circumstance you have to in order to get the job done, was a good one. While the plot worked, it didn't blow me awayjust because something works doesn't mean it's beautiful. Ghost Protocol got the job done, cool and proficient.<br/><br/>This is because Brad Bird played to his strengths. Coming from his animation background he understands that each shot has importance, a message and must be connected to the shots on either side. He doesn't worry about creating a huge blockbuster moment but an action sequence that works within the framework of the story. The series of scenes where Cruise is hanging from the tallest building in the world is a perfect example. These scenes are actually rather minor to the actual plot but because of how he composed the shots they became central to the entire story. I believe it's this skill with making unimportant plot matter for both plot's sake and character sake that saves this movie. (It mitigates the lack of motivation present in the characters, both hero and villain.) It does quite a job blowing an action junkie's mind too.<br/><br/>I do wish there was more of a puzzle aspect to the modern Mission: Impossible series. (This is more a writer's purview so I can see why it's lacking here.) There is more to life than the special effects stunt. Nowadays a professional's expertise is played down for the 'everything man' in our modern heroes. On the MI TV show there was a participation from the audience to put together where the different experts fit into the larger plan. (And hence a need for a team rather than a lone agent.) There are no longer any ""ahhhh, I get it"" moments where you are rewarded for taking on the larger cast of characters and the lack of explanation in the setup. We want nothing so complicated as thinking involved in our action flicks and so rely heavily on looking good instead. There is nothing wrong with being hot, but do you really want to spend your life with your brain off to compensate?<br/><br/>There is much to admire in Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol and so much improvement from previous installments. While I long for an action movie with a brain I'll settle for a well thought out brainless version. In the end it doesn't matter, we know how an action driven story like this will play outsince when has the modern action hero not saved the world?<br/><br/>To read more of my review: http://yaykisspurr.wordpress.com/"

It's the outstanding use of picturesque locales combined with the danger of stunts that look amazingly as though nobody could have survived the making of the film. Cruise's spiderman stunt on a high tower glass skyscraper is something to see, as are many of his ""chase and be chased"" stunts.<br/><br/>To enjoy this sort of thing you have to ignore the credibility gaps in the story and simply dwell on the action-filled sequences, some of which look absolutely amazing. The photography is first rate, especially clever at capturing a frantic chase through a sand storm and other such perils that look like a danger to life and limb.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise still looks fit enough to handle most of his stunts and does so with an intensity he always projected as the daring agent. All in all, the film is an example of how to put together an action film with few lulls in its long running time, and one that is sure to please the masses.<br/><br/>One of its saving graces: no shaky camera as in the ""Bourne"" films."

","I don't normally think much of the M:I films. Having watched the TV series as a child, the films didn't have quite the same level of class. I found M:I I through to III to be a trio of watch-able, if formulaic, action films which I wouldn't add to the list of those worthy of a re- watch.<br/><br/>M:I - Ghost Protocol doesn't really break the mould I've laid out above which was set by the previous three instalments. It seems strange then, that I have given this film a rating of 8 out of 10 but the fact that I was expecting another copy of 1,2 or 3 is probably the reason I was so shocked by how good this film was.<br/><br/>Yes there isn't much which ties it to the original series. Yes it's formulaic, even though there are some twists and turns - you generally know how it's going to turn out. And yes, it's still based on Tom Cruise's charisma, as with the first three films. And yet... Everything is so much more impressive this time round. Tom Cruise seems to have shrugged off the nagging 'what the hell were you doing?!' questions from his antics on Oprah and carries the lead role in the film effortlessly. You want him to succeed and he doesn't disappoint. The spectacular action scenes are incredible, it doesn't look to be CGI (which makes the question of whether it is or not irrelevant) and I've never seen a film which has had me believing in the danger which the characters faced as much as this. Finally, the supporting cast provide a solid foundation for Cruise to shine.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed this film immensely. I do worry that my rating was swayed by my low expectations based on the first three but I can only base a review on my own experiences, which were of fully baked action film, brimming with excitement and charm - well worth a watch. Although I probably won't be revisiting it again just yet."

","What really made this movie work is the lack of the super villain like in MI3, I thought Philip Seymour Hoffman ruined MI3 with his cheesy role and thankfully the villain in MI4 is part of the story but not the central focus.<br/><br/>I also like the fact that they got the Ethan Hunt character back on track as a solo, single spy instead of a married spy like in MI3. Hopefully they will keep the franchise going in the right direction especially now that they've introduced the Syndicate as a group that Hunt will be going up against in future movies.<br/><br/>Even though he's pushing 50, Cruise still proves that he can bring an A List action film to the big screen. Hopefully he will keep the MI franchise going over the next 10 years as grows older. He can easily turn his character to a Jim Phelps character and be the team leader instead of always being in the middle of all the action and stunts."

","Would this be the last impossible Mission? Finally watched this latest installment on Blue Ray and i still regret not watching it on the big screen for the sheer magnitude of some of its sequences. Brilliant cinematography coupled with some unbridled imagination gives you a few moments that are really worth it. That said it is difficult to believe that the same writers also came up with some instances that reek of ignorance, racism, and plain oversight. or was it a deliberate attempt to please the Studio Bosses and make it palatable to a certain demographic of audiences.<br/><br/>Coming back to the movie, it really looks like age has finally caught up with Cruise and his subtle attempts at passing on the IMF baton to Renner is evident here. But still you see him diving head first into the thick of things, with full gusto. His enthusiasm and the rakish humor is still evident from his past outings as Ethan Hunt. This time around they are outcast, disavowed and treated as conspirators out to incite global nuclear war. They have to catch the perpetrator of the Moscow incident, their Defence Secretary Murderer, apprehend a renegade Nuclear Strategist, dodge a Smoking Hot Assassin and stop a nuclear device from detonation all while looking cool and constantly moving across the globe. The makers really thought of creative ways of using tech gadgets and some of the sequences are really worth watching twice especially the Kremlin sequence & Khalifa sequence. Simply brilliant.<br/><br/>But having praised them for their creativity, i would also like to thrash them for bringing in idiotic sequences that really put a blot on the entire movie experience. How can they be so unaware and not pay attention to those sequences: camels on Dubai road, (seriously) or the Mumbai sequence (where warnings signs are written in Telegu) or Mr. Kapoor sex deprived caricature of a Telecom Magnate especially when you have a local film crew working with you on these sequences. Why didn't the local crew point out these loopholes to the director when they were assisting him at the respective locations.<br/><br/>From the first installment to the latest, it has been quite a journey for Ethan Hunt and his team, and it seems to the makers that are now looking at a fresh face to carry on the franchise. In my opinion, it would be fatal mistake because people associated Tom Cruise with Ethan Hunt, and Ethan Hunt meant IMF. Now please don't ask me what IMF stands for if you have not watched all the 4 movies. In the end if they do decide to bring in a new face (read as Renner) to carry on the franchise (like he is doing for the Bourne Franchise), i will surely be disappointed, but i am still going to watch it. Because if i don't i wont be doing justice to the this forum. May be i should change the forum tagline to ""WE WATCH EVERYTHING"". Sniggers. In the end, all i can say is ""This message will not self destruct in 5 seconds"". Do catch it on Blue Ray/DVD if you haven't seen the movie yet. It is worth the watch."

","Ghost Protocol was a really good movie with solid acting and interesting characters. Tom Cruise continues to be a great Ethan Hunt and Jeremy Renner's character was solid as usual. Also, Simon Pegg's character added some very nice comedic effect. However, this isn't just any old movie, this is a Mission Impossible movie and while it was better than the third one, it paled in comparison to the first two. Now this movie did have the best continuity of any of the prior films but it also had some of the weakest special effects and some of the most unrealistic fight sequences. Also, while the continuity was fantastic, the ending was terrible. ***SPOILER ALERT*** I honestly didn't have a problem with them killing off his wife. However, why keep her alive with that twist in the end? That was completely unnecessary. It's like if the only reason they did it was to make Ethan Hunt look smart but the drama and emotion of the movie until then worked better if they would've left her dead. I think if they wanted to keep her alive they should've played it off like if Cruise wanted for Renner's character to replace him. Almost like a protégé sort of twist. Nonetheless, this movie was definitely worth watching, I just thought the ending (either way) could've been better."

"bob-rutzel-1","10","0","1","21 April 2012"," Very Good Action Movie
","Blamed for bombing the Kremlin, the IMF is disavowed (no support) by the US government, but Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) knows Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) did the bombing and escaped with nuclear launch codes and Hunt also knows he must be stopped from starting a nuclear war. <br/><br/>It always amazes me that the bad guys want to blow up the planet and don't seem to realize they will go with it. So what's the point? Here's one more thing that amazed me in this story. The IMF is disavowed, but when they go to Dubai and Mumbai they have all the equipment they need to do the job. So where did all the electronics, magnetic climbing gloves etc come from? And, one more thing that is truly amazing: going about 60-mph or more in a crowded downtown Mumbai. That just doesn't happen. Oh, I almost forgot: there is a sand storm in Dubai and Ethan Hunt is chasing bad guy Hendricks in it. I was amazed at how many other vehicles are still in the storm going very fast although everyone (that would be us) can see that no one can see where anyone is going. Simply amazing. Okay, okay, movie magic. I hope. <br/><br/>All the above aside, this is a very good action movie. The fight scenes with or without CGI were excellent. The acting by all is terrific and yes, Tom Cruise actually does his own stunts. If he keeps it up one day he will be watching someone else do those stunts from a wheel chair. Watching him do those stunts, I have only one thing to say: OUCH, OUCH and OUCH! Hey, I checked myself into the ER after watching him perform those stunts in that automatic car park in Mumbai. I could barely move. <br/><br/>We get to see the tallest building in the world in Dubai: The Burj Khalifa building. I got dizzy just looking at it from afar. And, yet Ethan Hunt goes climbing on its windows with magnetic gloves. Again, I couldn't move and tried not to look down.<br/><br/>The action is practically non-stop and there is no time for character development. And, if that is what you are looking for, don't watch action movies. Oh, you get bits and pieces and it's up to you to fill in the blanks. Hey, you did it with the James Bond movies. And, to be honest, this Mission Impossible movie is every bit as good as the Bond movies. And, it has that good MI music too. At the end of this we see that Ethan Hunt now has his IMF team and we should see more of them in future movies. Just hope ""dem bones"" of Tom Cruise hold up. <br/><br/>One of the things I like about the Mission Impossible movies is that when we are told something in the beginning, we buy it and then find out later that what we were told wasn't exactly true. It's like a magician doing his mis-direction thing. I love it, but I cannot tell you what that one thing was. Sorry. <br/><br/>This may be the best Mission Impossible movie so far and was very enjoyable and despite some observations above we, who love action movies, should just enjoy what we have.

","Well, it is official, the newest installment of Mission Impossible franchise is the best action flick of the 2011. Ethan Hunt is now more than ever an equivalent of James Bond, and I believe that this is going to create a similar franchise of movies that will last decades into the future. Produced by J.J. Abrams (Cloverfield, Lost, Star Trek) and directed by Brad Bird this action packed thrill ride shows that a proper sequel of a franchise can be done. Cool action scenes, amazing gadgets, cars and familiar characters create something very rare, a PG-13 movie that feels like a full-blooded R bloodbath. The action is only paused by moments of suspense and it gets better and better as the movie progresses. We will be visiting several exotic locations and buildings (granted, they seem to be popular in any action flick) with the inevitable jump-and-hang-in-air stunt that has become the trademark of the franchise. With ever-changing directors each Mission Impossible movie is different and somehow better. So get ready for some excitement with this one.<br/><br/>Kurt Hendricks is a very bad man, and he has a very sinister plan to start a nuclear war. As always this will involve some Russian nukes and launch codes, and it seems that the nuclear disaster is inevitable. But, there are a few men who might be able to stop this plot from happening. The only problem is that their leader Ethan Hunt is trapped in Russian prison, but after a successful escape the team is on their way to Kremlin to stop Kurt from getting the codes. But from there everything goes to hell, as their plan backfires and they are accused of the break in. With nuclear codes stolen and in the hands of the super-villain they are disavowed from the service. This means that they have to invoke Ghost Protocol (I just love the sound and the feel of these words...)...<br/><br/>Check out my review site Rabbit-Reviews.com for movies that are worth watching, Rabbit out..."

","I have mixed emotions about ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"". I really like that this film has finally abandoned the ""lone wolf"" grandstanding by Tom Cruise and has finally returned to the roots of the series; that being, the Impossible Missions Force is an ensemble effort in which EVERY participant is essential to the success of the mission. That being said, I had some real problems with the cheesy credits (look by Maurice Binder rejects for a Bond movie), plodding script, unbelievable climax and denouement that undermines Ethan Hunt's character with some highly questionable behavior.<br/><br/>However, how can one argue with a movie with outstanding action sequences, breathtaking scenery and camera-work, full-figured women in beautiful dresses displaying lots of cleavage and just the right touches of camaraderie and humor?<br/><br/>Some quibbles, however. How come the IMF in this movie seem better equipped than usual, even when officially cut off from most of their government assets? Also, while the ""rover"" might have a hydrogen fuel cell capable of producing enough magnetic force to levitate a 175 pound man, the magnetic field would be so intense as to probably render the man unconscious, if not kill him outright.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I give ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" a ""7""."

After a long hiatus I have to admit that the series is back with a vengeance. The action and gadgets were great as always and this one seemed more real then the others to me. There were a few call back shots to the other movies which made it more interesting to me. The addition of Simon Pegg really was brilliant and he was my favorite part of this movie.

","This will be a very fruitful viewing experience, should you choose to accept it. Your mission, per the noir model, will be to transcribe protocols from chaotic fate.<br/><br/>What does this mean? Film noir posited a detective or ordinary schmuck riding the waves of an insensitive world and looking to see where the whole is rippling from. The spy film appropriated this as far back as Lang's silent Spione. Our current generation of spy film is a Cold War product, and this is to our benefit as Tinker, Tailor showcased last year. The War over, we understand now that it was not some noble battle for national destiny, but a bureaucratic stack of papers, a fight for the sake of control.<br/><br/>In '33, Lang made The Testament of Dr. Mabuse, a continuation of an earlier silent. It was about a criminal mastermind plotting for control of what characters inside the film experienced as reality. His aim was the Cold War nightmare, and incidentally the aim of the villain in this; renewal from world destruction.<br/><br/>Fast-forward to the present, the point as illustrated here in this film remains; reality is something you control and direct.<br/><br/>Kremlin sequence:<br/><br/>our super-spies infiltrate a high-security vault to retrieve some meaningless info. They achieve the impossible by actually replicating reality, of course costumes and proshetic masks, but much more keenly a canvas screen that projects an illusion of space. I do not know of a more cinematic device used last year. The camera scrolls on the X axis.<br/><br/>Burj Halifa sequence:<br/><br/>our team is only in possession of the time and place of the important meeting where nuclear codes are exchanged for diamonds and lead back to the villainous mastermind. Except they have neither codes nor diamonds to exchange. Once more they control reality, but now pure theater; they appear as who the other expects to meet, the important documents are copied by a cinematic eye, the diamonds by sleight-of-hand, deceit in broad sight. The camera scrolls on the Y axis. This translates in by-now famous acrobatics on the steep surface of the Burj Halifa skyscraper, and also in our tech-guy controlling elevators.<br/><br/>So far so good, both these scenes have erupted in chaotic fireballs or gunplay, but you can see the blueprint of cinematic control. It is very cleverly staged business.<br/><br/>Notice by contrast the other two sequences. One involves even more meaningless high-tech nonsense and just ordinary seduction by the team's femme fatale, the other a purely chaotic last-minute chase. The last desperate action is that Tom Cruise has to crash a BMW from 4 stories high to manage to hit in time the button that aborts the apocalypse.<br/><br/>All four sequences are ludicrous and highly improbably, but the first two reveal a design. The other two are random. Either inspiration run out or they were intended to as counterpoints, one of the two. I'm leaning towards the former.<br/><br/>Either way, the film unfolds a chain of events that ordinary people watching the news experience as chaotic, turbulent universe, the Kremlin bit is asserted by authorities to be an 'accident', but we know, from our position as viewers, that there are protocols in place and being followed. At the crucial point, the entire organization is disavowed by the government and publicly denounced as 'terrorists', agents of random violence. This is how the historical narrative is being written. <br/><br/>The viewer is ordinarily supplied with the fabricated version. We're given both, and the whole fabricated as a good-vs-evil struggle in the outer layers, which is as far as Tom Cruise and corporate suits probably care to look.<br/><br/>But of course the controls go higher up than we ever see in the film. Our team is equipped with the most impossible gadgetry, key info is magically made available by invisible telecommunication systems, operatives are anonymously issued through public phones. We can surmise a massive infrastructure controlling the controlers."

Watching Hunt scale the tallest building in the world in Dubai is just as delicious, especially because Cruise is reputed to do his own stunts. By the way, he keeps from becoming too self impressed at almost every turn with his ironic grin and recurring playfulness.<br/><br/>Along to do the heavy emotional lifting is Jeremy Renner as Brandt, a team member with a questionable past that gives Renner a chance to show off his Oscar-nominated acting chops (from Hurt Locker). Cruise has moments of admirable acting as he emotes about his wife (Michele Monaghan). But the locations like Budapest and Moscow along with the techno treasures are the real stars.<br/><br/>Mission Impossible shows itself to be more durable than ever: Impossible to fail with its winning formula."

","Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol: The movie starts off rather slowly than the other installments of the series. Nevertheless the movie proceeds well and with the attention shifting to Dubai, the movie takes a new high. Brilliantly executed stunts at Al Burj Hotel.<br/><br/>But then soon after the first hour is over, the movie tends to get repetitive with old formula taking hold of the movie, the audience will start getting bored as soon as the movie shifts to Mumbai, India. The action scenes and the climax are the weakest point of the movie. After witnessing the hair raising scenes at Al Burj, the audience will feel let down at the climax which was expected to be more engaging than it is. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise is brilliant at the stunt scenes. Paula Patton acts good but I expected a more gorgeous face ;). Jeremy Renner acts ably while Simon Pegg steals the show with his comic timing. There was a lot of ho-hallo over Anil Kapoor's role which only turns out to be of merely 5 minutes. He is just bout okay, nothing special. <br/><br/>The directions is good while the cinematography work is brilliant. The movie is a visual treat. The action scenes are of top notch. <br/><br/>All in all, a time pass movie which works brilliantly in the first hour and then lets u down in the second. Definitely not better than MI:2 which sailed smoothly till the end. But worth giving it a try. Rating : *** the one extra star is for the Dubai sequence, Man, it was the best thing of the movie :)"
"sir_erwin82","8","0","4","18 December 2011"," very good movie to end up the year 2011
","this is could be the best Mission Impossible movie, compare to the previous three. Show better team work, and the now the movie add some additional scene of joke. For me its worthy to watch, even there's some annoying scene which is to much chasing.however, this movie is so thrill, especially when the scene at burj dubai.<br/><br/>the improvement of the gadgets also good even though the team effort is the coolest thing in this movie. <br/><br/>For the overall story, for me this movie shows very very impossible mission indeed. we can not guess what happen next, so much surprise.<br/><br/>Very good movie to closing the year. This movie has its own style..simple story,"
"duanedeen","7","0","2","18 December 2011"," Enjoyable Action Flick
","I went into this movie with really low expectations after Mission II and III. But I thought maybe seeing the action sequences in Imax would make up for a predictable plot, poor scripting, and the actor's grossly unbelievable capabilities. <br/><br/>I actually was pleasantly surprised that action did exceed my expectations and I could at least follow the plot in this one, maybe because it has been done in so many other movies before, so don't go in expecting a plot with any originality, depth, or character development. <br/><br/>I would really recommend you see this in Imax as it makes you feel as if you are right in the action with the huge screen and super sound, and for that I give this movie a 7 rating and that is only for the action as the rest of the movie would rate about a 3, thoroughly watchable and enjoyable movie, just leave your common sense at the door as usual."
"SydneyAlias1306","9","0","3","18 December 2011"," Cruise and Abrams should give Bender a Mission to accept.
","I've watched first three for another viewing before I went to see fourth entry of the franchise. I went to see fourth entry because I liked what J.J. Abrams did with third entry especially the action and pacing was very insane and hectic that got me invested and interested that John Woo lacked in the second. John Woo did his action scenes pretty well in second but I didn't like the storyline.<br/><br/>It's difficult to judge which one is better than the others because:<br/><br/>Brian DePalma did the first. John Woo did the second. J.J. Abrams did the third...and<br/><br/>now Brad Bird did the fourth.<br/><br/>Brian DePalma did what he was well-known for making it a good suspenseful film with his signatures of camera work. (86/100)<br/><br/>John Woo showed his chops for action but failed on the story.(71/100)<br/><br/>J.J. Abrams revived the franchise in his own way because of his touch with Alias even most of people would claim that this one is too much like a TV Movie of Alias but he did his THING by making impeccable pacing with non-stop action and frantic camera work. (93/100)<br/><br/>Brad Bird came in for his first live-action debut and he did the film so well but in part of me feels that there is something missing here. So, I feel in a way Brad Bird did so well with his execution but the overall film couldn't match the insane pacing that J.J. Abrams did with the third entry, even the third had good character relationships invested into the storyline. I actually fell asleep at some parts during the third act of the film, it's because the pacing felt like it's falling apart that Brad Bird couldn't match to what he did with first two act with well-staged action. (89/100)<br/><br/>Overall, for the execution, J.J. Abrams and Brad Bird made John Woo's entry look like a whimper on action sequences and pacing.<br/><br/>For Mission: Impossible 5, I have a pretty good idea of who will be a good choice to take on the director's chair to take all good parts from previous four to whole new level with more ferocious pacing and well-use of camera work.<br/><br/>The director for Mission 5 should be Jack Bender even he has a long history on directing television but he has the expertise to do it due to his work on Alias and Lost. He has a Jack Ryan film with Chris Pine in the can after Chris Pine completes Star Trek 2. Tom Cruise and J.J. Abrams should give Jack Bender a mission to accept."

","I've seen all the previous ""Mission: Impossible"" films, and while I do recall liking them to varying degrees, I'm hard pressed to say that I remember anything about their plots, characters, stunts, special effects, or even their casts. What I do remember, obviously, is that they all starred Tom Cruise. With ""Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol,"" Pixar veteran Brad Bird not only makes his live-action directorial debut, he's also eager to have you forget the first three entries in the series entirely. He succeeds. This is a fun, thoroughly entertaining, immensely satisfying spy/action thriller. It actually makes an effort with an engaging plot, clever dialogue, pulse-pounding stunts, great special effects, and well-developed characters. It even has just the right amount of humor. If there's anything a movie like this shouldn't do, it's take itself too seriously.<br/><br/>But it also shouldn't be so silly that it becomes a self-congratulatory form of parody. ""Ghost Protocol"" shows a clear awareness of the spy-movie formula, utilizing such clichés as frequent travel, exotic locations, high-tech gadgets and gizmos, impossible stunt work, foreign madmen, nuclear codes, and a scheme to create chaos and war on a global scale. It also makes no apologies for being preposterous, as evidenced by the outlandish displays of technology and numerous scenes of destruction and death-defying escapes. And yet, never once does anyone stop to wink at us slyly. Bird gives audiences what they want without insulting their intelligence. For the first time in what seems like ages, I didn't ask any questions; I just sat back and let the story happen.<br/><br/>Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, an agent for the aptly named Impossible Missions Force (IMF). After being sprung from a Moscow prison, he joins fellow agents Jane Carter (Paula Patton) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) on a mission to infiltrate the Kremlin and gather files on a person of interest codenamed Cobalt, a name somehow tied to the death of another IMF agent in Budapest. But wait a minute. Did I say infiltrate the Kremlin? To describe this feat would only spoil the fun. Let's just say that this kick starts a chain reaction that leads Hunt and his team around the world. The first stop is Dubai, where Hunt is forced to scale the Burj Khalifa using nothing but specialized sticky gloves. In case you don't know, the Burj Khalifa is the world's tallest building, standing at just over 2,700 feet tall. I've never been acrophobic, although I'd be lying if I said that seeing Hunt hundreds of stories high clinging to glass panes didn't make my heart race.<br/><br/>On two floors of the tower, two separate meetings will simultaneously take place. Both are in regards to making an exchange. They each involve people who are either pretending to be someone else or are not wise to the fact that they're being deceived. Here's an example of timing so precise, performances so nuanced, and editing so skillful that the scenes never fail to generate suspense. But mere descriptions can hardly do them justice. The same applies to a surprisingly spectacular car chase, which happens in the middle of a sandstorm. Perhaps we're too accustomed to always seeing the cars in movies like this. And speaking of cars, there's a superbly choreographed showdown in an automated parking garage in Mumbai, where vehicles are lifted and lowered into place via a concrete elevator. There's a lot of jumping, falling, punching, and precarious dangling.<br/><br/>Upping the stakes for these agents is the fact that they're being shadowed by an unknown operative, who successfully got them blamed for a catastrophic explosion in Moscow – which, consequently, has the Russians believing the Americans have initiated an act of war. This calculated move results in the IMF being dismantled from the inside out under a covert operation known as Ghost Protocol. If Hunt and his team are to track down Cobalt and prevent nuclear war, they will have to do it completely on their own. Their actions will not be officially sanctioned by the American government, but then again, even those in power know that a few rules need to be bent in desperate situations.<br/><br/>Along for the ride is William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), an IMF analyst with remarkably good fighting skills. How he came to be a part of Hunt's team, I leave for you to discover. The same goes for the secrets he's keeping from Hunt. What I liked about this character is that he addresses many of the questions audiences are likely to ask themselves. Exactly how does one think of using a dead body and a lit flare to dodge underwater gunfire? Or of wearing a metal suit under your clothes so that you can jump twenty-five feet into a concrete cylinder, be caught mid fall by a magnetized rover vehicle before being shredded by a giant fan, and be dragged floating through a massive computer core? Or of wearing a special contact lens that can take pictures when you blink twice? You've got to love this. ""Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol"" is a mission you should choose to accept.<br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"
"vickykolari-222-154170","8","0","3","16 December 2011"," Its smooth, fast and furious..!!
","Its a prison in Moscow, USSR. Benji Dunn succeeds to hack prison server system and opens lock of a cell gate, a big fat criminal comes out and a guard go to him to get him back to his cell, now Benji opens another gate and prisoners come out and start attacking guard. Many gates get opened and there will be chaos everywhere, there is presence of a person in a dark cell, he knows whats happening, he knows what he has to do, he gets out of his cell and smoothly jumps down one floor. Yes, he is Ethan Hunt of IMF. Ethan goes into the chaos and gets a prison friend of him and manages to fight guards and higher security to get to a room, the floor starts to break and an IMF team member waiting for Ethan down, they jump down and start walking and the Mission Impossible Theme Music starts........... <br/><br/>Its just a start, Mission Impossible's new installment to the franchise offers more action, more adventure and more technology than expected. Its smooth, its fast and its furious..!! One more fine spy movie adds to the Mission Impossible franchise..!! Even though there are some loopholes in the screenplay, especially in the part shot in India, movie goes mind-blowing. The technology, action, stunning performances, locations, cinematography and the MI Theme are enough to say its a MUST- WATCH. Its must watch for action lovers, but those who interested to see just Anil Kapoor or India in this Hollywood flick, i can assure you that you will be disappointing. The concept is not so strong but the gadgets and actions hide the loopholes and wont leave a single dull moment. The technology used in the movie are tremendous. Brian De Palma's MI-1 was standard and brilliant. John Woo's MI-2 was stylish and futuristic. J J Abrams's MI-3 was thrilling and edgy. Now Brad Bird is speed, thrilling, stunts and full of gadgets. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise with his Double Agent attitude, stunts and performance, simply superb. You will fall in love with him when he do the Burj Khalifa stunt. Its a must watch for all, his fans and non-fans. He makes a lot of jumps in movie, almost all the time his finishing of that jump won't be perfect, which makes the movie perfect..!! I loved it.. Newly promoted Simon Pegg who is new addition to the team, is hilarious and your eyes will searching for his appearance all the time. Perfect witty dialog delivery in the very serious moments is specialty of Simon. Jeremy Renner the IMF desk analyst turned IMF team member impresses with his performance.He did wonderful job in The Town and The Hurt Locker. Acclaimed filmmaker of animated films like The Iron Giant, The Incredibles and Ratatouille, Brad Bird succeeds to add another perfect spy action to MI franchise. He succeeds to keep up the fast pace, action and thrills, and the main attraction to bring new technologies which will be used by IMF team. The visionary ideas, imaginations of futuristic gadgets and technology used by IMF team members are brilliant and main highlight of the movie. Some of them will shock you and you will be hungover when you finish the movie. The virtual screen, contact lens printer, glass climber, magnetic jacket and list goes on.. Its a treat for gadget freaks, one step more to Bond movies i can say. Cinematography by Robert Elswit is tremendous. The way he shot from copters or whatever when a new city is introduced or a major building like Burj Khalifa is brilliant. Action scenes will be real-like, and the credit goes to Robert Elswit and IMAX cameras. Concept and story by André Nemec, Josh Appelbaum is good but it fails to impress everybody, movie gets highlighted for the technology used and action scenes, but the concept is not so great, but dialogs are hilarious and its more comic than any other MI movies, but i like this one better. There are plenty of action sequences and its a total treat for action lovers, i thought its one of the best action after Die Hard 4.0. The main action attraction is the stunt by Tom Cruise in Burj Khalifa. It will remain in your mind for long time. Action lovers will definitely won't be disappointed. Right amount of MI theme music in right time make you love this fast paced movie for sure. <br/><br/>For Indians : Brad Bird's team ignored screenplay of the movie in Indian parts. They say that its Mumbai, Maharashtra where Hendricks facilitated the sale of a defunct Soviet military satellite to Indian telecommunications entrepreneur Brij Nath (Anil Kapoor), and that satellite could be used to transmit missile-firing instructions, Tom Cruise and Paula Patton succeed to gather satellite override code. Then they show them driving to television broadcasting tower of Brij Nath, they show streets in Mumbai (In front of Chatrapathi Shivaji terminals, Marine Drive). Then they reach to television broadcasting tower where the signs say its ""Sun Network"", also written in Kannada Language, which is definitely in Bangalore. Also some other indoor shots show some signs in Kannada which is language of Bangalore. If it was Mumbai they had to show it in Hindi or Marathi. Also sun network is a South Indian TV network. Its a loophole which Indians will find out. They know that even Indians watch this movie, so they had to be a little careful in it. We did not expect this kind of silly mistakes from such a huge filmmakers from Hollywood. From last few months Indians heard a lot of hype over Anil Kapoor's role in this movie, for which we have to think that Anil kapoor is there all over movie, but he is there just for 5-10 minutes..!! It was a cheap promotional technique. Visit bangnext for more reviews.."

","Mission Impossible 4 - The Ghost Protocol 07/10<br/><br/>MI 4, like its prequels would be a treat to your senses, that is, if you are not too bothered about the story. MI 4 has good picturization, cool gadgets, awesome action scenes and our ever-young Tom Cruise with his good sense of humour. What is not right about the movie is the Story. Don't get me wrong... I actually enjoyed watching the movie. But that alone cannot be used for rating a movie. <br/><br/>I would (carefully) put my words to say that MI 4's story is ""not-bad"". It is a very entertaining movie, but not a very realistic script. You would assume that being a secret agent you would have lots of skills and gadgets but that doesn't turn you into God. Tom Cruise and team have performed some stunts that left me stunned. But there is something about Tom Cruise that he almost makes you believe that he could actually do all those things which might be hard for a normal Human Being to do. I guess that is what makes the movie so damn cool to watch.<br/><br/>My suggestion: If you decide to just stay home this weekend and do nothing-much, go and enjoy this movie! :-)"
"Rajesh-Narayanan01","8","0","3","16 December 2011"," Good action movie right from the start
","Good action movie right from the start. Most of the action sequences are out of the world. Brad Bird has a great directorial outing with his first action movie.<br/><br/>Kremlin getting hit, amazing gadgets that probably would never see light of the day outside of Hollywood, hot cars getting roughed up, ammunition being fired like crazy and of course fist fights - you got it all.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise has aged only in flesh. He is as astounding as one would expect the lead of a high-caliber action movie. Jeremy Renner somehow reminds me of Daniel Craig a lot. Simon Pegg plays up a pseudo-comical role to cool down the tension. To sum it up, good plot and a LOT of action."
