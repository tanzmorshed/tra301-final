"Hitchcoc","9","81","90","23 March 2006"," It's for all time; a baseball mythos
","Whenever ""The Natural"" is on TV, I stop what I'm doing and watch it. I don't know why, exactly. I have been a baseball fan since I was a little kid and love the tradition. There is no other sport that has as much history. It's because one can isolate moments in time. Situations develop. Every announcer says things like, ""Bottom of the third, men on first and third, Turley on the mound, Simpson is up, he's two for four today. The wind is blowing out to right field, etc."" We can make words visual. In this wonderful movie, a man wants a piece of that tradition. He makes a horrible mistake along the way to the big leagues, and now is given one last chance. This is mythical. This is not realistic. To criticize it on the basis of its credibility is unfair. Even to compare it to the book is unfair. They are totally different. What one does with a camera should not be compared to the printed page. Malamud did his thing and now Barry Levinson is doing his. The cinematography is without peer. It is magical all the way through. The lighting as Glenn Close stands up in the stands is mesmerizing. This is more Greek myth than baseball story, but it is a baseball story, with the Ruth like gods and the day-to-day players. Roy Hobbs is like all of us in some ways and we love him for his endurance, patience, and drive. Redford brings him to life with that rugged face moving away from lost youth. It's a fine film."
"alfiefamily","9","82","93","27 April 2004"," My favorite baseball movie. Truly magical.
","A wonderful, magical fairy tale, and morality play.  This is the type of movie that as a new father, I cannot wait until my son is old enough to watch this with me.<br/><br/>I know much has been made about Redford being too old to play Roy Hobbs. But much of the story asks you to believe in incredible things, so to me, this is a minor issue.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is first rate. The cast which includes Redford, Glenn Close, Kim Basinger, Wilford Brimley and a pair of terrific performances turned in by Robert Duval and Darren McGavin.<br/><br/>It is easy to see that all of the actors trust the material and believe in their characters.<br/><br/>Barry Levinson tells the story in a straight forward style, he doesn't try to build any false suspense or surprise twists.  When you watch this movie you know exactly what is going to happen long before it does, but you don't care, because it unfolds intelligently and without pretense.<br/><br/>My two favorite components of this movie are the cinematography by Caleb Deschanel and the beautiful, moving score composed by Randy Newman.  I first enjoyed Mr. Deschanel's work on ""Being There"", and felt Mr. Newman's score for ""Ragtime"" was the best score of 1981. <br/><br/>""The Natural"" is so much more than a baseball movie. It is a story about faith, good and evil, right and wrong, fathers and sons. It is about all that is good in baseball and in life. <br/><br/>10 out of 10"
"ccthemovieman-1","10","84","101","25 October 2005"," The Ultimate Sports Fantasy Movie
","This is THE classic sports-Walter Mitty-fantasy movie, with an ending that may seem corny to cynical critics or those who prefer the book, but was perfect for me and a lot of other people.<br/><br/>Granted, I am a little biased in my review since the movie was made in the area in which grew up. Having made many trips to the ballpark in which the movie was filmed, and to the old-fashioned soda shoppe where Robert Redford and Glenn Close re-unite, this movie was special to all of us in Western New York. It always a kick, too, (and a bit odd) to watch the final scene since the opposing pitcher is a personal friend.<br/><br/>I think I would have loved this movie regardless of the ""home-field advantage."" It's an interesting, involving story that has you really rooting for Redford's character. To have actors like Close, Robert Duvall, Richard Farnsworth, Kim Basinger, Wilfred Brimley, Darren McGavin, Barabara Hershey, Robert Prosky, Joe Don Baker and others in the ""lineup"" doesn't hurt, either!<br/><br/>The cinematography is beautiful, too. That was something I never really appreciated until after several viewings. There are some wonderfully subdued brown and golden hues in here. This is very pretty motion picture.<br/><br/>All the characters - the good and the bad, and there are plenty of both - are fascinating. It's also nice to see an actor in a baseball film that actually knows how to throw, hit and field a baseball. This is a great, old-fashioned storytelling."
"MiriamEB","8","55","68","6 July 2000"," A delightful fable pulled off believably and
","I really enjoyed watching this movie. It seems like the very embodiment of the Hollywood cliche - a noble hero overcoming difficulty to achieve his dream...but somehow, The Natural manages to pull it off in a very un-glamorized way. Take the hero - he's 35 years old! It just seems refreshing not to always have a dashing young fellow of twenty as the main character. And then - an ulcerated stomach? What kind of an obstacle is that? Not a Hollywood one, I'll tell you that. This hero is actually believable - and Robert Redford plays him handsomely. He makes Roy Hobbs a real person, and a gentleman. I recommend The Natural for any Robert Redford fan, baseball fan - and anyone who just wants to see a neat, entertaining movie with a main character you can really root for."
"pricerc","Null","26","31","25 April 2004"," For Father and Son
","My son and I have watched this movie twice together. I can't think of any other movie we have watched twice--together. I'm 60 and my son is 26. There is the element of magic, of fairy-tale, of other-worldliness; there is the element of the naturalness, the character of Robert Redford; there is the element of baseball, the great sport-love of millions of boys in North America--and me back in the 1950s when I was growing up and dreamed of going to the majors; there's a touch of the sexual with Kim Basinger and Barbara Hershey----one could go on listing the pluses that this movie brings to the viewers. But I think what makes the movie in the end is the magic of Roy Hobbs as he hits a baseball further and harder than anyone ever has or(probably) ever will. Hobbs is the quintessence of the baseball hero and for sports lovers that's their religion. Hobbs is like Jesus come down to earth in the form of a baseball player, yet with sins of omission and commission. So, he's human and a superhero all at once."
"budmassey","10","61","80","21 January 2004"," Book Schmook! The Movie is VASTLY superior!
","As a writer, I am often compelled to read the books on which my favorite movies are based. Since its original release, I have loved The Natural as one of my favorite movies of all time, but it was only recently that I read Bernard Malamud's novel on which the movie was based. I cannot tell you how disappointed I was.<br/><br/>Malamud was a great writer, and was best known for winning a Pulitzer and the National Book award for The Fixer. His award winning work usually dealt with themes closer to his own heart, and Malamud didn't seem to ""get"" baseball in this book. Either that, or he had some axe to grind about baseball, and wanted us to hate it and all the people involved in it. <br/><br/>The Natural was Malamud's first novel and, as such, it suffers from shallow, simplistic characters, a muddy, at times almost unintelligible plot, and poorly attenuated subplots that almost seem like afterthoughts or clumsy devices slathered on to shore up weak story objectives. He does, however, have a historical understanding of baseball, and most of the events related to baseball in this story are composites of everything from the Black Sox to Babe Ruth to Christie Matheson and a string of other legends.<br/><br/>The main character, Roy Hobbs, is almost certainly based on the real life character Eddie Waitkus, and Malamud does little to imbue him with likable traits that would deepen him as a literary character. He even throws in a little Joe Jackson to compromise the character even further. The fact that he is called ""Roy"" is an obvious allusion to Sir Thomas Malory's 15th century opus ""Le Morte D'Arthur."" (Recall that ""roi"" is French for ""king."") Why Malamud chose this story as a model is a mystery, since although he goes to great lengths to reinforce the Aurthurian connection (the baseball team is called the ""Knights"", the bat, ""Wonderboy"" is obviously ""Excalibur""), he creates little of the Arthurian heroism in Roy Hobbes, or, for that matter, the sport of baseball as an allegory for the jousting of Chivalric heroes. <br/><br/>The character of The Whammer, played in the movie beautifully, if all too briefly, by Joe Don Baker, is more Ruth than Ruth, but he's gone in a flash, leaving yet another heroic void in the original story. And the women in The Natural are shallow, conniving and cheap and I have never been able to understand Malamud's literary allusions with regard to Morgan LeFave and Guinnevere, the women in Arthur's life. The Bad Guys in the book are ALL Bad, everyone else is mostly neutral, and there isn't any real good, or anything uplifting or affirming or positive in the whole thing.<br/><br/>Thank god for the movie. Barry Levinson's direction is gilded and glowing, and the whole film has a luminous aura that seems magical and enchanted and, compared to the wooden novel from which it came, a satisfying recast of the Arthurian legend. The screenplay was done by Roger Towne, who recently gave us The Recruit, and the changes he made to the story make all the difference in the world; less literary, perhaps, but more beautiful and elegant and not nearly so cynical and pessimistic. Compared to the Levinson/Johnson magic, the novel is almost amateurish, and recalls Ayn Rand's facile characters and stories, didactic and pedantic, and almost completely obscuring the Arthurian magic that Levinson coaxes from the story.<br/><br/>Once, when I had the chance to mention personally to Mark Johnson how beautiful The Natural was, he responded with a sincere modesty that fit the innocent tone of the movie, and he even gave me a keepsake from the film that I have to this day as a reminder of just how amazing an achievement this movie was, coming from so flawed a novel.<br/><br/>This was the first movie in which I loved Redford. He was older and deeper as an actor, and this was the beginning of his real golden age. Glenn Close was delightfully virginal and beautiful as a character almost completely created by the screenwriter, not the novelist. Kim Basinger is gorgeous and dangerous as the femme fatal, a portrayal that she would echo in her Oscar winning turn in L.A. Confidential.<br/><br/>Randy Newman's brilliant score was recycled a dozen times in subsequent movies, but none captured the beauty and nostalgia of The Natural. There are only a handful of movies so magnificently driven by their score, and The Natural remains Newman's best and most satisfying work.<br/><br/>In short, this is the best baseball movie ever. Whereas Malamud wanted to show baseball as jaundiced and commercial, Towne's screenplay shows us the baseball we loved as kids, and more. Malamud's dark and wholly unsatisfying ending is also rewritten, and if you find the final scene a little sweet, ask yourself if you really wanted to see the dismal finale that Malamud supplied."
"jmorrison-2","9","36","46","24 June 2005"," Superb Film
","One of my all time favorites. Everything about this movie appears authentic. From the time period, to the baseball scenes. These guys really look like a baseball team.<br/><br/>Redford is low-key and stoic, but he hits just the right note for the character. Everybody else, especially Robert Duvall and Wilford Brimley, are fantastic.<br/><br/>A touching story, without being hokey. You get the feeling you are watching something mystical and magical along with all the characters in the movie, and it is played with just the right note.<br/><br/>Thrilling and inspiring. A well-made, well-acted film."
"soapfish","Null","36","46","22 May 2003"," A Film for the Ages
","I can't ever forget the first time(s) I saw The Natural. I was a member of the Directors Guild of America and there was a screening at the DGA. I love screenings of films about which I know nothing! And at the time I hadn't read the novel, really didn't know anything about it. I knew Barry Levinson and liked his work, and Randy Newman was, of course, a god. I just wasn't ready for it! Tears were streaming down my face from the beginning. The music would play and the waterworks would commence! It felt organic, not intellectual. It just ""was"". The only other film where I had that experience was, you guessed it, ""Field of Dreams"", another screening. When he asked his Dad if they could play a little catch, I lost it. The people I was with got up and slowly moved to other seats. But back to the Natch. I love it when a film subsumes reality, and every time I hear the theme at a ""real"" ball game, I smile. From time to time I'll put on the DVD to watch a scene, and I invariably end up watching the whole thing! If you haven't seen this film, you simply must!"
"Loren-3","10","33","46","19 December 1998"," A 20th Century Fairy Tale
","That's how I personally summed up this movie when I first saw it. And what better place to couch a fairy tale than in a milieu with real legends like Ruth and DiMaggio and Mantle ... or fabulous ones like ""The Whammer"" and Roy Hobbs. The story of a man playing the game they way it SHOULD be played, wishing while injured that his father could have seen him, and coming through in the clutch for his father, his lady, and his son. Beautifully shot by Caleb Deschanel, this isn't just a movie, this is ARTWORK.<br/><br/>And who could forget the soundtrack written by Randy Newman, which has found its way into virtually every sports show on the tube at one time or another. Without a doubt, his best handiwork."
"movibuf1962","7","5","5","29 August 2006"," ""I know better.""
","This is another one that I recently re-watched on cable. I must upgrade my collection to include the DVD. Of course, there are reviews which will attack its sentimentality; get over it!! It amazes me that so many film goers can't view a movie with a positive and sophisticated charm without rolling their eyes or sticking their finger down their throat. (As if we don't have enough coarse, angry, 'edgy' films in release already.) I don't mind Redford's Joe Hardy-like ability one bit, because success- for all of his skill and talent- still doesn't come to him easily. He must suffer a physical tragedy, be elusive with his greedy contemporaries, and finally deal with the past, which he spends the entire movie trying to hide. The one nitpick I have with the whole film was the painfully obvious soft-focus photography used to disguise Redford's age. It isn't so bad in the first reel when he's supposed to be a teenager (and the camera shoots him in silhouette and at length), but later, when he's supposed to be between 36 and, say 40, he just *isn't*. Glenn Close is radiant as his love from childhood, and shines in a memorable scene when they are first reunited at one of his games. After he goes into a foreshadowed slump, it is the arrival of Close (angelically back lit, and whose presence he senses even before seeing her) that brings him back to winning. Singularly gorgeous."

","****SPOILERS**** Wanting to be a professional baseball player since he first picked up a baseball as a little boy Roy Hobbs, Robert Redford, was on his way to becoming one when he was shot and almost killed by a unstable young woman fan whom he met the day before on a train traveling to Chicago where he was to be signed to play for a major league team. <br/><br/>With all of his hopes of becoming a major leaguer dashed and a faded memory at 19 Hobbs, 16 years later, now at the age of 35 is back from playing a year of semi-pro ball to play in the big leagues and see if he still has it as a middle-age rookie and if he can make the team. Playing anywhere he's needed, on the bottom-dwelling New York Knights, and hoping against hope that the manager Pop Fisher, William Brimley,will put him in the lineup. Pop does reluctantly only to find out that Roy was heaven sent to not only win the pennant for the Knights but to save him from being brought out by a bunch unscrupulous shysters and gangsters from his share of stock he has in the team.<br/><br/>At times corny but still very moving story that despite its unbelievable plot is based on a true story that's almost as incredible as the movie itself. On the evening of June 14, 1949 Phillie first baseman Eddie Waitkus was gunned down in his hotel room by a crazed female fan and admirer. Waitkus with a bullet in his gut was left almost bleeding to death with his future as a professional baseball player non-existent. In only a year Waitkus came back, literary from the dead, to guide the Phillie ""Whiz Kids"" to the 1950 National League pennant! The ""Whiz Kids"" Won it on the last day of the season, like Roy Hobbs' Knights did in the movie, against the heavily favored Brooklyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field.<br/><br/>A real crowd pleaser with Robert Redford as Roy Hobbs out to prove to himself, as well as the sports world, that he still has what it takes to be a professional baseball player and comes across his old girlfriend Iris, Glenn Close. Iris unknown to Roy had and is raising his 15 year-old son Ted, Robert Rich III. <br/><br/>The movie ""The Natural"" has Roy torn between sweet and caring Iris and party girl and gold-digger Memo Paris, Kim Basinger,who together with the sleazy owner of the Knights Judge Prosky and big time bookie and gangster Gus Sands, Darren McGavin, wants Roy to throw the final game with the Pittsburg Pirates. This in order to put out Pop and make a killing betting against the heavily favored Knights.<br/><br/>Playing his heart and guts out Roy's past injury comes back to not only haunt but possibly kill him as his stomach wound opens up causing him to miss three games that the Pirates won. With the pennant on the line Roy, despite orders from his doctor not to, returns for the final do or die game at Knights Stadium and ends it, and his career, with a hot and sizzling Forth of July explosion on a cool windy and lighting struck October evening.<br/><br/>Predictable but still heart-lifting and exciting movie ""The Natural"" ranks right up there with the best baseball, as well as sports, films ever made. ""The Natural"" both beautifully and touchingly shows how the human spirit can overcome every obstacle that's thrown in front of it, natural or man made, when it frees itself from all the fears and negativity that's around it."
"AusJedi","10","9","11","4 July 2002"," Enthusiastic endorsement
","This is one of my favourite movies of all time.  An excellent story, great music and emotive cinematography.  The shot of Wilfred Brimley sitting in the shadows, illuminated by nothing but sparks, finally realising his dream is simply wonderful and moving.  Robert Redford is characteristically brilliant as is the cast supporting him."
"hall895","5","26","42","9 April 2011"," Sentimental schmaltz
","The Natural is not a baseball movie. It's a fable, a fairy tale, a fantasy which just happens to be centered around a baseball player. It probably would have been better as a baseball movie. The movie drowns in sentimentality, few movies have ever laid it on as thick as this one does with its portrayal of the godlike Roy Hobbs. Roy's a mythical superhero. At least that's the effect the movie's going for. Unfortunately this superhero is a complete idiot. All he cares about is baseball and his vain quest to be the best there ever was. Unfortunately his quest is derailed before it ever gets a chance to properly begin. But when years later he somehow gets a second chance he screws it up all over again by making the same exact mistakes he made the first time. Here's a helpful hint for the audience in case you can't figure it out, because Roy sure can't. Woman dressed in black...bad. Woman dressed in white...good. Yes, this is one simplistic fairy tale all right.<br/><br/>Aside from all the sentimental overload the movie's other big problem is Robert Redford. Not because Redford gives a bad performance as Roy Hobbs, because he doesn't, but for the simple fact that he is much, much, much too old to believably play the part. Yes the story is about an old man, at least in baseball terms. But not that old. Redford was pushing fifty when he made this movie. He just doesn't look the part as the 35-year old Hobbs we see for most of the movie. And at the start of the movie, when Redford plays Hobbs at the age of nineteen? All the favorable lighting and makeup in the world wasn't going to prevent that from looking truly absurd. It's hard to buy into the movie when the great baseball star looks like your grandpa. For comparison's sake a key role, that of old, cantankerous manager Pop, is played by Wilford Brimley. Brimley is a mere two years older than Redford.<br/><br/>So Redford's casting is a problem. The fact that this supposed baseball movie features some truly ridiculous baseball action doesn't help either. Roy Hobbs joins a terrible team. To show you just how terrible the team is the filmmakers resort to comic baseball, players getting hit in the groin and such. Not funny, not at all. If you want to take this seriously as a baseball movie you're in trouble. There's really nothing believable about the baseball sequences. But if it doesn't work as a baseball movie maybe it at least works as a fable? Not really. The movie beats you over the head with the Roy Hobbs as god stuff but it never really rings true. The fact he's such a dunce surely doesn't help. When a woman from Roy's past shows up she has a secret for him. But she doesn't come right out and say it, she only hints at it. But anybody could figure it out. Anybody except dear old Roy. He doesn't get it. He never seems to get it, no matter what ""it"" is, unless it's hitting a baseball. That he can do and with remarkable precision, able to hit faraway objects and make them explode whenever the mood strikes him. The character of Roy Hobbs never really works and thus the movie never really works. Redford's acting is fine even if he never looks the part. Many other performers, most notably Robert Duvall and Glenn Close are really wasted, not given enough to do in this totally Roy Hobbs-centered movie. Kim Basinger has a bit more substantial part to play but doesn't really do all that well with it. The film has a great look and sound to it, with beautiful cinematography and a wonderful Randy Newman score. But the story lets the movie down. It's a fable which falls flat, not particularly believable and often, as the movie drags along, not particularly interesting or entertaining. This baseball movie leaves you longing for a real baseball movie."

","""The Natural"" is a strange move by any sense of the imagination. One minute, it can be as serious as any movie ever made. The next minute, an outfielder crashes through the wall, dies, and has his ashes spread over the field in a later game. Despite the oddities that pop up here and there, though, ""The Natural"" remains a classic for one simple reason: it will move you emotionally in the end.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""The Natural"" tells the story of Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford), a young pitcher who seems to have the world on a string on his way to the major leagues. When a freak accident takes him out of the game for many years, though, he comes back a wily, grizzled veteran just hoping for another chance. He gets that chance with the Knights, coached by Pop Fisher (Wilford Brimley). While figures such as the team owner (Robert Prosky) and prominent sports writer Max Mercy (Robert Duvall) want to see him fail, Hobbs shows the type of perseverance that legends are made of.<br/><br/>Like I said in the opening, ""The Natural"" can be a really strange movie at times. It's almost like director Barry Levinson doesn't quite understand how strange his dramatic tone shifts were as the film rolls along. While some view this as quirky and giving the movie its own style, I see it as a negative (the only reason it doesn't get my full five stars and vault into ""Field of Dreams"" territory).<br/><br/>That being said, ""The Natural"" does more than enough things right to still remain a classic movie. Certain sequences (striking out The Whammer (Joe Don Baker), ""pick me out a winner, Bobby"", etc.) are now etched into iconic film & baseball lore. Then, of course, there is that ending. I don't care how cheesy you might have thought the movie up until that point was, but if that final scene doesn't move you to tears, you probably have a stone in place of a heart. When it comes to ""greatest single scene in a baseball movie of all-time"", Hobbs' final at-bat probably takes home the prize.<br/><br/>One must also comment on the music of ""The Natural"", as that is part of the reason why it resonates on such an emotional level. I don't think I could name too many soundtracks that top this one. The main theme is now a mainstay, and it seems like all the scenes in the film are backed by the perfect instrumentals.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Natural"" is a slice of ""baseball Americana"", if not a perfect one. There are moments that will probably make you shake your head out of weirdness, but more often than not you will find yourself falling for Roy Hobbs and his quest for the American dream...baseball style."

","I recently saw this film - I never tire of seeing it again - with a friend who visited me for a weekend. He and I had played baseball together in college, and he's as big a baseball fan as I am. But for some inexplicable reason, he'd never seen this film, so we watched my DVD on a Saturday afternoon.<br/><br/>First, it's far and away the best baseball flick, ever - not because ""Pride of the Yankees,"" ""The Rookie,"" ""Bull Durham,"" or ""For Love of the Game"" weren't excellent - but because it is such a terrific story, and because Robert Redford gives a sensational performance, and can really look like a talented pro in swinging a bat and throwing/fielding a baseball. (Incidentally, of the above movies, the last Costner film didn't gain the popularity of praise of the others, but I still found it excellent, and like Redford, Kevin can handle a bat and ball.)<br/><br/>Since I'd watched the film just shortly before this visit, I looked for any details I might have missed before, instead of getting totally absorbed by the story.<br/><br/>I noticed that despite his being presented as a multi-million-dollar bookie/gambler, wagering six figured amounts (in the depression 1930's, yet!) Darrin McGavin's ""Gus."" never drew the right bead on Roy Hobbs, and seemed to have a stupidly naive perspective with regard to his prodigious talent, and losing betting against Roy throughout.<br/><br/>Also, Robert Duvall's ""Max,"" the syndicated columnist, presents himself as a tower of virtue to preserve the integrity of the game, yet is friendly with Gus, who is involved in bribes to players to throw games to aid his confederate (Robert Prosky) and presumably also to clean-up in the betting arena. Even though Duvall's character obviously is ambitious to break the big, inside story, and is self-promoting, it seems his character would have been a bit fairer and more discreet.<br/><br/>These two are still great actors, and their characters strong and interesting, despite any such inconsistencies.<br/><br/>And the baseball scenes are terrific, in and of themselves, and provide a completely authentic representation of baseball five decades earlier than when filmed, and seven decades ago now.<br/><br/>Some purists have criticized the ethereal, surreal aspects in the film as detracting from the baseball games portrayed. I disagree, and feel that these added immensely (even necessarily) to the ""story,"" without in anyway detracting from the outstanding ""on the field"" parts of the movie.<br/><br/>Like Dennis Quaid in ""The Rookie,"" Redford was in his late forties at filming, portraying a character about a decade younger. Like Quaid, no problem for him; and had the character been even a few years more junior to him, he'd have been just as believable.<br/><br/>This film, along with ""North Dallas Forty"" and ""One-on-One""/""Hoosiers"" (a tie) comprise the far best films about our big-three sports. While there have been many excellent films about baseball, football and basketball, these are the absolute finest."

I hear it every time I attend the MLB ballpark close to my house and the home team hits a dinger. For those who think that this movie is not realistic, let me point to a ballplayer in the majors now. If you know baseball, you can figure out who I'm talking about, #32. His life and this movie have a lot of parallels.

","Baseball is a sport in which it is everyone's favorite sport. But in The Natural, baseball will never be the same. The Natural is a wonderful and great movie that fills the screen with extreme joy and magic. The movie takes place in 1939 where a youngster named Roy Hobbs, played by Robert Redford, makes his way through the major league baseball team. But hold on a minute, that is just the story. The Natural begins with the young Roy as a boy playing ball with his father. But after a while, his father passes away and one night, a thunderstorm's lighting bolt split a tree in half. The young Roy then make the wood from the tree into a baseball. He also etches a name of his bat. ""Wonderboy"" is what he called the bat. Soon enough, the bat gives the magic touches to Roy. One day, while playing a baseball game, he hits the baseball and the ball goes flying flying into a glass clock, shattering it into pieces. Another time, he hits another baseball and that baseball and the inside of the ball came out. Knowing that he is the best, Roy faces problems in his life including a manager called The Judge, played by Robert Prosky. His job is to bring Hobbs down. Roy doesn't stand a chance to the Judge's actions, knowing that Roy is just the person he is. An baseball hero. The Natural have great performances by Redford, Glenn Close and Wilford Brimely. The Natural is one of the best films of 1984. ★★★★ 4 stars."

","This movie reminded me a lot about the movie ""Cujo"" in one way. I'd read the book (""Cujo"") before seeing the film. And the film's upbeat ending was a far cry better than the dreary end of the book. Likewise with this film (""The Natural"") - except that I saw the movie first.<br/><br/>A few minutes ago (and for the first time), I just finished reading the novel by Bernard Malamud. The novel, for the most part, was a pretty good read. But I absolutely hated the ending - totally different than the way the movie ended. In fact, I hated its ending so much that, tomorrow, I'm going to donate the book to my library (fighting my first urge to burn it or toss it out with my weekly trash pickup). I will *never* want to read it again.<br/><br/>But the movie? I've watched it several times. And I will no doubt watch it time and time again ... especially now, to take the bad taste out of my mouth left by the novel. Screenplay writers Roger Towne & Phil Dusenberry did a splendid job of transforming Malamud's novel into a hopeful saga of courage & honor with an exceptionally satisfying climax. And Robert Redford, et al, made the Oscar-nominated saga believable and palatable at the same time.<br/><br/>So, watch the movie ... but avoid the novel like the plague."
"vincentlynch-moonoi","9","5","7","9 July 2011"," A Near-Perfect Film
","Funny thing is, I'm not a sports fan, but I often like movies about baseball. I can't really explain it. But I think that this baseball movie is as good as it gets in the field of sports-story films. This is, in my view, a near-perfect film. Not in the class of spectacular films (such as ""GWTW"", ""Dr. Zhivago"", or ""Ben-Hur""), but probably in the class with ""Casablanca"". <br/><br/>The one criticism I have of this film is that about two-thirds of the way into the film it does drag a bit for a while. But it was necessary because the director had to let the story catch up with itself, because although the story is about baseball, it is even more about a man and destiny, and how destiny is sometimes denied.<br/><br/>Robert Redford was at his peak at this point, and although he made quite a few films after this, this was his last truly great performance, in my view. But still, overall, Redford should be right up there in the top ten of American film-making.<br/><br/>It seems to me that Glenn Close didn't live up to her early performance, but I enjoyed her in this film. Darren McGavin has long been a favorite character actor of mine, both in film and on television. He's excellent here. Kim Basinger, not one of my favorites, is good. Wilford Brimley (they should have shaved his chest!) was excellent as the baseball manager, as was Richard Farnsworth as part of the management team.<br/><br/>The script -- a masterpiece -- with a little evil, a little magic, depression, inspiration, and all the touches that put you right in the era.<br/><br/>This was a class act, so to speak. Perfection near everywhere in the production. Very highly recommended."
"Inklings","10","5","7","26 April 2008"," Classic Myth Modernized
","The original story written by Bernard Mallamud is popularly and critically considered one of the greatest sports novels ever written. This movie, while altering the ending in an opposite direction of the novel, maintains the thematic element of myth.<br/><br/>As a child, this was my favorite movie. It attracted me because of the baseball setting and its awe-inspiring protagonist, as portrayed by the wonderful Robert Redford. What I didn't realize at the time was its links to the classic myths of ancient Greek and English lore. Roy Hobbs is a classic Arthurian archetype; the honest, good, and completely lovable main character. Consistently throughout, Hobbs is pulled on by the forces of good (Glenn Close's character) and evil (the Boss, the murderous woman, etc.). What, I think, distances many of today's audiences is that they cannot connect with such a character; that he seems TOO good. What they forget is that Hobbs does succumb to vice; it is an allegorical vice, as portrayed by the seductress (Roy begins to fail in his game immediately afterwards) and by the Boss (greed, darkness, blindness, etc.).<br/><br/>Overall, this is not just another stereotypical Hollywood pile. It is an allegorical, symbolic, triumphant portrayal of good's eventual triumph over evil. One must not write this off as silly or contrived. It simply isn't."

","When I was about 7 years old my father returned from a work trip to Toronto - raving about a movie he'd seen whilst he was there and bringing back 'Blue Jay's' baseball caps for my brother and I. He wasn't a baseball fan but he he'd been inspired by the film he'd seen.<br/><br/>It was years until I saw this film and it didn't disappoint - despite the huge build up my Dad had given it! It's a modern day fairytale. And that definition is no way pejorative.<br/><br/>I've written academic theses on the diagetic process of obscure film makers, compared the cinematography of Ozu and Kurosawa  and I wouldn't hesitate to describe this film as a truly masterful piece of storytelling. It taps into a deep vein of sporting fantasy and in return injects it with some of the most poetic and enduring images of athletic endeavor that I've ever seen (as an intellectual equivalent I'd recommend  'Stand and Deliver', 1988).<br/><br/>The acting is excellent across the board. The casting of Farnsworth and Brimley against a dubiously youthful Redford (Vaselined lenses for the first 10 minutessuspension of disbelief thereafter) is exquisite. The sepia shot tones give the movie a mythic edge. The finale gives a (genuinely) gut-wrenching kick and provides one of the most memorable 'slo-mo' scenes you will ever see. Forget 'Field of Dreams' - this is American myth making at it's best and at its most poetic."

","The challenges we face with our lives are so often times metaphorically relegated to the game of baseball... Baseball has always been a somber analogy of the ups and downs in our precarious existence.. This nineteenth century pastime, which evolved as a criteria for success and failure, has cultivated itself as an American ideology that reflects our fortitude as United States citizens!! This embodiment of winning and losing is the key element that made the movie ""The Natural"" so painstakingly identifiable!! Barry Levensen directs this film, for me, that is enough to categorize ""The Natural"" as one of the best movies anyone will ever see!! ""Diner"", which was directed by Barry Levensen, is one of my favorite movies of all time... Of course, ""Rain Man"" is his prize piece, ""Rain Man"" won the academy award for best picture in 1988!! ""The Natural"" is a film which garners a heartfelt empathy from the movie audience to understand Robert Redford's character's desire to prove his ability ,and reaffirm his coveted achievements to himself and to everyone around him!! Robert Redford stars in this movie, and like so many of Redford's films, the fervor to take his emotions seriously is always a critical component to justifying his comprehensive endeavors!! Robert Redford is very believable in this film, and his interpretation of peculiar occurrences, and flagrant human shortcomings, manifest themselves in a way which leaves an indelible impact on the movie audience!! I have embraced baseball as a kindred spirit, and not just a recreational hobby, that is why I love this movie!! Kim Bassinger is so incredibly beautiful in this film, and it stands to reason that Robert Redford perceives her beauty to be almost hypnotic!! Glen Close plays a succor of spiritual enlightenment for Redford, as the two of them commiserate, and engage in the intellectual luxury of delving into an onslaught of perplexing questions which require definitive answers!! For his own edification, Redford must resolve every issue in this film through the personally mandatory guise of going in accordance with his urges!! These instincts necessitate his utterly human responses!! Baseball just emerged as a cutthroat business back in the 1920's, and, suffice it to say, that subsequently, it has snowballed into a corporate nightmare of today!! Baseball has now been reduced to the clinical and callous translation of television revenue, multi million dollar salaries, and mega facilitated stadia which require subsidy by the taxpayers!! The single most poignant concept to emanate from this film ""The Natural"" is that an individual's accomplishments must be approved by that individual in order for them to be truly rewarding!! I found the movie ""The Natural"" to be a remarkable film, the acting was sensational!! Robert Duvall's role was seedy and intriguing as well!! This movie also possessed very well thought out acting performances by John Finnegan, Darrin McGavin and Jon Van Ness!! In general, Baseball parallels our national guidelines, everybody interprets so many life situations by the rule of thumb pertaining to three strikes and you're out!! The national association with baseball in this country is pandemic!! In 1984, when ""The Natural"" came out, people took to it, in this case, the movie audience and I were in sync!! I thought ""The Natural"" was a fantastic film!! I recommend to everyone that they see it!!"
"angry127","6","7","11","9 December 2010"," Good Movie
","I'm not a real baseball or sports fan. I did like this movie though. I think just about any movie starring Robert Redford will at least be OK. This movie is no exception.<br/><br/>The film is kind of melodramatic though. It seems like every scene there is a woman dressed in black poisoning Redford. Or there is a woman in white inspiring him to hit the ball out of the park. And speaking of which, there are probably half a dozen scenes where Redford is down two balls and he hits it out of the park.<br/><br/>Putting that aside, the movie still has a lot to offer. The acting (besides Bassinger) is very well done. We also have Duvall, Brimley, Prosky, and Farnesworth giving stellar performances. This is probably the best part of the film, with a close second being the cinematography. All the shots are great eye candy. The glare of the sun, the farmland, the fields (with great color composition). This is really something to see."
"TxMike","Null","7","11","31 December 2001"," Allegory about life, a good ""8"" of 10 film on a baseball theme.
","SPOILERS - One of the more puzzling aspects of ""The Natural"" is the absence of Darren McGavin from the credits, since his character is the second most important in the whole story. Right before it came on AMC last night, the introduction said that it is an allegory, so I suppose my review would not be complete without my interpretation of that.<br/><br/>We first see that Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford) is a ""natural"" in baseball, grows up at age 20 to be a pitching phenom, and on a train stop as he was going forward with his dream of ""I want to walk down the street and have people say 'he was the best ever'"", in a dare and a bet he strikes out the ""Whammer"" (Babe Ruth?) in 3 pitches. A lady (Barbara Hershey) seems attracted to him, but when he restates that he only wants to ""be recognized as the best ever"", she shoots him, in the side, and we learn later that she threw herself off a high place onto the street below, dead. We find out much later that McGavin's character had lost $100,000 on that wager, ""and I took care of him.""  Meaning, he was the one who hired the Hershey character to shoot Hobbs. Hobbs only realizes that at the finale, when he has to choose whether to try and win the game, or give in to McGavin's attempt to fix the game.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back at the beginning, Hobbs was out of baseball 16 years, recovering from his gunshot, and dealing with his infatuation with the temptress known as ""fame."" He is recruited as a 35-yr-old rookie, almost never gets into a game, and finally using his bat carved from the old lightning-struck tree, becomes a batting phenom, the best hitter they ever saw. When he starts fooling around with temptress Kim Basinger, he suddenly cannot hit anymore. When he sees Glen Close again, he suddenly becomes a hitting machine again. He ultimately wins the big playoff game, sending the bad guys reeling.<br/><br/>At one point, Close's character tells Hobbs, ""I believe we have two lives, the one we learn with, and the one we live with."" Hobbs was a victim of the want of ""fame"", so much so it de-railed his career. Only after he learned to play baseball for the sheer enjoyment of it did he achieve the success he wanted, but ""fame"" was no longer a need. It is almost the same theme in ""Big"", where Hanks' character is a success because he remains a kid, enjoying what he is doing, while all the others just want to run a business and make a buck. <br/><br/>Good movie, Redford is always good. The baseball sequences are fairly well done, and the moral is positive. I think many who enjoyed Costner's ""For Love of the Game"" would also enjoy ""The Natural."""

The background music is superb.  Several years ago I took my family to Cooperstown,NY to visit the Baseball Hall of Fame.  The main musical theme was playing as part of a baseball video.<br/><br/>Although the climax of the movie was excellent, I think the scene in Chicago where Glenn Close stood up and Hobbs hit the home run that broke the tower clock was definitely my favorite.<br/><br/>Whenever I feel a little depressed, I know it's time to pop the video in the vcr."

"paul.proteus","3","16","32","1 November 2000"," A travesty (also, it's pretty silly)
","Not only is this film schmaltzy, with one-dimensional characters, it perverts a classic American novel.  Malamud's book is dark, intelligent, and enthralling.  This movie takes the essential plot of the book and strips away any meaning from the story and any depth from the characters.<br/><br/>While in theory there isn't anything wrong is changing aspects of a novel in adaptation, in this case the changes show how they bastardized what was once a work of art and made instead a mediocre movie.  In the film, Hobbs is seen making his ""magical"" bat with his father in a loving, touching father-son moment.  In the book, Hobbs' father was an abusive drunk.  The character of The Judge is more than just a Snidely Wiplash villain in the book, we actually understand why he's doing what he's doing.  And most important of all, Hobbs relationships with the two women (in the film played by Kim Basinger and Glenn Close) is far more complex.  The film leaves nothing to the audience's credit, making it clear at the end which woman Hobbs should go for.  In Redford and Levinson's watered-down world the heroes are perfect, the villains and completely evil and the outcome is pre-ordained. This is not a thinking man's movie.<br/><br/>They should have at least had the common decency and respect to give this movie a different title so someone could later make a true adaptation of Malamud's brilliant novel."

The film isn't a true story, but treats itself with the respect of a great biography. Some will like it, others will be appalled by it.

","An excellent example of the ""Hollywood-ization"" of a work taken from another medium.  As mentioned in other comments, the cinematography and historical realism are both top-notch.  The storyline takes on mythic proportions though choosing a one-dimensional good v evil, corruption v purity theme rather than exploring the multi-dimensional and in my opinion, more realistic and human themes prevalent in Malamud's novel.  Hobbs here is the straight-up American Golden Boy, played to the hilt by Redford, and ably supported by Duvall, Basinger, Close, Brimley, et al in archetypal characters (atavistic sportswriter, temptress, pure old-fashioned girl, crusty manager).  Enjoyable to watch, if only for the nod to the ""good old days"" of baseball when players were larger than life yet also more accessible to the common fan."
"a_chinn","10","3","4","20 August 2017"," Baseball Americana/American Studies at it's best!
","Wonderful bit of Americana told through that most American of sports, baseball. Director Barry Levinson fashions a mythic tale about an over-the-hill 1920s baseball player, Roy Hobbs, finally getting his shot at the big leagues with the fictional New York Knights. Robert Redford plays Hobbs, himself in many ways a stereotypical All- American boy. Hobbs seemingly comes out of nowhere and no one knows where this talented player came from or why it took him so long to appear in the majors. Hobbs quickly gains fame an attention, and while on his journey faces many challenges; tempted by seductresses, facing down dark corrupting forces, and the lure of money and fame. As with most American myths and tropes, they have their roots in other cultures. The mythology presented in ""The Natural"" seems heavily influenced by Greek Mythology, with Hobbs as a Homer-like hero on a journey to find home. Kim Basinger and Barbara Hershey plays a sirens. Darren McGavin and Robert Duvall plays dark, corrupting underworld god-like figures manipulating events. Glenn Close represents the home that Hobbs is seeking. Other actors of note in the film include Wilford Brimley as the team manager and Richard Farnsworth as an assistant coach. There's also strong supporting performances from Robert Prosky, Michael Madsen, Mike Starr, and Joe Don Baker in a small role that's a thinly veiled analogue for Babe Ruth. Randy Newman also deserve note for his beautiful score, as does director of photography Caleb Deschane. When a baseball smashes the ballpark lights in an explosion of sparks and rousing music are unforgettable and gorgeous. Barry Levinson has made some brilliant, including ""Diner,"" ""Avalon,"" and TV series like ""OZ"" and ""Homicide: Life on the Street,"" but I think this film may be my favorite of all of his fine work."

","I've been on kind of a baseball kick lately, and obviously, ""The Natural"" is going to come up. And it's a good movie, boasting some veteran talent both behind and in front of the camera. The funny thing is that it's not really about baseball, same as boxing is just a storytelling vehicle for ""Raging Bull"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"". This is really an allegory of good and evil, of honorable men and the forces that would smother them; the symbolism's painted all over the walls in this place.<br/><br/>When I read Malamud's book a few years ago, I was blown away by the ending, one that really underlines the novel's bitterness; and that finish has no place in this film. Even still, while you know who to root for and who to despise, there are still aspects that really need to be fleshed out; Robert Duvall's character, in particular.<br/><br/>But I'm not out to poke holes. This movie is memorable not just for the acting or Randy Newman's main theme, but for its fondness for the period.

","The Natural is one of my favorite sports movies of all time not to mention one of the most uplifting films you'll ever see in general. After a quiet sort of mute opening credits sequence, it becomes a poignant, heavenly joy with Randy Newman's hair-raising score pouncing in at all the right moments. As aging baseball legend Roy Hobbs, Robert Redford seems a bit miscast at first, but the movie manages to make you forget about it by surrounding him with a strong assembly of renowned actors (especially Robert Duvall as driven-by-the-truth sports writer Max Mercy and Oscar nominee Glenn Close as a woman from Roy's past). The story takes Redford's character and portrays him as a sort of glorified, baseball messiah (he was out of the game for 16 years because of a gun shot wound) who played outfielder for the New York Knights (for one MLB season mind you). There is a mythical sort of fantasy element present here in which Hobbs has the ability to both pitch and hit like an all- star (unprecedented in today's modern game). Also, the fact that he kinda came out of nowhere and carried a checkered past, draws the viewer in with every well lit scene.<br/><br/>Director Barry Levinson effectively displays a knack for sentimental heroics and although The Natural tries to manipulate the viewer into thinking it's Citizen Kane (considered by many as the greatest film ever made), it still manages to give you goosebumps (the home run sequences are a little outlandish but go with what I'm saying) and does what the Jackie Robinson biopic 42 tried, but might have failed to do.<br/><br/>As a great family film and essential viewing for any sports fan, The Natural will make you stand up and cheer, even if you're the only person in the room."

","Of course I love the scene at the end where Robert Redford's fated Roy Hobbs wins the all-important pennant game by smashing the baseball into the floodlights. It is one of the great scenes of American sporting cinema.<br/><br/>But my favourite scene is previously when Glenn Close as his genuine love interest, as opposed to the evil character of a modern Morgan la Fay, so well-played by Kim Basinger, stands up in Wrigley Field magically willing him to break his poor batting run. Her character tranfuses strength into him, giving that scene an Arthurian, chivalric resonance. But then so has the whole film that glorious mythic quality. <br/><br/>I am also thinking of Field of Dreams, here. What is it about baseball which so lends itself to films of mythic power?<br/><br/>In this film some elements of its success can be readily identified: Barry Levinson's direction, the star power of the actors and, of critical importance, the power of Randy Newman's score.

Repeatedly, we kept hearing them asking each other what had just happened. However, near the end of the film, I had a big laugh. When Roy (Robert Redford) hit the huge home run and the film went into slow-motion with sparks flying everywhere, we sat--marveling at the predictable but wonderful finale. When it was all over, we heard one of the folks behind us say ""Did he hit the ball?!""---well, I guess you had to be there.<br/><br/>This is an amazingly loving tale--told with amazing care to get the look and feel of 1939 just right. It also showed an amazing reverence for baseball--not just real baseball, but the mythical and metaphorical game. The cinematography was amazingly beautiful and helped set the wonderful mood. And, the acting was terrific. The film is simply among the best sports films ever.

"paulzpt","1","16","37","14 March 2005"," The movie that should have never been made based on the book that should have never been written!
","For those of you who didn't know, The Natural is based of a book by the same name, by author Bernard Malamud. The book was already mediocre, and the film found a way to sink lower. The story is about an aspiring baseball player named Roy Hobbs (Redford) who dreams of being the best ball player in history. In the first few minutes of the movie, Roy is shot in the belly as a teen and cannot go on and fulfill his goal for the next 16 years, which to me is just lazy writing. He then reemerges as a 35-year old man to try for his dream again. You would think that the star-studded cast would make the movie seem at least watchable, but even that doesn't help. Robert Redford gives the main character, Roy Hobbs, the personality of a block of wood. Even Glenn Close and Robert Duvall, who are great actors, still give boring and bland performances in this adaption of the novel. The only redeeming qualities of the film are that this movie features Michael Madsen in one of his very first movie roles and Joe Don Baker. Unfortunately, Madsen and Baker's roles are extremely short lived. I would not recommend this film to anyone and would happily pick Gigli or Hard Cash anytime over this embarrassment to novel-based movies."
"playerazzi","5","9","19","15 May 2006"," Missed Opportunities
","A great potential come-back story that misses too many opportunities.<br/><br/>Like, why did Harriet Bird (Barbara Hershey) shoot Roy Hobbs (Redford)? It was never made clear. That would have been a great sub-plot in itself. Say, she was his girl and was jealous of everything, and crazy to boot, and he didn't see it coming, and got it. Or something like that.<br/><br/>Or a hint that Roy *could* have fathered a child with Iris (Glenn Close). There wasn't even a hint, like in Forrest Gump. And the fact that he was ""away"" for 16 years doesn't add up. The kid who we see at the end for too little time is about 10-12 years old. He should be 16-ish, which could have him as a budding, tough High School player. It would have been poignant if he was a true star player, and that Roy, whom we only fleetingly learn is his Daddy at the end, would come back to become his pitching/hitting coach. But maybe I'm asking too much.<br/><br/>And besides, this is the 30'-50's. A woman who has a child out of wedlock would have been a scandal. Why was this fact ignored? And it was strange that she didn't marry. Why? Was she in love with Roy all the time and was waiting for him to come back? That, too, was alluded to, but the point wasn't driven home, so to speak. And when she did find him, Glen Close's reaction was much too subtle and un-emotional for my taste. This is the father of her only child for crying out loud. So, cry out loud.<br/><br/>And how and when did Roy make his decision to come back to play ball? This was quickly glossed over when Roy told Iris what had happened during the course of the 16 years apart, but it would have been dramatically worthwhile to see his ""epiphany"" of deciding to return.<br/><br/>And just how does Memo Paris (Kim Basinger) ""jinx"" Roy and cause him to play poorly? Does she distract him? Did she out-and-out bribe him, or convince him? Did she take up so much of his time that he was quite simply exhausted? It's not clear at all.<br/><br/>And when the Knights play poorly, they play like Little Leaguers. I mean, a team that plays like that just doesn't exist in major league ball. And not in AAA,AA,A, nor rookie ball. Now, I don't mean to get too technical here, but showing them playing like that is going overboard. They should have shown them playing OK, but there was a ""je ne sais quois"" missing. A mental ""push"" that helps them play truly top quality ball. And that mental inspiration is Roy Hobbs.<br/><br/>Now, it was made clear that he inspired the team to improve, no question about it. And it was made clear that ""Bump"" (Michael Madsen) the right-fielder, was throwing the game, being bribed by The Judge (Robert Prosky).<br/><br/>So, I agree with Roger Ebert in this case. It is a movie about idolizing Robert Redford, and it has very little to do with baseball."

If you take something like ""The Stratton Story,"" where you see Monty Stratton work hard to become a great ball player, you become involved in his efforts, and really root for him.<br/><br/>But Hobbs' success is the result of magic, not any effort on his part. He says that he went 16 years without playing baseball. Yes, he ""thought about it"" for those 16 years, but thinking about baseball is not working to get good at it.<br/><br/>He hits well, sometimes, because he has a magic bat. But the bat doesn't explain how he can succeed as an outfielder, which he evidently does. We just have to believe that he suddenly can play major-league outfield. Must be niece.<br/><br/>Sure, you feel sorry for him when he gets sick, and appreciate that he must have been in pain during that last game. But other than that, you never see him work to become a successful player. So, when it is taken away from him, it's hard to feel sorry for him.<br/><br/>This just didn't get me involved, at all."

","Granted, this is a family film -- the kind of thing dads take their six year old sons to. The baseball scenes are stunning, the music soars, Redford looks golden. But you know, a closer look shows a number of weird mixed messages in the sexual subtext of the film.<br/><br/>Roy Hobbs is in love with innocent farm girl Iris. Okay. But on the train to the Big City, Hobbs meets a BAD GIRL. Oh, she's bad all right. You can tell because she's poised, intelligent, book-smart, and interested in sex. That spells evil, right? Women should be at home making apple pie, not riding in trains and reading books and talking to strange men, right? Who wrote this stuff, Osama Bin Laden? <br/><br/>So Roy goes to lovely Harriet Bird's hotel room, and she SHOOTS HIM WITH A GUN! See what happens when women have too much power? Bet you can't guess where the bullet hits, can you? Symbolic castration time!<br/><br/>Okay. Fifteen years later. Hobbs is back from the dead, (think Bela Lugosi meets Horatio Alger) and wins a second chance with the last place New York Knights. The moment he signs with the team, he meets a BAD GIRL! Kim Basinger is bad girl #2. You can tell ""Memo"" is bad, bad, bad because she's ""not waiting for true love to come along."" In other words, she expects to have the same adult freedoms Roy Hobbs has always enjoyed -- like walking into strange people's hotel rooms for sex. <br/><br/>So one night Memo comes into Hobb's hotel room unannounced, drops her mink coat, and gives him plenty to look at. Now stop and think. Hobbs is the golden boy, the hero, right? If he's morally superior to the loose woman, this is the time to say, ""young lady, get out of my room! And put some clothes on this instant!"" Does he do that? NO!!! He simply stares at her with dead, zombied out eyes, and then they do the deed. Well, if they both do it together, how come SHE is the evil temptress and HE is the helpless victim? Who wrote this stuff, St. Augustine?<br/><br/>Okay, so the moment Hobbs starts having sex with Memo, his bat starts to droop. I mean his batting average declines. What, she's draining his vital bodily fluids? Hobbs starts coming on like General Jack D. Ripper in DR STRANGELOVE: ""I don't avoid women, Mandrake. But I do deny them my essence. I don't allow them to sap my pure bodily fluids."" <br/><br/>Fortunately, at this point Iris, the GOOD GIRL reappears. Apparently she has lived a chaste, sexless life for fifteen years, while Hobbs was having sex with a long, long string of ""bad girls."" Now she's ready to take care of him and make apple pies back on the farm? Who wrote this stuff? I mean, like WHO?"

Let me save you the agonised protracting: Yes, he is; even in his mid-40's; but of course, in the 'magical' world of moving pictures, Redford, with his insouciant charm, might just be capable of leaping tall buildings, with his status as the 'wonderboy' of the baby boomers.

","This film is a quality production throughout and my favourite Redford performance next to ""The Candidate"".<br/><br/>The subject matter is baseball and its place in American life, but the legend is Arthurian, mirroring the turmoils and triumphs of the ancient King of England. <br/><br/>Along the road to becoming 'The best there ever was', Roy Hobbs (Redford) caves in to temptation and abuses his emerging boy to man status by ignoring his honour to his first love and meeting the mysterious Harriet (Hershey) at a hotel. There are many theories as to her dark purpose and how this links to later plot development, none of which really becomes clear. However, her early act of genuine shock does give background to the later years emergence of Hobbs, who has aged and seemingly risen from the dead to fulfil his destiny on the plate. Consequently on the road to greatness, another femme fatale, Memo (Bassinger) effectively takes Harriet's place, seeking out weaklings for Gus the big bad bookie from hell to manipulate (such as ""Bump"" Bailey and, in the climax to the film, the NY Knights bent pitcher).<br/><br/>I like the contrast of the two ladies here - Hershey/Bassinger in black and Glenn Close in white - a clear reference to evil Morgana and pure Guinnevere (have I spelled that right??).<br/><br/>Hobbs rises, falls and rises again, to defeat, in a brilliant baseball crescendo, the owner (in league with Gus and Memo) of the Knights. He then returns to his first love in a sentimental, but 'right' end frame. Thus the story comes full circle and why not? It is a tale and a great one, too.<br/><br/>One unanswered question: Hobbs was shot in the stomach, so how come when Memo Paris touches his sensitive scar (the nightmare scene) it is placed on his shoulder.....?<br/><br/>One of my favourite films of all time and it is something that all of the family can watch, without the feeling that it is wishy washy.<br/><br/>Maybe I am drawn to this film by my love of baseball - but I cant help but draw parallels with the injured Kirk Gibson stepping up to the plate for the Dodgers in the 1988 World Series to score a platinum plated homer, against the ""A""'s against all the odds.......<br/><br/>""Try this one for size"" (Hobbs fits cap on) ""Welcome to the majors!"""

Atmosphere is great, particularly the Knights' wonderful home park (War Memorial Stadium in Buffalo, now history). The supporting cast led by Brimley is uniformly good. But there's something off and it's hard to put a finger on it. It may be that things just all seem gothically over-played. And the upbeat ending spoils the message of the original story, where the bitter climax largely defined the tale. Sort of like filming Titanic without the icebergs. If the book wasn't so inspired it might be less of a fault, but given the wonderful source material to work with this movie deserves no more than a 5 out of 10."
"vitaleralphlouis","1","13","34","9 December 2007"," Baseball: Bad and Boring
","The poster child for bad movies about baseball has just gotta be THE NATURAL, an overrated mess by Barry Levinson who directed DINER (real good) and has since directed one dud after another.<br/><br/>With lots of pretentious and stilted drama --- imagine Masterpiece Theater doing baseball on Saturday Night Live --- this picture might be an unintended tribute to the Chicago Cubs circa 1984 or earlier --- their wonderful Wrigley Field being a holdout against night games.<br/><br/>Why? Much --- I mean most of --- the picture is about Robert Redford trying to destroy the stadium lighting system by smashing it with baseballs! Not to give the whole plot away, but this he does literally dozens and dozens of times. I suppose Levinson thought all this light smashing looked like fireworks, or maybe it was intended to represent the shear glory of Mr. Redford, but the true effect for that portion of the audience neither brain dead nor ga ga over Mr. Redford is how stupid it is, how boring to watch a 2 hour movie which is mostly about smashing up light bulbs.<br/><br/>Somehow this awful film became a rallying point for the pseudo intellectual; hence the numerous 10, 9 and 8 ratings herein. But honestly, almost any other baseball movie is scads better."
"fabiogaucho","Null","5","10","29 August 2004"," Sort of a B movie, but fun
","The cast is all-star; the story is promising; the lighting is weird; the directing is cliché, but the screenplay is the fun. It feels computer-generated, so amateurish are some dialogs, so formulaic are the situations (it feels as if a Disney family oriented movie sometimes invades a serious drama), so stereotypical are the characters. (SPOILERS) At one point, our hero has a bullet removed from his stomach after being shot 15 years before (!), and the doctor warns him about the danger he's in because of the damage it did to his guts. Redford argues it is not important because that shot is something of the past (!!). At another point, he goes on a bad hitting streak for weeks because he is dating a girl who wants to sabotage him. She does nothing, he just catches her bad luck! But he starts hitting well again for several weeks when he is at bat and vaguely sees a person in white (the mother of his son) standing up and reflecting the sun. The last 40 minutes of film are just composed of ""generic"" scenes that could be in any movie: hero rejects bribery, gets to final game just before it starts, talks to a teammate who is on the fix, has a bad game but rises up to the occasion in the end hitting a home-run in slow motion (how could it be otherwise?). There isn't a single shot that you can't see it coming from miles. But I found nothing irritating in this movie, because 10 minutes after it begins you already can't take it seriously. I actually found its silliness very charming. Brimley, Redford and Duvall are very charismatic. Good mindless fun."
"kmarshall","4","8","19","22 July 2001"," You can't always do whatever you want, even if you try hard enough.
","﻿Let's face it: it didn't really matter who was cast in this film. All of the so-called characters are basically caricatures that are so cliched, it becomes ludicrous. I must give Robert Redford points for trying to make something out of this script, and he is one of the few reasons I gave this film a higher rating than it probably deserves. He brings an unmistakable presence to his film characters, and ""The Natural"" is no exception. Unfortunately, I think he was being a bit to optimistic in thinking that anyone could make something of a character who's depth can be completely described with one sentence: ""Aging and down-on-his-luck baseball player who believes in 'playing the game how it was meant to be played.'""<br/><br/>Perhaps the most ridiculous addition to the film is Robert Prosky as the sinister team owner.  This is just the type of film where the good guys wear white and the bad guys wear black, so I guess it may seem fitting that his character conducts his business in an office, all the lights off and the blinds shut. He doesn't like light, we are told, but are given no valid reason as to why (although one can easily guess by studying the rest of the film). Yes, he threatens the hero with blackmail. Yes, his sinister shadow can be seen behind his office blinds overlooking the night games, although the fact that he can see the game through closed blinds and that his shadow can be seen at all without any light on in his office seem to contradict simple logic. But, by the time these things occur, the film isn't worried about small details like these anymore.<br/><br/>The first half an hour or so of ""The Natural"" are very promising, which in turn makes the rest of the film even more of a let-down. The use of slow-motion is excellent, although it is used to show us the shattering of glass a little too often. The score is perhaps one of the movie's brightest points, smartly providing the mood for each scene. But, in the end, this film falls prey to dull characters and an uninspired script. I tried to like ""The Natural"". I really did. I guess it just goes to show that, contrary to what this movie tells us, you can't always do whatever you want, even if you try hard enough."

It stars Robert Redford, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Kim Basinger, Wilford Brimley, Barbara Hershey, Robert Prosky and Richard Farnsworth. Music is by Randy Newman and cinematography by Caleb Deschanel.<br/><br/>The Natural is a wistful sports movie, one that asks every person who views it to buy into the whimsy and mythologising on show. If able to do that then it's a film of beguiling beauty, awash with strength of the human spirit and of luscious technical credits. The Arthurian core to Roy Hobbs' (Redford a superb presence yet calmness personified) second chance ensures we always know this is fanciful stuff, but that's just fine, we are in Field of Dreams territory here and fans of such fare are rewarded royally. Period art design, photography and musical score are grade ""A"", snuggling up nicely with a support cast to Redford that is of high end proportions.

","Not being an American or a baseball fan you would ask yourself why I would be watching a movie about baseball. Well, I think there is more to this movie than only baseball. It's theme reminded me of ""The Rookie"" with Dennis Quaid (2002). It was about a man fulfilling his dream. There are lot people saying that it is alright to dream as long as you remember that you can't live your dream if you have certain responsibilities. Of course there is some truth in that but that movie as ""The Natural"" teaches us it's never too late in trying to achieve your dream. And that theme is quite universal so it would appeal to many viewers. And I must say that this movie certainly is uplifting. The fact that ""The Natural"" is filled with skilled actors that did an excellent job is a nice bonus in my eyes.I enjoyed seeing Robert Redford in action. He made the older ""rookie"" thing quite believable. After having seen a lot of bad movies this year(2008) I took it upon me to watch older movies. And compared to those movies it is obvious that there is a serious decline in quality film making. ""The Natural"" is an example of how movies should be made."
"Blueyondermjs","7","3","5","5 December 2006"," Another Baseball movie
","Yet another baseball movie roles around, and we always wonder if this one will be ""it"". The Natural(1984), directed by Barry Levinson is an enjoyable, entertaining movie that is above average in many respects. The Natural certainly isn't revolutionary, but its worth a shot.<br/><br/>The Natural has a wonderful story. It is a story about a man overcoming his past and achieving his boyhood dreams. Roy Hobbs, in what would have been the peak of his career, is shot and disappears from the game altogether for nearly 20 years. After this lengthy stretch he attempts to come back to the game, but such an attempt proves what would be an entirely futile attempt, as seen in the dugout during batting practice as Hobbs approaches the coaches telling them he's actually already on the team, much to the coach's dismay to the addition of this ""nobody"". Sentimite quickly changes, as just a few scenes later he is being interviewed as he walks from the locker room from a rather large congregation of members of the press. Hobbs eventually sets out and accomplishes what he had original set to do. While the plot proves to be entertaining, it is not terribly original. This, however, does not detract much from the movie, keeping it at an overall appealing film. The Natural, while not terribly original, entertains with a story about determination and triumph where the Hobbs overcomes his past.<br/><br/>Many directorial techniques enhance the film by making certain scenes increasingly dramatic. The use of slow motion is abundant in this movie-almost to a fault, yet it serves to intensify the plot at key points. The final scene of the film features a very dramatic game where Hobbs has to pull his team out of what seems to be an abyss. He steps up to the plate in slow motion and the anticipation builds. The opposing picture, who looks daunting enough, is viewed from a low angle shot, enhancing his daunting character. The drama is built to where viewers begin to wonder if Hobbs can really pull it off. The directors use of cinematic directorial techniques help to dramatize the film with such techniques as slow motion and low angle shots.<br/><br/>While the movie is enjoyable, the action goes so far that is is far-fetched, taking away from the experience. The final scene, again, is very dramatic, but that's not where it goes wrong. Hobbs and the rest of the team are playing terribly, and what could have been a great victory looks like a quickly fading dream. However, towards the end of the game Hobbs hits the game winning home run. But this isn't just any home run. This home run went literally out of the park, and hit the stadium lights which almost literally explode. A shower of sparks rain down over the stadium as Hobbs rounds the bases (in slow motion again). The sparks begin falling in the outfield, but somehow migrate to rain on the team as they celebrate Hobbs's victory which appears to be a powerful scene if you aren't groaning as to how far out this movie (and especially this scene) go. Other far-fetched scenes are plentiful, such as batting practice where Hobbs hits consecutive home run after home run. This, unfortunately, isn't the work of steroids at their finest, but a movie crossing the line (and then some). Many incredible events, such as the main character possessing superman-like abilities at key moments such as the climax and the batting practice scene take away from the film.<br/><br/>The Natural is an emotional, powerful movie. Many scenes which prove to be possible tear jerkers in this movie are present. For example, Hobbs's bat was hand carved from the wood of a lightening struck tree. His bat, however, breaks in the climax, and Hobbs asks Bobby (a little boy who befriended Hobbs) to pick out a new bat, and he chooses a bat that the two made together. The climax, while the action is too far out there, is a powerful scene. This is seen especially as Hobbs steps up to bat against a young pitcher. Here, you begin to see that the entire scene is symbolic. Hobbs is facing, almost literally, his past. He must overcome, and defeat his past, while achieving his boyhood dream of being a big shot baseball player. The Natural, due to its powerful scenes, such as Hobbs symbolically overcoming his past and achieving his dream and using a bat his young friend made to hit the game winning home run, is an emotional film.<br/><br/>This film deserves a view despite its shortcomings. It is, overall, a very enjoyable movie that should entertain a wide range of ages."

","Darren McGavin's death yesterday brings to mind his career, including all his movies. He only had a small role in ""The Natural"", but the movie itself was something else. Starring Robert Redford as a 1930's baseball player with a seemingly superhuman talent (possibly due to his bat), it's one of those movies up to interpretation - although IMDb.com noted that there's a slight allusion to Greek mythology. Maybe some parts were a little predictable, but it was overall a pretty neat movie, even for someone like me who takes no interest in sports. With a supporting cast of Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Kim Basinger, Wilford Brimley, Robert Prosky, Joe Don Baker, and Richard Farnsworth, it's another impressive feature from Barry Levinson."

","A big, showy, flashy, museum-piece of a film--like a famous painting of a myth--that sure does leave me cold. <br/><br/>The film, which looks and sounds great, goes to such lengths to do up a mystery-man myth- -the stuff legend--that I find the more legendary it becomes, the more removed I become from the characters. Redford plays a fellow whose past is so hidden, and who is really only interested in playing baseball, and talking baseball, that I have no connection to him, no reason to be interested in him. I much prefer Redford with a wild side--see THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR, or BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID--over this tight, controlled, almost robotic knight of sport. Meanwhile, much as I respect the stature of Robert Duvall, I'm a bit weary of the patented nervous laughter, or sly, knowing leer he uses to buff up a performance. Admittedly, he tries to do a lot in a few scenes, but what he does is too familiar, too obviously easy for him. The same goes for my impressions of Joe Don Baker, who sometimes strikes me as a guy slipping into easy caricature--here and in GOLDENEYE-- rather than look for the subtler shades. I guess the bottom-line is: can I tell they're acting a role.<br/><br/>On the flipside, people like Wilford Brimley, Richard Farnsworth, and Michael Madsen are a breath of fresh air in this puffy-shirt of a movie. Brimley and Farnsworth don't work to undermine the mythic quality sought in the film (the aspect that doesn't always impress me), but their old-duffer, regular-guy, ""I say what I feel"" approach keeps them down among the mortal plane with me. As for Madsen, he doesn't get to be a regular guy, necessarily, and he doesn't get to add layers--but despite that the movie desperately needed a feral, wild-card quality, something or someone dangerous and unpredictable, and Madsen provides that with his egotistical, arrogant ballplayer. The most enjoyable scene for me, the only time I didn't really know where things were going to go, was when a jealous Madsen took hold of Redford's lucky bat and wouldn't give it back.<br/><br/>This brings me to the overall predictability of the film; It's not that hard to see what is leading to what. Combine this with the over-the-top hitting heroics that make our star player an almost unbelievable hero, and spectacular becomes corny. And the women's roles? Three talented actresses caught in, to my mind, negligible, paste-em-on characters, with only the amazing Glenn Close having some layers, and handling them well, predictable though they are.<br/><br/>I would love to love this more, but it's not my thing, by show's end. Beautifully lit, gorgeous period detail, stunning cinematography--and these people kind of bore me. I guess if I were a more rabid baseball fanatic, I would treasure more The Fairy Tale Where Everything Is Just Perfect. Instead, I was all ""C'mon, Madsen--slug somebody, break a bat over someone's head."".<br/><br/>I just wish 'Legend' didn't mean we don't get to know anything about anybody."

How he overcomes these imperfections provides us with some of the most uplifting and magical moments in modern cinema.  Whether or not you're a sports fan, this film will remind you why we need heroes.

It's a fable. It does silly things knowing that they would work in an illustrated children's book, so why not make it a sepia-toned over-the-top feel-good Hollywood bash? Indeed.<br/><br/>So when Robert Redford (who does not, by the way, have the biceps for power hitting) smashes a pitch so hard he rips the skin off the ball, it's not for real. Or it's better than real. And so forth with lightning arriving in time for his last big hit, or having his rival crash through a wall and die (yes die!) just when he needs a chance to take position in right field. <br/><br/>Treating this as a fable about a man with talent and a dream, and with some kind of sloppy honor to his past (you'll see), makes it very watchable. It's doesn't quite make it ""good"" however, so be prepared to like the film only on its own simple terms. It's fun if you don't think too hard. <br/><br/>This movie has great credentials, including Barry Levinson directing and Robert Duvall in a secondary role. Honestly, it's just not my kind of film—check out ""The Pride of the Yankees"" for a really good baseball film—but I can see how it would settle nicely on a lot of folks, including young people with dreams of being the best."

","The Natural is known to be a Holy Grail movie set to Baseball.  And, as such, it's a beautiful movie.  It has interesting characters and a good story.  But, that's not what makes this movie special.  There are three home-run scenes in the film, an initial success, a comeback from adversity, and the triumphant finale.  These are some of the most magnificent and magical moments ever captured on film.  No other movie has ever caught the mystery of baseball in three short scenes as this one has.  Okay, the film is a bit too long and the last scene of the movie is a bit hokey, but if you don't see any other part of The Natural, you will always remember that musical fanfare, showers of sparks, balls that seem to have been given wings, and knowing that there can be magic in a stick of wood."

","Barry Levinson is kind of the specialist of films resembling more poor TV movies, his cinematographic feel being close to zero, and he proves it once again with The Natural.<br/><br/>The story of this baseball player hardly could have been more badly told, there is absolutely no coherence in the narration, the scenes follow one another completely disjointly, with no clear line, and to make things worse, some elements of the story are hardly believable, for example the player making his comeback after a 18 year break, or his level of play fluctuating with his relationships.<br/><br/>The movie is terribly flat, the characters have no dimension, the game scenes have no emotions, no ambitions, and are peppered with ridiculous slow motions and a dispensable grandiloquent music.<br/><br/>The Natural is typical of the American director, a poor movie one will forget as soon as finished."

","The film drips of filtered sunshine, a hearkening back to some golden past when real heroes could emerge, and that is the problem. It is almost too pat. We know Levinson will not let Roy strike out, like Malamud did in the book, so this throws any tension out the window. To make up for it, he gives us an 1812 Overture of an ending.<br/><br/>But what could Levinson do in 1984? That was the year of ""Morning in America"" and the great gold haul at the Olympics in Los Angeles. Dutch made everything sunny. The book was written in the early Cold War fifties, when the Joe McCarthy show was the leading television program. Surely Malamud was infected by the mood of the times. Watch the films of 1950-53....so many are about seedy characters, or ambiguous men trying to skirt fine lines. Several Richard Widmark gritty pieces neatly illustrate this, as does Wilder's Ace in the Hole. <br/><br/>I doubt Levinson would have been the director to follow Malamud's tale, but rather he used it as a scaffold. The book would have made a great movie in 1974, but that time was gone."

I think there were unanswered questions that are troubling. Why did Harriet shoot Roy. We never found out. Wasn't it a strange wager between the coach and the judge to determine ownership of the team? This was more fantastic then the home run at the end that changed the weather.

To make matters worse, this travesty is two hours and 18 minutes long.<br/><br/>The only thing remarkable is the period sets, costumes, cars, etc. Someone obviously worked hard on these items.<br/><br/>For a good move in the baseball genre, try For the Love of the Game (1999).

The problem with this approach, though, is that it sometimes gives us only melodrama -- an often satisfactory but also uncomplicated vision of good and evil that comes nowhere near to the true complications of our lives. Also, the use of such heavy-handed imagery (the lights popping out like fireworks) beats us about the head too freely, leaving us feeling ever so slightly manipulated.<br/><br/>Also, whether the moviemakers realize it or not, they also conjure up some pretty unpleasant attitudes of those good old days -- the completely unracialized vision of baseball and the vision of women as only saints or sinners.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this movie, seeing just before the new season.

"tieman64","Null","2","6","21 June 2013"," Generic, overly sentimental ball movie
","Like most baseball flicks, ""The Natural"" is a mawkish, overly sentimental sports movie. Typical of the genre, it's filmed with a gauzy, nostalgic tone, spends most of its running time romanticising the game and indulges in a number of hokey, metaphysical subplots which attempt to lend a vaguely spiritual or mythical air to one of America's favourite religions. Thank director Barry Levinson for all this.<br/><br/>Thank actor Robert Redford for everything else. Redford, who plays a hotshot ball player in the film, was known for a number of counterculture projects which attempted social critique. This one, ""The Natural"", goes out of its way to sketch an America full of schemers, back-stabbers and money grubbing profiteers who destroy lives, families and the ""spirit of the game"". The juxtaposition between the film's two poles thus results in its best quality, a love-hate relationship which Redford's character eventually grows tired of and rejects. The film's final shots echo its first, fathers and sons playing ball with fathers and sons. Almost all of Redford's films during this period had the same philosophical arc: frustration followed by cynical, reflexive impotency and then disconnection; abandon the game or play it on your terms. <br/><br/>Levinson has never been particularly strong with visuals. ""The Natural"" is filled with clichés, overuses slow motion and is very heavy-handed throughout. In Levinson's defence, such things were new at the time, and in many ways ""the Natural"" was a trend-setter which set in stone what we now take to be genre clichés. The film co-stars the always wonderful Richard Farnsworth.<br/><br/>6/10 - See ""Bull Durham"" and ""Moneyball""."

","'The Natural' is, unfortunately for the viewer, very unnatural in the way it chooses to tell its story. Several events occur in the film that are handled in a ham-fisted and bizarre manner. This leads to a jerky and disjointed progression of developments built around a character (Roy Hobbs) that has very little backstory, despite the fact that he's onscreen about 90% of the runtime. Because of this, interesting characters such as Pop Fisher, Iris Gaines and Max Mercy get sidelined. Speaking of characters: the villains of this film are generic and somewhat cartoonish; they do not add much in the way of real tension.

But put him in the right movie and he stands out. The Natural is such a movie. But as I watch the movie, I wonder if maybe because it stars Redford it plays a little overly soft and gentle, as though the film is aimed more at 14 year-olds when compared to 40 year-olds.

And I don't know of any moviegoer who doesn't immediately recognize the slow-motion home run with fireworks and Randy Newman's beautiful score in the background.<br/><br/>Those two scenes aside, The Natural is a classic baseball movie. Robert Redford rises and falls—and perhaps rises again—as a baseball player in the 1920s and 1930s. Which means this is a perfect ""compromise"" movie, as I call it. Men will be satisfied because it's a sports movie, and ladies will get to drool over Robert Redford in period piece outfits.<br/><br/>Three women, Barbara Hershey, Glenn Close, and Kim Basinger, are important and different influences in his life.

These are arrogant and corrupted men.<br/><br/>Brimley and Richard Farnsworth are the pure heart of the sport, uncorrupted men who love the game.<br/><br/>I first watched this film over 30 years ago and found it enchanting, a thoughtful film for all the family.<br/><br/>This was director's Barry Levinson's introduction to the major league. A chance to work with a big star and bigger budget. I think Levinson feels a bit lost away from his personal Baltimore set films and this could be the reason why some find the film cheesy and the portrayal of women shallow.<br/><br/>I think the decision to shoot Redford and Close as teenagers in dim light is a risky move that they just about get away with. However when we see the older Hobbs we see Redford in his element. Like Hobbs in the intervening sixteen years, Redford keeps him mysterious, somehow distant which is typical of the actor who eschewed the method acting of displaying histrionics on screen. You leave that to others and just bounce of them."

","(Plot) A highly touted, once in a lifetime prospect has his career taken away from him. He reappears out of nowhere for another crack at greatness, but there seems to be some real divine magic at work, considering his age.<br/><br/>I wanna get this out of the way. I enjoyed this film quite a bit. It has a certain old school charm that manages to consume you throughout most of the duration. My problem is actually with the duration itself. It's over two hours long, and I felt they could have easily cut it a little bit. Especially Redford & Basinger's scenes, which I felt droned on a bit. I think viewers could easily tell where it was going, and trimming it would have been more effective. This is also the type of film where you will have to suspend your belief quite a bit, but hey. That's the magic of movies. It also has big hints of ""divine intervention"" throughout the film. I loved the cinematography, and the baseball action is often very exciting. Robert Redford plays this perfectly low- key, and proves why he is one of the greatest actors. He is our hero, and he was a main reason why I didn't tune out from the very long running time. He was excellent. Glenn Close doesn't have as big a role as you may think. She has a much bigger part in the second half. Close was good as per usual, even if her character was a bit underdeveloped. Robert Duvall is good as the nosy reporter. Duvall's range is near untouchable at times. Wilford Brimley is excellent as the grumpy coach with a heart of gold. Kim Basinger is effectively cold in her performance, but I felt some of her scenes were not needed. Barbara Hershey has a really quaint character. It's hard to describe her , but she did well. Joe Don Baker elicits memories of Babe Ruth. I wish he had more screen time. <br/><br/>Final Thoughts: It's a bit of a strange film in all honesty, and much too long, but I did enjoy it quite a bit. It's definitely well made, engrossing, and the cast is awesome. Recommended!<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","Being Scottish, my acquaintance with live baseball is limited to attending three separate games while on holiday in the States and Canada, but there's something about the history of this almost uniquely American game (oddly enough, I'm also a keen fan of its nearest UK equivalent, cricket) which fascinates me and led me to recently watching in its entirety Ken Burns' extensive TV history of the sport.<br/><br/>So, knowing just enough about the sport to get by, I settled down to enjoy this excellent baseball-themed movie and enjoy it I did. Directed in a fashion that aptly recalls classic Hollywood story-telling of the 20's and 30's, it relates its fable of the rise, fall and rise again of ""The Natural"", the man with no past, Roy Hobbs, played handsomely, in more ways than one by Robert Redford. Only of course we do know his past, as shown in the prologue which introduces Hobbs and his exceptional talent, brutally curtailed following a moral misjudgement, the outcome of which delays his entry to the big league by some 17 years.<br/><br/>Luckily, Redford can carry off looking 20 as required in the first 15 minutes, when he first shows his talent, albeit in pitching, with an encounter with a thinly disguised Babe Ruth, played with gusto by Joe Don Baker. When he returns years later to make his destiny in the sport, he comes across the usual distractions of sleazy journalism, shady financiers and of course, loose women, before he gets a wake-up call just in time from his true love and gives the ending the story deserves, even as I understand it contradicts that of the source novel.<br/><br/>Shot in appropriately golden light and strongly played by most of the principals, the only weak link being Kim Basinger as the scheming sex-pot out to turn his head, this is an exciting and emotionally engaging story. Perhaps the villains of the piece could have been drawn a shade darker and Robert Duvall is slightly underused as the scheming journalist scenting a story, but a young Glenn Close is just right as the grown-up girl Hobbs left behind, whose eleventh-hour revelation inspires his final act.<br/><br/>Director Levinson pulls out the stops for the big set-piece climaxes on the field as Redford serves up the clichés of ""hitting the cover off the ball"" and ""stopping the clocks"", before literally ""lighting the lights"" at the conclusion. He thus invests the sport with the near-mythical symbolism its devoted supporters claim as its due and I for one am not about to deny them.<br/><br/>In a crowded market-place, this has to be one of the best sporting films ever, while I hold my breath waiting for a major movie about cricket."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","1","2","21 August 2012"," Knock the Cover off the Ball!
","Most sports-themed film follow the similar tradition of an underdog getting an opportunity to play with the leagues followed by an obstacle that sets him back and then the final match that symbolizes his victory in life or that of a fallen sports hero finally getting a chance to clear his name and wins the last match of the film. 'The Natural' follows a similar tradition but Barry Levinson's treatment of the story is what makes this film unique. It's a very nice looking film thanks to the superb art direction and Caleb Deschanel's remarkable cinematography. Even though 'The Natural' has a polished look, it never appears flashy.<br/><br/>The characters are beautifully defined. It's got none of the formulaic caricatures one has witnessed x times in such films. All the characters here are complex just like any other human being. Furthermore, I liked that each of them had their own secrets, their own mystery. Humour is used cleverly with fine timing. Like the scene where the cover of the ball is knocked off.<br/><br/>Robert Redford is brilliant as the middle-aged batter. One can tell that he really studied the role and sunk his teeth into the character delivering a splendidly restrained performance. Rubert Duvall and Richard Fairnsworth are great too. Glenn Close and Barbara Hershey are wonderful. Kim Basinger's performance might not be outstanding but she certainly looks the part.<br/><br/>Overall, Barry Levinson has created something unique from what could have easily been a cliché. 'The Natural' is full of layers and rich in detail, detail in the characters and detail in their small interactions. However, a few flaws include casting Redford as Hobbs in his 20s (when he was in his late 40s). Of course they didn't have the technologies in those days that made Brad Pitt look younger in 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Buttons' but still it was too obvious that Redford wasn't anywhere near 20. But these sequences are only ten minutes so they can be forgiven."
"classicsoncall","8","1","2","30 December 2011"," ""I came here to play ball.""
","Sometimes the best sports movies don't have a lot to do with the sport that's being represented on film. You could say ""The Natural"" is a good baseball movie, but it's not really about the game as much as it is about examining a man's life and the way he plays the cards he's been dealt. It's about determination and loyalty, with a healthy dose of personal redemption. Iris Gaines (Glenn Close) sums it up pretty well for Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford) when she explains her theory of two lives - ""the life we learn with and the life we live with after that"". It can't be stated any better than that.<br/><br/>I have to admit, I thought the idea of the 'Wonder Boy' was a little corny when I first saw the film, but then I think about some of the goofy stuff I came up with when I was a lot younger and it doesn't seem so out of place. I liked the idea of bat-boy Billy carrying on his own tradition with the Savoy Special, especially when it was called on to save the day in the defining moment of the story. When Roy said ""Pick me out a winner Bobby"", you knew the outcome was inevitable but it was a thrill to see it happen nonetheless.<br/><br/>""The Natural"" has a great cast supporting the principal players, with Wilford Brimley as the crusty manager Pop Fisher, Kim Basinger as sexy seductress Memo Paris, and Robert Duvall as sportswriter Max Mercy. A young Michael Madsen is barely recognizable as ball player Bump Bailey in an early film appearance, and I got the biggest kick out of the guy the Knights brought in as a motivational speaker. If losing is a disease, I wonder what illness he had."

"TOMASBBloodhound","8","1","2","27 April 2008"," Full of nostalgia and inspiration.
","Okay, so it can be a little corny at times, and Robert Redford is always a bit overrated, but this is still quite an inspirational film. The Natural is one of the best kinds of sports movies. It is a film that LOVES the game it is depicting. Sports movies often try but fail to convey their true appreciation for the game they are about. Other times, sports movies are simply parodies of the worst traits of their games. The Natural elevates its story and characters to mythical proportions. The results are generally moving.<br/><br/>Robert Redford is the title character named Roy Hobbs. When we first meet him as a young man, he is all set to become perhaps the greatest pitcher of all time. An unfortunate tragedy robs Hobbs of the next 16 years of his career, and the next time we see him, he is an aging rookie just trying to play right field for the worst team in major league baseball known as the New York Knights. The Knights are quite a bunch of guys. Managed by a grizzled old coach (Brimley), they seem destined to be cellar dwellers until Hobbs is finally given the chance to play and his incredible hitting ability inspires all of them to play like champions. The owner of the team, a crusty old judge, will win full control of the team from Brimiley if they don't win the pennant. He and his cronies attempt to use money and beautiful women to trip Hobbs up, and his character is tested once again as an older man. Will he remain true to the game? Will the wounds from his previous accident prevent him from winning the big game? Apparently not. But I guess in the book, he strikes out in his final at bat. Come on! Robert Redford's ego is way too big to have allowed that ending to be filmed!!! The film scores its most points (or runs) in terms of its nostalgic feeling. You really come away believing that's how things looked for a baseball team in the 1930s. The acting ranges from exceptional to mediocre, to maybe just sub-par. Many of the supporting cast out-shine Redford in little scenes. The man just doesn't have the acting chops to justify his stardom. At least in this film, he isn't smug like he is in so many other films. Roy Hobbs is generally a humble and unassuming character that you feel compelled to root for. Even when he makes a bad decision. Support from Farnsworth, McGavin, and Duvall is outstanding. Kim Basinger might have been a little out of her element, however. But she is nice to look at.<br/><br/>Although the film is loaded with mythology and symbolism, the basic lesson learned is pretty much: Don't rely on your gifts alone. You have to work hard and make good choices in life, or all manner of things can bring you down. Redford also gets major props for developing a great-looking swing. He really looks like a great player should look up in the batter's box. Overall, I'd say this one is about as close to being a classic as you can have without it actually being a classic. 8 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

","There are quite a few great movies about baseball. Some of my personal favorites are: ""Pride of the Yankees"", ""Field of Dreams"", ""Bull Durham"", ""A League Of Their Own"", ""Eight Men Out"", ""61*"" as well as others I just can't remember right now. However, ""The Natural"" is, by far and away, my own personal favorite of all. It is based on a fictional character named ""Roy Hobbs"", whose love and exceptional talent for the game predispose his upcoming career, by virtue of his ""natural"" ability, to the kind of notoriety legends are made of. Although certain aspects are loosely based on an actual event, the aftermath is strictly a fictional accounting. It is an inspiring, entertaining story about facing adversity and overcoming the odds, especially when the odds are stacked against you. This great story is made all the more memorable by the impeccable performances of: Robert Redford, Glenn Close, Kim Basinger, Wilford Brimley, Robert Duvall, Robert Prosky, Darren McGavin, Richard Farnsworth, et al.

"moonspinner55","7","1","2","26 April 2008"," ""King Arthur"" on the baseball diamond...some pleasures to be had
","Robert Redford plays Roy Hobbs, a middle-aged ballplayer in 1939 who is recruited to the New York Knights baseball team based upon his freelance success at the game; his new coach keeps Hobbs benched out of spite, but when the chips are down, Hobbs shows his miraculous way with a bat and ball for all the world's amazement. Barry Levinson directed this handsome, burnished film-version of Bernard Malamud's book, with a coffee-table elegance and lots of crusty sons-of-bitches in the line-up. Some of the plot-mechanisms are tacky (such as out-fielder Michael Madsen's exit, or when Hobbs is told to knock the cover off the ball and he actually does it), and the underlying mysticism of the story is never quite brought to the fore (there is magic and the opposite of magic--jinxes--at work here, yet the pieces seem to fall into place by unassuming design). The gals are either good or evil, while the men (Wilford Brimley's coach, Robert Prosky's blackmailing Judge, Robert Duvall's reporter) are rank-and-file old coots. I'm not sure what Brimley's personal beef is during much of the picture, and Redford's unwavering loyalty to him seems to come out of nowhere. Richard Farnsworth is always wonderful to have around as an assistant coach, and Redford does a very fine job at being mysteriously stand-offish and cautious (and he cuts a nice figure out there on the field). The movie has peaks and valleys; it would've been wiser to shake off the cobwebs a little sooner and get Hobbs out of that dugout, but it's prettily photographed and, at times, moving, perceptive and absorbing. **1/2 from ****"

A poor, mentally imbalanced woman stalked a Major League Baseball Player and did Shoot and critically wound him. Fortunately, he lived.<br/><br/>Using flashback, the story takes us from the now 35 or so year old Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford)sits,alone, lonely and obviously being very thoughtful, sitting in a Railroad Station, waiting for his Train. We look at his serious, weary face and are instantly that this is a man who has been through an ordeal. Life has not been easy. His countenance retains a permanent sadness, as if it were etched into a stone sculpture.<br/><br/>The story takes us back some 20 years or so to see this same Roy Hobbs as a young Farm Boy, playing catch and shagging fly balls with his Father (Alan Fudge). Roy excels in every phase of the game. While practicing his pitching, his Father praising him, but cautioning him that he should never take it for granted. ""You've got a gift,Roy. But that's not enough!"", Father admonishes him. The neighbor Farm Girl, Iris, watches them practice.<br/><br/>Time moves on and we see Roy witness his Father's fatal heart attack, right under the huge sycamore tree next to their farm house. Young Roy continues to cling to his dream to be a Ballplayer, his walls decorated with pennants of various National League Teams including the mythical New York Knights.<br/><br/>A violent thunderstorm brings torrential rain fall and a heavy bombardment of lightening strikes the old, huge sycamore causing it to split open, shattered down to a stump. Roy chops out a large section of timber, and finely hones it down to a custom made Baseball Bat.<br/><br/>Fast forward and we find Roy, now newly graduated from high school, running through the farm fields to meet the now also teen-aged Iris(Glenn Close). Having a great announcement about his having been called up by the Chicago Cubs for a look see at his Baseball talents. They go in such a jubilant, hurried manner to the barn that we know that they've been there before. Roy announces the good news, they hug and kiss. He would be leaving town, bound for Chicago. ""I want to marry you!"", declares Roy. ""I'll send for you!"" To celebrate, they go for a roll in the hay, apparently for the first time.<br/><br/>The rest of the flashbacks tel the story of Roy's journey to Chicago and his getting sidetracked in his quest for the Major Leagues. Youth, coming of age-suddenly and the inevitable development of at least some degree of cynicism along the way.<br/><br/>Some have been critical, declaring it too long and meandering. We could't disagree more. The screenplay moves along at a good clip, but not too fast. Yet, it still does not overdue, or ""pad"" out, if you will, any scenes.<br/><br/>As for the all important aspect of casting, Director Barry Levinson and Company would seem to have covered all the bases. After the parts of Roy and Iris are firmly identified with Mr. Redford and Miss Close, the choice of the rest of the players was no less fitting.<br/><br/>We have Roy's High School Coach Sam Simpson (John Finnegan) who is both fatherly proud and cautiously protective of his young protégé. Sportswriter Max Mercy(Robert Duvall), who would stab one in the back if it meant the right price or a little more circulation.<br/><br/>We have the ""other women"" (not just one, but two),Harriet Bird(Barbara Hershey)and Memo Paris(Kim Bassinger) helping to provide bumps in the road for Roy.<br/><br/>The Big Time Gambler, Gus Sands (an uncredited Darren McGavin)provides a large measure of villainy, especially when in cahoots with N.Y.Knights Owner, The Judge (Robert Prosky). As usual, Mr. Robert Prosky turns in a fine, somewhat underplayed, masters' performance.<br/><br/>Team Manager/Part Owner Pop Fisher(Wilford Brimley) and Coach Red Blow(?)(Richard Farnsworth),provide a team of tough, cynical yet lovable ""old codgers"" to run the team and provide their best advice and judgment for the younger folks, especially Hobbs.<br/><br/>I confess that my favourite character is Joe Don Baker as ""The Wammer"". He is the fictional Big League Slugger who Roy meets on the train, and later competes with at the Fairgrounds. Mr. Baker presents us with a huge and powerful, bigger than life slugger. As nasty and vain as he is talented, Joe Don's ""Wammer"" also bears quit a resemblance both physical and personality-wise to one George Herman 'Babe' Ruth.* The location shooting included a lot of work in and around Buffalo, N.Y., which doubled for parts of New York City as well as Chicago.The use of Buffalo's War Memorial Stadium as a 'stand-in' for both Wrigley Field, Chicago and for the mythical Knights' Field in New York City.<br/><br/>Oh, my own personal scene of the whole picture comes along right about midway when N.Y.Knights'Star Outfielder, Bartholomew 'Bump' Bailey gives his all for 'Pop' Fisher and the team by running through the wall, literally. The scene and follow-up come together to demonstrate a fine example of ""Black Humour""**, a rare commodity in today's cinema.<br/><br/>* Please don't accuse me of attributing any of the arrogant,vile and self-centered attitudes and behaviour to the 'Babe'. These poor and less than admirable qualities are strictly the property of ""The Wammer"".<br/><br/>** 'Black Humour' is a little used term today for that which is found to be funny in a serious, sad or tragic situation.

","Barring the darker portion of the film where the protagonist is shot by a wayward female, this is a great film for anyone of any age. It has adultish stuff in the background but does not tamper with the game. In a time when baseball is plagued with the problem of steroid use this movie makes clear right and wrong. A young man starts out to become a player and his career is seemingly cut short. He resurfaces again only to meet resistance from a second-rate team. His character and attitude allow him to take the field and that is what a great story is all about. Second chances, beating the odds, and of course, great women played by Glenn Close, no less. I love the clothes, the scenery and the directing. A remake of this film would not be possible, as Redford probably shows his best here. Perhaps the most important message is that baseball should not be tampered with, by anyone. After the Chicago Black Sox (see: Eight Men Out) it was probably difficult to see sports in the same light again. This movie probably did much to repair that image, although it has been many years since then, the things that make it great don't change. The crack of the bat and the speed of the throw. Even if you only marginally like baseball, you will agree this movie is top notch. This movie is to baseball players as To Kill A Mockingbird is to lawyers. It is just a movie, it didn't really happen, but maybe someday you'll see someone shatter all the nighttime lights at a ballpark. The Natural makes us believe so."

","Barry Levinson's The Natural is by far one of the best baseball movies of all time (second to Pride of the Yankees (1942)) not only because the story is so extraordinary but it also feels like you are an actual character which is in fact how great this movie really is. The movie stars Robert Redford as Roy Hobbs a man who loved baseball all his life and played when he was a kid until high-school and tries to play for the Chicago Cubs at the age of 22 but before that he meets a journalist named Max Mercy (played by Robert Duvall) and a man who is called ""The Whammer"" (played by Joe Don Baker) and practices pitching with them. After he is done with pitching he meets a woman named Harriet Bird (played by Barbara Hershey) who at first seem like friends but after a few days she almost kills Hobbs in her apartment with one gunshot but luckily Hobbs survives and has to wait until he is 38 years old and doesn't get signed on to the Chicago Cubs but instead gets signed on to the New York Knights where he meets two managers one who's name is Pop Fisher (played by Wilford Brimley) who isn't sure at first that Hobbs would do well at his age, and another man named Red Blow (played by Richard Farnsworth) who believes that Hobbs would succeed. The screenplay to this movie is just awe-inspiring, because not only does it tell a story of a great player it also tells an evil back-story because Hobbs is being betrayed and he knows it by three people, the Judge (played by Robert Prosky), Gus Sands (played by Darren McGavin), and a girl that Hobbs was flirting with for a short time named Memo (played by Kim Basinger).The actual best supporting performance in the film didn't only come from Brimley and Farnsworth but the most inspired performance came from Glenn Close as Iris Gaines who was Roy's true love and made Roy a true natural at baseball.Though I didn't read the novel I felt as if I did while watching the movie, which I felt like I was an actual audience member at one of Hobbs' baseball games which to me pretty much explains why i think that all movie lovers should see this wonderful movie that will stay with you for a long time."

","Robert Redford has made a career packaging integrity, and in this sappy soaper, he has really hit paydirt.  The cast is adequate, given the material, and that is NO compliment.  What drives this tearjerker on for 135 dentist-drilling minutes is Randy Newman's luscious score; indeed, he should have written this as a concert piece and withdrawn from the film.  The rape of Bernard Malamud's short novel of the same name, based on the tragic fall of Shoeless Joe Jackson's throwing the 1919 World Series in the infamous ""Black Sox"" scandal, is a travesty.  The novel ends with a paraphrase of the apocryphal question posed to Shoeless Joe by a teary-eyed child, ""Say it ain't so, Joe.""  Malamud closes the novel, ""When Roy looked into the boy's eyes he wanted to say it wasn't but couldn't, and he lifted his hands to his face and wept many bitter tears.""  Instead, we get a music and light show reminiscent of the spaceship landing scene in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" that brings tears to our own eyes and a dulling of our senses.  The big question to ask:  Why hasn't Darin McGavin, who plays the cynical sportswriter, been given screen credit?  Was he too ashamed to have his name attached to this glossy stinker?"

Note the similarities with the movie, The Fisher King. Same theme, new players and setting. The grail did not work in either case. Being the ""best that ever was"" is not an answer to what we need in life. Glenn Close was poetic in saying that we have two lives, one that we learn with and one that we live after that. It is interesting that in the Fisher King Jeff Bridges risked his life for a baseball trophy that he thought was the grail. Some real irony that the screenplayers added.<br/><br/>All in all, a great movie, for lots of reasons. Lots of good and evil. Very little violence. It is about all of us."

"gab-14712","10","0","1","22 April 2020"," My Favorite Baseball Movie!
","The Natural is my favorite baseball movie beating the likes of Field of Dreams or Bull Durham, and I love those movies as well. Could it be the iconic Randy Newman theme that brings me shivers every time I hear it at a baseball stadium? Could it be the stacked cast that includes Robert Redford and Glenn Close? Could it be the impressive direction from Barry Levinson? Or how about baseball being played with a religious overtone? Whatever is the real reason, its safe to say that I adore this movie with all of my heart. I've seen it a good number of times and it never grows old. Ever since hearing the theme played at an independent baseball stadium, my dad showed this movie to me and I'm glad he did.<br/><br/>The film is based off a fictional story from Bernard Malamud. Barry Levinson, who smoothly directed the film, always claimed that the movie was not a direct adaptation of the novel. Many naysayers of the film criticized the film for not being faithful to the book. I have never read the book myself and I am not sure if I want to after falling in love with the movie. Apparently, the ending is vastly different. I consider the film's ending to be more open-ended and could be interpreted in a variety of ways. I liked that! I believe screenwriters Roger Towne and Phil Dusenberry created plenty of magic in their script.<br/><br/>Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford) is a middle-aged baseball player that came out of nowhere to lead the struggling 1930's baseball team, the New York Knights to the pennant. Years earlier, he was a rising star pitcher that was discovered by journalist Max Mercy (Robert Duvall). On a train ride heading to his new future, he meets the mysterious Harriet Bird (Barbara Hershey) who has a thing for athletes who claim to be the very best....and that thing is shooting them. Hobbs career is in limbo after his injury but appears 15 years later with a magical bat made from a tree that was struck by lightning. Along with helping Pop Fisher (Wilford Brimley) take his team to the pennant, he also has to face schemes about controlling the team and his ex-lover, Iris Gaines (Glenn Close).<br/><br/>Robert Redford gives a very subtle, but commanding performance. There is no shouting or no fiery speech, but his presence keeps your eyes glued to him throughout. Glenn Close likewise did an admirable job. She was actually nominated for an Academy Award and was part of the film's ""controversial"" ending. No spoilers, though. The rest of the cast is excellent. Robert Redford as the scheming journalist, Wilford Brimley who is a great manager, Darren McGavin as the greedy, slimy person who wants complete control of the team.<br/><br/>Critics who opposed this film (not too many, thankfully) have issues with the religious overtones. I think these overtones worked incredibly well with the film. Baseball is a healing sport, a sport of unity. Look at baseball right after 9/11. After the current coronavirus pandemic, people will look to baseball for healing. I knew from the beginning where Hobbs uses a bat from a tree that was struck by lightning and where his father died of a heart attack what kind of film we were getting. Of course, the themes hold up throughout the film. Glenn Close's Ira Haines appearing in what seems to be a divine, white light and the film's ending. Randy Newman's score also has an aura of religion about it. Caleb Deschanel, who is in charge of the film's photography, did very good work with the camera capturing these overtones.<br/><br/>Baseball is America's pastime and The Natural gives us reasons why it is. Some people may find the film corny or unrealistic considering the type of home runs Hobbs hit, but not me. I found it to be a story about a man whose life is baseball and believes it's never too late to achieve his dreams. If I had a power bat like Hobbs, I certainly would follow in his footsteps. This is an unforgettable, powerful movie thanks to Robert Redford and company.<br/><br/>My Grade: A+"

Unfortunately, Ed dies leaving Roy to his own devices. The adult Roy (Redford) is involved with local girl Iris Gaines (Glenn Close) and the two plan to eventually marry. We next meet Roy on his way to a tryout in Chicago with the Cubs leaving Iris behind. On the train he meets up with reporter Max Mercy (Robert Duvall) whom he will encounter later, and ""The Slammer"" (Jo Don Baker) a thinly disguised Babe Ruth.<br/><br/>Also on board is the mysterious Harriet Bird (Barbara Hershey) a gold digging femme fatale who attaches herself to ""The Slammer"". A bet is placed that Roy van strike out ""The Slammer"" on three pitches. Roy accomplishes the feat and Harriet switches ""allegiance"" to Roy. Roy gets involved with her but for some unexplained reason, she shoots Roy in his pitching arm and then jumps out the hotel room window to her death.<br/><br/>Fast forward 16 years to 1939 where Roy show up unexpectedly in the New York Knights, a bottom dwelling baseball team, as a 35 year old rookie. Manager Pop Fisher (Wiford Brimley) is skeptical but coach Red Blow (Richard Farnsworth) sees something in Roy. After being benched for several games, Pop is forced to insert Roy into the lineup when regular fielder Bump Bailey (Michael Madson) tragically dies in an accident. Well, Roy promptly shows his talent for the long ball and becomes famous.<br/><br/>One day at a game Roy spies Iris, dressed in white in the stands and something comes over him. He regains his stroke and fame. On meeting with her the old flame re-kindles.

He is told that he can never play baseball again. As the league championship game approaches, Roy announces that he will suit up one last time and..............................................................................<br/><br/>A great supporting cast elevates this movie to classic status.

"ElMaruecan82","6","0","1","11 October 2019"," Well, Mr. Redford has done it, the New York Knights have won it...
","It all starts with the idyllic postcard-picture of an Iowa or a Nebraska farm, a kid named Roy Hobbs is playing baseball with Daddy, he pitches the ball in the same spot drawn by his father, he's a natural we get it, but that's not enough. I thought what was missing was something from the heart: guts or determination, how wrong I was: it's all about the elements. The lightning struck the mighty oak tree under which his father collapsed to death, splitting it in two (the tree, not the father) then Roy took a piece of wood and carved it out into a baseball bat, calling it ""Wonderboy"" with a lightning bolt Ã  la AC/DC, at that moment, I kept hearing that name being whispered in my head: Home...r... no, not home-run but Homer like Homer Simpson.<br/><br/>The 'Wonderboy' sequence inspired the first act of the legendary ""Homer at the Bat"", the one that started the Golden Age, and the music was used in another episode where Homer fulfilled one of his lifelong dreams by scoring a perfect 300 at the bowling game. Yes, there's something magical about that story and that Randy Newman's triumphant Wagnerian score, something that inspired the highest point of the life of all American hero: Homer. There's a catch though (no pun intended), ""The Simpsons"" is made for laughs. I'm not too sure bout ""The Natural"", Barry Levinson's adaptation of Bernard Malamud's 1952 novel of the same name.<br/><br/>In many aspects, the film is similar to ""Field of Dreams"" and I must applaud its daringness. it embraces a sort of metaphysical vision of base-ball, revisiting America's favorite pastime through an almost mythological hero, a man with a gift for baseball and for troubles in the same time, a man whose aura carries some fantasy chosen-one element and yet for some reason, never seems to get even with Karma. Indeed, when we first see him at 19, striking the Babe-Ruth lookalike Whammer (Joe Don Baker) out on three pitches, it's like nothing can stop him, except maybe a silver bullet, cutting through his stomach and his promising career. I was caught off-guard by that moment and I thought the film had succeeded in its opening part... though it asks us a lot in terms of suspension of disbelief to make a 48-year old Redford pass for a young man, and it doesn't get better after.<br/><br/>For instance, when 16 year after the incident, he's hired to play for the New York Knights, the coach Pop (Wilford Brimley) never gives him a chance to show his talent and keeps him on the bench all the time. Granted he's the boss but when your club is sitting in last place, what can you lose? Roy could have pitched himself (so to speak), told the Whammer story, but no, we have to wait for the right moment so he can knock the cover off the baseball. Yes, it's spectacular, it's rewarding to some degree, but that's the film's problem: it always waits for the convenient moment, and even when it is effective and overwhelming but there's something a bit artificial about the pacing, and maybe worse, the characterization.<br/><br/>Robert Redford is heaven to look at and I'm straight like an ""I"" but Ebert is right in his assumption that the film is more enamored with the figure of Hobbs and his glowing blondish halo than it is with baseball, it's never Hobbs who's instrumental to the beauty of the sport but rather the opposite. And everyone around Hobbs is corrupt and malicious to a degree it gets ridiculous, the manager (Robert Prosky) uses bets against his own team (has anyone learned the lesson from 1919?), a beautiful woman (Kim Basinger) sees the best interests for her in a relationship with Hobbs and so does a manipulative bookie (Darren McGavin), and finally a cynical journalist (Robert Duvall) makes or breaks careers without any scruple as long as it makes good money.<br/><br/>In that microcosm, where the odds and the Gods are against him, Hobbs can only count on a few supporters: Farnsworth as the bench coach with a benevolent smile, Glenn Close as his sweetheart and lady-in-white Iris with a mysterious angel-like aura, enough to earn her an Oscar nomination, and don't get me started on the constantly smiling bat boy who looks like a picture you'd find in a peanut butter jar smile, that kid almost gave me ulcers. So for all its love letter to baseball, the bad guys have absolutely no redeeming qualities, the good guys believe in Hobbs in some saintly way, they're all as two-dimensional as an ad poster, and in that flood of good sentiment, somewhat I wished baseball could find a way and provide something a more intellectually challenging.<br/><br/>I read that the original novel was darker and had a more complex ending but ""The Natural"" seems to follow Hobbs' journey without even caring to explain anything. And many things do happen for no specific reason, there's a character played by Michael Madsen as star outfielder whose exit comes totally out of nowhere so I was wondering whether it was to be taken humorously or not, but of the many points that compromises the film's enjoyment and credibility, the worst is perhaps the ending. Say what you want, the deal was clear between Hobbs' choice to play... and the alternative and the final shot made me wonder if it was intended as a fantasy or reality, in both ways, it was a spectacular concession for fireworks but a bad move that contradicted the film's message. If there ever was."

","The Natural is a classic tale of redemption that follows most sporting movie story-lines. However, this example is one that plays out more like an ancient tale of a conquering hero, with feats that are far-fetched and defy the odds. Roy Hobbs, played by none other than Robert Redford, is an aspiring young baseball player. We get to see young Roy growing up on a mid-western farm developing into one of the best young prospects in America. This is where the film has its awkward editorial phase. Tragically, teenage Roy loses his father to what we presume is a heart attack. During the subsequent scenes, we see lightning hit the tree where Roy's father died, from which Roy then cuts out and fabricates a baseball bat. Then we immediately transition to a young adult Roy (enter Redford) speaking with his girlfriend Iris (Glenn Close) about a baseball tryout. This entire sequence of events is covered in rapid succession in what seems like less than 60 seconds. It is awkward, and honestly pulls the film down a bit from its potential. Were it not for this rushed and awkward opening and development, I would've rated the film much higher.
Moving forward, Hobbs' career is derailed when he is nearly murdered by silver bullet from a mysterious ""black widow"" character played by Barbara Hershey. This sets our hero up for a series of amazing and almost too good to be true feats of baseball lore. The aging Hobbs becomes one of the best in baseball, helping is New York Knights rise from near obscurity to the top of the league. Here, the viewer is immersed in all the sights and sounds that make baseball movies fun; cheering fans and home run after home run. But then we learn after he is hospitalized, that Roy has lingering effects from his gunshot wound, presumably keeping him from playing until now. Our hero returns from his infirmary bed for a pivotal championship game. Struggling to keep himself upright from his injury, Hobbs stands in for one last at-bat, creating one of the most iconic scenes in sports movie history. As with his late baseball career, against all odds, Roy belts a pitch high into the lights and victoriously rounds the bases on his homerun trot. The entire scene is absorbed in explosions and sparks from the lights that absorbed Hobbs heroic blast.
The Natural has all the ups, downs, characters and stories we have come to expect from sporting movies, with great success and failures, trials and tribulations, love interests, old cranky coaches (Wilford Brimley), and even greedy, corrupt owners. Frankly, I feel there may have been a few too many story lines crammed into this particular screenplay. This is probably due in large part to having an all-star cast, and the producers desire to have all of them be integral to the story. Additionally, the editorial approach in the beginning was rough and awkward, almost as if the introductory scenes were initially intended to be segmented flashbacks later in the film. In fact, I personally believe this film would have been better served building Hobbs past through flashbacks. And while the film didn't entirely miss the mark, thanks in large part to the iconic home run scene at the end of the film, it did fall short of being the home run the filmmakers intended to create. And yet, for reasons I can't explain, I still can't help but love this movie!"

his career though not fatally with too many encounters with Ebbets Field's
outfield wall. Hobbs himself as we see him practicing in the Iowa cornfield
is Bob Feller no doubt.<br/><br/>The Natural is impeccably cast besides those mentioned there is Robert Duvall
the sportswriter who both eventually remember where he saw Redford before
and who smells a rat in the pennant race. His character is based on legendary
sportswriter Hugh Fullerton who discovered the Black Sox scandal. Wilford
Brimley is the crusty old manager of the Knights and Richard Farnsworth his
coach.<br/><br/>For a change women in this baseball movie got some roles of substance. Barbara Hershey is brief but memorable as a deranged baseball groupie who
shoots Redford in the abdomen, said incident based on the shooting of Phillies
first baseman Eddie Waitkus. Kim Basinger plays another baseball groupie,
a temptress to lead Redford astray. And Glenn Close got a Supporting Actress
nomination as his faithful girlfriend.<br/><br/>The Natural got other nominations for Best Music Score, Art Direction, and
Cinematography.<br/><br/>Redford looked pretty good on the field, a lot better than Gary Cooper for
instance playing Lou Gehrig. The Natural takes its place among the great
films about baseball."

","1 December 2012. There is a compelling and appealing naturalness in the presentation of baseball in this movie directed by Barry Levinson. Its restrained features and backdrop support the story and the feel of actual baseball especially during the games are pervasive and emote a sense of realness that is likely to exist with those devoted fans who watch real baseball games, particularly those of importance, on television. Though a few scenes seem to mildly confuse rather than move the storyline with clarity, especially as it comes to various characters and initially who they might be, there is always a confident directorial hand in the background to ensure that the drama and the excitement of baseball and their impact on relationships remains. In a way there is a classical element of It's A Wonderful Life (1946) inserted into the plot of this movie.<br/><br/>Two more contemporary movies likely owe some of their power to this movie - For The Love of the Game (1999), The Rookie (2002) with Dennis Quaid and Moneyball (2011) with Brad Pitt. Unlike the more ethereal fantasy of Field of Dreams (1989) or the lighter docu-history comedy of A League of Their Own (1992), The Natural is a human drama as well as a subtle thriller in the likeness of Chinatown (1974). The Natural brings to the big screen a serious, luscious look at baseball, the human element, along with a dramatic story."

","Wow.
What an interesting film. It's both a sports flick and a morality play...and it fits both those categories quite perfectly. It's elevated by the use of ambiguity and metaphor into a story that truly transcends and speaks to the soul. We root for the lost sparks of glory that is ever present and yet beyond the reach of a fallen man. And we question what our first life is really worth - what we can find meaning and glory in. And all this is set in the completely entertaining sports genre.<br/><br/>Honestly some of the best use of slow-motion I've ever seen.

","***Spoiler Alert*** No offense to ""Field of Dreams"" or ""The Sandlot"" but ""The Natural"" is the best baseball movie ever made, in my opinion. Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford) is a baseball phenom as a child and is certain to become a big league star someday. As a young child while playing baseball with his father, his father has a sudden heart attack and dies under a tree in their yard. Several years later, that same tree is struck by lightning and broken into pieces. Hobbs makes a special bat from that tree in his father's honor and names the bat ""Wonderboy"". 
 When Hobbs gets older he has a chance for a tryout to play in the big leagues. While on his way to the tryout, he gets the chance strikeout a famous major league hitter names Whammer. After striking out Whammer with pitches one could barely see. Hibbs then meets a lady by the name of Harriet Bird (Barbara Hershey) who befriends Hobbs but then shoots him before committing suicide. This would take Hobbs out of the game for 15 years before he would reappear and be given a chance with the last place New York Knights. This is when the theme of the movie, redemption, begins to unfold. 
 The manager of the Knights, Pop Fisher (Wilford Brimley), thinks Hobbs is just a middle-aged rookie with no chance of being a contributor to the team. For a while, Pops just lets Hobbs languish on the bench while the Knights continue to lose. One day at batting practice, Pops witnesses Hobbs hit home run after home run into the stands and decides it's time to give Hobbs a chance to play. Hobbs dominates and becomes the most feared hitter in baseball. As his star rises so does the success of the team and by the end of the year, the Knights have a chance at winning the pennant. The past begins to come back to haunt Hobbs as his injury he suffered while being shot 15 years ago flares up and lands him in the hospital just as the Knights are on the verge of winning the pennant. Hobbs wills his way out of the hospital and onto the field as the Knights are struggling and on the verge of missing out on the pennant. Hobbs plays in the last game and strikes out the first few times he comes to the plate. During his last at bat, his prized bat shatters while hitting a foul ball. He takes a bat from the bat boy and proceeds to hit a majestic home run that shatters the light stand on the roof in right field and wins the pennant for the Knights.
 ""The Natural"" uses clever lighting techniques during the final scene where Hobbs hits the home run into the light stand and sparks start flying all over the sky and even onto the players on the field. I also enjoyed the movie's use of sound during the game scenes where you could hear the fans yelling at the players and the sounds of the crack of the bat while hitting the bar. The film has similarities to movies like ""Rocky"" where the main character rises from nothing to become a hero. I love the story of redemption and I will watch this movie any time it appears on TV."

","In the most famous scene from this modern baseball classic, struggling middle aged professional baseball player Robert Redford strikes gold after a spell of strike outs. It's thanks to the presence of a majestic lady in white (Glenn Close) who stands up to guide him to his big hit. Redford, as comeback king Roy Hobbs is a mystery man who all who knows him, and even though they haven't seen each other in years, it is Close who knows him best. <br/><br/>Wouldn't you be a bit of a mystery man if all of a sudden, you were shot for some unknown reason by a mysterious dark haired vixen who claimed that they were fascinated by your talents? Barbara Hershey is briefly seen as this mysterious femme fatale, and after that, it is surprising that he could ever trust a woman again. Along the way he meets another vixen, Kim Basinger, who distracts him into loosing, and the question becomes, ""Why?""<br/><br/>Not just a film for baseball fans, this is a look at every young boy's American dream. Whether it be baseball player, fireman or even president of the United States, it is a look at how good intentions come out of the Innocence of childhood, and how dishonest people can step in the way of one's dreams. <br/><br/>Certainly one of the great modern baseball classics, it is even better then the mystical ""Field of Dreams"" which had little to do with professional baseball other than solving an issue for the film's hero, Kevin Costner. If Costner was the All- American hero of the 1990's, Robert Redford dominated much of the sixties, seventies and eighties with his easygoing personality, way with the ladies and his determination to make films that were artistic as well as entertaining.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent, although I've never been quite convinced that Kim Basinger was one of the great beauties of the last 30 years in films. Glenn Close, on the other hand, had a realistic beauty that shines in the scene where she stands up in the Chicago baseball stadium. Some movie fans ridicule her as being somewhat haggard, but I've never looked at her that way. If you don't find the fact that she is indeed beautiful, watch this film and think again. I would rather have the girl next door that look like Glenn Close rather than a buxom vixen like Basinger who uses sex to sell.<br/><br/>As Redford's mentors on the baseball team, the fictional New York Knights, Wilford Brimley and Richard Farnsworth are particularly outstanding. Brimley is that grouchy old grandfather we all know and love, knowing that underneath that gruffness is a huge heart of gold. Farnsworth is more quiet, and the wisdom that he silently conveyed to the complaining Brimley is something that you can take to heart. Less honorable are the characters played by Robert Duvall and Robert Brodsky, the later cast as an amoral judge who instantly wants to see Redford suppressed as a baseball superstar.<br/><br/>While not an obsessive baseball fan, I can still appreciate the fascination with the sport, having grown up with professional games going to the Pittsburgh Pirates when they were at Three Rivers Stadium. I remember as a child the way I felt being in the presence of the All American Heroes and when I saw the film in its original release, those memories came back to me along with the excited looks of the two youngsters who popped in and out, looking up to Redford as their own hero. This does take a realistic look at the rivalry between players on the same team, some jealous or envious of Redford, referring to him as that old man since they obviously don't have the power he has. I wish I had a baseball bat like wonder boy when I was a kid. Of all the professional sports, baseball remains the most all American, and it is films like this that celebrate that sport's greatest qualities."
"adams79","10","0","1","26 June 2015"," One of the most iconic baseball movies of all time
","Not just a great film about baseball, but a fable about overcoming demons, rising from nothing to greatness and good old fashioned love.<br/><br/>Robert Redford plays Roy Hobbs, a prodigious baseball player who showed incredible promise as a young man, but was shot by a serial killer who hunted star athletes. Although he didn't die, he was badly wounded and missed his opportunity to join Major League baseball. The story revolves around his comeback (16 years later), overcoming his weakness for women, reuniting with the love of his life Iris (Glen Close) and saving his ball club and their head coach Pop Fisher (Wilford Brimley) from being sold. In the end, Hobbs must confront his younger self in a final showdown for glory, but ultimately his own happiness.<br/><br/>This is not a story about real life or ""the real world"". This movie is metaphoric. Although the theme is around baseball, it is actually a story of a cursed knight with a magical sword who saves a Kingdom from a tyrannical ruler.<br/><br/>There have been many reviews about the great performances by all of the cast, but the one thing that I have not heard much about is the INCREDIBLE score for this film. Written by Randy Newman...yes the Toy Story guy. He composed what is in my opinion, possibly the most iconic and memorable fanfare ever written for a movie. Absolutely, beautiful and uplifting. I can't for the life of me understand why he didn't win an Oscar for his work on this film. In the style of Aaron Copland, the perfect sixth that soars above as the baseball smashes the lights in the end scene will make even the hardest of men think about their childhood. Iris' leitmotif is very charming and makes you fall in love with her as much as she and Roy truly love each other.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that this movie is only based on the book. That is to say, the characters start off the same, but they do not arc the same as the book and that ultimately effects the story's outcome. Roy Hobbs' character is much purer in the movie than in the book. If you've read the book and expect to see the same story in the movie, you'll be surprised. Perhaps, unpleasantly surprised. I prefer the movie to the book, but I saw this movie when I was a kid and I am so biased that Roger Ebert himself (who didn't really like the movie) could come back from the dead and draft a 50 page critique of this movie and I still would love it just as much. That's how powerful and impressionable this movie is.<br/><br/>Watch this movie. People have compared it to the Fisher King, (hello? Pop Fisher?) and the Lancelot, King Arthur story (the team name is the New York ""Knights"").. all of that may be true, but I find that the most important theme that stems from this movie is Aristotalian... that is one's pursuit of happiness.<br/><br/>""Pick me out a winner Bobby."" ... What a great film..."
"sesht","Null","0","2","12 October 2014"," Dated melodrama, yet 'Let's play ball'
","The structure of the movie, an amalgam of a little mystery and misdirection at the beginning withing the trappings of a true-to- life sports drama, might throw off some viewers, but worked for me, gradually over the movie's runtime. <br/><br/>In fact, that's perhaps one of the things that did not seem dated, in terms of narrative at least (again, gradually stretching over the movie's substantial runtime). I confess to getting restive with the flashback cuts in the beginning, which, in hindsight, was essential, and perhaps the perfect way to introduce everything. <br/><br/>The choice made about how the filmed ending differed from the book its based on, to me, smacked of being one of those choices a mainstream filmmaker typically makes, a feel-good cop-out. I'm sure the movie would have withstood the passage of time better if they had stuck to the tone of the book, but for those who're unfamiliar with the written work, this should work just fine.<br/><br/>Kim Basinger plays the moll as she knows how, and though her character's trajectory is unsurprising on the whole, casting did matter, and perhaps the overall effect is better for that. <br/><br/>Robert Duvall, almost always great in his everyman-playing career, in this flick, has to have played the most despicable character (not surprising, since it hits close to the scruples held by a true-to- life media-person) in his career ever as Max Mercy (observe his drawings in a key sequence, and his own rationale of his place of power in the baseball-playing world, completely undeterred when another key character wants to tear down what he does - he Never Backs Down, in spite of us hating him, not 1 inch), along with an uncredited Darren McGavin (Mike Hammer from late-50s TV - mroe on him in a bit). <br/><br/>I've never been a fan of Glenn Close, but respect her talent, and in this one, she does what she needs to, although her portion lends itself to some muted melodrama that gains some traction as her portion increases its relevance to the overall plot. <br/><br/>The best part is the one performed by the uncredited Mike Hammer himself, McGavin. A veteran of TV and the silver screen, the entire movie is elevated due to what he brings to the filmed work, and the 1 scene in which he and Redford's character trade-off one-upmanships is a treat to behold (and the other scenes in which they play off one another). One of the more menacing antagonists, always lurking in the shadows, and more powerful in the dark.<br/><br/>Wilford Brimley due his thing, and it's always a nice thing to watch him in play. The raggedy old bear who we slowly grow to like, with his tough exterior also softening over the course of the movie's running-time is perhaps one of the oldest clichÃ©s in the book, but not such a bad thing with a master like Brimley bringing him to life.<br/><br/>Redford doesn't have to stretch much like a few of the other roles he'd tackled in his past, but he puts in his efforts, and they do bear fruit - doesn't get a note wrong. <br/><br/>All in all, in spite of most of the material being dated, and the cop-out of an ending, this one's still a better-than-good watch - we'd do even better to watch it with like-minded aficionados on the big screen, given the opportunity."

","The Natural is one of the better baseball movies that have ever been filmed. It may be sentimental to a fault and a little corny at times, but this is a sports film that one cannot resist, baseball fan or not. Plus the ending leaves an open-ended discussion to be had and one that promotes some thinking. While this is a baseball movie, I also find this to be a character movie. This movie is about the characterization of Roy Hobbs, not about how Roy Hobbs can hit home runs.<br/><br/>Barry Levinson's film is about a man named Roy Hobbs who has a mysterious past and came out of nowhere to help a ragtag, losing baseball team become winners. Along the way he has to encounter evil sportswriters, devilish owners, and tough managers.<br/><br/>This film has a large, well-known cast and all of them were excellent. Some people question the casting choice of Robert Redford and his age, but I think he did a magnificent job despite looking a lot older than the film claims his character to be. Glenn Close does a solid job as one of Hobb's love interests and so does Kim Basinger as another. Robert Duvall does an excellent job as the writer who does anything for a story.<br/><br/>Overall, The Natural is not only an excellent sports film, it's an excellent drama that revolves around it's characters. But of course, it's nice to see these home runs destroy items around the ballpark. This film also has a magical taste to it, which we see every time Hobbs does something special at the plate. Maybe it's the iconic score by Randy Newman, but this film has magic in the air. An incredible baseball film that makes use of all its talents. I rate this film 9/10."

","Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford) is a young ballplayer who on a train trip strikes out The Whammer on 3 pitches. When he gets involved with Harriet Bird (Barbara Hershey), she shoots him sidelining his career. Years later in 1939, Roy Hobbs re-enters the major leagues as an old rookie in the New York Knights. He's been hired by the owner The Judge (Robert Prosky). The Judge and the coach Pop Fisher (Wilford Brimley) have a bet. Pop could get back some of his shares of the team if he could win this year. So he assumes Hobbs is nothing more than The Judge sabotaging his year and refuses to let him play. When he finally relents, Hobbs literally knocks the cover off of the ball with his bat Wonderboy. Max Mercy (Robert Duvall) is a newspaper man who keeps hounding Hobbs for his life story. Memo Paris (Kim Basinger) is Pop's niece and bad luck who is in cahoots with bookie Gus Sands. Iris Gaines (Glenn Close) is his salvation from the past.<br/><br/>I don't really like his introduction. It would probably make more sense to have a young lookalike to do those scenes. At first blush, the passing of years may not be as appreciated by the audience. It may be a good idea to use the younger version as simple flashbacks. Redford just don't look different enough in those two different time frames. That aside, Barry Levinson does know how to shoot a beautiful movie. The movie does have its slower spots, but it fits the mystical feel of the story. This movie runs like a fantasy.<br/><br/>One thing is for sure. There is that iconic home run scene. Sometimes a scene or an image can stand for something bigger. For that alone, I have added one point to my vote."
"Aly200","9","0","1","7 August 2012"," A Sports Classic
","Robert Redford shines in this classic tale of baseball mixed with attempted murder, betrayal, testing of faith and survival. Redford plays Roy Hobbs who aspires to be a Major League player after discovering he has a great pitching talent at a young age. Roy's dreams are ended when a mysterious woman (Barbara Hershey) shoots him in a murder attempt and then she commits suicide. Years later, Roy takes up his dreams again and heads to the Minor League team, the New York Knights who are the worst team in their league. Eventually Roy is faced with a repeat of his past when another mysterious woman (Kim Basinger) enters the picture. I normally don't like sports movies, but 'The Natural' is a huge exception. Robert Redford is one of my favorite actors and he does not disappoint in this film. He has the charm and strength that Roy has, but he plays on Roy's weaknesses so well that he evokes the sympathy that he gets at the opening of the film. If you are into sports, ""The Natural' is just the one for you."

","From director Barry Levinson (Diner, Good Morning, Vietnam, Rain Man), I read about this film after finding it in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it sounded like a good light hearted easy to enjoy film. Basically Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford) had dreams of playing professionally in the baseball league ever since he was a young man, he even managed to beat professional The Whammer (Joe Don Baker) in a hitting bet. After his father died he made his own bat from the tree trunk split off by lightning, he marked it with a lightning bolt and named ""Wonder Boy"", but his dream was put on hold for sixteen years however when he was seduced by alluring but sinister Harriet Bird (Black Swan's Barbara Hershey), and she shot him before throwing herself out the window. Roy has come to the New York Knights, now aged thirty five, hoping to get his place in the team and become a star player, manager Pop Fisher (Wilford Brimley) is at first not happy with a ""middle aged rookie"", but he lets him field. He is next allowed to practise batting, and he shows promising accuracy hitting the balls, and he is given his chance to be hitter after original star Bartholomew 'Bump' Bailey (Michael Madsen) died running after the ball. Quickly Roy becomes an instant star hitting the ball great distances, he is called a ""natural"", but everyone questions where he came from, especially sportswriter Max Mercy (Robert Duvall). Some time goes by and Roy gets to meet The Judge (Mrs. Doubtfire's Robert Prosky), the owner of the Knights, and he offers him a new contract, but Roy refuses as he wants to win for his team. Mercy remembers seeing him in the past, going against The Whammer, and he decides to distract and throw his concentration on the game by setting him up with and falling for Memo Paris (Golden Globe nominated Kim Basinger), and it works. With his game play slumping and recognising his face from the past, childhood sweetheart Iris Gaines (Oscar nominated Glenn Close) goes to see Roy at a game, and seeing her he suddenly gains his enthusiasm again, and becomes a star again. But bad news when his bullet scar and wound comes back to haunt him, pains occur in the area where he was shot, and doctors warns him that if he continues playing baseball there could be damaging consequences. For a while he takes this advice, becoming catcher, until of course the big game comes around, and he sees no way for the Knights to win unless he is hitter again, and even though his wound bleeds, Roy does hit the ball an extraordinary height, smashing the stadium lights, and the Knights win the game. Also starring Richard Farnsworth as Red Blow, Alan Fudge as Ed Hobbs, Paul Sullivan Jr. as Young Roy, Darren McGavin as Gus Sands and Dumb and Dumber's Mike Starr as Boone. Redford gives a marvellous performance as the everyman trying to make a name for himself and doing what he is passionate about, Close does well as the sweetheart who admires him and gives him some encouragement, Basinger is terrific as the woman forced into distracting him for others' gain despite possibly caring for him for real, and the supporting cast members do great as well. It is a very engaging story, I recognised moments that The Simpsons spoofed, especially the lightning and tree bat making moment, one of the most memorable scenes, and even if you don't understand baseball you are still rooting for the Knights and enjoy the games, it is a most watchable sports drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography and Best Music for Randy Newman. Robert Redford was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!"

","This is a comparative rarity, a film that can satisfy the popcorn set at the Multiplexes yet offer more substantial food for thought to the more discerning. There's a fine period - late nineteen thirties - 'feel', a complementary period 'sound' via the background music (Levinson is clearly a Duke Ellington buff as both Sophisticated Lady and In A Sentimental Mood can be heard in the background if you know where to listen), excellent photography and fine ensemble acting. The symbolic references don't need to register and/or get in the way of an entertaining story that ticks so many boxes in both lower and upper case - second chance if you're an average Joe, REDEMPTION, if you're a college graduate; I could go on but you get the picture. Robert Redford is just about ideal casting as Roy Hobbs, with his natural handsomeness played down - unlike, say, The Way We Were, where it was exploited much more - and manages to pull off the idea of a slightly tarnished idealist to a fare-thee-well. Glenn Close discards her natural femme fatale comfort zone and is able to do 'pure' and 'sincerity' to perfection. And so it goes; good and evil, black and white, a movie for all seasons."

","I finally saw this movie on the TV for the first time yesterday (1/4/08). I'd always avoided it for some reason - probably because it was so popular, I thought it had to be a big Hollywood feel-good movie without any depth or texture. Boy, was I wrong! I loved everything about it, especially, as some here have noted, the overall sense of ""real magic"" created by a combination of great directing, stunning cinematography, perfect acting, genius editing, and of course, a story that resembles timeless fairy tales in its themes of love, loss and redemption. What affected me most, though, was the cinematography. I've never before been so mesmerized by the lighting in a film that I felt compelled to research the cinematographer. It wasn't just the light hitting Glenn Close in her white dress in the stands in that pivotal scene, though I found myself gasping ""how did they DO that?"" It was the light throughout the entire film, soft, radiant yet somehow evocative of the past and lost beauties (until the last scene). The use of light weaves into the themes, with the ""darker"" characters often wearing black, or choosing always to sit in the dark. I see that cinematographer Caleb Deschanel has a self-made film titled ""Visions of Light"" that I'd love to see.

Despite playing for a couple years while I was a kid, I never cared much about the sport. I decided to give the film a chance anyway. Robert Redford has the image of a great baseball icon, which suits him perfectly for the role of Hobbs. The team manager, Pop Fisher, makes a perfect coach. His lines about being a farmer are priceless. The opponents of Hobbs, particularly The Judge (the corrupt owner of the team), are a believable bunch that adequately reflect the hurdles of organized baseball. The music is also a strong point of the film; its main score has become forever intertwined with achievement in sports.<br/><br/>The plot was interesting enough to keep my attention. While not particularly exciting or deep on the whole, it certainly has its moments. The last ten minutes are a good wrap-up, and is probably the best part overall.

Perhaps today's professional athletes could stand a lesson in what integrity is all about since so many seem to have it being questioned because of drugs, gambling, steroids, etc.<br/><br/>Not only did Hobbs have integrity, kids of the day looked up to him for what he stood for in being a player that came out of obscurity and into the limelight.

","""The Natural,"" Bernard Malamud's 1952 novel on which this movie is (very loosely) based, presented a considerably more flinty viewpoint of baseball and its protagonist, the late-blooming Roy Hobbs. A movie true to Malamud's conception has yet to be made, and would probably start with a younger and less iconic actor in the starring role (Hobbs as written by Malamud was in his mid-30s, but Robert Redford's gravity suggests someone a decade older). In its own right, this is an enjoyable baseball fantasy with a nostalgic haze (literally so, in the way many scenes are lit). Randy Newman's score is the best thing about it, playing up the mythical Americana element of the movie. Twenty-three years after I first saw it in a theater, ""The Natural"" strikes me as a long-form version of the ""Morning in America"" TV ad campaign that helped propel Ronald Regaan to re-election that same year. No accident that two of the movers and shakers behind this movie were major players in the world of advertising."

The THE NATURAL's story offers a might dose to counter the nihilistic (but all the same fantastic) story as what's found in THE GREAT GATSBY, where the theme seems to be that we have two lifetimes ~ a rise and a fall. THE NATURAL is a story about hope and second chances. Many of us can likely say at sometime in our lives that we sort of got sidetracked or that we've been in-between trains.

","Many people say this movie is too sappy and doesn't follow the book. Yes, it is somewhat over dramatic in parts but you have to keep in mind that most sports movies are (greek) tragedies portrayed against a sports background. The scenes are excellent, you could almost turn off the volume and enjoy the movie. But then you would miss the great relationship between Pop Fisher and Red Blow - what a stroke of genius casting these two together. Just great casting: Basinger is great as upper class white trash, McGavin, as per usual, steals several scenes, you can't help but hate Duvall and Prosky, Baker plays a great Babe Ruth, Madsen plays a great Prima Donna, and Glenn Close is her usual great. Barbera Hershey could possibly be the answer to the Trivia Question: what actress played in the 2 greatest sports movies ever (The Natural & Hoosiers). Almost every scene has a memorable quote. Most would say The Pride of the Yankees is the greatest baseball movie ever but when you compare the two, I'd say that Cooper's acting dominates Redford's portrayal; otherwise every other actor from The Natural dominates their counterpart in the The Pride of the Yankees. The two dance scenes in each movie are a real bonus: I think it's some famous pair (Yolina and Velez) dancing to Profidea and Redford/Basinger dancing to Duke Ellington. Almost every scene in The Natural has a frame or two which, if frozen, would be a fantastic still - my favorite would be Pop Fisher sitting on the darkened bench as Hobbs rounds the bases in his final Home Run, all you see is a rough outline of a stunned Pop with the exploding lights reflected in his glasses. I'll close with my five greatest sports movies of all time (not in order) Hoosiers, The Hustler, The Cincinnati Kid, The Natural, Rocky."

","The Natural is one of my favorite movies of all time. The movie succeeds in capturing the heart of the audience; especially to the ones who grew up playing baseball. The Natural is about a boy named Roy Hobbs. Roy Hobbs is a baseball prodigy, who wants to become a professional someday. What I love most of all about this movie is the strong tie between Roy Hobbs and his father. This movie is essentially about a son who wants to make his father proud. When I saw the scenes with young Roy and his father playing catch, it made me think of my father and myself. This is a movie that I can truly relate to, and I'm sure many other people will feel the same way. When we go though the long walk of life, we encounter many things that we wish we never have encountered. We also face many challenges in our life that determines the person we end up becoming in the future. Roy Hobbs starts out as an innocent kid, who eventually molds into a man who is determined to win without compromising his own personal integrity. This is what makes Roy Hobbs so great. He is a stubborn man, but, at the same time, he wants to do what is right. This is an excellent movie. If some disagree with me, that's fine. They probably don't understand the true meaning to this movie."

The beginning is great and Barbara Hershey is a definite tarantula type. I think Glen Close was nominated for this, but I can't understand why.

"rmax304823","7","0","3","3 October 2002"," Spectacular Catch by Levinson!
","I don't know why I enjoy this movie as much as I do. I haven't cared about baseball much since I was ten years old and this isn't Redford's best performance. <br/><br/>Let me get the weaknesses out of the way first. The story is an ur-sports one. Act One: Prodigy is discovered. Act Two: Tragedy leads to slump. Act Three: Protagonist overcomes demons and wins the game (or bout, or chukkar, or whatever). Subordinate characters are largely quirky stereotypes. <br/><br/>There is an over-obvious mythological overlay that's more pretentious than anything else. During dramatic moments, the score swells to heroic proportions to an extent that we almost expect a cut to Moses's parting of the Red Sea. The slow-motion not only signals a triumph in the making but allows us to relish it for a few seconds longer. <br/><br/>Let's see. I guess that about covers most of the reasons not to like the film. But these flaws are pretty much overcome by its virtues. When the score isn't alter-casting us as worshipers it has a nice slangy period feel to it. <br/><br/>During the periods of defeat the score never becomes maudlin. It retains a kind of tinkly offhand quality but sounds a bit slower in tempo, imbued with a hardly noticeable melancholy. The photography is first rate. It has the same tawny quality that has cropped up in lesser works like ""The Fortune"" or ""W. C. Fields and Me."" Everyone seems burnished by the sun. There is an early scene, shot late in the afternoon, in which tiny, white, feathery pappus drift slowly in the air like motes, and each figure wears a golden nimbus. When Glenn Close needs to be inspirational, she stands upright and is engulfed in a mandriole of gilded flame, a little overdone.And the period detail is evocative without being obtrusive. A slow-motion shot of a dying flashbulb signals the beginning of Redford's career slump. The light-bulb-as-career works well, as it did for Scorcese and for Orson Welles in ""Citizen Kane."" The lighting and photography are warm and welcoming and exceptionally skillful. <br/><br/>The story follows the three-act pattern, except that it doubles it by giving us two tragedies instead of one, so you get twice as much for your money, and Hobbs has double the number of demons to cope with. (First he gets shot -- in a theme I must say I didn't completely understand -- then he falls for Lillith instead of whoever the muse of the game of baseball is.) <br/><br/>The acting? As I say, Redford in the central role is a bit too minimized, or maybe it's the wrong kind of role for him, although he looks the part of the fit athlete perfectly -- sinuously muscled instead of bulging all over with sarcomeres. Of course his real background in baseball must have helped his physical performance. He looks right. I wish he had projected a little more concern about his slump. He's pretty casual about the whole thing. ""Whatever's wrong, it's not the bat,"" he shrugs. <br/><br/>Glenn Close is good, as usual, although surely such companions don't exist. Kim Basinger, later to be my co-star, looks ravishing. Duval, another co-star, turns in his usual superior performance, an arid chuckle, smiling, his mouth open, villainous. The other players are equally good, locked as some are into one-dimensional roles. I particularly enjoy the pizazz that Darren McGavin brings to his part of the antagonistic gambler. It's his best role in years. He's philosophical about losing, charming, full of casual jokes. The restaurant scene in which he pops out his eye is amusing and slightly frightening at the same time. <br/><br/>The judge, despite his greed and underhandedness, is amusing too. He speaks in the pompous Gongoristic prose you'd expect from someone who used to sit on the bench and is accustomed to demonstrating how superior he is to most mortals. ""A canard -- a pure canard."" Brimley and Farnsworth are a pair of aces as they try to deal with the newly arrived middle-aged rookie, or sit together on the bench while each tries to name the song the other is humming. (This was a touch added by Levinson when he noticed the two of them doing it between takes.) <br/><br/>Yes, it has all those weaknesses. But it's the kind of movie that doesn't repay much analysis. Anybody up for deconstructing ""Duck Soup""? It's extremely easy to sit back and be drawn into this story because it is, in so many ways, admirably done."

Glenn Close, Kim Basigner, and Barbara Hershey are among the women whom he meets, Robert Duvall is the sports reporter who isn't sure if Hobbs has anything left to prove, Robert Prosky and an unbilled Darren McGavin show their doubts, and Wilford Brimely and the late Richard Farnsworth are the bench coaches who give Hobbs a chance to play again.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the novel by Bernard Malamud and it's treated like glass in the direction of Barry Levinson, who's made some bad choices in recent time (""Sphere"", ""Toys"", and my least favorite - ""Sleepers"").  Another noteworthy is the musical score by Randy Newman and the Norman Rockwell-like scenry provided by Caleb Deschanel.<br/><br/>I can sum up ""The Natural"" in three words: pure movie magic.

This film never received the credit that it deserved, perhaps due to the fact that it bears little resemblance to Bernard Malamud's The Natural, on which it is loosely based.

","Of course there is the shot that everyone remembers. The lights breaking, fireworks in the air. But that's just one of the great moments in this movie. You would think that after watching so many sports movies, the little tricks would present themselves. Not in the Natural. Every shot, every scene is so well-lit, well accompanied by Randy Newman's score, and so darn well acted by Robert Redford, that everything works. I've been a semi-Redford fan all my life, but I must say that this one is one of his very best. He gives the character a depth that many others couldn't, without him, Roy Hobbs might have been a caricature, a goody-goody. Instead, he gives Roy a youthful force in the beginning of the movie, and after a pivotal moment, we see the age he has accumulated, the weight of his dying dream hanging firm to his shoulder. We see an actual change in him. For the worse. But we still see that grin, that grin not only brings back the youthful Roy we saw in the beginning, but it awakens the young Roy we all have inside. The scene I will remember most is not the ending, that's incredible enough, its a scene in the middle, one that might have gotten lost but Levinson the director, not one to ignore the small scenes that make up a story, films it in a way that keeps you in the right frame of mind. The scene is when the manager lets Roy play. It takes place in the tunnel to the clubhouse, and Levinson doesn't light it at all, its taken in a darkness, the only light at the end of the tunnel. but at the right moment we cut to a close shot of Roy reacting to the news he can play. This shot is filmed with bright light on his face, a sharp change from the shot before. This light makes Roy's face shine, and I don't believe anyone can dispute that they didn't get a little thrill out of that scene. All in all a masterful performance by all involved (including Robert Duvall in a nice neat role, and Glenn Close, the woman in white, Kim Basinger is also good). I highly recomend."

The whole movie has such a Biblical tone - man's original sin (through woman?), the casting out from the Garden of Eden, the years of seeking salvation, the years in the wilderness, the limitation on man's perfection due to original sin. <br/><br/>The 1930s/40s atmosphere is perfection.

","There is a long-winded gentleman that posted from London, Ontario that obviously doesn't like baseball or good movies.<br/><br/>He points out supposed holes in the plot that, although irrelevant, are not there if he were to watch the movie.  The ""sinister"" owner of the team does not like light because he was scared of the dark as a child, and trained himself to like the dark.  The reviewer points this out as if it is a gaping hole, ruining the whole movie.<br/><br/>""Uninspired"" is a large word, and the reviewer uses (or alludes to) it quite frequently.  A true baseball fan couldn't help but be inspired by this movie.  What person doesn't or hasn't dreamed about a bottom of the ninth, game winning home run?  This movie one-ups that fantasy by putting not one, but two plots behind it.  Pop gets his team back and the Judge gets screwed, and Roy gets to go out in style with his lifelong love and his son.<br/><br/>The reviewer is correct about the score, however smart seems to be an understatement.  Excellent could be attributed to the music, not to mention the setting, script, timeline and plot.<br/><br/>Reviews should be left open for open-minded individuals, not cynical blow-hards who just like writing about what is bad.  This movie is not be the best movie ever, but I challenge someone to come up with a better baseball movie."

","How strange and refreshing to see a movie so lacking in cynicism.  The people who populate the world of The Natural, from the stars to the fans in the stands, projected a quality not seen in today's world.  Could you say they were natural?  That comes close.  There's an unhurried, genuine affection for the game of baseball and for its star, Roy Hobbs.  This is not a film about things as they are.  There's minimal profanity, sex, and violence, with heavy doses of sentiment.  Hobbs is a hero many of us dream about being. The makers of this film had the nerve to project that dream without apology.<br/><br/>This movie is intended to make you feel good, and I think it largely succeeds."
"CAM-32","Null","0","1","21 January 2001"," At times stunning, but it could use some editing
","This is a movie with a great story: an unknown aged ballplayer appears who has magical talent.  This concept leads to a couple of wonderful scenes. Most of all, the scene featuring Roy Hobbs first at bat as a Knight is spectacular.  I would be willing to say that every shot of this scene is perfect.  The growing storm that accompanies him, the foreshadowing, the music, the magic... it is the stuff of legend, again, fabulously done. Unfortunately this movie is too long and boring.  I very much enjoy a slow developing story, if every scene in this movie featured an amazing home run by Roy Hobbs, the power would be lost, thus its necessary to keep things slow.  However it is not necessary to tie in ridiculous side-stories, such as an evil owner trying to take an idiot manager's shares of the ball-club. Yeah!! Roy Hobbs fights corruption to save the dunce manager!!! How idiotic, how about just plain Roy Hobbs plays baseball because he loves baseball; that's what the movie's trying to say, why try to add more suspense? Cutting this kind of uselessness would really help this movie on a couple levels.  I'm very tolerant of slow movies and I love baseball, but this movie is boring.  Robert Redford is ok, some may disagree, but I think he comes off as too much of a prick in this movie, especially since it seems clear that from the script Roy Hobbs is a very good guy, yet somewhat mysterious.  I think Redford turns mysterious into prick.  The manager is annoying, Kim Bassinger is not that great, Glenn Close is good but not at all attractive, Michael Madsen was great and Robert Duvall is very good as well. ***"
"FeinMess","Null","0","1","17 November 2000"," One of my all-time favorites
","Just watched The Natural for the first time in a long time and forgot just how good it really is. Barry Levinson is a master with ""faces"". Just like ""Good Morning Vietnam"" he's able to convey with an actors face something that cannot be conveyed with words. It's a shame that he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for Best Director. And once again Wilfred Brimley delivers - he was definitely overlooked for a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Glenn Close was good as usual but I don't think she had a big enough role to have been a given a Best Supporting Actress nod. Regardless, this is an excellent movie, so well done and masterfully crafted."
"mctoomey","10","0","1","3 July 2000"," ""Well, you're the best I've ever had...and you're the greatest hitter I ever saw!!""
","How this movie was snubbed by the Academy, I'll never know. Combine a great story (adapted beautifully from the Bernard Malamud novel) with a stellar cast, a powerful score, and brilliant direction (Barry Levinson's best, I think) and you should walk away with an armful of Oscars, right? Not!!! What were these people thinking? Just another baseball movie? First, the cinematography in this movie is awe inspiring and has the type of ""texture"" to it that illustrates and exemplifies the true beauty of film. Further, it has some of the most perfectly framed shots I have ever seen. This is also a period piece, circa 1920's, and the sets and costuming are, for lack of words, perfect. This is one for the time capsule, folks! Don't miss it (even if you've already seen it)!!!"
"bligh_81611","Null","0","1","13 May 2000"," One of my all-time favorites
","The adaptation of Bernard Malamud's piece comes across in grand fashion as Robert Redford shines as Roy Hobbs.  Inasmuch as the film is plagued by an undercurrent of dishonesty and deceit, (on the part of the team ownership) it reminds us all of what our national pastime used to be, in its best and purest form.  Long before the days of strikes, salary caps and negotiations and belligerent acts of defiance, there was indeed a certain innocence and purity in the game.<br/><br/>The Natural, indeed, seeks to parallel the glory days of the sport, masked behind a fictional account.  Roy Hobbs emerging to save the New York Knights from certain failure lets us see that heroes still exist.  The story was above all a character study which sought to bring to life the trials and tribulations of an aging ballplayer with a unique gift.  The Natural was brilliantly acted by a formidable cast (even by today's standards) and expertly directed by Barry Levinson.  It will endure the test of time as perhaps the best baseball movie ever made."
"BudB83","Null","0","1","11 May 2000"," The Greatest Movie I've Ever Seen
","An absolute excellent movie.  ""The Natural"" has Robert Redford at his best. And speaking of best...the cast credits for this movie are outstanding. Glen Close, Kim Bassinger, Robert Duval, Wilford Brimley, Darin McGavin,..etc.  The best baseball movie I've ever seen and my all-time favorite movie.  Also, beautiful cinematography and a stellar score by Randy Newman.  A definite must see!"
"Sandcastling Guy","10","0","1","1 March 2000"," DVD Release just around the corner?
","This movie has always had the ability to transport me into the ""magic"" of baseball. Why, there have been times that I've gazed upon a ballfield, with a setting sun behind it, and suddenly I'm there... back in a scene right from the movie. Watching that slow-motion pitch, seeing the light reflecting off the faces, feeling the tension as you wait for the bat to hit the ball, listening to the music swell in anticipation...<br/><br/>There's so many things to enjoy in this movie. One of my favorites is the connection between Roy Hobbs' character and the younger generation. Hobbs isn't afraid of ""getting down to their level"" to sign a ball or give an encouraging word. The climatic scene where Hobb's interacts with the bat boy is wonderfully done. In that moment, few words are spoken, but so much is said. This is the kind of movie that you don't want to rush. It's to be savored. Take in all the sensations, angles, lighting, sound - it's all there to enjoy.<br/><br/>Of all the movies I'd love to have on DVD, ""The Natural"" is right up there on top. The photography, the music, the actors, the slow-motion scenes - they all deserve a first rate DVD treatment. I've heard rumors that this title will be out on DVD in the Spring of 2000, so keep your eyes peeled."
"iam-1","8","0","1","31 January 2000"," Un-like most sports movies, this romantic film works!
","On average, sports movies either leave me cold, make me laugh at the jingoistic stuff they put in, or on rare occasions actually work and move me.  This is one of the latter movies. While using the standard recipie of 'slow down the action and make things look like ballet', the film actually transends the stereotypical Baseball Is Life thing. The story is a bit hokey, and steals from the old Aurthurian legends too often, but it does so in such a sweet way that you have to love it. What does not work is the lack of resolution in several story lines, which I won't go into, but suffice it to say that you'd like to see more tidiness in the details in a picture this beautifull.  Also, Redford appears as a supposedly 17 - 20 year old version of himself early on and you have to remind yourself that he's supposed to be some young phenom, not a 40 year old trying to look younger.  Sorry, Bob. Generally a fine movie for a Sunday night when spring training hasn't started getting everyone bogged down with the hype that has ruined a game that is best played by fathers and their sons in the neighborhood ballpark/ vacant lot."

","I was very disappointed that this movie never really got the accolades it should have.  Redford gave a performance that is rarely seen in any movie. The triumphant scene in the end was so rousing and full of emotion that it still brings a tear of joy to my eyes.  The cast was well thought out, and full of talented actors and actresses."
"bmcclain","Null","0","1","28 September 1999"," 180 degrees from the novel -- but worth the deviation!
","A terrific job by the ensemble cast led by Barry Levinson's understated, gentle hand in directing. Beautiful, lush camera work by Caleb Deschanel, who knows how to use shadows better than any other cinematographer ever used light.  Randy Newman's spectacular score.  Hey, I didn't even mind that you could barely tell it came out of a Malamud story -- it's still a great film. Excellent choice for a weekend rental, even if you're not much into baseball."
"Janelle-3","Null","0","1","14 July 1999"," Not bad but a little hokey...
","When this movie first came out, my son was a little leaguer.  Needless to say, the entire family thought this was a great movie because of the ""dream come true"" aspect.  My son thought the home run balls hitting the light standards and the ensuing fireworks/lightening to be the greatest and I'll have to admit, on first viewing it indeed was a spine-chilling moment for anyone who plays baseball or enjoys it.  However, after seeing it off and on over the years, I probably enjoy the non-baseball parts better than the hokey baseball parts which is what they seem now.  Maybe we all get a little more jaded with age?  Nice performances by Redford and Wilford Brimley who has the best line in the movie about how he should have stayed on the farm. I also enjoyed Bobby the batboy and his look of pure joy after the last home run.  Great moment.  Great musical score."
"DNVigerJ","Null","0","1","16 September 1998"," Greatest flick of all!
","Redford's best movie..It is every sports enthusiasts dream, of showing up an unknown, parking them over the fence and being the natural, and immediately making a major impact on the major leagues and winning the game in the end. It is a dream come true,and then the final fade out, with father and son together...it was great!"
