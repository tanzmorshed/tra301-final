"madmaxmedia","8","388","474","24 April 2006"," My Ultimate Guilty Pleasure- how do you assign a rating to that?
","This movie is my ultimate guilty pleasure. It's inane, manipulative, has hyperactive cutting, a ton of glaring inaccuracies (pointless to even discuss or debate), and probably 29 other glaring faults. And why in every dramatic slow-mo emo shot are there 3 helicopters flying in unison overhead? What's the point of having 3 helicopters flying really close together? Who cares! It looks cool. If one day I am having a heartfelt talk with my daughter, I hope there are 3 helicopters flying overhead to really 'bring it home' (and Aerosmith performing in the background.)<br/><br/>Despite it all, I still love watching this movie. Anytime it is on TV I can watch it 'til the end. Bruce Willis does a great job doing his Bruce Willis 'thing' (smart alecky tough guy), and the supporting cast is really great. Steve Buschemi in particular gets the best lines. An awesome assortment of ragtag castoffs (spitting funny one-liners) must save the world- who would have thunk it?<br/><br/>I think Armageddon was actually conceived by suits in a studio office (no really, I read that in a magazine), which is I guess another strike against it. Yet only a bunch of suits could come up with a 'high concept' like this (so high it's basically a parody by itself.) And only a director like Michael Bay could make it. He's far more suited to these types of movies, rather than big historical epics like PEARL HARBOR (which I really, really disliked.)<br/><br/>I read somewhere once that this movie is as close as Hollywood gets to pure cinema, in that it is basically completely divorced from reality of any kind. Is that good or bad? I don't know. I do think if you're going to ditch convention and any semblance to reality, you may as well go all the way. It's better than having something that is a confused mess that tries to be different things (Pearl Harbor.) There will be no 'it could really happen!' here.<br/><br/>So after all this, believe it or not I am going to give this movie a big fat whopping 8. Why? Because IMO it unabashedly succeeds at what it tries to set out to be, whatever that is. That makes no sense, since I am basically saying by all logical accounts this movie may actually suck, yet I am giving it a 8. But hey I loved this movie."

","This film is unashamedly corny. Unrealistic with a cheesy end but it's entertaining. And when the people giving this 2's, 3's & 4's should politely remove their heads from their asses if their problem was lack of realism. It's pure cheesy entertainment so just enjoy it and don't over think it."

","Sometimes IMDB group rating is wrong. And that is OK. I have learned my life that being wrong teachs me lessons in life.<br/><br/>However, in this film, my girl whispered to me that it was perfect, and I have to admit I agree. I have also spoken to many many friends and family members about this film and they all call it a ten.<br/><br/>So there you have it. Sorry the critics couldn't do their job well enough for us on this title. Even they make mistakes, from time to time. Its OK to be wrong.<br/><br/>Be sure to enjoy this with a glass of wine, or tea if that is your choice because it is so intense I nearly recieved a heart attack twice."

","After discovering that an asteroid the size of Texas is going to impact Earth in less than a month, NASA recruits a misfit team of deep core drillers to save the planet.<br/><br/>The real mystery surrounding this film is how it got released by the Criterion Collection. Both this film and Michael Bay's ""The Rock"" received the Criterion treatment at one time. And while both are very enjoyable films, do they really belong with Criterion? I feel that by merely being released by them, there is an added importance stamped on the film.<br/><br/>But as far as guilty pleasures go, this is a fun and entertaining film. I could do without the romance angle, but the idea of blowing up an asteroid before it hits earth (which assumes a lot of questionable science) is just classic science fiction, here given more legitimacy and budget than ever before."

","Steam, wind, sound and gravity on an asteroid flying through space? Yeah the director didn't really think this whole 'space thing' through (or I think he simply didn't care... he was just like: ""Meh, let's just make it fun""). And the movie is pretty fun, if you ignore the obvious inconsistencies and plot holes. Just take it like this: It's a movie of Bruce Willis and his team of misfits attempting to save the world by going to outer-space and blowing up a giant asteroid that's hurtling towards earth. PS. Liv Tyler at 21 y/o was unbelievably beautiful... she's distractingly gorgeous in the movie."
"XJoey","8","230","328","15 May 2003"," Fun, Action-packed movie.
","This movie seems to be a movie that many people love to hate.  I don't see why it has such a bad reputation.  It is meant to be an Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie, and it definitely lives up to this.  It is what it is. Many people have tried to compare it to Apollo 13, but that's like comparing apples and oranges.  They are entirely different fruit. Apollo 13 is based on a true historical event (Docu-drama), while Armageddon is an Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie.  It has plenty of action and adventure, a lot of humor, and a bit of romance.  Is the story realistic? Not hardly, but name ANY Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie that is.  That's why they call it Science FICTION... For those who criticize this movie, nothing will change their minds. However, if you HAVEN'T seen Armageddon, take a chance, watch with an open mind and try not to let all these negative reviews spoil your enjoyment of a really fun movie.  Remember, a movie is meant to ENTERTAIN, and Armageddon does just that, if you let it!"

","What did everyone expect when this film was released, i expected exactly what i got, stunning visual effects, good surround sound and plenty of action (and yes i expected the traditional dose of sentiment too)<br/><br/>This movie is pure escapism fun, which has its place in my collection, movies like Independence Day and Armageddon are great fun to watch and as a bonus the characters weren't bad the script was reasonable and action was indeed plentiful. There were a great deal of laughs too (mostly intentional) anyone who hasn't seen this but just wants relax and enjoy a good (yet Shallow) action flick then this certainly fits the bill.<br/><br/>For pure entertainment value i score it 8/10<br/><br/>If this is for you then check out The Core and Independence Day, avoid the Day after Tomorrow and Deep Impact, there not really for action fans."

","...that's exactly what this is: an ACTION movie.  It's not supposed to sweep the Oscars, the acting isn't supposed to be perfect, and it's not supposed to make perfect sense.<br/><br/>The story follows a group of oil drillers sent by NASA to stop an asteroid that will strike the world in eighteen days.  The drillers are taught and trained to become astronauts (in a very comedic scene) and then sent to the asteroid to drop the nukes and blow it up.  After that, a whole lot goes wrong.<br/><br/>I loved this movie, and I hate how everyone's been calling it 'mindless action'.  It's not mindless, it's actually very dramatic.  The acting is great from pretty much all accounts, even Ben Affleck does a good job.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis captures the 'reluctant hero' role, and Liv Tyler does well as his daughter.  Steve Buscemi delivers a great comedic performance as the genius who goes insane once they land on the asteroid.<br/><br/>Great, funny, intense, dramatic movie.  8/10."

","I'll be the first to tell you, special FX are not what I look for when I am hitting the movies, I love intelligence and acting, story, story, story, good directing at least. But from the opening scenes, 'ARMAGEDDON' explodes into emergency action. This sci-fi comedy-drama was a solid hit!! I have to fully disagree with critics who will praise a horrible movie and then say that a story like this is not bigger than life. This is a blockbuster entertainment giant, with a striking sense of humor, which 'Rockhound' (Bucsemi) provided many laughs, along with the rest of the multi-talented and troubled 'troup' of civilized maniacs. I truly think that the plot of the story is fun to think about, the world needs to be saved by a bunch of motley-ruff necks that can hardly obey the regular laws in their own city and now, they are going to work with the laws of gravity, science and all else to keep the planet from becoming a memory. Every movie mogul wants a block buster that is going to in essence save the world from total oblation and hit the box office with a vengeance. This one does it with he-man style and a wise-crack or two. They all ride together though, Harry Stamper, Grace the young in love daughter of Harry, Charles Chapple er, I mean 'Chick', A.J. also in love with Grace much to Harry's uneasiness, 'Rockhound' who just wants to have girls' who 'just want to have fun' the man who is a sky-scraper if anything else, Jayotis 'Bear' who is strong and a bit on the sensitive side, just to give us equilibrium, when they landed on the surface of the huge rock and he looks up and emotional and exclaims Thank you Jesus! The theater roared! He was right though. Then there is 'Oscar' who is a fun having not so fearless worker, and the comically sarcastic, but easy going Max, all under N.A.S.A Administrator Dan Truman who can't fly anymore. But he gets to watch these birds-of-a-feather, working together. With everyone up and going plus Lev Andropov the Russian Cosmonaut who works hard and gets a little too rowdy! They are able even with the adversity of Col. William Sharp they come together and pull it off and even with the last few moments when Harry Gives his life for A.J. in a very touching moment the story comes together and sets it right, the screw balls have a mature moment and a sobering lesson. But this crew is great!! They all mix together like a great drink. Bruce has the Juice, along with the rest of the motley crew, making this adventure a blast, even by today's standards it still comes across with strength, style, and comedic punch! <br/><br/>Recommended for action/adventure sci-fi junkies as well as regular Joe's' like me.

","This could have been super but, as with the case of most modern action films, the action is way overdone. Still, it had its moments.....<br/><br/>THE BAD -One word describes a lot of scenes in here: chaos. Things are blown up all over the place, people are shouting everywhere. It gets to be too much, especially in the last hour which gets ludicrous. You practically have a headache when you're finished watching the 150 minutes of mayhem.<br/><br/>Half of the disasters that happen to the astronauts were not needed, and many of them come one after the other. It wound up muddling the story. Do today's filmmakers think you have to have something dramatic and loud every two minutes to keep their audiences? And talk about loud.....holy eardrums, Bataman, you could be deaf listening to this movie which includes a lot of loud heavy-metal ""music."" It's too noisy.<br/><br/>There are touches of ""Independence Day"" mentality with very unrealistic with a veteran astronaut smuggling a gun on board a ship; the daughter of the one of the astronauts barging into the command center and shoving the center's leader in the middle of a crisis (in reality, she wouldn't be allowed in the room to begin with); and the usual last-second impossible heroics. I mean, sometimes I swear I was watching a movie made specifically for morons. Speaking of stupid, what was that goofy cosmonaut character (Peter Stormare) all about. That's just another example of what I was just talking about - totally unrealistic people. Why does Hollywood like to portray astronauts - some of the classiest, most educated and reserved people in the world - in such a negative light? Just another of its sicknesses, I guess where good is bad and bad is good.<br/><br/>THE GOOD - What was great to watch in this film were the special-effects, especially the disaster scenes with the meteors hitting the earth. They were spectacular. A few of the panoramic scenes in here were beautiful, too. (This is a must for widescreen DVD.)<br/><br/>There is a good mix of humor in this adventure thriller. That humor makes some of the characters likable, even though they are still unrealistically sleazy heroes. Steve Buscemi had most of the good comedic lines. I liked Billy Bob Thornton as the NASA boss. He's very interesting to watch. Bruce Willis plays his normal macho-hero role. His heroic effort in the end is nicely sentimental. The special-effects, as mentioned earlier, were perhaps the best right in the first 5-10 minutes of the film - a real attention-grabber right off the bat. Actually, the first half of this film is far better than the second half."

","*minor spoilers* This film follows the basic asteroid going to hit earth plot. They find out about the asteroid, some brave souls are sent to destroy it, they get into problems, and one has to die to save the planet. With one major twist. Does NASA send a group of highly trained astronauts to save the earth from destruction? No. instead they call on Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and his gang of oil drilling misfits. This happy gang are rounded up from a strip club, casino and various other hideouts, to save the world.<br/><br/>This makes from a many laughs and eventually a ""happy ending"". If you want a serious film about saving the planet, don't watch this. Its way to far fetched, and has far too many funny moments to be taken seriously. This is great entertainment. For example when the mad Russian astronaut hits the space shuttles engine with a spanner to get it started! Hilarious. Steve Buscemi's character provides some of the films funniest moments. The acting's OK and the special effects are great.<br/><br/>If you want a far fetched, over the top, voyage into space with the strangest bunch of astronauts around, watch this film. Don't take it seriously, don't expect it to be realistic, just sit back and watch it."

","First and foremost, it was great to see Bruce Willis doing something that didn't involve him rolling on the floor, machine guns blazing.<br/><br/>I have to agree and disagree with some of the comments posted about this movie.

","This is definitely the type of movie you'll either love or hate.<br/><br/>
I personally love it, I am a Die Hard (lol) Bruce Willis fan.  All characters were supurbly cast.  Busemi as Rock, Affleck as AJ, Tyler as Grace, Thornton as Truman, ect....  All of them seemed to work well together. Their character just fit them. Lots of people didn't like this movie for they believed that it is too far fetched, which isn't true.  One of NASA's theories IS to land on, and drill into a ""global killer"".  And as it is also said in the movie we don't have the budget to look for these things. Amatures are the people that usually find them.  Another thing people over look is the fact that Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer worked with NASA on the factual aspects of the movie. They didn't just make these things up.(all of this is said in the commentaries on the criterion collection) The other thing about this movie is, you have to like science, space and the things that go with it (like me ""aero_nut""). And you have to appreciate the fact, and not be obtuse that this could happen one day, God destroyed the Earth before he could do it again. I really believe that the love story helped this movie make money, (thats what made Titanic #1), Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck made a great couple. The chemistry between them was awesome.  Not to mention this is americans at their best,(with the help of a russian friend, who is perfectly cast as stormare). The love song to this movie is definitely a topper, Dianne Warren has graced so many movies with her songs and this has to be the best so far. Furthermore very few rock bands can sound good with a orchestra, (G-N-R is one) and Aerosmith certainly fit the bill here.  i love this cast  the movie and the soundtrack, but thats just me."
"fermat1313","Null","58","102","28 November 2000"," Pure stupidity (spoilers)
","This movie is one of the silliest, dumbest movies I have ever seen.  When I saw this film, it was apparent that no thought, no research, no intelligence went into the writing at all.<br/><br/>Let's start with the basic premise of the film.  An asteroid is discovered and we have 17 days until it hits.  What do we do?  In the real world, we bend over and kiss our butt goodbye.  There is absolutely *no* way a mission such as this could be planned, trained-for and executed in this time.  17 days wouldn't be enough time to prepare a standard shuttle launch, much less one with this type of mission.  This movie blindly ignores this fact.<br/><br/>I am always distressed when films treat people as mere cattle, props to use while pounding a point home and then forget.  In the open of the movie, New York is hit with a barrage of fragments, presumably causing untold death and injury.  In the real world, people might even see fit to comment upon this with the people they meet.  In Armageddon, this scene is presented as eye-candy (it *does* look pretty good) and then is promptly forgotten by everyone involved.  No one talks about it.  No one cares.<br/><br/>There is so much that is wrong with Armageddon.  The science involved in splitting an Asteroid the ""size of Texas"" with a nuclear bomb implanted only 800 feet into surface (trust me, when you have driven 800 feet into Texas, you haven't driven very far.)  The idea that that bomb could divert the two large fragments enough to cause them to miss the Earth in the time they had left.  The amazing ""gravity"" on the asteroid.<br/><br/>The thing is, I can enjoy a good fantasy movie.  Films do not always have to work by the rules of the reality I live in.  I can accept ""The Force"" and other such fanciful ideas, as long as the movie is true to its own reality. But Armageddon chose to place itself in *our* reality, and should have attempted to follow the rules that apply here.<br/><br/>Put simply, this movie is pure trash.  It was by far the worst movie I saw in 1998, a year rife with embarrassing tripe.  Save your time, save your money, save your brain.  Don't see it."

Is it the cars being thrown around in the first 5 minutes, is the horrible 'Russian' accent of the 'cosmonaut', is it the uninspired characters, the poorly integrated Top 40 hits, or the ""US will save the world"" vitriol? No. It's the fact that regardless of the ""sad"" ending - there is very little suspense in this movie - we basically know what's going to happen.<br/><br/>The one good part of this movie: ""American components, Russian components: all made in Taiwan!"""

","I saw this film last night.<br/><br/>And I'm worried I'm turning into one of those left-wing liberals they rightly make fun of in South Park. Because I found it hugely offensive. Am I being ridiculously sensitive? Firstly, there's the old staple that is America being the only country in the world that is physically capable of anything, ever.<br/><br/>Secondly, and chillingly, there is the early meteor strike hitting some (unnamed  why do they need a name?) Asian country. The reaction to this is to look at it as a warning. As in ""my god, imagine the tragedy that *could* happen"". Because, you know, it happened to Asians. It might happen to white Americans, and *that* would be tragic.<br/><br/>Then, later on, a bigger meteor hits Paris. Our cast on the ground are irritated, because this might mean our boys have less time than they thought. Not much upset in America. No mention that a lot of people have died.<br/><br/>Then there's Michael Clarke Duncan. A wonderful actor, wasted. Never has a black man been so token. Among a team of hardcore drillers, his job seems to consist of standing in the back, occasionally saying ""Hey, you da man."" Really. Why did they even bring him? It's not like he's petite - he weighed down that shuttle for nothing! Not once does he lift a tool, steer a space ship or even help fix anything that blows up.<br/><br/>Even if you ignore the Russian Cosmonaut (Peter Stormare, another great actor wasted in a pointless role), who seems drunk most of the time and hits things with spanners instead of fixing them because ""Dat's how we do dese dings in Russia"", it's pretty horrific.<br/><br/>All cemented of course by the site of blond, blue-eyed American children all celebrating in corn fields at being saved and everything being all right. Because all the death and destruction to the rest of the world is irrelevant.<br/><br/>You expect the bad script, the dodgy acting, the implausible plot (fat, middle aged men being trained in 12 days to be astronauts? Including one who appears to be retarded?). But I couldn't believe the racism and xenophobia implied in the film, and the callous disregard for the lives of anyone not corn-fed American.<br/><br/>It's a chilling indictment of the attitude of a section of Western Society to the world.<br/><br/>And it's a crappy film too."

","I like action movies.  I have a softspot for ""B"" flicks with bad dialogue and wooden acting.  So, I've been wracking my brain to come up with one of my guilty pleasures that was worse than this blockbuster.  I can't.  You'd be hard pressed to put together a bigger piece of cr*p than this Bruce Willis vehicle.<br/><br/>Armageddon is the story (and I use that term loosely) of a team of ""Super-Drillers"" flying off to destroy an asteroid before it destroys the Earth.  Realistic?  Not really.  But who cares?  It's an action flick.  I'm not blasting the premise.<br/><br/>Minor spoilers:<br/><br/>The movie begins with a couple of scenes designed to introduce the threat and the characters.  Bruce Willis is the tough-as-nails leader of the team, and spends his first bit of screen time chasing around Ben Affleck with a gun for the unforgiveable act of sleeping with his daughter.  For some reason, that didn't make me laugh.  It was forced, like everything in this movie.<br/><br/>The team is called in because they're the only people in the whole wide world who can drill the asteroid.  Okay, I'm prepared to accept that premise if it gets us to the action - the supposed meat of the movie.  More attempts at humor, with each character going out to do some crazy, nutty thing before blast off.  Again, lame.  Finally, they take off.  Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  They arrive on the rock, and set to work.  Would you believe it, nothing works right and everything has a suspenseful countdown!!!  Whoah!  Ten, nine, eight... one - Oh, surprise surprise we saved the day again!!<br/><br/>And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  I can only assume they were trying to cover up the gargantuan holes left by the insipid performances by cutting away to a different shot every few seconds (and this from someone raised on MTV - Mr short attention span himself).<br/><br/>Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse... wait - there's a manufactured tearjerker ending that was so tacked on it made the rest of the film a virtual Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.  The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.  The acting was bad.  Really bad.  Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  Camerawork - again, bad.  (I didn't even mention the dumbest love scene in the history of motion pictures - think animal crackers).<br/><br/>Rating: 1 out of 10.  (I'm giving a half point for Steve Buscemi, who makes me smile against my will and another half point for the times I was able to look at the lovely Liv Tyler and attempt to ignore her acting performance) This is far and away the worst movie I've gone to see in the theater... ever."
"preppy-3","7","20","32","22 July 2009"," I agree that this film is stupid but I was entertained
","After some silly opening narration by Charlton Heston the story starts. According to this an asteroid the size of Texas is going to hit the Earth in 13 days. If it hits it will destroy the entire planet. (I know I know--just go with it) So NASA (led by a slumming Bily Bob Thornton) hires a group of oil drillers (led by Bruce Willis), trains them how to work in outer space, sets them off to drill a hole in the asteroid, set explosives and get the hell out of there...all in 11 days. Also, before the asteroid hits, meteors are coming down and virtually wiping out major cities like New York and Shanghai.<br/><br/>As you can see logic disappears pretty quick in this one. Director Michael Bay has said he makes movies for teenage boys. That's no surprise. There's LOTS of explosions here, lots of masculine men fighting each other and a plot dumbed down so anyone can understand it. There's also a hysterically funny ""love"" story between Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler (their goodbye scene using Animal Crackers has become a classic of bad cinema). Despite all this the movie WAS a huge hit. I saw it in a theatre back in 1998. It was a ridiculously stupid movie but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't entertained. It pounds you into submission with some incredible widescreen imagery, LOUD stereo sound and some truly unbelievable special effects. After a while you ignore the stupid story and just sort of go with it. As for characterizations--well who needs that? All of the actors are playing walking, talking clichés. There's not one person that acts like a normal human being. Liv Tyler tries but the script is stacked against her. Also I LOVE how she's allowed to casually stroll around the top secret NASA facility while her father and boyfriend are on the mission! The acting is as good as it can be. Willis delivers his regular one note performance; Thornton doesn't take this seriously for a moment; Tyler tries; Affleck looks lost and Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, Will Patton and Michael Clarke Duncan basically hit their marks and say their lines. So this movie is big, loud, stupid and far too long but it WAS entertaining. Just turn off your mind, sit back and watch things blow up. I give it a 7."

How many undramatic countdowns did they think they could fit in this thing?  Does a scene where people have to defuse a bomb by cutting one or another wire even count as fiction anymore?

All the work is done; we just have to wait a couple more seconds for Harry Stamper, the jerk, to toss off a few cotton candy lines.  I know Bruce Willis is a generally charismatic guy, but his Harry Stamper character is an obnoxious bore.  I thought he earned the Golden Razzy he was awarded for this role.<br/><br/>Since the movie is so long, the plot so obvious, and the dialogue so disposable, one can't help but notice the lame inaccuracies, inconsistencies and plot holes.  800 feet into something the size of TX is less than a pinprick.  Try walking 800 feet into TX and see how close to the center you are.  After all the discussion about the artificial gravity on the Russian station, it appears to be arbitrary once inside.  Actually, gravity comes and goes throughout the movie.  Does it make any sense that anyone besides Michael Bay would give these morons a couple shuttles and send them to blow up an asteroid threatening the earth?<br/><br/>The sentimental phone/insurance/cola commercial style montages were revolting.<br/><br/>I do like action movies.  Really.  This one is boring, stupid and really stuck on itself.  It deserves hatred and scorn because it's everything Hollywood's most expensive efforts have become - a bunch of cheap cliches running from one expensive explosion to another.  Oh yes, the whole thing is permeated by a Neanderthal conservative outlook on sex, politics and so on."

No. Was the Towering Inferno true to real life? No. Was Earthquake just exactly like a real earthquake? No. All the disaster films of the 70's were big budget and very entertaining...and so was Armageddon which I compare it to those great films. This is a fantastic, big budget, over the top action film with the same feeling as those 70's films. The cast was excellent and I'm disappointed when a see an actor 'disowning' a film that they star in that was so good.

"BealeFan","Null","80","156","18 January 1999"," At least it's honest
","You know, looking at what people here have to say about this movie, I think there are two problems. One, some people have no tolerance for pure entertainment. Not every movie has to explore the depths of humanity, and teach us new things about ourselves. Some of the greatest movies aver hardly do that. On the other hand, there are variances in entertainment. Those who proclaim Armageddon to be the greatest action movie ever are generally those who, last summer, said the same about Con Air, and the year before, said the same about Independence Day.<br/><br/>Now, Armageddon is slightly better than the absolute mediocrity and ""one-time-in-the-theater-but-only-with-a-big-screen-and- digital-sound"" kind of summer hit that we usually see, but by two virtues only.<br/><br/>The first is its blunt honesty. It promises no plot, no characters, little reason to care, etc. It does promise all the visceral pleasures you can get your fill of, if you're up to it. And on that level, it aims, and hits the target with style. I wouldn't see it more than a couple times, I wouldn't buy it except to test my DVD surround setup, but I do find much of it to be decent escapist fun. And then some of it is also extremely boring.<br/><br/>
On full-screen VHS with TV sound and the lights on, and the expectation of anymore than a purely technical film experience, it's not worth the time.<br/><br/>And one more thing: I, for one, appreciate the extreme care that went into Armageddon. The technical skill required to make it happen were far more impressive than most movies of this type. If the pace made it hard to follow, try paying more attention, because had it not been made as it was, it would have been even more boring. I wish, though, that it lived up to the superiority of The Rock.<br/><br/>Oh, and by honest, I'm largely comparing to the shallowness of Deep Impact. This one delivered everything it said it was going to, and didn't try to trick us into thinking it was any more."

Once again Bruce Willis is in the lead and puts on another amazing hero performance. This guy is not the most versatile actor in the world but his ""save the day"" style does not EVER get old. Not only does this movie have the A list Willis but also an amazing supporting cast with afleck, Duncan, buscemi, Wilson, Patton, and most impressively Billy Bob Thornton who is amazing in this role. The directing by Bay in this movie was flawless and the flashy style that had a cut on average every 2 seconds was absolutely amazing.

","I remember thinking that due to the cast, the subject matter, and the director, I was going to love this movie.<br/><br/>Stepping into the theatre and taking my seat, I was like a giddy schoolgirl as my anticipation for the opening scene built.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed with the opening and felt that I was truly going to love this movie.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the movie and feel that anything that gives away scenes might be seen as a spoiler, please stop reading. I'm not going to give away anything really important, but it might be seen as such, so that is the warning.<br/><br/>Spoiler may be included below, beware.<br/><br/>I think that the first scene that really hit me as just utterly ridiculous was the Russian space station scene. I mean honestly, refueling a shuttle with no real prior warning, and then to simply show the station as being so fragile that a simple little mistake can cause the entire thing to just explode.<br/><br/>While all of this is possible, it seemed to me to be way over the top. I'm not sure if it was just the situation or if it was the cheesy acting, the silly view of the Russian technology, or just the campy attitude of the scene itself.<br/><br/>It only got worse for me after that because then we endure what seemed like 2 hours of constant super loud explosions in space...you know, that place where there is no sound because it's a vacuum.<br/><br/>But the coup de grace for me, honestly, was the gun scene. (spoiler possibility) - Earlier in the movie, we see Bruce Willis tearing apart their land vehicle (the vehicle that they will use to drive around in when they get there and to help them drill) when he is told that this is what they will be using. He is taking pieces off and complaining about it because much of what's on it is heavy and not required for what they are doing.<br/><br/>So then, as we are wandering onto the asteroids, we see that they have opted to add a massive gatling like gun to the vehicles...you know, standard NASA fare is to have heavy weaponry on all space missions in case, you know, aliens or something.<br/><br/>I could have taken the explosive 2 hours, the silly Russian space station refueling scene, the cheesy love scene near the end, the Bruce Willis character being nothing more than most of his other past characters, but the Steve Buscemi going mad and shooting the space vehicle's gun all over the place and causing havoc/damage, well that threw the entire thing over the top for me.<br/><br/>Save your money and time and avoid this movie. If you want a good meteor movie, see Deep Impact, if you want a fun space movie with awesome special effects, see Space Cowboys, but no matter what, avoid this flick."
"jma-13","2","69","135","9 April 2006"," This movie touches me inappropriately
","Like many people in my general age range, I remember going to see this movie as a kid in '98 and coming out of the theatre practically in tears. It seemed, at the time, to be one of the most important, awe-inspiring cinematic experiences of our generation. At once riveting, action-packed, funny, heartbreaking, and truly inspirational, Armegeddeon really did have everything going on, right down to the catchy Aerosmith theme song and sappy tear-jerker of an ending.<br/><br/>Sweet Jebus. What were we smoking? I watched it for the first time in years last night on one of the movie channels, and... I cannot even describe it. This is, truly, one of the worst movies ever made. Where to even begin? Leaving aside the plethora of LAUGHABLE scientific errors ('personnel trackers' on astronauts? yeah, sure, thanks for that, Billy Bob), I'd have to say the worst thing about it was the remarkable - dare I even say unmatched - way in which it combined crappy writing with crappy acting. There are too many examples of this to even begin listing here, but one in particular springs to mind - the scene where Bruce Willis is telling the Feds exactly where to go to track down each of the oh-so-charmingly-roguish members of his oil drilling team ('check every bar in New Orleans', 'the craps tables in Vegas', 'the only black guy on a motorcycle in Sturgis'... all to the tune of 'Come Together'... it reminded me a bit of the ""NEWS TEAM! ASSEMBLE!"" scene from Anchorman, except serious). Ben Affleck proves, once again, that he is by far the most overpaid actor in Hollywood, having less depth, range, and overall talent than anyone else in the business. Not that Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, OR ANYONE ELSE IN THIS GODFORSAKEN PIECE OF GARBAGE was much better.<br/><br/>(I have to say, though, I got a kick out of seeing a pre-stardom Owen Wilson get killed off half-way through... is this the only movie where his character dies?) <br/><br/>Peter Stormare is perfect as THE MOST STEREOTYPICAL UNSHAVEN Russian COSMONAUT YOU HAVE EVER SCENE. (Then again, Peter Stormare does seem to have a talent for playing over-the-top Eurotypes.) It really was quite amusing how, almost IMMEDIATELY after the Americans dock with the Russian Space Station (which is actually called that in the movie), Ben Affleck succeeds in singlehandedly causing the whole joint to explode in spectacular Hollywood fashion. I also love the fact that, in the end, Paris is the only place on Earth to get destroyed, and that absolutely no one seems to care. And on top of all that, it at points literally turns into simultaneous ads for Lockheed Martin AND Kerr McGee. Oh how proud I am to be an American.<br/><br/>There's plenty of other stuff to rant about, but I won't... suffice it to say that this is a really, really, REALLY terrible movie, that I feel ashamed to have ever genuinely liked.<br/><br/>I give it two stars just for the mockability factor."
"lagriff05","7","9","13","16 June 2007"," This just goes too far sometimes, but it's good
","I'll say it straight out, this movie let me down quite a lot. I wanted an epic badass of a film that would revolutionize the way I see movies. I got an epic behemoth of a film with more then ample doses of goofy monkeying around inserted sometimes at the most inappropriate of scenes. Bruce Willis stars in this movie along with Ben Afleck and Liv Tyler as two young lovers, and it's safe to say that there aren't too many complaints with the acting (although admittedly there were some weak spots there, too).<br/><br/>No, my main problem with this movie is the comedy. Now, I'm all for comedy, but the directors of Armageddon didn't seem to be taking their own plot too seriously at some point. I was in awe at the utter stupidity of the characters in this movie, especially toward the second half of it, and specifically Rockhound (Steve Buscemi, who does do a very good job acting here anyway). We all need some lighthearted fun in our movies, but what we don't need is for the comedy to interfere with the dramatic parts of the movie, which it almost does a few times here. Rockhound's foolishness and monkeying around almost ruins several scenes and it doesn't fit with the whole theme of saving the Earth. Why did they even put the parts involving the stripper and then later the machine gun on the asteroid into the movie? It's safe to tell who we can all throw rocks at for ruining the movie. Why on earth is he so lenient about it? It makes no sense. I can say the same thing for most of the crew at the beginning, too, they seem awfully laid back for a bunch of guys about to go save the world. Bear was falling asleep and making comments about a hot girl during the teaching sessions. What? Like I said, I like comedy fine, but here it just hinders what would otherwise be a phenomenal movie.<br/><br/>This movie is full of explosions (big explosions, too, we're not talking about little buildings. We're talking entire cities all at once here. That's epic.), romantic love scenes, and other action clichés. They're actually done quite well, until we get Rockhound or Bear making more dumbass jokes. The whole mishmash makes Armageddon look like a PARODY of the action genre at some points, and it hurts the score. A lot. If I were to see this movie without any prior knowledge of action movies, and having never seen one before this, I would get a flawed first impression of the genre. It's not quite to the level of Scary Movie and Date Movie, of course, but it's not an upstanding example of how to incorporate comedy into an action movie. See Die Hard 3 or The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly for that. Sorry, but Armageddon just goes too far overboard sometimes.<br/><br/>No, I don't hate this movie though. I do like it quite a lot. It's great fun for a Saturday night with friends or if you've been drinking (lol). The ending scenes with Willis and Afleck are very touching, as are most of the scenes involving Liv Tyler. It's also got some extremely triumphant moments, and the explosions and special effects are amazingly done. Check out those skies toward the end! The scenes with Chick (Will Patton) and his ex-wife and son are extremely touching, and are the saving grace of the quieter parts of the movie. Beautiful. And like I mentioned before, it's EPIC. In all caps, too. There aren't many other movies like this that can touch it in epic-ness. Not even Die Hard or it's sequels are more epic than this monster of a film.<br/><br/>Recommended to action fans who can stand stupidity in their movie-viewing. I'll be watching this one again, too."

Would you say that Colonel Willie Sharp was predictable? Or Dan Truman? Not so, sorry.<br/><br/>True, the story is a little far fetched.

","I was surprised how many people disliked ARMAGEDDON. Sure, it's not realistic, but it's fun and that's all it's trying to be. This movie isn't trying to be APOLLO 13, or anything like that. It's supposed to be entertaining, which I thought it was. I didn't see DEEP IMPACT yet, so I can not compare the two, but I thought ARMAGEDDON was a great film.<br/><br/>An asteroid the size of Texas is heading straight for the planet Earth. When it hits, everything on the planet, even bacteria, will die. NASA, in a desperate attempt to save the planet, calls Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), an expert driller, and his elite driller group of unlikely heroes (includes Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, Michael Duncan) to go on a mission to drill a hole in the asteroid, place explosives in it and destroy it before it hits Earth. A.J. (Ben Affleck), who is engaged to Harry's daughter Grace (Liv Tyler), struggles to earn his respect. Nothing on the asteroid goes as planned, and the survivors of the team must work together to save the planet.<br/><br/>The plot doesn't have realism going for it, but it does have some great entertainment and special effects. This is probably the ultimate summer movie smash! The acting is pretty good too. Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck and Billy Bob Thornton all do a terrific job. Steve Buscemi also is excellent comic relief.<br/><br/>Go rent this movie and have fun, you'll enjoy it for sure!"

","First of all. I do not look down on Americans. I know lots of people that are intelligent people from the USA. But this Movie is so utterly bad, that i just had to comment on it.<br/><br/>First of all...Movies are mostly far from the truth. This movie is no exception. Lots of scene's are so incredibly false. For example the departure of the 2 space ships. You see them drop off the full tanks in space. Just a small distance from each other. Remember what caused the space shuttle to explode in the past ? Just a tinsy winsy part that came off. In here it is just common to drop fuel tanks that are as big if not bigger then the whole ship. What idiot would let 2 spaceships lift up and do that at the same time ??? Second of it is that the Russian station is a piece of (s)crap. I hate to bring this up to you, but astronauts nowadays go to Russia. Since their equipment is much more reliable then NASA's. The Space Shuttle is retired. And NASA uses it just to pay off the bills. And there is no better alternative for it. And the list of whoppers goes on and on. This is truly an insult to people that do take space travel serious. And i know half as much as these guys do. But the most annoying part ( read: the whole movie ) is the Propaganda and patriot crap that u get choked with. MY GOD !!!! I thought i was looking at a CNN business commercial for like an hour. The actors solve their petty problems by shooting at each other, giving the middle finger to everyone they come face to face with, start up fights, ignore the police, etc, etc... But when it comes to their love for their country and sacrificing their lives, suddenly everyone stands in line to commit suicide for it ( bomb detonator ) ?? Maybe i lack the feeling of being a true ""Patriot"", that can sing the national anthem backwards in Swahili. Whilst riding with George Bush behind the steering wheel of a golf cart, driving in circles until the battery is empty. But this movie was too much for me too handle. And when i finally got hold and pulled the flag pole and fabric of the American flag out of my hiney. I realised that i was glad this movie was finally done. I do not know why so much good actors participated in this narrow minded, stereotyping, propaganda movie. But i pity them. This represents a country where you can get away with murder if you have money or power. As long as ""Uncle Sam"" thinks you are a good patriot. Where everyone is happy as long as it is another country that has been devastated, no one cares."
"marcusedenellis","3","56","111","27 August 2007"," It's not that it's bad - I just don't like being taken for stupid!
","There are far too many high quality reviews on this film for me to make any real impact with my humble views. However... I re-watched Armageddon on TV a few nights ago and now, ten years after it was unleashed, I feel I can take a more pragmatic view.<br/><br/>Most of the articulate and intelligent reviews that have already been written cover off the preposterous nature of the science which underpins the woeful script. For example, the varying degrees to which gravity obeys the laws of dramatic tension rather than the laws of physics, the absolute necessity to have some serious Gatlin guns mounted on the drilling vehicles (what were they expecting  annoyed aliens?), the ludicrous notion that NASA would let the moronic men-children anywhere within fifty miles of a shuttle - rather than simply train their own highly disciplined astronauts to operate a drill, the cardboard cut-out Russian cosmonaut whose script direction read ""SHOUTING"" at the beginning of each line. And... nukes with big green countdown read-outs on them, 12-inch diameter drills that make 36-inch diameter holes, Earth shorn of time-zones and the amazing a ability to put on sun-glasses whilst wearing a space-suit helmet. You get the gist, the list is endless.<br/><br/>All these and many other inconsistencies, inaccuracies and failures of reason are just about forgivable if the movie delivers what it is meant to, which on some levels it does, I suppose. The thing that really gets me though, and this is the bit that I find pretty unforgivable, is that the makers of the movie assume that I (and you) are morons who will let these issues go without questioning. Maybe for some of the Cletuses and Darlenes out there  well, OK. But the vast majority of us average intelligence movie goers will say, ""Whoa, hold on buddy. Do you expect me to swallow that premise or this notion?"" To which Bay and his ilk say, ""Sure, why not, eat your popcorn."" That's what really irks me. The fact that they had all this money to spend and they used four dollars of it on technical advice for the script. Sheesh.<br/><br/>""Space dementia""... really, I ask you."
"Theo Robertson","3","23","41","6 January 2005"," I've Seen Razor Commercials With More Depth
","Looking through the IMDb trivia section I see that Ben Affleck can up with the conclusion that it might be easier training astronauts to be drillers rather than training drillers to be astronauts , but then was told to shut up after pointing this out to the producers . Hey I thought this too and I'm sure that everyone who hated this dumb movie thought the same . When the cleverest person on the set is Ben Affleck you know the movie is heading for disaster . That's just one aspect that's wrong with the script , there's plenty of more like the sketchy and clichéd characters , the scientific blunders and the unrealistic scenario - A bunch of redneck oil drillers attempt to save the earth by travelling to an asteroid , just think about that for a moment and see how the concept quickly collapses <br/><br/>But it's Michael Bay's directing that's the major problem . It really is amazing and not in a good way with the camera locking on to characters when they're not doing anything , and too many slow motion sequences during undramatic moments , then when the action does start to hot up the camera intercuts between the action scenes far too quickly . This problem of Bay's style isn't as bad as the director's latter PEARL HARBOR ( But could Bay direct a worse film than PEARL HARBOR ? ) but it is very evident here . And seeing as I've criticised the script for it's lack of science much of the problem is down to Bay as much as the screenwriters . What fireballs on an asteroid with no atmosphere ? <br/><br/>There are two things that Armageddon deserves credit for <br/><br/>1 ) The special effects are very good <br/><br/>2) It makes DEEP IMPACT look like a masterpiece in comparison <br/><br/>But you do get the impression from watching this film Michael Bay would be better suited directing commercials for macho products like razors and aftershave .

Some of the cinematography is superb, the script well thought out and Michael Bay should be praised for this.<br/><br/>The sound track both by Hanz Simmer and Aerosmith are classics.<br/><br/>This film is the definition of epic and heaps fun to watch!"

This movie gave you a lot of action and mind-blowing, spectacular and never seen before F/X. Armageddon takes you on a emotional roller coaster ride that has never been attempted, you just have to experience it to beleive it and it even brought tears to my eyes which was totally unexpected to a man like me. The only drawback I have on this movie is the editing, it looks like they deliberately took out 1/2 hour of the movie to satisfy people who will watch 7 hours of t.v. but can't watch a great 3 hour movie, maybe there's a director's cut somewhere."

This movie is the poster child for bad, unwatchable movies. How it ever got through the entire production process and into theaters is beyond me. And how this movie managed to garner an IMDb rating of 6.1 really says something about the IMDb crowd. As some others have correctly pointed out -- this movie is an insult to anyone who has an ounce of intelligence. It was tacky. Cheesy. Predictable. Boring. Unimaginative. Hackneyed. Annoying.

","''Armageddon'' is one of the most touching movies I already watched in my life. I don't care if some people think it's too heroic or too easy to predict the end, I loved it and it is one of the fewest movies who made me cry. A big asteroid with the size of Texas is coming to the Earth, and NASA decided to send the best deep core drilling team to space in order to make a chance to us, humans, not get extinguished. Harry S. Stamper (Bruce Willis) is the leader of the team and also the worried father of Grace Stamper(Liv Tyler). Grace and A.J (Ben Affleck),one of the guys who works in Harry's drilling team, loves each other and pretend to marry, but Harry disapproves the relationship and has serious problems with A.J.All the team is being trained to go to Space, and when they are in the asteroid, one of the most beautiful scenes of the movie (with an extra help of the famous aerosmith's song ''what it takes'') happens.<br/><br/>This movie is great and all that ''Deep Impact ''wanted to be!"

","An asteroid the size of Texas is detected heading for Earth. It will wipe out all life on the planet if it hits. NASA decides that the only course of action is to plant a nuclear warhead deep into the asteroid to split it in two hoping it will safely pass Earth. They send a team of oil drillers led by Bruce Willis to drill the hole and save the Earth.<br/><br/>This is a great disaster movie utilising the directing skills of Michael Bay, a great action movie director and when teamed with producer Jerry Bruckheimer they create some of the best action films around. The effects in this film are incredible with an out of this world storyline and a cast of greats that includes Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Owen Wilson, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan, William Fichtner & Will Patton. All great actors and all bring so much to the film, but the greatest performance is by Steve Buscemi who steals every scene he is in playing the character of Rockhound.<br/><br/>This is an effects heavy film, but it works. The film is about chaos and destruction and the effects are relentless in the portrayal of the destruction. The spectacle of smaller asteroids crashing down to Earth is amazing to watch. Many people were put off with the effects of chaos and mayhem, but the film wouldn't have worked without it. However this film manages something most sci-fi films fail in. It manages to get you emotionally involved. I know many people that got teary eyed at the end of the film and that is something rare in a sci-fi/action film.<br/><br/>This is a big budget blockbuster and it succeeds in every way. If you are a fan of action or sci-fi films then this is truly one not to miss out on. If you feel that with effects less is more, then this may be the wrong film for you. Try a rom-com!"
"j30bell","2","41","84","23 December 2004"," Alas, the end of the world was not nigh
","While watching this film, I was reminded of the futility of trusting politicians. This moment came when the President of the United States said ""the bible calls this time Armageddon - the end of all things""It's a sad fact, but life is never that kind.<br/><br/>When big, bad, balding, butch Bruce looks solemnly into the camera and, with creditable sincerity, delivers the line ""six billion people on the planet, why d'ya call me?"" you know something special is afoot. Lesser men - Lawrence Olivier, maybe, or Alec Guinness - would have cringed at the thought of having to deliver such verbiage without an ironic sneer. Not Bruce. Bruce, like the women of Sunset Strip, is a pro. Either that, or ironic sneers were not required in his contract. Judging by the rest of the film, neither were shame, dignity or self-respect.<br/><br/>Were there ever to be an unholy union between Top Gun and Cobra, the cinematic wreckage that would result might resemble Armageddon. It's a testosterone fuelled, guttural paean to trailer park America.<br/><br/>In many Hollywood films, for instance, technical jargon is used to pad out a dull script. Armageddon is no exception, except that here the writers clearly couldn't be bothered to find any real jargon and just made stuff up. Zero Barrier for example - what the hell is that? Freedom is ""off the Grid"" I mean pleeease! Jargon this implausible hasn't been heard since the British Government implored junkies not to shared their ""works"". Even taking into account the fact that I was hardly expecting Woody Allen, it's just awful.<br/><br/>Special effects wail around the vacuum where the story is supposed to be, looking for something to do, looking for something to affect, looking to go bang. It's not surprising then that, many, many things bang in this film - and I'm not talking about Ben Afleck. Immediately following a distasteful little scene where our Bruce is driving golf balls at people in a Greenpeace boat, and playing it for the hilarious laughs such behaviour obviously deserves, his Oil Rig explodes. Then his test rig at NASA explodes, then the Russian Space Station, then a Space Shuttle, Then a Thermonuclear Device, followed shortly (and mercifully) by himself.<br/><br/>Things go bang, then. Good basis for a multi-million dollar film project.<br/><br/>But by far and away the most depressing thing about this film is the cast list. Leaving aside the bald one, whose occasional forays into the world of acting we already knew to be liberally interspersed with pap of the highest order, there's Steve Buscemi (not only a good actor, but a very decent director), Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Afleck, Michael Clarke Duncan, Jason Isaacs, Peter Stormare (who somehow manages to steal it, though give it back, I say) - I mean even Owen Wilson. Do none of these people know better? Obviously not.<br/><br/>Some will no doubt say that I am being a curmudgeon, and that not all films need to explore the ""depths of humanity"". I agree.Unfortunately, this film does explore the depths of humanity, it just doesn't realise it's doing it. 2/10"

","I loved this movie as one of my favorite action movies of the late 90's. I only do not like it because of the action of all the scenes while on the asteroid, but it is also touching and emotional. I'm not much of an emotional person, but I did cry a little bit in this movie. The part where Bruce Willis's character talks to his daughter about him saying that he has to sacrifice himself to save the world by detonating the bomb made me cry because it was just, I don't know...touching. The Aerosmith song, ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"" was an awesome song in my opinion, as a matter of fact one of my favorites. <br/><br/>That was another thing that made me tear was the song at the end. When I saw this in the theaters, people that I saw were tearing, and I was one of them, and I don't cry much. But it was full of a lot of laughs too, such as Steve Bucsemi's character, which is fact my favorite character, almost every time he said something, almost no matter what it was, the audience was laughing. <br/><br/>Don't plan on seeing this movie if you just want to see damage and destruction, because this movie ain't like that, and you're not going to like it much if that's all you're interested in. It's about love, bravery, and freedom."

","This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  It has every bit of cheesiness, including the infamous ""animal cracker scene,"" shots of little kids running across the field at sunset (I guess that's who those people are risking their lives for, yes), the father-daughter touchy-feely crud, and just an awful depiction of patriotism much like Mel Gibson's The Patriot, another awful movie.  The worst thing about the movie is that it managed to make every character extremely annoying and obnoxious, maybe with the exception of Willis and Tyler.  If everyone except Willis died on the mission, I would've been happy; unfortunately, it worked in the opposite way.<br/><br/>And one more thing: I couldn't keep a straight face throughout the movie (a mixture of disbelieving laughter and frowns) since they started talking about drilling a hole into the asteroid.  Right.  Then just watching them actually do the drilling, in space, on an asteroid traveling really fast towards the earth is a priceless bit of comedy; unfortunately, the movie was not meant to be a comedy.  The idea is as absurd as Silvester Stallone playing an arm wrestling big rig driver.<br/><br/>I really hate this movie.  On a scale of one to ten, I give it a zero.

","There are few films I truly loathe, as I am a connoisseur of the 'so bad it's good' genre of movie-making. This distinction, however, is nearly always applied to low-budget grade-Z schlock and sci-fi. ""Armageddon"" had a humongous budget of $140,000,000 in 1998 (I'd like to know the chunk of change that went into Bruce Willis' pocket). This movie defies belief in some ways, and has qualities that warrant my loathing: 1) Editing from hell. The jump-cutting and jarring editing throughout this film could have been dangerous to some (seriously); e.g. epileptics (seizures)and bipolar people such as myself (inducing a manic episode). As I struggled through this thing, annoyance can hardly describe the what the images displayed so frenetically on screen did to me and I hadn't received my diagnosis yet back then.<br/><br/>2) The utterly-preposterous storyline. I know, I know, it's science fiction but the plotting and side stories go beyond the absurd and ridiculous. The people recruited for the mission are as stereotypically-contrived as they come. None of this stuff is believable, for one second. I think even a hint of believability should be necessary to drive a plot. Perhaps that was the point, but it didn't work for this reviewer.<br/><br/>3) Bruce Willis. I begrudgingly liked him in ""Unbreakable"", ""The Sixth Sense"", and the first ""Die Hard"" film but here he's just a macho schmuck. As John McClain, Mr. Willis was a true bad-ass who, through tremendous perseverance and over-the-top police work, you wanted to see kick those villainous terrorist's cumulative butts; here, you want to see him REALLY get hurt to shut him up.<br/><br/>4) Billy-Bob Thornton. I loved this guy in ""Sling Blade"" a few years before, where his mentally-challenged character, Karl Childers, was a wonder to behold. Original and moving, that movie was his; here, you almost expect him to wink at the audience at his un-dynamic choice of roles here. His character has NOTHING TO DO. He's wasted, as maybe he was in another way during this film's shooting schedule.<br/><br/>5) The director, Michael Bay. Oh my, what this man has done to film-making. Overblown, over-hyped, over-everything-ed, and ultimately mind-numbing pap for the masses. A popcorn flick you say? I'd gag on it, watching this case of celluloid dreck.

Every single scientific thing in this movie is wrong or made up. The list of scientific horsesh*t is too long to include in this review. However, even if you don't want 7th grade science messing with a good plot, the movie still disappoints. There is a rich stew of clichÃ© and inexplicable character behavior holding it all together.

The plot that was presented was all that was needed for a disaster movie, plus a few side stories.  An asteroid the size of Texas is headed for earth, and NASA has to employ a few of the worlds best drillers to go up into space, drill, and plant a bomb. What more do you want for an action movie about a disaster?? Armageddon is an emotional thrillride, filled with action, adventure, explosions, Bruce Willis, and most of all heart.  It has a lot of comedic interludes (some a bit silly) but it is very much welcomed in what could have been a depressing movie, like DEEP IMPACT(horrible, horrible movie). We all know what will happen.  But unlike most movies where we know the score ahead of time, Armageddon makes it fun.  Some of Hollywood's most respected actors are put through NASA training, set to cool music by Aerosmith and Trevor Rabin, and sent up to space in order to intercept an oncoming asteroid.  Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Billy Bob Thornton, Will Patton, and Steve Buscemi take us for the ride of our lives..... Well, at least the ride of the summer."

It's also got some of the best action sequences I've ever seen. Being a massive fan of sci-fi, it's great fun to watch space shuttles mauevering around, dodging debris.

Bruce Willis is such a good actor, you can't help but give in to the sadness of the end. It's all a result of the afore-mentioned character development.

And directed like an MTV video, as you would expect from Bay. God forgive me, I even remember saying I preferred Deep Impact!<br/><br/>A couple of years later and after seeing it two or three more times, all those things that I saw as defects I now consider as its virtues. Precisely because it dispenses completely with believability and is played continuously and exclusively for kicks, is why I love it so much now.

Take any random thirty seconds of the movie and have a TV spot.<br/><br/>Anyway, the premise is that a giant meteor is heading towards Earth and that everybody is going to die. Unless NASA trains these oil drillers to go up there (by 'up there' I mean 'land on the asteroid'), drill a hole, and drop a nuke down said hole, and blow the meteor apart. Apparently this meteor is the size of Texas. Okay, say that a chunk the size of Austin was left over.

","O.K.  Whether you like it or not, you can't disregard Armageddon.  Some listings list the movie as the 13th box office hit of all times.  However, to be more realistic, we can be sure that it's in the first 30's. Yes.  I accept every bad word told about the movie.  That it's not scientifically appropriate, that the plot has weak points etc.  BUT SO WHAT????  Film making is an art form and you can't question the artist if there are people worth $600 million of box office, willing to see the movie. You can not tell the film maker how to make a movie.  Armageddon was made to attract people's attention and it succeeds in it.  You can't deny that.. However, what makes it so successful?  The answer is, IT'S DIFFERENT!!. The idea that an astroid the size of Texas (although scientifically inaccurate), the idea that ""a bunch of retards that General Kimsey wouldn't trust with a potato gun"" go up to space and save the Earth etc..  I can't count them all up but the movie is really different.  The characters are filled with delicate humor and sarcasm.  Also, the plot involves points that lead to very interesting visuals.  They are sending up two shuttles and each take off at the same time, side by side.  And continue on their journey together until they reach the astroid.  NOW THAT'S SOMETHING.  Think about watching two shuttles taking off and making a journey together.  They recreated the mission room of the NASA space center just because it wasn't cool enough.  Also, who can explain me why there are black lights in the shuttles?  Or, why the colors reflecting from the actors' faces change from red to green then to blue in take-off.  SO WHAT?  These are all done on purpose!  To make the film look cool.  And it DOES achieve it."

","Looking at what other people had said about this movie, it really gave me a clear picture of the general public's intellectual capacity. I mean, we have great actors, a great story (even if it's old), and, most of all, a wonderful directing. You can even feel the thrill and the happiness when the job is done, that great the movie is. This movie smells from far as being a high-quality one. Special effects, well, they are astounding, nothing else to say. And Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck are really amazing, also the other guys have done a great job. What a hell, maybe this is what makes this movie so good, the performance of all the actors, not just those two. And I see here one guy that tells this is a ""popcorn movie"". Unbelievable. What's a good movie for guys like him, Saw, Borat, Harry Potter, etc? But this is a fact, people, in general, do not appreciate good quality movies or music, nor the guys in the Oscar committee. Michael Bay, even if you don't read this, you did a wonderful job, keep up with the good work."

","The acting was horrible. The special effects, while exceptional, dominated the movie. The writing was pathetic, and the dialogue was unbelievable. And the silly little love story between Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck was out of place.<br/><br/>But the worst offense of ""Armageddon"" was the total lack of scientific reality. ""The asteroid is the size of Texas,"" says Billy Bob Thornton. Er, that's 800 miles wide! No one in NASA even sees the asteroid until a midday meteor shower wrecks havoc in New York? Suuuuure. NASA hires a drilling team to join the astronauts and trains them in a week? Yeah, right. Someone brings a sidearm on the Space Shuttle with them? Yeah, that's realistic.

With all due respect to Americans, this movie was just typical for America - the big bad cowboy riding out to save the world and whatnot.<br/><br/>Well, at least the actors did what they could, Bruce Willis did some wonderful work in bringing life to his character, as always, and so did most of the other actors - but the truth is, not even good acting is going to save this movie from me classifying it as ""B-type"".<br/><br/>With all the music, and graphics, and fast sequences, the entire movie looked more like a automobile-commercial then a doomsday movie. The plot is cliche, the graphics big and sparky, and everything just too dang typical.

"Dr_Coulardeau","8","8","14","4 November 2007"," This film leads us to mental archeology
","The film opens with the twin towers standing proud and tall in New York City. We are in 1998. The US had not yet been the victim of that deep fit of terror fright which is just as frightening as space fright. It was a time when the US were already deeply obsessed by the end of the world (as always and ever in their short history), and since the USSR did not exist any more, and China was not yet seen as the new contender, they were exploring the danger from outer space anew. They could accept the idea of more or less showing a few Moslem pictures along with dominant Christian ones. The strict separation of religions had not yet reached Hollywood. The enemy that the US mind needs to be able to think the proper way was a big piece of rock coming from far far away in space and the size of Texas, read my lips of course. But why do the US always think the world as having to come to an end and why envisaging this end as having to be a fight, even against a piece of rock? If the world has to have an end, and it sure has to because nothing is eternal, why not prepare for death that may occur any time? If humanity has to have an end too and it will have an end since it had a beginning, why not just getting ready to meet that end in dignity? Why always see that end as a catastrophe? What's more why do the US always end at once thinking of themselves as the saviors of the world as soon as they speak of that end? The world will have to come of age and be able one day to face its future, no matter what, in other terms than a savior and a mass of repenting and grateful individuals? But the film is a lot more interesting when seen ten years after its shooting. The world can be saved by the human race itself. Good. We had not reached the great paranoia of climate change yet. To save the world one individual will have to sacrifice himself for it and that one is the father and not the son. That is a complete inversion of the Christian myth. But even better, in fact worse, that savior, that redeemer, that self-sacrificial person is a man, as if women were not yet of age for that kind of selfless sacrifice. But note that father has a daughter and there is no mother anywhere. Is it a sign of our times when families are broken up everywhere? Or is it a sign of the superiority of men, though there is another divorced couple with a son and the son is taken care of by his mother (inverted situation). So where is the real truth about this question? I personally have the impression that the film is ten years old and that in Hollywood they could ten years ago still produce such films that are definitely slightly male chauvinistic with just a light, very light touch of female liberation if not only female presence to avoid any gay ambiguity. Slightly passé, and also a little bit long as for the scenes on the meteorite.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

","I can't say often enough how bad ARMAGEDDON is. Roger Ebert's review is probably the best ever written about this film: he wrote that it's not a movie but a two hour movie trailer. But ARMAGEDDON is the standard to which every ""Big Budget Hollywood Blockbuster"" stinker is set against. Personally, ARMAGEDDON is even worse than Roland Emmerich's GODZILLA (98) and that travesty was HORRENDOUS, so you can imagine how bad ARMAGEDDON is. The whole idea of getting guys who work on a oil rig to help astronauts destroy an incoming asteroid is stunningly brainless. Seriously, who greenlighted this project? This ""movie"" has absolutely nothing. It's probably the most hollow film experience ever put on celluloid. To make things even more enjoyable, it's jaw-droppingly jingoistic, so much so that I wanted the piece of rock to slam into planet earth  and kill the whole human race once and for all.<br/><br/>I've never seen so many actors wasted in one single movie. No one gives a semblance of a performance. It's all posing and screaming and in the very embarrassing for everyone concern. The editing is epileptic. The look of the film is like a Budweiser commercial. The science is unacceptably unscientific, even for an escapist movie. Dialogue that made my ears bleed. And the action was silly. The world is about to end and they go party at a strip club where women throw themselves at them. Sure. The space shuttles take forever to land on the asteroid but it only takes them a couple of seconds to leave it. The asteroid pieces always crash into big cities (NY, Paris, Hong Kong...). The never-ending use of slow-motion shots. Machine guns on the rovers. Why?!?! Did they expect to find nasty aliens on the asteroid? Mind-numbingly loud! I can't stress enough how loud ARMAGEDDON is. It's nearly offensive and it takes a lot to offend me. All in all, ARMAGEDDON is the perfect showcase for everything that's wrong with movies these days."

Anyone who really understands physics and astronomy will have a good laugh at this movie's expense.<br/><br/>Let's move on to all that other stuff in a movie (story, characters, special effects). All of them are poorly done and some of them are at an absurd level of silliness. Yet, you can tell that the director is taking this movie seriously and expects us to.

That's exactly what I expect from this duo, and nothing less than that. Not unless it was meant to on their part, other than that I look forward to these kind of pictures (The Rock, Con Air, Pearl Harbor). This is just meant to take us out of our own reality for a moment(2+ hours), and let us enjoy an entertaining piece of work. So what, it's not going to win best picture at The Academy Awards. Do you really think Bay didn't know that when he set out on this project. Of course he did, but the thing I like about his filmmaking is that you can tell that he has a lot of fun doing what he loves doing. And I say keep on trucking.

In fact, I think that with another cast, it would been just another cheezy scifi movie. I, truly, cannot think of anything that I would change about this movie.

Therefore the nuke will explode and Earth will be safe once again. But, the team runs into a few snags for example Harry (Bruce) doesn't really like A.J.

"HotToastyRag","7","3","4","8 July 2019"," Great cast with tons of energy
","Believe it or not, I managed to escape the 1990s without sitting through Armageddon. I'm notoriously squeamish about ""we're all going to die!"" movies, so the only reason I did sit through it was because it was Bruce Willis's week on Hot Toasty Rag. Thankfully, my mom prepped me for it and told me everything that happened so I wouldn't be too scared or sad. So, if you're squeamish like me, and you want to watch it anyway, just ask your mom how it ends.<br/><br/>He must have been busy, or didn't want to seem old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter, but the leading role Bruce Willis took on seemed tailor-made for Kevin Costner. Bruce held his own and wound up making a certain scene one of the most iconic scenes to come out of the '90s. He plays a gruff, tough oil driller with a soft spot for his daughter, Liv Tyler. Liv, raised around gruff, tough friends of her dad, has fallen in love with one of them, and her dad's not happy about it. Liv and Ben Affleck's romance seems a little unimportant when Bruce and his entire crew are called to NASA to save the world.<br/><br/>Sure, I'm not a fan of the premise of the movie-a giant asteroid heading for Earth isn't my idea of a good time-but the cast is so delightful it makes everything worth it. Everyone has tons of energy and brings their own presence to the screen. Bruce had his classic combination of machoism mixed with being a softie on the inside. His fellow drillers-turned-astronauts are an eclectic group impossible to dislike. Steve Buscemi has a weakness for women, and his antics are hilarious and remarkably charming. Will Patton has a broken homelife, and he's given a touching scene the night before the rescue mission to reconcile with his family. Michael Clarke Duncan, Owen Wilson, and Ken Campbell aren't really given anything to do besides rattle off one-liners, but the one-liners are funny, so I don't think anyone will complain. Back at NASA, the head of the program and mission is Billy Bob Thornton, and he always brings a little something special to his roles. Keith David, a head honcho from Washington, brings tension and severity to the plot, and Jason Isaacs plays a scientist with good intentions.<br/><br/>When Bruce's group is brought to NASA, they have to go through a mini-boot camp to make sure they're physically able to undergo the mission. It's a very funny sequence, started by William Fichtner, who plays the only certified astronaut on the mission, quipping, ""Talk about the wrong stuff!"" when he sees the odd lineup. Bill has a great, meaty role, and he's completely believable as a disciplined, intelligent patriot who's scared yet confident. Peter Stormare puts on yet another accent, Russian this time, and plays a quirky astronaut who's been stationed in space for too long at the expense of his social skills. There are plenty of comic reliefs in this movie, Peter included, to even out the immense tension of the plot. Even though you'll be worrying about the end of the world, you'll be laughing through your fear.<br/><br/>Since this is a Michael Bay movie, you can expect overactive camera angles and tons of special effects. The opening sequence is incredible, even when watching it twenty years later, as a meteor shower destroys New York City. There's a lot to appreciate in this movie, with the push and pull of the characters, everyone's special quirks and motivations, and the Oscar-nominated song, ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing."" The romance between Liv and Ben is really the only downside; it's supposed to be true love and more powerful than the end of the Earth, but it feels like a summer fling between two teenagers. Liv is given many tearjerker scenes throughout the movie, and since she was only twenty years old during the filming, I decided to cut her some slack. I remember the difficulties of being a young actress and how sometimes the emotions you think are being projected in front of the camera don't end up coming across very well. So, when you watch her scenes and she's supposed to be crying over the danger her boyfriend and father are in, keep her age in mind and be kind.<br/><br/>To call yourself a true '90s kid, you'll probably want to rent this movie. You'll probably have a good cry during the credits, but if you like these ""we're all going to die!"" movies, you'll probably enjoy yourself during the process. Go ahead and bring your Kleenexes, and enjoy what this very large cast brings to the screen.<br/><br/>DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie will not be your friend. Since I counted 66 spinning camera shots and 13 canted angles, as well as 4 scenes with strobelights and 6 scenes with a severe shaky camera, you should be aware that this movie could make you seriously sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""<br/><br/>Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, since this is an ""end of the world"" movie, I'd wait until my kids were a little older until they watch it."

It's a non stop action flick that puts a few A-listers and some best of the best B-listers in some very interesting situations happening in outer space.<br/><br/>Directing and cinematography are music video like, as they always are in a Michael Bay movie, but music makes up for all of it. Aerosmith at it's best. Also, editing is quite good. The entire movie is well crafted and it's so hard not to like it weather you agree or disagree with some of the statements it presents. And writing, no matter how unoriginal it is, really takes the best from dumb science fiction movies and does a good job at putting it all together. Armaggedon is a big pile of overused Hollywood stuff, but the writer did a very good job with it and for that the movie is never boring or irritating in any way. And yeah, like i said, this is one of the biggest American Propaganda films of the last twenty years, but with all it's qualities i just can't help but love it. Even if those qualities are nowhere near to being original or fresh.<br/><br/>As for the acting, the actors do quite good with their roles. Yes, even Ben Afleck. But the star of the film is still, as he is in any movie he's ever been in, Bruce Willis. He just looks natural in these bad guy with a heart of gold kind of roles. All the others did quite good as well, but like i said, Bruce really stands out. Even in a cast that's filled with good and popular names.<br/><br/>American propaganda, yes! American propaganda at it's best, yes! I love it even though i hate all it stands for. Well, not all of it, but... I have nothing against patriotism, but i do have everything against movies that put one nation, America, in the savior of the world part and put it above everyone else. But i guess they tried to cover it up with a good hearted crazy Russian guy so i'll be forgiving this time and just enjoy the movie as interesting as it is, no matter what it's flaws are. And yes, you heard me right, the Russian guy is actually a good guy instead of a terrorist or anything like it. And he wants to come back to his Mother Russia as a hero! :)"

If you can do that, the film becomes quite entertaining - just don't start looking for seriousness. Quite a bit of the film is (I would say, anyway...) intended to be tongue-in-cheek, I found myself laughing out loud at many, many scenes in the film (especially at some of the to-die(-for) one-liners that the characters seem to sprout at regular intervals.<br/><br/>So: See this film as pure no-brain entertainment. About as deep as a puddle and about as suble as the wrench that Bear holds the first time we see him on the oil rig. But still, in my opinion, entertaining.

This movie exceeded my expectations in nearly every way, through its enriching plot and acting, exceptional directing by Michael Bay, and its core concept of the power of relationships.<br/><br/>The movie opens up with action right away, with a meteor shower. It first impacts a space shuttle, and then hits Earth in various locations, causing chaos and fear in people's eyes, as they don't know what is going to happen next. This scene catches people's attention, and is a powerful opening to what the rest of the film has in store. NASA then discovers a Texas-sized asteroid approaching Earth and they have 18 days until it hits. This causes panic in the space station, and everyone bands together to try to find a solution to this massive problem. It's a race against the clock to stop the asteroid before it's too late. They came to the solution of blowing up the asteroid from the inside, with the help of some oil drillers.<br/><br/>Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), an experienced deep sea driller is hired by NASA to essentially save the planet. No pressure, right? He agrees to the task, but insists he brings his own men with him, as it makes him feel more comfortable. One of his men, A.J. (Ben Affleck), is dating his daughter, Grace (Liv Tyler), and this is hard for Stamper to handle, as he is the typical overprotective father. Grace has been travelling with her dad throughout her life, as her mother left the picture. She created a family with the guys onboard, and they treat her as they would their own child. They have a strong bond that no one could take away. Bruce Willis' performance was superb as he portrays a character that is tough, yet vulnerable as he cares about his daughter. He also offers a sarcastic charisma, which helps ease the tension of their life-threatening circumstances. While Bruce Willis' impressive acting is evident in other well known movies like Die Hard and Sixth Sense, where he plays strong characters, he brings a unique depth to the character of Harry Stamper specifically. His powerful performance adds a lot to both the story and the film as a whole.<br/><br/>One of the elements that made this movie so powerful was the use of music to create certain moods. Music had the power to increase the intensity of a moment or a scene and evoke emotion from the viewer. This film uses the powerful song, ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"" by Aerosmith multiple times. This song helped create a deeper emotional connection to the characters and the relationships that they formed. Michael Bay also implemented strong visual effects to portray space, and action scenes involving explosions. This was crucial to the film, because it made it more authentic and helped create a realistic portrayal of events. Some think that certain scenes seem impractical, as their bomb wouldn't be able to blow up an asteroid of that size. I recognize these complaints, but little details like these don't make or break the movie, as it is a fictional film.<br/><br/>A core theme of the film is the power of relationships in one's life. Relationships add to the depth and the power of this film. Harry has a special bond with his men, as he spends nearly everyday working with them. Harry is extremely tough on the outside, and hardly shows how much he cares, but it's there. And he of course has the relationship with his daughter, who is the light of his life, and does anything to make her happy. Grace, in particular was the main reason that he decided to complete this task, in all efforts to make her proud.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see, and thoroughly impressed me on all levels: plot, acting, visual effects, and emotional appeal. It also captured the core theme of the importance of well-developed relationships. It grasped my attention from start to end, and never failed to keep me on the edge of my seat. Michael Bay's fantastic directing made this film an entertaining masterpiece, and I recommend it to anyone seeking an action-packed, heartfelt experience."

","As an international student who have came there for 3 month, I find something that in American blood. No matter how many bugs in this film, it can show the spirit of American from many fields.<br/><br/>It mainly talks about the progress of a group of drilling workers saving the world by drilling a failing stone and exploding it. At the beginning, I notice that all of them wear jeans which have been the mark of American, like the hat of cowboy. The job may be dangerous because of storm ,but they love challenge.<br/><br/>Self-reliance is another part I see from American. They tear down the drill cars that take NASA millions of dollar and then rebuild them the way they like. That is one of the reasons they overcome the bad situation in the end. Self-reliance may be the reason why there is no other country join the saving plan except a drunk Russian. Just like a hundred years ago, rugged individualists, like Daniel Boone, Jesse James and Wyatt Earp ,and many other people tried to conquer ""the Wild West"" by themselves.<br/><br/>From the start to finish, president to soldiers, no one ever thought about what will happen if they don't win. All I see is ""I can do it! "" ""We can get it!"" ""God bless America"". ""Can-Do"" is the power that change impossible to possible.<br/><br/>The most impression of America that I get from the film is equality. In front of risk, we are equal to each other. No matter what's your job, you may be the hero to save the world because those drilling guys did it. This just like a copy of history, people change, equipments change but the spirit will never change. God bless American."
"jimjo1216","Null","4","6","6 February 2010"," A guilty pleasure of mine
","I've always kinda liked this film. Sort of a guilty pleasure of mine. The script is cheesy in parts, but the film makes up for that with thrilling outer space/end-of-the-world drama.<br/><br/>NASA has only one chance to blow up an asteroid that threatens all life on Earth. One chance to do it and do it right. We feel for the guys sent on the mission, but at the same time we know that if they can't get the job done, the entire human race will be wiped out.<br/><br/>There are parts of the movie that will make you start to tear up. These ordinary men are sent on a dangerous mission to save humanity, and (minor *spoilers*) not all of them come home safely. One particular tragedy is especially sad. But then the film comes back with some uplifting moments as well.<br/><br/>There's also plenty of Michael Bay explosions and grand scale destruction.<br/><br/>I can understand the complaints people have with this film. I noticed a few myself when watching the movie for the first time in years. Some of the dialogue is cheesy, the romance (particularly the ""animal cracker scene"") doesn't really work, there are too many clock-ticking-down-to-one-second scenarios, and a lot of scenes are overly sentimental (with dramatic slow-motion). I can see these flaws, but the fun and the thrills balance them out for me.<br/><br/>(One gripe that I can't agree with is the film's lack of scientific plausibility. No sound in space? No explosions? In a film like this, scientific accuracy is not what's important to me. I don't expect to find realism. The movie is entertaining the way it is.)<br/><br/>The cast includes several familiar faces (Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan, etc.) and the ensemble is kind of fun. (Though I've never been much of a Liv Tyler fan.)<br/><br/>If nothing else, the movie is worth watching for the performances of Steve Buscemi (as a borderline insane maybe-genius) and Peter Stormare (as the crazy Russian cosmonaut). Buscemi is great.<br/><br/>While it's not perfect, there's a lot to like in Armageddon. It's a fun ride and a classic ""save the world"" epic. I'd rate the movie about a 6, but I couldn't help but enjoy certain parts enough to bump my final grade to a 7/10."
"kilhaproductions","Null","4","6","13 December 1999"," Still you can't help loving old Bruce, if for nothing else his sporting new hairdo.
","NB:SPOILERS INCLUDED<br/><br/>
Although Armageddon has more testosterone than Liv Tyler has collagen implants, it never tries to be any more than the genre permits. Keeping this in mind I defy anyone that doesn't enjoy it, for the visual attributes alone. Firstly it's an extremely unbelievable scenario that NASA would have no better scheme to save the planet, than to drill a hole into a global killer. For all their technology they can only think to nuke it. However the characters equal disbelief of the plot, helps us to get through this.<br/><br/>In the initial scenes we find ourselves thrust (no pun intended), into the immediate drama of the government discovering a meteoric shower. The fact that New York has just been blown to smithereens might have given it away, but as an audience we find ourselves strangely believing the US military fool enough to mistake this for a possible nuclear assault. After all these are the men who did not assassinate Saddam Hussein. I found myself immediately drawn in by Eddie Griffin, a familiar black face, great. As a WB sitcom star I expected him to be in a supporting role at least, I was soon to discover he was very disposable. What an excellent casting choice, taking a well-known comedian and turning him into.a bike riding bum? Here begins our journey into.well the end of the world really.<br/><br/>Michael Bay truly pleased the ""drunken, hormonally charged populous"" with immediate explosions and military conflict. Enter Harry Stamper (a.k.a. Bruce Willis) with a god-awful accent, swinging golf balls of an oil rig. This is the person to whom the responsibility of saving the world will fall, a man on an oil rig assaulting Green-Peace activists. Still you can't help loving old Bruce, if for nothing else his sporting new hairdo. Then we're introduced to the other main characters of the film, the ""it boy"", A. J. (Ben Affleck) and the ""lip girl"", Grace (Liv Tyler). Which leads us nicely into the age-old shotgun scene. You know the one, father tells son equivalent to stop taking risks, finds son equivalent screwing daughter. Chases him with large semi automatic weapon, annoys Japanese investors, strikes oil and gets asked to save entire population. You know that old chestnut. A good portion of this picture basically consists of a bunch of drilling misfits learning to become astronauts in 10 days, on the premise that Brucey feels that the real astronauts ""may be NASA's finest but they don't know a damn thing about drilling"". With this logic in mind, I suppose it would make more sense to teach oil riggers to become astronauts, than teaching the astronauts to drill. Astrophysics, drilling, astrophysics, drilling. Tough call Harry.Admittedly there was a lot wrong with this movie, unnecessary footage for the sake of BMW, unnecessary people (i.e. the stripper who looked like Eva Herzigova). Even when appealing to our basic lusts, we all wanted to see Ben and Live get busy, (after all they're both so pretty) it was an anticlimax. I'm sure I wasn't the only one in the audience thinking for God sake Ben hurry up and get her skirt up and stop farting around with those bloody animal crackers!<br/><br/>Then there was the script, constantly confusing me with its changes in tone and content. Just when characters said semi-meaningful words, filled with doubt, fear or emotion about the possibility that they might not succeed in destroying the meteorite. They'd ruin the moment by announcing they were going to ""tear this bitch up"". Perhaps this was due to the fact that they had simply too many writers, Shane Salerno, Ann Biderman and Academy winner Robert Towne obviously work better alone. This also left me wondering were these intentional lapses into manly behavior, or were they simply trying to please the beer swilling populous?<br/><br/>I'm was also wondering about the choice of actors, Brucey triumphs in his element. Even though he's getting on a bit, we all still love Brucey. Bruce is cool, Bruce is a hero, Bruce is in very familiar territory. This is Die-Hard in space Part 2 (part 1 being The 5th Element). Then there's Grace how aptly named, Liv looks great in this movie, but she just can't act the part  (especially when it comes to shouting). She's like Milla, but they don't treat her as such, for Gods sake scantily clad the girl and make sure she doesn't have too many lines. As for Ben well he has no place here at all, we expect sarcastic comedy from Ben, or at the very least poignant drama. We do not expect fighting words, it's hard to take him seriously, but maybe we're not supposed too.<br/><br/>There were some great supporting performances, personally I felt Steve Buscemi stole the show as the neurotic secret genius. Mr. Buscemi was also responsible for capturing the world's most crooked teeth in the most unflattering camera angle of cinematic history. The graphics were in themselves like a supporting character, they played a very important role in this movie. Believable devastation's of small Asian villages that near brought tears to my eyes, hats off to the combined efforts of Dream Quest Images, Vision Crew and Digital Magic. The casting director should have been shot; she'd made one mistake too many by this point. There really was no need to cast such attractive extra's, I'm convinced I saw the most handsome goat herder known to man.<br/><br/>However if you just cringe at the one-liners, and try to ignore at the all American hero aspect. Let the bad casting of Ben and Liv slide, and revel in the glorious graphics and Brucey at his best, you won't be disappointed. If you want a more realistic interpretation of Armageddon, I suggest Mimi Leders ""Deep Impact"". I honestly enjoyed the movie but when I left the theater my mind wasn't contemplating the possibility of hurtling meteorites, instead I was left puzzling ""now which one was on special K, was it the cowboy or Mr. Pink?"""
"lotus_chief","1","10","20","19 January 2004"," Well that's two hours I'll never get back.....
","My GOD this has to be one of the absolute worse movies I have EVER seen! Michael Bay is at it again with the 'all style and entirely NO substance' approach.  Its just AMAZING to me that so many big names were involved in this movie and its still THIS BAD!  Talk about asinine!  The whole plot is just ludicrous.an asteroid is coming towards Earth to destroy us all..the only people who could save us?  Oil drillers!  Train them until the absolute last possible day before this big rock hits us and send them up there like astronauts so they could dig into it, drop a nuke, get out of there and detonate the bomb.  This is where the person with sense would say, wouldn't the pieces from the explosion still hit Earth anyway?  Hark!  Bay & Co. have the answers to that one...detonate the nuke before you cross this boundary between it and Earth and the pieces should just miss our planet!  Are you KIDDING ME???<br/><br/>I still can't believe this trash was even made.  And the fact that it made as much money as it did bewilders me.  There's escapist entertainment, that still somehow makes sense and is somehow logical, and then there's Armageddon, which is just too stupid and ridiculous to even NOT be taken seriously.  I knew what to expect going in, but its one of those things where you don't think it will ever be as bad as you think it would be.  In this case its even WORSE!  Just how in the hell did they manage to do that? Easy.  By having NO script and a load of talentless 'superstars' (i.e. Ben Affleck).  Ben Affleck was one of the most worthless, stupidest characters I've ever witnessed in a movie.  What was his purpose?.... to just mess everything up and be as inept as possible?  The acting was horrible, which doesn't help the fact that the 'script' is pure nonsense.  Everyone just took the idea of the world ending too calmly..giving Bruce Willis & Co (our 'heroes') ample and frequent times to complain and bicker to each other about stupidness.  Uh, we're here to save the world.maybe this isn't a good time?!?!?!  Could SOMEONE have a BIT of sense here?  Oh, there was the self-proclaimed genius, Steve Buscemi (what the hell was HE thinking??) who was the only logical one until he came down with 'space dementia'. WHAT????<br/><br/>
This is the perfect example of a movie having all the fancy decorations and brand names to cover up its total idiocy.  What really got me was how the surface of this asteroid was as smooth as newly paved streets for everyone to just drive/stroll around so easily.  I can employ my suspension of disbelief but so far, but the Evel Knievel jump made by Affleck on the armadillo was THE LAST STRAW for me!  I said 'two hours' in my summary because that's how much of the 153 minute drivel of a movie I was able to tolerate before almost breaking my sacred player trying to get the rented DVD out of it (how I removed the disc from my player without breaking it is a mystery).  I didn't see the last half hour or so and I truly don't care to know/see what happens.  I have been scarred for life watching this garbage, though I'm still recuperating from the torturous experience.  From now on I now know to stay FAR FAR AWAY from Michael Bay movies..Pearl Harbor, Bad Boys 2, and now Armageddon???  This takes the cake.  Those were two precious hours of my life that I could never get back.  What a load of CRAP this was.. one of the top 10 WORST movies I've ever been so unfortunate to see.<br/><br/>ZERO out of **** stars."
"DTOdlum","1","13","28","14 July 2001"," A horrible, bloated, and hyper movie
","This movie was not an action-packed guilty pleasure (Except for the fact that it's enjoyable to goof on).  It was not mindless fun/entertainment. Go see Face/Off for that.  Armageddon is a fractured, over-stylized mess of not much more than spliced rip-offs of music videos and television commercials. If my memory is correct, as the climax neared, the cutting between scenes increased in frequency.  It got to the point when I didn't even know who was dying or who was surviving on the asteroid, and I was too dazed from the strobe-light effect of the MTV/zero attention span cutting to care. Constant movement does not necessarily equal good action, in my opinion. Therefore, I give this movie a 1.  It is truly awful, possibly the worst movie of all time, and what makes it worse is that it made a lot of money, which has resulted in and will result in more bloated offspring to come.  I will not be vacationing in Pearl Harbor this summer."

But you still need plausibility and story and acting so you can believe. If you don't care about the characters then what is the use of showing me one of them sacrificing himself for another. If it had any of these things (even slightly), then it would of be fun.<br/><br/>This movie is like some child telling you some improvised story with action figures: ""And then the Tonka truck guys go into space...and then they land on the ass-teroid...and then they drive around it and almost float away...and they have to put a bomb in a hole..wait wait I forgot the part about the drills...they have these big drills...and then the guy cries...and then the bomb goes booooooooosh.

"Jonas1969","1","7","13","23 June 2009"," Not Bruce Wills worst effort ever (but a close second)
","Yes this will turn into a bit of a rant because I can't stand this stinker. But Bruce has actually lent his name to even worse dung in the past with 'Hudson Hawk', but there at least it's possible to laugh at the sheer horror of it all, but Armageddon is so offensive in it's stereotypes that I can't stand to watch.<br/><br/>It's been said in other reviews that this is a movie for Independence Day fans and I agree as long as they are prepared for even worse stereotypes and no characters that are lovable. ID has Will Smith & Jeff Goldblum in nice quirky roles with some humanity, but Armageddon has no character depth at all and the 'humour' never gets above the potty level.<br/><br/>If either Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi or Peter Stormare are proud of this then I would be astonished. I even expect better from Michael Bay: the director of such junk as Pearl Harbour & Bad Boys. Why? Well he has done the flawed but OK 'The Island' & the stereotypical but entertaining 'The Rock'.<br/><br/>Many modern action flicks are flawed in their portrayals of countries & cultures but stereotypes about Germans & South Africans aside 'Die Hard' & 'Lethal Weapon (2)' still manage to outweigh this with their charm, wit & pace. Armageddon does not.<br/><br/>For apocalypse movies see: 'Deep Impact' or even the better than it's rated 'Twister'. If you want action you can pretty much chose anything & it will be better - why not revisit 'The Rock' by Michael Bay. Comedy: Even a Greek tragedy has more humor than this so you can pick anything & it will be better.<br/><br/>I've rated about 250 movies on IMDb and my average score is 6.6. This is the only movie I've given a 1 (no I haven't rated 'Hudson Hawk' yet). When I give a score below 3 it has to be a truly bad movie - and this is just about the worst I've seen. If you are like me watch all sci-fi, then by all means live through it, but otherwise avoid it at all cost."

","The worst movie I have seen in many a year. Who produces this garbage and calls it good film-making? For one thing, it was not suspenseful in the slightest. It is almost as bad as the made-for-TV disaster movie 10.5. I would say it is only slightly better than Deep Impact, which was another horrible movie that came out at the same time. The script is lousy and the characters so unbelievable you almost want to laugh. No wonder the ""disaster"" movie genre died a quiet death after the 1970s. Why is Hollywood trying to bring it back? At least in some of the ""disaster"" flicks of the 1970s, like Earthquake or The Towering Inferno, we had a sense of foreboding. This movie does not even rise to that level.<br/><br/>The part of the movie that I groaned at was when the ""astroidonauts"" or whatever you call them were saying to their girlfriends ""Honey, I love you...goodbye"" on the telephone-TV. After sitting in the theater for about 2 hours wanting this awful movie to end, I wanted to throw up, it was so sappy and phony. Does Hollywood think viewers want to see this kind of Karo syrup in an action movie? It was not even believable. By the way, Ben Affleck cannot act his way out of a paper bag and this movie proves that. The only reason Bruce Willis is in the film is because he is a box-office ""draw."" If I were Willis, I'd be embarrassed to have been associated with this BOMB. Bad, bad, bad. Avoid at all costs."

Jerry Bruckheimer must have wagered Michael Bay that he couldn't make the most overblown sensationalized movie ever. Well Jerry, you owe Michael this time, because he did it.<br/><br/>If Mr. Bay were to eat like he directs, then he would easily weigh in at 2 tons. There is not a single scene in this movie that doesn't want to be grandiose, not a single line of dialog that wouldn't be improved with the actor taking a giant bite out of a ham sandwich after delivery.<br/><br/>I have actually once been, with a few hundred other people, in a life or death situation.

","I used to like some of the Hollywood action blockbusters of the 80s. They had icons such as Arnie and Sly but I think the action movie in the '90s has plummeted to new depths. The worst of these, I believe, was Armageddon.<br/><br/>
The plot is shamelessly contrived and pulls off the worst cliches as it seeks to excite viewers. The melodrama is so cringingly saccharine and awful that you actually cannot wait for Bruce Willis to disappear from the screen. Liv Tyler, who had acted admirably in several fine independent features directed by such masters as Bernardo Bertolucci and Robert Altman, regrettably decided to jump onto the commercial bandwagon. This movie symbolises the new Hollywood aesthetic of grand special effects and precious little good dialogue or authentic melodrama. That is the norm these days and I begin to wonder if there is a role in Hollywood for screenwriters. It seems as though they just employ hacks and committees to write the facile scripts. The rest they leave to technology. There is not a single piece of grand, heartfelt human emotion in Armageddon. It just feels empty and bland. I can think of only one good aspect of this movie and that involves Liv Tyler's dad who doesn't even make an appearance in the film. Steven Tyler's band Aerosmith provide a theme song for the movie - a ballad that really soars and at least tugs at the heartstrings a little when the end credits come up.<br/><br/>I weep for Western civilization if people like this predictable, cumbersome movie. It stands for shallowness, lethargy, and a decline in the human intellect. I would even prefer to watch the eighth Friday the 13th."
"atzimo","1","9","18","21 May 2001"," An irritating joke with a ridiculous direction
","If you are a rational person, you will go crazy when you watch Armageddon. This movie is way beyond the poetic justice of Science Fiction and sometimes I wonder how the studio approved such a script. I mean we are not talking about a B-movie here, this is a multi-million dollar project that was advertised as the Sci-Fi event of the decade.<br/><br/>Apart from the craziness of sending a bunch of unqualified people on a mission to save the world, there is the well known Michael Bay celebration of the US military forces ('The Rock'). There's also a sad statement that the whole planet depends on USA to find a solution in a crisis. You see, this drilling thing is such a sophisticated procedure that all the nerd astronauts of the world are unable to perform, so Bruce Willis' 'American' oil drilling team were asked to save the day.<br/><br/>But what's even more irritating than the script, is Michael Bay's direction. He behaves as someone who's just learned all those cool trick shots and tries to show them off through the entire movie. There isn't one static shot in the movie! Literally! When he's zooming in to a character he uses those trademark Spielberg/Rodriguez techniques and he doesn't know where to stop. Those shots should be used in order to emphasize a line or a critical moment, but he does this all the time! The whole thing is like an enormous music video and after some time it becomes really bothersome.<br/><br/>Just a few days before Michael Bay's US military trilogy is completed with the official screening of 'Pearl Harbor' I have one thing to ask: How can a cult personality like Steve Buscemi star in Armageddon?"
"petshop","1","9","18","2 March 1999"," This doesn't work on so many levels for so many reasons
","The most amazing similarity between this film and its sister blockbuster ""Deep Impact,"" is the same level of suckiness they register. This one, the hard-core action flick (as opposed to the spring's sentimental ""human"" one) dredges up just as many horrible lines and schmaltzy relationship scenes. Only it rushes them and leaves character development on the fly, which is fine in a film like this. But it had better make up for it in action. There's a lot of intense music, testosterone-fueled scream-offs, quick cuts, and a few explosions: all the earmarks of action. But no action. Not on the scale of worldwide destruction anyway.<br/><br/>Like Deep Impact, much of the best destruction was shown in the trailer. A couple of scenes were saved for those willing to put out the price of admission (like the destruction of Paris), but these are few and far between. Here's the perfect opportunity to randomly cut to any point in the world and show its obliteration by any size meteor the creators deem necessary. What a fantastic image. That's what we're here for. It's only used a couple times.<br/><br/>Our hunger for worldwide annihilation is expected to be satiated with excruciatingly long ""action"" scenes like a shuttle refueling gone awry. These scenes simply feel like budget buffers and unnecessarily stretch the film to an uncalled for 2 and a half hours.<br/><br/>Any astronomers or physicists, hell anyone who passed 6th grade science, should be prepared to feel insulted by the ignorance the script expects you to have. Even if you know absolutely nothing about things like say, gravity, the holes in simple logic are distracting enough to keep you frustrated: Easy access machine guns mounted on the space shuttle's drill machines? (Even though a handgun is under top secret lock and key) There was tons of debris hindering their landing on the meteor; when they take off, because the run time is way too long, it's miraculously gone. At one moment everyone is rushing because there's only 7 minutes of radio contact left. Hours later, once the action sequence has passed, radio contact is fine. With that big of a budget, you'd think they could stick a PA or two on continuity.<br/><br/>Speaking of radio contact, why is it that people in space suits can only hear the other people in space suits with whom they're specifically talking only when they're talking to them? Another annoying transmission snafu: there are only a few moments to drop dead time and Bruce Willis (in outer space) has an unimaginative two minute conversation with his daughter (an earthbound Liv Tyler). I guess the 30 second or so delay between transmission and receipt of each line was inconvenient to the story line. And hey, why was there a camera in his suit, but nobody else's?<br/><br/>Of course the special effects are decent. They better be for that much money. Few of the applications are creative, these generally involved crashing meteors. The effects used on the surface of the big kahuna meteor are unconvincing and bland. Digital effects look so obvious now, they seem to have reached their limit in simply awing us by existing, now they need creativity and unusual application.<br/><br/>Bay does try to infuse some style into the shoot. A few cool angles here and there, and generally nice shot composition. Unfortunately he goes AT&T/British Airways commercial in his montages of all the wholesome cultures around the world uniting in fear and prayer on the eve of Armageddon. At some points the dialogue and character plots are so bad, so pre-fab, one can't help but hope for a sign that this is all tongue-in-cheek. Please, just a pinch of irony.

","Being an unrelenting non-stop over-the-top explosive melodrama, this movie is one of the worst action flicks ever produced, and utterly unbelievable in every way. The pace is constantly fever-pitched, and all the action and the actors are gripped by total hysteria. It is nigh unwatchable, and a stain - nay, a blotch - on the careers of everyone involved.<br/><br/>The wildly exaggerated attempt at excitement undermines itself, resulting in a movie where you just go ""Come on!"" all the time. The setting and the events are impossible to take even remotely seriously.

","This movie stunned me. I sat watching it like a slack-jawed idiot, mouth agape, eyes transfixed on this colossal train wreck of a film. It must be the biggest waste of talent in the history of filmaking. The cast (other than Ben Affleck and Michael Clarke Duncan) are decent. Even Bruce Willis can be good once in a while (Pulp Fiction, 12 Monkeys). But, this whole movie is just a big formulaic, predictable, melodramatic turd. How can a movie that was this expensive to make with a massive special effects budget and all these talented actors be SO utterly boring and just plain bad? It is so very, very BAD. It must be the Michael Bay touch. He has to be the worst American director of his generation. He is to America what Uwe Boll is to Retardland or wherever the hell he comes from. I've got a great idea! An action-horror film directed by Bay and Boll! It would star Steven Seagal and Sandra Bullock with Whoopi Goldberg as the comedic relief! It would be based on Grand Theft Auto and Donkey Kong where two hard-nosed cops have to fight off a mutant gorilla that attacks Florida!"

","One of those annoyingly overblown films that is far more popular than it has a right to be, this syrupy rubbish succeeded in stealing much of the thunder of the superior Deep Impact. <br/><br/>Earth is doomed, and only a group of overbearing Yanks can save us. They're a collection of rogues, criminals, perverts and potential psychos, but they can drill holes well so they're our only hope. Cue a collection of hysterical (!) scenes as they're trained to be astronauts, then shot into space to destroy an oncoming asteroid that's the size of Texas.<br/><br/>Bay and Bruckheimer are never names that suggest subtlety or good taste, and true to form after an admittedly impressive opener the movie soon descends into a mess of overly plush special effects and saccharine sentimentality, not least when the doomed inhabitants of Earth gather around their most photogenic national monuments to stare sorrowfully at the sky. No cliché is left unused, no opportunity for a heartfelt dialogue is avoided; these people truly have no shame. <br/><br/>The impressive cast is not even worth mentioning. They rattle off the dialogue as if it was written ten minutes before the cameras started rolling. Buscemi in particular was wasted, and it's a sad day when a Bruce Willis character is not even the slightest bit appealing.<br/><br/>
Quick cuts and confusing camera angles shouldn't be allowed to cover what is essentially shoddy filmmaking. One day the people who make these films successful will realise what they've been doing. I hope they can live with themselves."

","I absolutely hate Armageddon with every fiber of my being. This is probably not the worst movie ever made, but when considering the budget, the number of big stars, and the shameless over-promotion it is dollar-for-dollar the most despicable.<br/><br/>The action is way over the top, it is wholly unrealistic, the characters are not at all interesting, even the special effects can only be marked as sub-par (especially when considering the budget of this film). It's just one lame gag after another. ""Oh my God, I dropped a screw! The entire mission is doomed"" over and over and over again until you find yourself wishing the mission would indeed end in a spectacular fireball just to put the film out of it's own misery!<br/><br/>Unlike it's counterpart Deep Impact, these filmmakers don't even bother to showcase the human element of this story, how the potential end of the world effects society or even the characters involved. It's all about the father who feels like a failure; the girl who pines for her loser boyfriend; and the various psychotic episodes of the rest of the characters. Never do we even get the sense that these people care that the world is about to end. It's this lack of caring about humanity that boils out of the screen: the filmmakers didn't even like their audience. This isn't even a case of a good screenplay idea poorly executed (like Deep Impact), but the writers and filmmakers simply didn't bother to make a good film.<br/><br/>This film will always sit at the top of my Most Hated List."
"Private Ryan-2","1","6","11","8 May 1999"," Great disappointment, horrendous movie.
","I truly don't know where to start listing all the things that are wrong with this flick. I left the theater with a terrible headache, and feeling totally insulted. Does Michael Bay consider his target audience to be 12 year-old kids with attention deficit disorder? I find no other explanation for the long succession of flops that comprise this movie.<br/><br/>The story is weak, the acting is plainly horrendous, the shameless flag-waving is embarrassing, and the many plot-holes make the script look like the surface of the Moon.<br/><br/>I especially had a problem with the ""suspension-of-disbelief"" issue. I understand that when you go see an action film, you need to give some credit to the storyline in order to be able to enjoy it. For example, nobody knows how an alien looks like, or even if there are aliens at all, but we see ""ET"" and it does not bother us; this is so because the story is superbly told. Everyone knows that not everyone can survive a major explosion, but if the story makes sense and it's well told, we suspend our disbelief, give the creators some credit, and enjoy the show.<br/><br/>In ""Armageddon"" the (poorly developed) characters are surviving excrutiating life-threatening situations every two or three minutes. They always scape in the very last second, and most of the time totally unharmed. How trite! Once or twice is fine, but not every three minutes through the entire movie. It's cartoonish, and does nothing but to kill the magic that makes us enjoy movies: suspension of disbelief. How many explosions can they outrun? How many shots or ridiculously unbelievable situations can they scape without harm? Pleeeeeease! Of course, this is a Michael Bay product, so any attempt to analyze it in a logical way is pointless.<br/><br/>I certainly did not enjoy the radical conservative undertones through the movie (blatant bashing of Green Peace, only men take action while the women wait at home and catch the action on the TV screen, etc.), and the constant flag-waving to the point of ridiculous. I'm as patriotic as the next guy, but I don't appreciate flag-waving for the wrong reasons, and this movie has plenty of them! Other nationalities are reduced to plain caricatures of overused stereotypes (I felt like gagging every time they showed muslims praying in-masse, African children running in the jungle and pointing at the sky -like in a Microsoft commercial-, or every time the Russian astronaut from the Mir station opened his mouth -there's so many awful stereotypes one can take in a single movie!). Then, to please the close minded crowd this movie was intended to appeal, the only asteroid that hits the earth destroys Paris, of all places!<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure this movie was a great success among trailer-park dwellers, and Rush Limbaugh listeners nation-wide!"

","This was a very entertaining movie that, yes, was loud and confusing.  But I got what I came for.  Unfortunately, Bruce Willis needs a career makeover because he plays the exact same character in basically every movie he does, except the superior ""Mortal Thoughts.""  The script wasn't Academy Award material, but that's not what it was made for.  It had astonishing special effects and decent performances.  I, particularly, liked Ben Affleck's performance, especially at the ending.  Seeing Ben Affleck cry made me sob like a little bi***, and I'm not afraid to admit it because it really touched.

Even Marlon Brando or Laurence Olivier could not have saved this horrible work. Don't ever watch even if your are paid for that.

Fans of Armageddon keep arguing that a film can be silly or even stupid but still be entertaining.  I agree -- ""The 5th Element"" falls into this category.

"Michael Carruthers","Null","11","25","6 April 2001"," Well-Made, Misunderstood Sci-Fi
","On a rating scale of 0 to 100; I gave Armageddon a score of 74.<br/><br/>If you are making an explanation of the ingredients that an 100/100 film would need, it is best not to use Armageddon's flavours. But, if you are making an explanation of pure entertainment at it's best, then Armageddon is a great example to use. This film opened up to the world as a major blockbuster with Razzie potential from some critics. However, some movie-goer's, like myself, happened to enjoy this film, and as a shooting star of a moneymaker, Armageddon soars high in the universe.<br/><br/>A giant, global-killing asteroid, like the one that killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago is 18 days away from hitting the Earth. NASA's been caught with their pants down and needs a new plan to stop the rock. They enlist the help of Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), an expert deep core driller, to train their astronauts and help them drill into the asteroid and plant a nuclear bomb. But Harry figures the astronauts can't be trained in time and opts to go with his own oil drilling crew.<br/><br/>To get the flaws over and done with, Armageddon is sometimes too far-fetched that it becomes a little bit laughable, and Bruce Willis' character, Harry, is the hero. He isn't likeable one bit, unlike Willis' former heroic gun-aimer's and space travelling characters. But those things are quite minor, and great performances from Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck  especially Tyler, as the beautiful and Earthly young girl who sends her two most important men into sport  make up for Willis' half-effort. Also, a star-studded cast supports the three stars, including the never bad Steve Buscemi, giant Michael Clarke Duncan, the calm Owen Wilson and the weirdly watchable William Fichtner. All these actors play their roles well, and each have more faith in the story than some of the other main stars alone. Michael Bay controls his crew well, and he works excellently with the special effects team to create a stunning view of space, and some awesome blasting sounds that will unnerve you.<br/><br/>Armageddon is not as bad as you may of heard, and even though it isn't Best Picture material, it is still an excellent form of entertainment, a film that is able to mix romance, thrills and full-on adventure nicely and without struggle."

"formala44","1","5","9","26 October 2008"," 5 words: terrible, bad, idiotic, predictable, garbage
","Warning; this comment may contain spoilers.<br/><br/>I wonder why they chose the name Armageddon. They would do this movie more justice by calling it 'The movie where Ben Afleck does a lot of dangerous stuff, survives them and then gets married'. Its also way too predictable and has laughable plot twistings that make you wanna laugh or yawn. Or both. The story is about a big asteroid thats about to crash into the earth and end all life. Willis and Affleck and pals are tasked with saving the earth by blowing it up. Will they be able to manage it? Usually a movie does its best to provide reasonable and believable quests but Armageddon has more seemingly unsurpassable problems than all the Indiana Jones movies together. An asteroid needs to be blown up by oil drillers turned astronauts. Will they be able to make it? A bomb is about to go off with the timer counting down. Will they be able to dismantle it in time? A shuttle crashes into the asteroid, will Ben Affleck survive? The asteroid surface is very hard. Will they be able to drill a hole in it? The space station has a fuel leak and the crew needs to escape. Will they be able to make it? Whilst drilling into the surface a rain of meteorites slams in. Will they be able to survive? Etc, etc, etc, etc. The sheer number of problems makes this story very hard to believe and the endless shouting and mayhem becomes simply irritating.<br/><br/>Then there's the background music. Which is without any fantasy and youl probably could imagine what the scenes where like by just listening to it. dramatic when Afleck and Tyler say goodbye before his voyage. Heroic when he comes back and she flies into his arms. Suspencefull when they have to fight yet another problem. So very predictable.<br/><br/>Then there's the directing and editing. I cant believe anyone thinks highly of Michael Bay. The editing was so fast that at times you simply had no clue what was happening and why. The depiction of a flattened Paris uninspired and not very believable. The carnage in New York too much and grossly overdone not to mention way too long. The movie lacks pace in some parts and has too much in others. This is an important aspect for a director and if he cant understand this the movie is doomed, which it is.<br/><br/>Then there's the acting. The dialogs between Affleck and Willis where awful. The action unconvincing. Affleck does his best to look bored and has a flat display. Willis was not much better. Liv Tyler was not bad but played the - obligatory in these kind of movies - love interest of Affleck with the only purpose in her life twiddling the engagement ring between her fingers. Owen Wilson was like a child so bad. The only actor who got to his usual standards was Buscemi but granted, the dialogs where simply terrible for everybody.<br/><br/>I've seen some bad movies in my life, notably the Seagal or Van Damme movies, but this one really tops everything I've ever came across. After about 10 minutes of watching i predicted the end would be Tyler jumping in Afflecks arms under cheers from onlookers with a hugely heroic music back ground. And duly that happened. Not one moment was a surprise. It wasn't entertaining at all. A black spot on the careers of great actors like Willis and Buscemi. If you wanna waste 140 minutes of your life, then go watch this movie."

","Effectively a remake of the 1978 disaster Meteor, but that film reconstituted through the brain of two overwrought p*ss-artists, namely Jerry Bruckheimer  he who would unleash bangs on us for eternity and his top dollar whore, Michael Bay; not so much a director in the classic sense, more a mechanistic film machine with eyes. In fact if Bay hadn't been seen in public it would be easy enough to believe that his name was a synonym for a directing computer developed by Industrial Light & Magic; programmed to replicate the moves of great helmers like Stanley Kubrick and, er, Paul Anderson but lacking the human capacity for feeling that made those men such warm, intimate filmmakers. But Bay is a man and one with the worst directorial style ever known to 110 years of cinema patrons. His technique, if you're interested, involves substituting movement for drama, music video gloss for decent cinematography, incident for story and ciphers for characters. His co-conspirators, his editor and his composer, give their contractual all to ensuring that every one of his synthetically stylish shots are given at least 2 seconds of screen time and each bang, cant and crane-assisted close-up are accompanied by plenty of plastic pathos.<br/><br/>""I don't want to close my eyes, I don't want to fall asleep"" sang Aerosmith's Steve Tyler in the hilariously titled tie-in single ""I don't want to miss a thing"" but you did, you did and you did. With an average shot length of just 0.4 seconds, your ability to watch Armageddon is a lottery based on your pattern of blinking. This is deliberate so that having only registered about 45 minutes of screen time in a single sitting, an audience would be forced to watch it several times. This is genius of course but that aside, this confected cacophonic jingoistic man meat has all the real entertainment value of a Vegetarian Sunday lunchwith no wine. NASA gets a lot of free advertising in this one but they'd have come off better if they'd released the Challenger Disaster looped, into cinemas.<br/><br/>You can gain some fun from Armageddon though  play the drinking game. Take a shot of something really disgusting every time God is mentioned. You'll be dead about half an hour before the end, meaning you'll miss the climatic funeral scene AND the infamous ""he's got space dementia!"" line. How's that for two good reasons?"

","The only reason I give this above the lowest vote possible is because somehow I sat through this load of junk.<br/><br/>Ludicrous story and bad acting pervade the whole movie.

Not sure who gets the prize for the worst actor. Either Bruce Willis for his conceit and smugness or the actress playing his daughter who is a total annoyance throughout. Indeed every actor and actress in the picture is exceedingly irritating. The film makers may think there is something funny about low life people being astronauts, but count me out on that one.<br/><br/>Seems to me a lot of money wasted on some half decent special effects; its a pity nobody bothered to make anything else in the film worthwhile as most of the movie is pathetically poor, hence:<br/><br/>2/10"

","Well, for those who thought 'Deep Impact' was lacking in essential cinematic quality; here's 'Armageddon' to trump their disappointment.<br/><br/>This movie is not just bad; it's so expensively bad that it beggars belief. I really don't know where to begin, so I won't try. Those who gave it less than 3 stars saw it for what it was. Those who gave it more (and - yes - I know where you live) are in desperate need of an intellectual enema.<br/><br/>Which leaves me to ask these questions. Why couldn't Hollywood make an asteroid collision movie that would answer to an IQ above 100? How is it that an industry that can serve-up blinding science-fiction thrillers like 'Aliens' and 'The Thing', as well as thoroughly enjoyable fantasy romps like 'Star Wars' can also dish-out such preposterous tripe as 'Armageddon'? It's a paradox. And for me it's insoluble.<br/><br/>Don't waste time or money. This is the sort of space debris that is becoming an increasing hazard to satellites.<br/><br/>I cannot disavow it enough."

","Imagine the worst pain and suffering ever. That's how it's gonna feel at the end of the world. Coincidentally, you can feel that exact same pain and suffering by watching Michael Bay's Armageddon. <br/><br/>Armageddon is a painful exercise in squeezing every clichÃ© possible into 150 minutes of swooping camera moves, slomo shots of blond American farm kids, nauseous flag-waving and the movie's heroes walking abreast towards the camera, with smoke billowing in the background in slow motion. At least twenty times.<br/><br/>Armageddon is also about an asteroid (""the size of Texas"") on a collision course with Earth, which only Bruce Willis' team of oil-drillers can destroy, able to perform the requisite deep-core planting of a nuclear device on the asteroid to blow it up. You can't train actual astronauts to do technical stuff like that, no way.<br/><br/>While a slightly perverted subplot revolves around Ben Affleck pursuing Willis' daughter, Liv Tyler, a cavalcade of B-stars makes A-holes of themselves in the middle background: Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan, William Fichtner, Will Patton, Owen Wilson, and trusty Chris Ellis (Deke Slayton in APOLLO 13, and forever cast as Some Guy In Mission Control in all these space films).<br/><br/>A movie with less science than STAR WARS (if that's even possible), less physics than MOONRAKER (which had none), less credible operating procedures than CAPRICORN ONE (which faked them), and less street cred than DEEP IMPACT (which preceded this film by two months). And - of course - ripping off Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov so bluntly and banally, the filmmakers should be roasted over an open spit when they make that big science fiction convention in the sky which Clarke and Asimov preside over.<br/><br/>Only one example of the thousands upon thousands of uneducated scenes should convince a viewer what an eye-candy fool's joke Armageddon is: two space shuttles are launched simultaneously - okay, fine - but fifty feet apart? Just seeing them attain low Earth orbit together and jettisoning their Solid Rocket Boosters should give even the most ""unscientific"" bananahead (i.e. the filmmakers) an idea of why this was such a monkeybrain scene - the SRB's are ejected via explosives which propel them away from each vehicle - into the flight path of any other vehicles in their vicinity. Of course, in the film, tragedy is averted by making the CGI SRB's jettison AWAY from the path of the following shuttle. But anyone with common sense will look at this scene and realize what a brainless berk Michael Bay and his writers are for allowing it on screen.<br/><br/>CAPRICORN ONE was an uneducated mess, but space movies made before the 90's at least had True Ignorance on their side. The general public only knew so much about orbital mechanics and physics laws. Now there is NO EXCUSE for movies to treat outer space like a thrill ride at Six Flags. We've all seen footage of actual space shuttles in space - so how can Michael Bay's shuttles fly around as if they're in an atmosphere, following NO orbital mechanics, trajectories, or laws of physics. Why is there sound in space? Shouldn't these people have their glare-shields down on EVA in sunlight? We know all this via the very technology these movies flaunt, yet pretend to ignore, in order to serve the asinine plot.<br/><br/>Everyone in space shouting at each other like they're actors doing something really hard and important - even though they've all got headset radios; everyone extolling information which should have been imparted in training (""you're about to hit minimal gravity, so you might get nauseous"" - thanks for telling me TWO SECONDS before I hit minimal gravity!); non-sequitur action, like Buscemi picking up a machine gun and firing arbitrarily, simply to cause concern for the characters (which I lost as soon as they started signing Leaving on a Jet Plane like the Oil Riggers Men's Choir), rationalized as ""space sickness."" THIS MOVIE is space sickness.<br/><br/>Every scene an epic moment waiting to happen, like Liv Tyler with her hand on a monitor after tearful goodbye to her father in space; camera pulls back and every single monitor in NASA is showing that same transmission - not like they have anything IMPORTANT to monitor, like the incoming space shuttle with a thousand malfunctions represented by all the movie sparks comin' off the consoles. And if the epic shot doesn't happen, Michael Bay jumps on his Chapman crane and MAKES it happen, annoying inspirational music padding the whole exercise.<br/><br/>Best line is when William Fichtner describes the other crashed shuttle as being ""off the grid"" and Buscemi retorts, ""Off the grid?! What're you, a freakin' cyborg?!"" One redeeming factor of Armageddon is that it actually delineates what a ""hero"" is - for this society which tags foopball hooligans and people jumping out of buildings and army grunts doing their jobs as ""heroes."" Bruce Willis stays behind to detonate the nuclear bomb. He is a hero because HE HAD THE OPTION NOT TO.<br/><br/>The two halves of the asteroid ""miss the Earth by 400 miles"" and around the globe everyone cheers, Chapman crane swooshing in ecstasy, blond American farm kids hugging their parents in slomo - with everyone once again ignoring the physics law that puts those pieces (each half the size of Texas, mind you) in orbit around Earth (unless they're pulled out of orbit by another celestial body), which means, in Earth's future, another flyby, another potential collision...<br/><br/>Let's hope next time that ignorant human species is wiped out."

","Armageddon is a great film. It is one of the best in its genre. My favourite Michael Bay film used to be Pearl Harbour, but not anymore. Basically, an asteroid is heading for Earth and it's up to about 8 or 9 ordinary people to go into space, drill a hole in the asteroid, plant a bomb and hopefully save the world. The chance of a bunch of ordinary people being asked to complete such a dangerous task is unlikely, but who cares? The CGI could not be better, the casting is superb and there is just the right amount of comedy without making it silly. At times it does get too Star Wars-ish but the rest is very realistic. It is a superb film. I really don't know why it has had such bad reviews.<br/><br/>Deep Impact has the same premise but in that film it was like a stone was going to hit the Earth.<br/><br/>It is no where near as good as Armageddon.

","Okay, first of all, I would like to say that everyone who called this movie horrible, stupid and even OFFENSIVE, is completely on some type of cheap chemicals. Seriously? How can you honestly say that this movie was horrible? The acting wasn't completely amazing but, this isn't an Oscar winning movie over here! It's just a movie! It still shocks me to see people have expectations of a movie before they see it. How will you ever enjoy a movie if you are constantly having high expectations of it? Can't people just sit back and enjoy it? I really like this movie despite all of its bad reviews because unlike some people who actually let these reviews take over their own opinions, I like to just watch it and see what happens. personally, I think it is one of the better movies of the 90s. this movie has everything! its an action/drama/romantic/sci-fi/comedy movie for goodness sake! for those of you who said that the movie is completely over the top and unrealistic, then maybe you should look up this term: SCI-FI!!! that means ""Science FICTION"". okay, boys and girls? FICTON means NOT REAL!!! Come on people! please tell me if someone hasn't cried when Bruce Willis told his daughter that he has to break his promise...he's not coming back home. I NEVER cry during movies and this is the only movie that actually brought me to tears. But don't think i'm a daddy's girl because that's far from the point. for those of you who love your fathers or even lost them at some point in your life, then this movie will definitely break your heart especially when he says that he wishes that he could walk her down the aisle...but he can't. the guy dies trying to save the world!!! god forbid if an asteroid hits this earth, we'd all be screwed due to these pretty pathetic viewers. why don't you try risking your life by trying to save humanity and then tell me you're not a hero. anyways, Steve Buscemi just made me fall off my chair laughing and the movie is just amazing. The action is great, story line is great, and even the over the top science facts are incredible. these people seriously have an awesome imagination and everyone who said this movie is bad...well...then you guys just have a crappy sense of humor, no heart what so ever, and you guys are just pathetically boring. this movie is really sad and I loved it...I think i'm gonna go watch it right now."

","Dollar for dollar I think this is one of the worst movies to come out in a long time. Each line of dialogue from Bruce Willis' character is more macho then the last. Each problem the space crew runs into is supposed to create tension and after a certain point, it created laughter in the audience I saw the movie with. The beautiful cut away shots of the events on earth kept popping up and it reminded me more of a Visa commercial than a plot device. There's a lot of characters in this movie that really don't seem to have a whole lot to do,including Steve Buscemi, which is unfortunate. Bruckheimer films aren't surprising they follow a well known formula and I have to say I've seen most of his films. Armageddon was the first one I almost walked out on.

A good movie is one when you forget you in a movie theatre and and you forget you are sitting in uncomfortable seat all that you are aware of is that a character is going through a stressful, happy, painful or confusing time in there life and you are right there going through it with them.

But the problem solving team of grunts continually manage to solve each problem and encounter the new one every five to ten minutes.

","Well, Hollywood schlock-meister Jerry Bruckheimer has done it again with ""Armageddon"", another over-blown, overly-idiotic pile of cow flops.  This time he would have us believe that only macho roughneck Bruce Willis & his cadre of simple-minded, slovenly oil riggers are all that stand between us and a loud, fx-ladden end of the world. What plot there is involves Willis & his goons REPLACING NASA ASTRONAUTS (who were all ""un-cool"")to fly space shuttles to land on a meteor that's headed to earth, drill into it, and detonate a nuclear warhead.  Oh, and get home in time to save the soppy, needless romance between an obnoxious Ben Affleck(""Mall Rats"") & a pouty Liv Tyler(aging hair-rocker Steve Tyler's talentless daughter).  All of this is crammed together with moore unnecessary explosions, moore shameless flag-waving, and moore cheesy, embarassing Aerosmith tunes than I thought was humanly possibe.  This laughable, moronic plot is so wafer-thin it makes Kate Moss look like 350 lbs of buttered lard.  :=8P  All the characters are vague, non-dimentional cliches spouting incredulous, lousy dialogue: they are about as rich and alive as a rotting mollusk(which might explain the film's vivid scent...).  The only actor able to breathe any kind of life into their pitiful roles is Bruce Willis, whose performance ranges from smarmy, self-affecting smugness to over-the-top, unintentionally hilarious. No one else even registers, especially the vaccuous Tyler.  Of course, we're all really here for the eye-candy, right??  Who cares about rich characters, engaging dialogue, or a compelling plot, when Hollybore gives us Shiny Thing Go Boom?  Well, Bruckheimer gives us Shiny Thing Go Boom ad nauseum.  Many things in ""Armageddon"" blow up for no udder reason that to squeeze in one moore explosion to up the ""Ooh-Ahh"" quotient.  For example, there's one obvious, needless plot device involving a drunk Russian(ooh that's original) & a space platform which blows up just so we can see it blow up.  Aside from the overwhelming noise and amount of explosions, the fx were pretty poor - just exactly how does a multi-billion dollar piece of precision engineering, which is grounded when 1 tile falls off in reality, fly through a hail storm of meteor debris?  The MooCow has not seen such shameless, jingoistic flag-waving since ""Red Dawn"", during the Evil Red Empire-Reagan days.  The film's message is blatant: America is #1, all other countries should bow down before us & pray that we save their worthless butts.  It's hard to believe that such an ""ugly American"" film would go over well in udder countries.  The cheesy, vomit-inducing Aerosmith moosic is a constant irritant, and a lame attempt to curry favor with teens by connecting her with her famous father's hopelessly over-rated band. Overall, this cow hasn't seen such a high-priced, over-blown cow flop since ""Independence Day"" or ""Men in Black"", and this film is even worse.

"StevePulaski","1","5","10","6 June 2013"," The only film I can think of that should come with an Ibuprofen and a watch with a purchase of the DVD
","I regard the quality of Michael Bay's Armageddon with great sorrow but regard its enormous box office revenue with an even greater amount of depression. Has the magic of cinema been reduced to utter mindlessness that is devoid of content, meaning, and substance? You could defend the film by saying it's a ""turn your brain off"" film, but what kind of compliment or defense is to that a film? That's like saying it's a requirement to be stupid before watching it in order to enjoy the picture simply on an entertainment level.<br/><br/>Armageddon doesn't deserve that defense or any others. It's a terrible picture but in many ways does it embody everything that is wrong with American cinema as a whole. Racism, contrived emotions, overblown instances of peril, noisy, muddled sequences, hammy relationships, stupid characters, and patriotic, flag-waving nonsense thrown in for good measure. You look at a picture like this and wonder why we look like a slew of amateurs in terms of tonality and originality when compared with other world cinemas.<br/><br/>The story concerns the fact that an asteroid the size of Texas is on its way to earth, and NASA scientist Dan Truman (Billy-Bob Thornton) has a plan to bury a nuclear device deep inside the asteroid that will break the asteroid into two separate chunks and miss earth. You'd need Bill O'Reilly, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, and a slew of other journalists and astrophysicists to explain that kind of certainty. Desperate to find those that could pull off an operation like this successfully, NASA contacts Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), one of the best deep-sea oil driller in the world, for advice and assistance in staging the operation. Harry, however, has his own problems like keeping his adult-daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) away from her new boyfriend, who happens to be A.J. Frost (Ben Affleck), one of Harry's younger, more irresponsible drillers.<br/><br/>Long-story short, he chooses to accept the mission and takes his crew of utter misfits along with him to assist him in these efforts. Among them is the overly-sensitive and sometimes violent Michael Clarke Duncan, the insane Steve Buscemi, the sophisticated prodigy Owen Wilson, the irresponsible A.J., and others. I don't care how desperate NASA would be in this certain time and I don't care how willing and confident Harry and his crew would be, nobody would send this crew into space under any given circumstance. The thought is truly baffling that the fate of the U.S. essentially rests in a man's crew who can't solve a simple problem without shouting or arguing.<br/><br/>But leave logic at the door, since that's what we're supposed to do and look at the film's aesthetics, content, and quality. This is an incredibly boring picture, disgustingly overlong, horrendously underwritten and underdeveloped, and unspeakably redundant. By the umpteenth explosion around the fifty minutes mark, I was ready to wave the white flag. How loud does a popcorn movie have to be before we get the point? How screamingly obvious does every explosion need to be that it had the mass, density, and magnitude to level buildings, burn infrastructures, and send the camera spiraling into a dizzying frenzy? Michael Bay knows how to make every scene into a spectacle, which is why he has garnered praise and criticism. Some can appreciate it craft as a valuable addition into cinema. I see it as an emphasis on fast food filmmaking, or in other words, filmmaking that has the power to make us demand less story-wise but crave everything action-wise. I'd call these films dangerous to the public because it stops the desire and hunger for creativity and encourages settling on the bare fundamentals of film. In a culture already so easily amused by reality TV and sheer stupidity, it is films like Armageddon we need to uniformly ignore.<br/><br/>And if it weren't the explosions being the driving-force the film's badness, it's the abundance of music and emotion to manipulate and tell you exactly how you're supposed to react and feel towards every setup in the film. Between the soundtrack of Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, and Journey giving us the exact feeling we're supposed to possess and the incidents that practically flash what mood we're supposed to feel on the screen, Armageddon offers no room even for audience reactions outside of the norm. If you ever wanted to watch a film and want to be in touch with the mood of the film so much so that you don't even want to process the information being shown to you than this is for you.<br/><br/>Armageddon, despite featuring one-hundred and fifty minutes of sensory annihilation in the way of sound and visuals, is one of the most boring films I've seen in years. Inert, lackadaisical, overblown, and lacking in creativity and interpretation, it has gone on to be embraced only by those who could stomach such a degrading endeavor. This is the only film I can think of that should come with an Ibuprofen and a watch with a purchase of the DVD.<br/><br/>Starring: Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan, Will Patton, and Keith David. Directed by: Michael Bay."

","Armageddon was my number one favorite film with a bullet, when I was a little boy. It was the most spectacular film I'd ever seen and it still is one of the most spectacular to ever come out. Is it a masterpiece? Yes and no. You can't compare it with mind-enriching pieces of cinematic art like Fight Club or Requiem For A Dream but it does stand out in the, relatively mindless, action genre. It does everything what an action film is required to do and more. And therefore it's an action masterpiece. It's also Michael Bay's best, though Bad Boy is my favorite Bay movie.<br/><br/>Armageddon gives you the two-hour adrenaline rush that you wanted when walking into the theater to go see an action flick. The acting and script is definitely extraordinary for an action movie. Okay, it's not excellent but it's better than 75% of all action movies that come out, even to this day. Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi in particular did a great job and this movie wouldn't have been the same without them.<br/><br/>I'm not going to reveal anything about the plot since I don't want to include any spoilers in my comment.

Deep Impact. I have noticed people saying that the movie is art because it made $600 million dollars at the box office which is like saying Jenna Jameson is an artist because she's the most popular porn actress of all time. This movie IS garbage, popular garbage but garbage nonetheless, see Deep Impact. <br/><br/>Okay, Bruce Willis is an oilman who hates the idea of not having to drill for oil, so much so, that when protesters come near him, complaining about oil spills and environmental disaster, he drives golf balls at them and we all know that it doesn't hurt to get hit with a golf ball and you can't possibly be killed by it so, of course, it's funny.<br/><br/>Ben Afleck CANNOT act!!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>Once upon a time, JOHN DENVER wrote a song called ""Leaving on a Jet Plane"", which made sense with his line ""When I come back, I'll bring your wedding ring,"" implying that upon return he will drop to one knee and propose to his beloved, there is a reproduced track of the same song with the same line performed by a femalic moron for this movie in which, rather than augment the line to ""I'll WEAR your wedding ring"", she keeps it the same, to suggest that she'll kneel down before her betrothed and demand a marriage now!<br/><br/>If, no matter what, the guys are going to space, no chance in Hell they're not, what's the point of the psychological imbalance testing? <br/><br/>How does Steve Buschemi get the sunglasses on inside his helmet?<br/><br/>Where did Steve Buschemi get the high tech jeweler's eyepiece?<br/><br/>We call him Hound Dog because he's horny. I do not know anyone who equates HORNY with HOUND DOG. The following comes into my mind upon hearing hound dog: Elvis, The Baskervilles, loud and raucus, blood hound, etc. but NOT horny. What does that mean to imply?<br/><br/>How did NASA get a report on the total makeup of the planetoid(not asteroid) without sending off a probe and, if the thing is rotating erratically, how are they able to ensure any kind of sensible landing at all?<br/><br/>Why is the planetoid shedding so much stuff? It is assumable that it has been travelling billions of miles and I think its own gravity and other radical objects in space would have worn it down to a hunk of fairly smooth and slightly cratered planetary material.<br/><br/>What does, ""the size of Texas"" mean?<br/><br/>How does an atom bomb, less than a thousand feet into a planetoid, assumedly, as far across in every dimension as Texas, split the planetoid in half? How does the planetoid split from the 'front'(the end nearest Earth) when our team of heroes are working at its side?<br/><br/>I'm sure it was fun to make, just toss off a bunch of prescripted catch-lines and get millions of dollars, but it is just so I.Q. diminishing to watch.<br/><br/>Why do they specifically need Bruce Willis's drill design to cut through rock? Nasa has microwave matter splitters, for heaven's sake.<br/><br/>Why do they need a team of oil workers to operate a drill?<br/><br/>Why can't a NASA physicist put together a drill designed by an idiot?<br/><br/>Why can't a NASA physicist understand how a solar sail works and why would he roll his eyes at the movies most sensible idea?<br/><br/>What the hell does getting a ""C"" average in astrophysics have to do with anything??<br/><br/>THIS IS cinematic garbage!

","One of the most ironic scenes in ""Armageddon"" is when a dog starts tearing at a ""Godzilla"" doll. True, everyone hated the American version of ""Godzilla"" (released a month and a half before ""Armageddon""), but that scene almost implied that ""Armageddon"" was going to be totally different from the former. Well, guess what? IT WASN'T ANY DIFFERENT!!!!!!! It was just another ""Independence Day"": kick-ass Americans risk their own lives to save the world, with the help of excessive CGI. ""Deep Impact"", released two months before ""Armageddon"" and also about a space object on a collision course with earth, actually had a plot - but let's face it: considering that this movie starred Bruce Willis, should we have really expected a plot? At the end of summer, 1998, Rolling Stone magazine declared this movie the ""dumbest scum-sucking corporate product""; I couldn't have said it better myself.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, they're all doing their best, but there's nothing to work with. Steve Buscemi is actually the coolest person in the movie (well, duh). They could have done without that whole thing between Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler. If the movie has any redeeming qualities, it's that it gave Owen Wilson and Michael Clarke Duncan early roles. Also starring Billy Bob Thornton and Peter Stormare.<br/><br/>Yes, it was depressing that this awfulness had to appear on the silver screen, but hope is not lost: director Michael Bay followed it up with ""Pearl Harbor"", which proved to be a real embarrassment for him and everyone involved in it. Sometimes, I wish that an asteroid would crash down on the people who make these kinds of movies."

","When several eastern seaboard cities are struck by small meteorites causing significant damage and loss of life the Government look further into space to find a bigger meteorite the size of Texas heading for Earth.  The meteorite will destroy the earth, wiping out all life.  Oil rig owner Harry Stamper and his crew are employed by NASA to join the elite programme put together to destroy the meteorite.  The plan is to drill 800ft into the rock, plant a nuclear device causing the meteorite to split in two, with both pieces missing the Earth.  The team face a huge amount of challenges on the way to their goal.<br/><br/>In the summer of two ""danger from space"" meteor movies (Deep Impact being the other), this was the less thoughtful but the more enjoyable.  This is very much an action movie, from the first time we see Stamper chasing an employee round an oil rig with a shotgun, we know that we're not in for a thoughtful, reflective film.  Instead this is all about spectacle - New York is destroyed - in fact everything is destroyed!  The training section of the film is funny but again it is all OTT.  The rest of the film is all about action without reason.  For example the team stops at a USSR space station to refuel and blow it up accidentally - that's the way it works, everything they touch explodes.<br/><br/>This gets a little tiring after a while and I got to the point where I was almost numb to the action onscreen.  The only breaks from the explosions are scenes of soppy sentiment that don't really work.  In all it never really gets anywhere near a clever film however it's still quite enjoyable in a summer blockbuster kind of way.<br/><br/>The cast is superb!  They all play it with their tongue in cheek so they all seem to be having fun.  Willis is good, but his character is stupid and poorly developed.  Thornton, Patton, Buscemi, Wilson, Duncan and Stormare all add class and are good despite the material.  However Affleck and Tyler are both poor, he must be the heroic romantic man and he clearly can't do it (not his fault, his character is far too serious for this) while Tyler is forced to do all the emotional wailing and crying (again not suited to the dumb action stuff).  I could easily have done without both of them to make a better film.<br/><br/>Overall, this isn't Shakespeare - it's a dumb action film.  It's constant explosions and stupid action scenes get a bit tiring but it's all packaged together in such a slick way that it's difficult not to enjoy it."

","Two movies: ""the fifth element"", ""armageddon"". The same subject: to save the world. The same main actor: Bruce Willis. One difference: ""Armageddon"" is very inferior to Luc Besson's film. Some spectacular special effects don't succeed in hiding a labored and globally conventional screenplay. Several parts of the movie are showing it. I think about the president's speech and especially Willis' relationship with his daughter, ""Grace"". At the beginning of the movie, he tends to neglect and overprotect her and this makes her weary. Then, at the end of the movie, it's true love and understanding that shine in him. On another hand, the movie falls in the following trap: Michael Bay takes his subject too seriously. Of course, the movie tries to be funny but the result doesn't work as the humor introduced in the movie is often crude and pretty low-level whereas in the ""fifth element"", the humor was zany, involuntary and enabled to overlook the serious side of the action. The movie suffers from two other handicaps: it often falls into the ridiculous (the Russian astronaut) and almost all the actors are bad used. Bruce Willis is all the contrary of his ""fifth element""'s character. He plays the he-man, he hams it up and sometimes, he's unbearable. The other actors are barely credible in their own roles, particularly, Willis' sinking crew. It seems that this crew is here just for having fun. One of them is taken for being very qualified but he looks like a fool. And poor Liv Tyler! She's at the NASA just to be decorative.<br/><br/>When the movie was released in France in August 1998, Bruce Willis expressed is weariness of saving the world. His weariness was probably justified by this spectacular but poor movie."

","I just re-watched this over Thanksgiving weekend and I was blown away by the absurdity of it all. The premise itself is possible enough. A giant meteor could be on its way to crash into us, since it happened to the dinosaurs. I can also go with the idea that we want the best drillers to handle the drilling. Actually, sending the rag-tag group of skilled non-astronauts was the most plausible part, so I didn't have a problem with that idea. Perhaps a nuclear warhead could split a meteor. It's hard to say. Then I started thinking about the absurd things. There were so many absurd things in this movie, I have to list a few. 1) Having two new shuttles ready for launch 2) Launching and training in less than 20 days 2) Having some absolutely amazing monster trucks with multiple drills ready to go in 20 days. 3) Having nuclear weapons ready to go. 4) Actually thinking it would work to land on a rocky asteroid with a shuttle at all!!!!!!!!!! I guess they thought putting jet skis on instead of wheels would do the trick. 5) Landing a shuttle in zero atmosphere. The shuttle just falls like a rock and is barely a glider, but it does need air to keep level. 6) Since the space station blew up during fueling, how did the shuttle get fuel to finish the mission? I could go on and on and on. All of these thing being said, they still made this movie. I give one star for Bruce Willis. He does have star quality and he's enjoyable to watch. I'll give one star for Liv Tyler. Her role in this movie was to look amazing. She played that part well. I'll give one more star for the song. Liv's dad sung one of my favorite tracks.<br/><br/>It was surreal to see the twin towers in New York still standing, and then to see a meteor shower damage them. When buildings started coming down in New York, I couldn't help think about 911 and my mood changed from watching entertainment to remembering reality. That part was very real to me, but the rest of the movie was just totally BS. I do hope we have a better plan for such things if we do find a meteor out there one day."

","What would happen if our planet were suddenly threatened by the imminent collapse with an asteroid? Was humanity prepared to stop it or destroy it? This disaster film talks about it. Directed by Michael Bay, it has a screenplay by Jonathan Hensleigh, J.J. Abrams and other contributors, and has Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler in the lead roles.<br/><br/>We are facing one of the most famous disaster films made by the American film industry, a machine that is always ready to find new ways to destroy the planet. But in this film which was more damaged was the movie itself! Let's begin by the actors: Willis is excellent in action movies and is always ready to save the day since ""Die Hard"". His interpretation is good and the same can be said of most of the actors. But the script could have been much better. The idea of ​​using a nuclear bomb to split an asteroid and alter it's trajectory is simply not realistic or plausible enough since that bombs aren't stronger enough to do that. Even less plausible is the idea of ​​equipping amateurs, without any training or some previous trip to space, with multi-million dollar equipment and use them as a last hope of Humanity. This is a joke that only some minds in Hollywood could imagine and an attack against the intelligence of any viewer who has a minimum of logical sense. The illogical disaster that this film is, however, turns out to be softened by the love story between A.J. and Grace, moving like any other where the lovers are separated against their will. Some of the film's scenes are mere U.S. propaganda: the asteroid pieces have reached all except the U.S. (was that a minor problem?), who saves the day as usual, with great waves of American patriotism. The Russian space station, old and obsolete as a museum, is destroyed in the process, as well as it's single cosmonaut, who seems constantly drenched in vodka and has an absurd accent in an insulting stereotype to the Russians. Is this a remnant of the rivalry between the two countries?<br/><br/>While Bruce Willis is the great hero of this film, this is a film that was destroyed by two asteroids: the lack of logic of it's script and story and the American desire to do patriotic propaganda. ""We saved the world. Russia, France and China may have gone to hell but the rest is fine thanks to us"". Hollywood still didn't understand that the U.S.A. can be rich but they aren't the policemen of the world."

Ben Affleck is so bad that he has the ability to single-handedly ruin a movie. Although he wasn't even the worst part about this. I have a sneaking suspicion that NASA isn't going to leave the fate of the world into a bunch of nobodies after about a minute of training. Bruce Willis is wooden, as usual, Liv Tyler's acting is hilarious and Ben Affleck, well, he was Ben Affleck. Steve Bushemi, who I normally like, was annoying, but I blame that on the writers. That scene with Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler and the animal crackers was easily one of the most embarrassing in the history of film. ""Deep Impact"" has some similar clichés in it. The goodbyes at the end, the astronauts sacrificing themselves, etc., but it was still mildly entertaining. This movie was just an embarrassment. Liv Tyler trying to act sad at the end actually made me feel bad for her, because if it was me acting that badly, and I went back and watched, I wouldn't want to go on living. Probably the worst part of it was that Aerosmith song that makes me want to shove knitting needles in my ears to end the torment.

","May be spoilers<br/><br/>I think people become delusional after they have seen a film one to many times. How this film rates a 5.8 on the IMDb is beyond me. Armageddon was probably the best summer film in 98 and it holds that lofty opinion in my mind because it was as entertaining as they come. Jerry Bruckheimer has been making hits since the 80's when he gave us Beverly Hills Cop and he just keeps churning them out. <br/><br/>When an asteroid is about to hit Earth, NASA calls on the best deep core drilling team in the world. This is comprised of Harry Stamper, Bear, Rockhound, AJ, Max and Chick and a few others that die early in the film. But what we have here is a colorful assortment of characters. But what these colorful assortment of characters bring to the table is perhaps what makes this film a few notches better than many other films that are similar to it, either with an asteroid plot or as a disaster film. Armageddon is head and shoulders above similar offerings like Deep Impact and the much inferior Canadian film, Last Night.<br/><br/>I think the writers of this film deserve much of the credit for writing some very emotionally galvanized scenes that range from global despair, young love, family love, love lost that may rekindle and plenty of humour. Much of the humour is provided by two actors that have really come into their own since doing this film. Those actors are Steve Buscemi and Michael Clarke Duncan. Buscemi was quite famous before this film but his impeccable timing and perfect delivery of lines like, ""Yea, I've seen this one. Isn't this when the coyote sat his ass down in the ACME rocket and chased the coyote? No really, isn't it? Because it didn't turn out too good for the coyote."" And ""Isn't it nice to know that if the space program fails, you'll always have a job at Helga's house of pain?"" And Bear is played perfectly by Duncan. His best scenes are when he shows his vulnerability. Duncan is a massive man, about 6'5 and over 300 pounds so when you see him crying and asking for hugs, it accomplishes perfectly what the writers and director were aiming for. There are many seemingly flawless scenes in this film and sandwiched somewhere in between the humour and the action are some very powerful scenes with Harry and his daughter Grace and even with Chick and his former wife and son that doesn't know him. Bruckheimer and Bay wisely included a wide palette of emotions to keep everyone interested and it worked as Armageddon grossed about 500 million dollars on a world wide scale.<br/><br/>Armageddon is a perfect summer film and it is one worth owning. Every once in a while throw the film into your VCR or DVD player and sit back and be entertained. There are few films that are better at pure entertainment. This is a grand movie on the scale of a Titanic. It is not quite as good as the sinking ship saga but it is certainly not as bad as many asinine critics will have you believe. There is enough action to please those from the Raiders of the Lost school, enough comedy to accommodate those from the Beverly Hills Cop school and enough romance and tear jerking situations to please those from the Pretty Woman school. There is really very little wrong with this film and if you haven't seen it, you have no idea what you are missing.<br/><br/>9.5 out of 10-- The best summer film of 98!"
"RianTurran","10","3","5","30 June 2001"," What are you all crying about?
","I've seen this movie over and over and I think that it was a great film. Is the plot believeable? Of course not! Is that why you watch movies? Because they make you believe? Because they ""inspire"" you? Please! I loved the humor of the movie and how it pokes fun at the hierarchy of our society. As far as plot is concerned, did anyone watch the movie? Did anyone else realize that the whole plot, although cliched, was to save the world from destruction? It was a MOVIE!!! Not a freaking science journal or history manual. Movies take us on a ride, which is what ""Armageddon"" did. The events would never happen, but that's what I like about it. It's FICTION!!! And I LOVE IT!!!"

Its a funny, exciting testosterone fest.   All lot of critics panned this movie but they are pleasantly invited to caress certain parts of my anatomy with their tongue.  To me this critics have just forgot what its like to have fun and be entertained at the movies.  This is pure escapism at its finest.  In my opinon this was the second best movie of the year.

I wish I had, because just the thought of this movie's weak, insipid ending still makes me sick to my stomach.  The only good part of this movie is that you get a chance to laugh at the screenwriter's ""knowledge"" of space and physics.  I especially liked how there was wind on the asteroid, that's classic.  Oh and the space shuttles are good too.  I don't understand why people feel the need to stick up for this movie.  I am not bothered by ""brainless"" movies at all, but this one is just way too much.  It's not brainless in a fun way, it's just flat out insulting to humanity.  You can tell the people who made this movie really look down their noses at the viewing public.

They send half a dozen idiotic, egotistical oil drilling maniacs to save the world.  With NO backup plan, NO creative thinking and NO story.  The only story was of course Liv Tylers and Ben Affleck's little love, but oh kazoo.....While the team is in space they give Liv her own little room with 15 TVs to weep over and man this movie sucked hard.

","Wow, what an EXPLOSIVE movie.  This movie was everything I expected it to be: action packed and plot deprived.  There wasn't a very interesting plot to the movie, as it just tells the story about a bunch of oil drillers trying to save the world.  That's the basic plot in a nutshell, and it is quite far fetched if not utterly stupid.  Armageddon makes up for it's lack of plot with it's explosive special effects and action sequences.  This movie provides large doses of suspense and adrenaline leaving the audience breathless or dizzy.  Some of the scenes happen so fast that it's hard to tell what's going on, and vomiting seems like an inevitability.  If action is your thing, and you really want to see things get blown to hell, this movie is your thing.  You will see New York get pummeled by a barrage of meteorites, and beautiful Paris disintegrate before your eyes.  However, if you're looking for a movie with a decent plot and some interesting characters, look elsewhere.  You'll just sit through the movie wishing you brought aspirin.

"groggo","1","4","8","10 July 2007"," Bay is a Schlockmeister
","Dogme 95, with some exceptions, hasn't been a smashing success, but it's not hard to see how it developed, why Danish directors Lars von Trier, Thomas Winterberg and others waged open revolt over the theatre of the stupid that Michael Bay and too many other Hollywood schlockmeisters have been specializing in for far too long.<br/><br/>I read in a Toronto newspaper a few weeks ago that the wildly deluded Bay considers himself an 'artist'. It was an amazing thing to say, and underlined how far his ego has been insulated from reality in that California dreamland from which he produces his consistently dreadful exercises in self-absorption. This guy specializes in ear-splitingly loud and obnoxious movies and promotes them with ear-splitingly loud and obnoxious comments, and then carries on, hopelessly oblivious to his legion of naysayers.<br/><br/>If a cinematic 'artist' is defined by box-office receipts, by super-aggressive global marketing, Bay and his computer artists are Michelangelos. He makes mountains of dough, which might explain why actors want to work with him. <br/><br/>Bay is no artist; he's a big-screen video game cartoonist whose narrative skills depend almost exclusively on computer wizardry and special effects. His knowledge of character, plot or anything else is all but non-existent, and these essential features of art are always sublimated -- worse, simply ignored -- in all his 'films'. <br/><br/>In Armageddon, Bay's believability and credibility are non-existent. His redundancy quotient is a thing to behold. He batters you into submission, over and over again. If you don't get his 'point' the first time, wait five minutes and he'll come back again. His movies appeal to children and adult children who became addicted to video games 20 years ago and avoided the painful withdrawal of rehab.<br/><br/>Almost 10 years after Armageddon, in 2007, Bay is offering us another pile of shlock called Transformers, yet another insult to anyone who sincerely believes in cinematic art. This same pile of schlock is, predictably, breaking all box-office records. Sad.<br/><br/>Bay has made about seven or eight bloated, pretentious, pompous, self-important exercises in overkill, and not one of them is worth a serious review. Armageddon fits very well into his questionable canon. Warts and all, give me von Trier and gimmick-free artistic filmmakers anytime. <br/><br/>Every time I see these kinds of non-films (and there are far too many of them), I look with even greater awe and appreciation at the cinematic work of Welles's Citizen Kane, completed 56 years before Armageddon hit the bobbleheaded, popcorn-munching masses. Bunuel, Murnau, Lang, Keaton, Chaplin, and many others were all making far greater magic with film 80 years ago, without a computer in sight. To have Bay insinuate himself as an 'artist' in this same company goes beyond insult."
"weisstein","Null","4","8","9 November 2004"," Big Hollywood Roller Coaster
","Well, in retrospect, this was a really big movie. There was no match for it in it's time and now it's classic (at least for me). <br/><br/>This action/sci-fi was made under probably the most powerful production/direction in Hollywood today Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay with mega cast on stage --<br/><br/>Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi. All top actors play their parts well, Thornton and Buscemi truly shine.<br/><br/>Soundtrack is flawless to say at least, while Trevor Rabin delivers memorable classical theme and brings the atmosphere to every picture (this is his best so far), Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, Patty Smith and Journey bangs out their biggest hits.<br/><br/>Film is overly very well made, flawless cgi (nice tackle to Emmerich's Independence Day). Everything nicely explodes and sounds, some small overtones are seen on the asteroid, like those ""in space sounds"", ""in space fires"", low gravity issues, but hell, if it was all made correctly it wouldn't be such a fun. So stop complaining, film-makers know that there is no sound in empty space, no oxygen to burn fires and much less gravity, yet they do it this way. <br/><br/>Big time movie."
"realistik_US","Null","4","8","20 November 2003"," The film that fooled the internet...apparently.
","Well I have to say, I constantly find myself amazed that people who know nothing about fiction or film seem to have the most to say about any given movie on IMDB. This is a sad state of affairs that may someday see a remedy, though I doubt it.<br/><br/>To those ""reviewers"" who cite a lack of plot, I refer you to ""The Hammer of God"" by Arthur C. Clarke for starters. The ""asteroid heading towards Earth"" storyline isn't by any means new, and I like the direction Bay and crew took with it.<br/><br/>Important note: THIS IS A MOVIE. If you rented Armageddon so you could get a leg up on the latest advances in space technology, then you deserve whatever opinion you've foisted on yourself.<br/><br/>We could've gotten quite a bit more story in if Affleck had been left out of the story, but your average 'blockbuster' has to have a romantic element, I guess.<br/><br/>Final verdict: Definately not the best movie ever made, though quite certainly FAR from the worst. If you're looking for a good science fiction movie to entertain you for a couple of hours, I can heartily recommend Armageddon.<br/><br/>Ten-scale: 8.5/10"

The dialogue, if you can call it that, is nothing more than rehashed one-liners that we've heard a thousand times before, and that's the best I can say about it, the rest of the dialogue is just romantic drivel.<br/><br/>The writers really needed to make use of technical advisors.my 6-year-old brother cracked up at the sight of oil-drillers moon walking on an asteroid carrying a nuclear missile.

"h-son","1","6","14","11 January 2001"," This movie redefined my reviewing scale
","I was in a discussion about movies and 'Armageddon' came up. As usual, I went to IMDB (no kiss-ass, I actually use this site). Imagine my horror when I found one of my countrymen, said ""Probably the best movie I've seen yet"". I had to read it twice. Then I had to read the rest, to see if it was sarcastic.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of movies. Some good, many bad. Many, many bad movies. But only once in my lifetime I've yet had the feeling after leaving the theatre that ""now I have to redefine my whole reviewing scale for movies"". 'Armageddon' was that movie. It defies words, but I'll try. It is SO incredibly BAD it's amazing it ever got made. No, strike that; it was obviously made to make money, by people who didn't care about making movies.<br/><br/>It had actors. Some I like, some I don't. That's not the point. All the actors seemed to do parodies of characters they've played in other movies - even Steve Buscemi's character was outright bad, and he's usually one to be trusted to save a less-than-perfect movie. Bruce Willis was simply a parody. I hope he got paid lots. One of my countrymen, Peter Stormare, played (as usual) a russian, and even though it's usually heart warming to see him in small roles in major movies this was just plain embarrassing. I won't go into the whole Affleck-Tyler thingy, that was just bad beyond words.<br/><br/>It had explosions. Every big movie these days has great FX, so it's pretty useless going into details. Let's just call it ""expensive action sequences"".<br/><br/>It had a script. It must have been written on a box of matches, in a very large typeface. If it was written down at all. Maybe they just made it up as they went along; at least that would explain things.<br/><br/>It had humour. It had some terribly embarrassing one-liners that I assume were supposed to be funny, but that's not what I'm talking about. The entire movie in itself was just a collection of cliche parodies.<br/><br/>It had an ending. Thank GOD it had an ending, although at times it certainly seemed to be too far away.<br/><br/>That said, it at least has one redeeming quality: lots of people have seen it, so when I refer to it (""the new movie so-and-so is very very bad, but still THIS much better than 'Armageddon') people will understand what I'm talking about. And to think 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' was considered bad... It's a masterpiece in comparison."

Or how the shuttle and the armadillo can take massive impacts and escape essentially intact. To list all the inanities would exceed the allowed 1000 words.<br/><br/>Basic plot is as old as the hills.

Buscemi and Stormare are a lot better than the rest. The space-flying scenes with everything happening in Tom & Jerry-tempo destroys all the credibility of the fantastic impact scenes in the beginning. Everyone have seen real space-flight on TV and knows that docking in mid-space isn't done in the same manor as parking in front of the mall.

","Stumbled across ""Armageddon"" the other night on Foxtel, and with little to do and my brain reasonably empty, decided to rewatch it. When I first saw this at the cinema back in 1998, I remember thinking it was one of the dumbest films ever plus I was completely fed up with the ""natural disaster"" genre that was drowning society. Would time change my perception? ""Armageddon"" deals with the question ""what would happen if a meteor bigger than earth hit earth?"". For some reason the US discovered this threat and decided they alone could come up with the answer. Their solution was to send a bunch of misfits who drill for oil into a spaceship to land on the meteor, drill a huge hole in it, then send a nuclear bomb inside it and blow it up from the inside. Genius.<br/><br/>NASA enlists the ""world's best driller"", luckily also American Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) to come and help select the best drill and a plan to get the bomb into the meteor. Harry thinks it will be easier to use his crew who he's used to working with, rather than professional astronauts and scientists. Reluctantly NASA agrees and starts training the crew for the most important job ever in the world. During and after the tests it's clear the team isn't up to it, but they go anyways. Will this cast of misfits save the world? Take a wild guess.<br/><br/>Worth watching for the pure comedy factor, if you can overcome the normal US arrogance and ridiculous storyline. A solid cast, given little to work with, covers a multitude of flaws, most noticeably the crappy Aerosmith theme song. Gets bonus points for Pete Stormare who plays the Russian astronaut."

This movie has the blessing of tugging at your heart strings without out bein overboardly cheesy. (except for one part, i will leave out.) All in all, I give this show, 8/10. (Loses points for the one moment of overly cheesy, and the far-fetch parts.) This show is a keeper."

","""Armageddon"" is entertainment at its best. I just saw this movie last week for the very first time, and I cried. This movie is probably one of the best I have ever seen. It has so much emotion. I think it is a good movie for everybody. There is a love story (for the girls who are into that), there's humor (Bruce Willis' first scene, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler's animal cracker scene, and Steve Buscemi cracked me up), and there's special effects. ""Armageddon"" is very entertaining, but it's also a VERY GOOD movie. I've seen it three times in the past week, and I can't get over it. Sure, at first I saw it only because of Ben Affleck, but after I saw it the very first time, I realized that this was truly a movie I wanted to watch all the time, and now I realize why my dad likes it so much."

"BadWebDiver","8","2","3","25 April 2002"," The way an action movie works
","This is great fun escapist entertainment. What really makes it work, and what most professional critics don't seem to get, is the way the movie shows the events and situations without the characters sounding like they're self-consciously trying to deliver textbook dramatic theory. The credit should really go to the various performers for managing to make their characters **chat**!!!<br/><br/>Particularly notable is the performances of Steve Buscemi as ""So what, are we getting hazard pay for this?"" Rockhound and Peter Stomare as the whacked-out cosmonaut. They are examples of giving a story personality, and not just playing by the book. Of course Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton as the leads also give their characters real punch and panache too. This is especially evident with the negotiation scene. ""None of them want to pay taxes again ... ever."" Sure, it's escapist fantasy, but the dialog and personality makes it come alive.<br/><br/>Even Ben Affleck's gun-ho young heart-throb character is delivered with personality - including the widely-criticised animal cracker scene. It's important to remember that Affleck's character AJ is NOT meant to be a professional impersonator. He's just a deep-sea oil rigger who's casually goofing around with his girl. I think Affleck hits the characterization perfectly. (It certainly plays a lot better, with more personality and humor, than the equivalent heavy-handed sobbing melodrama of the bus-leaving scene in DEEP IMPACT!)<br/><br/>Other scenes that shows why this film worked with the general public, and outstripped its competition are the casino and examination scenes. They give insights into the idiosyncrasies and traits of the individual characters, without them sounding as though they're reading their own character descriptions.<br/><br/>Sure, this isn't going to qualify any viewer for rocket science, or help make the world a better place to live; but as professional escapist fictional mass entertainment, this really kicks some butt."
"ROBERT_BLUE","Null","2","3","24 April 2002"," A Great Movie
","I don't understand the criticism of this film. I admit that some parts are fictionalized to make the story flow better.<br/><br/>As for sending 'lunatics' into space, what would you do with eighteen days? It's never happened, and until it does you don't know to what extent NASA will go to.<br/><br/>The story in this film is excellent, it provides so much of what we look for in films, sci-fi, action, drama, and humour. None of it is overbearing.<br/><br/>When watching a film don't over-analize it, because it's not entertainment. As for the old 'GREATS' in film-making, if these are so great, and demontrate the highs of film-making, than why aren't they very popular, musicals, people singing-in-the-rain, what is so great about that?<br/><br/>

"TF Bblsh","10","2","3","20 September 1998"," Best of the Year
","Armageddon was a truly awesome movie, my favorite of the year.  It's Michael Bay's 3rd movie after Bad Boy's and The Rock both of which were two of my favorite movies of all time and this movie definitely makes him my favorite director.  What did I like about the movie? I liked how the characters were pretty much normal people as opposed to experts who had been preparing for something like this their whole life.  I loved the special effects.  In my opinion this movie has is no.3 of all time as far as special effects in a movie (no.1 an 2 goes to Titanic, and Independence Day.  All the actors in the movie did a good job(it's Bruce Willis's best role so far) and Steve Buscemi was hilarious , and is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. One seemingly minor thing I greatly enjoyed was the fact that it was a very patriotic movie, yet also was able to show what was going on around the world. Most of the scenes were done well.  The ending (which I won't spoil) is very touching, and there are about three of so scenes of glimpses of what people around the world were doing, and these were done so well(especially the one where the president was making his speech at the same time) they almost made me cry.  People say this movie isn't realistic, but what makes them such experts?  Have they ever been in a situation where an asteroid the size of Texas was going to hit the Earth and wipe out humanity? There could have been some things that weren't campletely probable, but you could say that about 99% of all movies out there. If you havn't seen this movie get off your ass and see it this second!  If you're in the mood to be entertained you probaly will be.<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for disaster violence, profanity, and sensuality<br/><br/>Rating:95/100<br/><br/>t"

","How do people get away with making these kind of movies? Maximum explosions does not equate a good movie.  It just gets old after a while.

Yeah.<br/><br/>Second, the cast:  Lots of potential there.  Too bad they weren't really used.  Liv Tyler's character, for example.  She starts out being a feisty little girl with a mind of her own then spends the rest of the movie moping around and looking sad pining for her daddy and her boyfriend.  Poor little girl.<br/><br/>Third, all the silly flag waving: Yeah, we know they're from America already.  We would of figured that out on our own.<br/><br/>I could go on but what's the point?"

"flickjunkie-3","7","2","3","23 November 2000"," Entertainment to the max!
","I wasn't that pleased with the other disaster flick, Deep Impact, which was released earlier than Armageddon, so I wasn't really expecting it to be all that good. Although it wasn't great, Armageddon entertained me to the max, which made it for me not to enjoy.<br/><br/>At the obligatory scientific-military crisis conflab with NASA's director (Billy Bob Thornton) we get a refresher course in extermination events. This particular cosmic uh-oh, Asteroid Dottie, is the size of Texas and will hit planet Earth in 18 days, leaving not even a bacterium alive. Our only hope is for a rock rendezvous mission to drill a hole deep into the sucker and nuke it at the core. Hence the urgent need to locate ""the world's best deep-core driller"". Cue Bruce Willis as Harry Stamper, a rowdy, globe-trotting maverick inspired by famed oil well firefighter Red Adair. Harry graciously agrees to save the world - like ya do - but only if he can take his own team with him. Enter a ragtag bag of roughneck, rambunctious and ex-criminal cowboys who include Harry's calm best buddy (Will Patton), a gigantic muscleman Ving Rhames lookalike (Michael Clarke Duncan), a Zen-babbling young dude Matthew McConaughey lookalike (Owen Wilson), the handsome reckless stud (Ben Affleck) - who's in love with Harry's gorgeous, headstrong daughter (Liv Tyler) - and a wisecracking weirdo genius geologist (it could only be Steve Buscemi).<br/><br/>Armageddon gets more exciting, more intense every second, every minute. The actors are all fine, Bruce Willis is great as Harry, Ben Affleck is an excellent supporter and Liv Tyler is beautiful. She is the stand-out of Armageddon, her performance being Oscar-worthy and all The direction was also impressive, especially for a guy I have quite frankly never heard of! The only thing that needs a little work is the screenplay, which seems rushed at times, and silly at others.<br/><br/>Armageddon is an entertaining, under-appreciated little gem which deserves praise.<br/><br/>I rate Armageddon 7 out of 10."

It is meant to entertain - nothing else.  I have seen this movie probably 10 or 15 times or so (cable - nothing else exciting to watch).  Something disturbed me though.  I was watching it last night (again) and something hit me.  It just didn't make any sense.  Maybe this is why some people are saying that this movie does not make any sense scientifically.  Okay - look.  **Spoiler Warning**  Now a reporter said that after the rock crosses the zero barrier - the rock would take 3 hours and 57 minutes until impact with the Earth.  Now when the rock is blown up by Harry just seconds before crossing the zero barrier, the NASA person says that the rock and I quote ""will miss Earth by 400 miles.""  Will someone please answer a question for me.  This rock - which was traveling at 2200 MPH as said by Dan Truman - How would the rock take 3 hours and 57 minutes to travel 400 miles when it crosses the zero barrier.  That seems impossible to me.  The film research department had to hear this, just like I did.  What happened?"

","I've read some of the other comments about this movie, and as with other movies that have been released many people have missed the point.  It doesn't matter whether the movie is scientifically correct, or ""entertaining"" for you.  The point of this movie is to GIVE PEOPLE SOMETHING TO LOOK FOR IN THEMSELVES.  All of them had some sort of problem, be it physical, psychological, or social, they all managed to find the part of themselves that was able to work together in harsh conditions and save the world.  The group of people that went up into space to do this mission was the most misfit group of people that basically could be found.  However, in the end, even the two people (A.J. and Harry) that really didn't get along managed to work together and save the world.  So what if it happened to be U.S. astronauts?, so what if the asteroid was the wrong size?, look at the basic point in the movie and judge it for that, not how accurate it is!!! Oh, and just for a little clarification, there can be a fire in space. Think about it, there has to be oxygen on the shuttle, right?, so that's where the combustion fuel is from.  Heck, the shuttles were even supposedly fueled with liquid oxygen!, now that stuff is going to burn pretty much anywhere you put it!

I mean, not only does Ben Affleck play a total bonehead, but Bruce Willis plays his girlfriend's angry dad!  That's really original!

Bruce Willis pushes his daughter's boyfriend out of the way so he can sacrifice himself!  And then he waits until THE LAST POSSIBLE SECOND to detonate the bomb!

It's a British quality I can't abide - that we resent America for enjoying itself, only because we're too shy and reserved to enjoy ourselves as much. Instead of looking down our noses, let's make some of our own unashamedly over the top films. We've certainly got the ability and talent to more than compete. I'm fed up of all the 'Notting Hills'.

"movieexpert2001","10","1","1","22 June 2020"," michael bay's movies are the reason cinema was invented
","I heard Alot of news of how so many people adore this film to death it amused them to death and so i decided to watch and wow this is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen it is about how a large asteroid can hit earth again and cause extinction the film was directed by Michael bay the man behind alot of cinemetic experiences he has not made a single Cinemetic train wreck his entire career i pretty much adore almost all of his movies and this one is as far as i am concerned his best movie he has made in his whole career while i originally thought that the rock was his best film which most detractors say, this film in my opinion is his best especially because Michael bay and his movies are the real reason cinema was invented and this movie proves it. the film has a great cast which is bruce willis, liv tyler, ben affleck, william fichtner, Steve Buscemi, michael clark duncan, and many others, this film first opens with meteor showers causing destruction around the planet, and bruce willis plays harry stamper who is an oil driller that has a daughter named grace ( liv tyler ) who is engaged to aj frost ( ben affleck ) who is also harry's best friend and co worker who also does oil drilling others include bear ( michael clark duncan ), rockhound ( steve buscemi ) and oscar,( owen wilson ) and now as i see the film has a great and interesting cast and the actors are well known from other movies and we also know what roles they have been known for like bruce willis who is an action movie star who played in several amazing action movies there is no denying he has played well in them and many say his best movie is either the die hard movies or the sixth sense but this is without doubt his best movie not even sixth sense or die hard can beat this one as his best movie. and it also has owen wilson who ususally plays in alot of fantastic comedy flicks, there is steve buscemi who has been in alot of good movies including some action movies as well as some comedies to he is alo largely known for starring in the crime series boardwalk empire which i thought was really good he has shown very strong performances in there but this is also his best performance, we also have william fichtner who also plays in some legendary action blockbluster films, he played many supporting roles his films include black hawk down, drive angry and the serial drama series prison break, this is also his best performance, there is michael clark duncan who played in the green mile this film and green mile are both his best performances, there is jason issacs who plays his roles very intelligently his most famous roles are in harry potter and the patriot but even so he does good here as a supporting actor. as well as will patton who also plays in action dramas here he also gives a fantastic performance, there is billy bob thornton a very good actor who recieved oscar nominations for a simple plan and sling blade this movie along with them are among his very best performances, and then there is also ben affleck, he was in many good movies including good will hunting, the town, argo, shakesphere in love and also in another michael bay film pearl harbor this film along with them tie to being his best performances , the other actors include peter stormare and ken campbell. this movie is all of the actors best performance, the oil drillers are then hired to go destroy the asteroid and when they arrive they unite with lev andropov ( peter Stormare ) who has a strong Russian accent he speaks the accent very well he is also amazing in this film, also many deaths happen such as the deaths of oscar and max they sacrificed themselves and in the end harry himself sacrifices because at the end one of the oil drillers had to stay for the bomb to destroy the asteroid it ends with a j marrying grace along with showing a Memorian with portraits of harry and the other members of the crew who sacrificed themselves. this film is about showing great courage and bravery and all of the members of the cast did a fantastic job with their character's it has alot of patriotism just like most of bay's films do and here what bay has done is save us all by warning us what to do when a large asteroid is about to hit earth again. i even heard that this movie was a major box office success but however it grossed 553.7 million i think it should have made more money than that like possibly a billion dollars i think it deserved to make a billion at the box office and its no wonder why almost all of bay's movies make a ton of money, its because so many people love it even some critics, moviegoers and detractors do to its just that rumors say not many of them like him and several have not been kind to him well those critics are wrong they need to learn a lesson to enjoy a great popcorn flick and that is what Michael bay's movies are supposed to be enjoyable popcorn flicks thats the genre he makes and movies are all good in different genres and that includes popcorn action they are all among the best movies ever made and this movie proves once again that Michael bay is the best thing about filmmaking and he deserves way to much credit for this, his films deserve the success they get michael bay desrrves the succes and we all must let him have it none of his movies deserve to flop because they dont they all deserve to make billions of dollars as much as possible. at the end of the movie when it was over i was exited and i was deciding which of the performances of the actors was the best of them all. many would say it was bruce willis because he gave his best performance of his entire career and his charachter was very likeable i thought there was two best performances meaning there were two actors who gave the best performance of all and that was both bruce willis and peter Stormare because i liked how stormare was speaking in his Russian accent as well as how he was acting, and with bruce willis i liked him as how he portrayed the oil driller correctly he was the best oil driller of them all he was the hero and he i lovd how he saved the world by sacrificing himself. he was definetly the best part of the film, and as you see while michael bay was directing he also produced the film along with the one and only jerry Bruckheimer who is my favorite movie producer and he did a great job producing it. there can be no better disaster thriller than this armageddon is the best science fiction disaster film of all time as well as being one of the greatest and best movies of all time and that explains how it ended up in the criterion collection. that is because this movie is one of the reasons cinema is invented and its one of the best things that ever happened to the history of cinema, I for one will violently and strongly praise this master of fantastic action movies who is Michael bay and this amazing action producer who is jerry bruckheimer and all you film critics and movie fans should to, bay and bruckheimer deserved an oscar, final grade score A+++"

","Awesome cast, a little silly, cinematic, and sufficient enough for a couple hours. Micheal Bay has a mixed bag of great and mediocre films that are epic fun! Nice balance of every genre packed in one at least most of them. Basic plot save the world except with an inexperienced crew in hopes to pull it off, that's left for the viewer. Lovely adventure popcorn flick, I'd recommend it!"
"GarretMGreviews","10","1","1","8 May 2020"," Probably in my top 5 favorite of all time
","This is a movie I can watch over and over and not get tired of it. It is mostly dramatic but there's a lot of great action scenes, as well as a little comedy and lot of romance as well. Little bit of every genre just about. A lot of people compare it to Deep Impact, which was ironically released just two months before Armageddon. I like Deep Impact as well but Armageddon is still #1 on my list. I also love the soundtrack and the general music throughout the film. My favorite is when they're launching and the music in the background, gives me chills. Highly recommended movie"

I loved all of the charachters in the movie they all did a good job and some even did Oscar worthy performances especially Peter stormare he was very good in portraying the cosmonaut who oversaw the Russian space station and everything else is also good other great things about this cinematic blessing is the cinematography, the supporting cast as well as the ensemble, the special effects, the sound editing and the mixing all were great even the screenplay and the film editing was good Michael bay has yet crafted another cinematic blessing this film has also elements from other great movies like dirty dozen and con air it really delivers in making you feel good many of Michael bay films have been Oscar material though not for acting Not many of bay's movies have had performances good enough for an Oscar nomination and this is one of his rare movies where even the performances are Oscar material Bruce Willis was also very good in this movie His amazing performance was even Oscar worthy it is especially emotional and sad in the end where he has to stay on the asteroid to sacrifice himself to destroy it affleck's charachter a j doesn't want him to be left behind but has no choice stamper tells his daughter that he made a promise but that he had to break it the asteroid then explodes and everybody is saved thanks to Bruce Willis and his team members but the real thanks goes to Michael bay and producer jerry Bruckheimer like I said they are a great team and always deliver what they have done is teach us how to save the world when an asteroid is about to hit again and they did well with it this movie deserved oscars in the following categories<br/><br/>Best director: Michael bay**********<br/><br/>Best picture: Michael bay Jerry Bruckheimer*********<br/><br/>Best supporting actor: Peter stormare**********<br/><br/>Best actor: Bruce Willis********<br/><br/>Best cinematography: John shwartzman**********<br/><br/>Best sound editing: George waters II**********<br/><br/>Best sound mixing: Greg p russell, Kevin o Connell, Keith a wester**********<br/><br/>Best visual effects: Richard r Hoover, pat mclhng, John frazier**********<br/><br/>Best original song: Diane warren*********"

","When an armature sky watcher notices a giant rock in space, he contacts NASA. It is discovered that the asteroid is on a direct collision course with Earth, and is large enough to snuff out life as we know it. A plan is hatched to send up a team of deep Earth drillers to lay in a nuclear device and split the asteroid before it gets too close, deflecting the two halves enough to miss us.<br/><br/>Once again, for the slow people in the back, it is a disaster film. The science is going to be terrible. If you have not yet figures out that fact from this and any other disaster films, you never will. I feel that the people that watch these and then judge them based upon how bad the science is are the same people that go to a Star Trek movie with a book that gives a breakdown of the Enterprise and get upset when the movie ship and book ship differ. These are meant as fantasy and escapism devices, not science lessons.<br/><br/>This is a good film, with a great cast and many amazing one liners. As I say with all my disaster movie reviews, put it on, shut off your brain and enjoy. This one is definitely one hell of a ride."

"bellino-angelo2014","7","1","1","2 March 2020"," Not a masterpiece and a bit confusing, but still very entertaining
","I have to admit that despite ARMAGEDDON is considered a classic of the end of the 1990's cinema, I haven't watched it until a week ago. Considering that ARMAGEDDON has lots of mixed reviews I hadn't high expectations for it, but I enjoyed it for what it was. Now I can go on with the review.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a shot of our planet hit by a meteor (similar to the same that killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago) and then we see the NASA's interior with everyone also in the White House worried for what is happening in the space. After they discover what the meteor looks like and after lots of explosions in New York City, the NASA President Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) says that if they don't find a solution within 18 days the meteor will destroy Earth. Soon the movie focuses on Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) that is the chief of an oil rigging company that has an hard time with his daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) because she is dating one of his employees, AJ Frost (Ben Affleck). Soon Harry is called by Nasa and he is commissioned lead of a mission for saving the world from outer space. He leads a ragtag team that includes also his employees that it consists of: AJ Frost, RockHound (Steve Buscemi), Oscar Choi (Owen Wilson), Bear (Michael Clarke Duncan) and Chick Chapple (Will Patton). After few days of training, some other explosions around the world and some disadventures (as you might expect with such a team) they go in mission. Once in space nothing goes as planned and after being at odds with each other and suffering some casualties, the team will manage to save the world from the asteroid (tho this manages to kill Willis' character) and AJ will finally marry with Grace.<br/><br/>As I said in the summary the movie was a bit confusing from time to time and it was overlong (tho I have generally no problems with very long movies) but it had some qualities that made it very entertaining in its own way. The acting by everyone (Thornton, WIllis, Tyler, Buscemi, Ben Affleck and even Owen Wilson and Keith David) is good and Michael Bay's direction is decent despite his style is very evident most of the time. The soundtrack is also very good (with the nice addition of Aerosmith's I DON'T WANNA MISS A THING) and the movie itself gives a nice and nostalgic 90s feel that folks that grew up in those years will understand better.<br/><br/>However, don't expect a masterpiece if you want to watch this movie. Just expect a DEEP IMPACT-type movie that it has also its funny moments, and this is probably the best thing."
"jmmustchin","8","1","1","19 December 2018"," A fun adventure
","In 65 million BC, an asteroid is hurtling towards earth, making a devastating impact. Charlton Heston narrates: ""This is the earth at the time the dinosaurs roamed a lush and fertile planet. A piece of rock just six miles wide changed all that. It struck with the force of 10,000 nuclear weapons. A million tons of dirt and rock hurtles into the atmosphere, creating a suffocating blanket of ash and dust the sun was powerless to penetrate for 1000 years. It happened before. It will happen again. It's only a matter of when.""<br/><br/>In the present, the shuttle Atlantis is destroyed in space by a meteor shower. Not knowing what's heading their way, the US upgrades to DEFCON 3. The meteors bombard the north Atlantic, with massive destruction shown in New York. At the same time, an amateur astronomer spots a mysterious anomaly in space.<br/><br/>NASA Director Dan Truman, on speaking with the amateur, moves the Hubble Telescope, and spots a Texas-sized asteroid on a direct collision course with earth. It'll hit in 18 days. ""It doesn't matter where it hits. Nothing will survive - not even bacteria.""<br/><br/>Thus begins 1998's most successful film, ARMAGEDDON. As you can guess from it's opening, it's a highly fun action-disaster film. True, it's science fiction, and it's not scientifically accurate - but who cares? It's highly fun to watch. There are some awkward scenes in the first half of the film - but the second half more than makes up for it. The action is awesome, the premise is scary (especially when one considers that in real life, WE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT), and the special effects are AWESOME!<br/><br/>An awesome movie."

"bheadher","5","1","1","20 August 2015"," Good action, but where's the science?
","Ohhh, this one is a visual masterpiece alright...but believability took a vacation big time. First off, asteroids simply don't look like that, except perhaps in an artists tortured mind, nor do they act like this one does. Also, shuttles don't fly like fighter planes in space, banking and maneuvering like the infamous Battle Star Galactica fighters. Secondly, NASA just happens to have not one but two ""shuttles"" of a never seen before design sitting around begging to be used. Third, but probably most telling, is that the NASA people can't seem to do much of anything right, so they have to recruit Harry and his crew to save the planet in only 18 days...with a unique little compact drilling rig that NASA conveniently ""stole"" from Harry himself but can't get working right...and the obligatory Nuclear weapon that just so happens to be the right size to fit into the hole they drill.<br/><br/>Ohhh, and don't forget the old decrepit Russian ""gas station"" parked in orbit that conveniently can refuel both shuttles, complete with its own ""attendant"", an eccentric and grumpy old codger who believes the only correct solution for anything mechanical or electronic is to give it a good bashing with whatever wrench is handy.<br/><br/>Well, you get the picture I suppose. The movie is actually quite entertaining in its own way, if you leave your brain at home and forget any hint of common sense."
"chrisbrown6453","8","1","1","31 July 2000"," Definitely the best comet movie of 1998!
","I have read a few other reviews of this movie, and I have seen the votes casted, and quite frankly, I cannot figure out what is wrong with this movie! It is perfectly directed (Michael Bay), with a great cast including Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thorton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, and a host of others.<br/><br/>While Deep Impact worked too much to have a feasible story to it, Armageddon went strictly for the ""AWW"" reaction.  This film is full of eye candy that will catch you from the opening sequence, and keep hold of you all the way to the final explosion.  While it's special effects were definitely fun to watch, the story lacked only in the dialogue.  Thinking that the audience didn't want to be overwhelmed with technical mumbo-jumbo, the writers chose to use ""baby"" terms easier for us to understand.  While this did infact slightly deminish the dialogue, the actors cast to portray the heros did an excellent job relaying the script. Steve Buscemi was great in the comedic role and Michael Clark Duncan was hilariously funny at times as a big, strong, muscle bound man, with a childish weak side to him. The beginning of this movie will have you sitting on the edge of your seat, and by the end, you will definitely have a tear in your eye just creeping down your cheek.  This is the type of sci-fi action movie that we deserve, and I could only hope that there are more to come."
"Mac-40","10","1","1","23 October 1998"," When your ears stop ringing, listen up.
","It gets pretty sad when a movie is bad-mouthed because it has bad acting. Don't get me wrong, I hate bad actors, and if you've read my other reviews, you'll see that I talk a lot about crappy actors.  But those are for movies where good acting is required for the situation to be believable. 'Armageddon' is a movie that does not require good acting.  Michael Bay never said that the movie would have Academy Award winning acting in the movie.  He said it would be an action packed thrill ride.<br/><br/>And it was.  The movie was very good, because it kept the action going straight to the end.  It didn't matter if the acting sucked.  But I have to be accurate about this movie:  The acting was half-decent.  I mean, whenever I see bad acting, I almost always laugh.  I never once laughed during this movie, except when the script required me to.  The acting is pretty good. Bruce Willis is not my favourite actor, after all, some of his movies have shown his 'bad actor' side.  But he does a decent job in this movie along with the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>And finally, I will say this.  The last 10 minutes of the movie disturb me. They are horrifyingly sad!!  The last 10 minutes of 'Titanic', were nothing compared to this.  I swear, I almost cried!!  It was so depressing, I was tight-lipped for the first few minutes after I left the theatre.  That's amazing.  A movie starring Bruce Willis is sadder than 'Titanic'.<br/><br/>Although I should tell you:  I'm speaking hypothetically.  I didn't find 'Titanic' sad.  In fact I laughed!  But I know many people cried their eyes out in that movie.  So if I didn't find 'Titanic' sad, and millions of other people did, and then I found 'Armageddon' sad, what does that tell you? That 'Armageddon' is one hell of a sad movie.<br/><br/>So if you're one of those 'Go see an action flick, just 'cause it's an action flick' kind of guys, go see this movie.  If you enjoy good acting, decent story and stuff like that, go see this movie.  If you want to cry your eyes out at the end, go see this movie.  I do, however recommend you bring ear plugs for some scenes.  (It gets a little loud!)"

","This is probably the most emotionally moving movie I've seen since Braveheart.  My brother dragged me to it, and I went back the next night to see it again.<br/><br/>If you want to see *science* fiction, ignore this movie.  They seem to have consulted not a single physicist, astronomer, or aerospace engineer in the making of it, so I spent half of my first viewing laughing at the sheer ridiculousity of it.  The rest of the time I cried, making this only the second movie ever to bring tears to my eyes.<br/><br/>Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck make an amazing couple.  Bruce Willis is heroic, but not superheroic; his character is more human than most of his action movie characters.  Add in Steve Buscemi and the others, and you have an amazing cast.  The story, and especially the love story between Tyler and Affleck, is well written (once you get past the scientific absurdity of it), and is well played out by the actors.<br/><br/>The special effects go without saying, being one of the primary draws of this film.  The score is incredibly well-done, and manipulates the audience's emotions with superb artistry.  The soundtrack, featuring Aerosmith both old and new, seems a bit strange in places, but still contributes to the film's intensity.<br/><br/>If you are blessed with the ability of suspension of disbelief, then this will be one of the best movies you see in years.  If, on the other hand, you cannot let yourself sit back and enjoy, you will find this a waste of time and money."

How can someone land on an asteroid flying at 225.000 miles per hour ( or something ). And, come on, if earth was to be saved by a couple of drillers, then we should invest in drilling equipment, screw Internet and all other no 'save-the-earth-potential-stuff' and wait for the moment when Clinton, or any Clinton, will call the top shots of the drillers in resque of the Earth.<br/><br/>Liz Tyler is 'wow!' and I still can't come up with any reasons why Bruce didn't make it at the end while the others ( most of them ) did.

Going<br/><br/>back to a part in this review, Armageddon is not about special<br/><br/>effects, and the other elements are not cheap excuses for that.<br/><br/>Armageddon was about its story. Bruce played a man who felt<br/><br/>that he didn't raise his daughter right and didn't want her to<br/><br/>marry a person like him.

","Let's be serious, there is nothing particularly realistic about this film. For starters, what are the chances that those asteroids would hit downtown Manhattan!  We can be hopeful of course, but more than likely it would be some obscure part of Russia or Nth Canada.  I am straying from the point. This is an all-American, gung-ho film.  The music (Jerry Bruckheimer music is always similar) provides the hero feeling and seeing them in their flight suits makes us all proud. All in all, the performances were good (Bruce Willis the same as always though).  The special fx were fantastic.  But more than anything, for an action flick I found myself rather attached to the characters.  Especially Bear and A.J.  And I was glad to see they both survived.  I also shed a few tears for poor orphaned Grace, left to survive on her own (with a totally gorgeous fiancee). Overall, I think this was a great film.  A mixture of a completely unrealistic storyline, gobsmacking fx, side splitting laughter, sniffly tissue moments and arm-rest gripping tension all contributed to the best film this year. I would see it again and again."

Yes, it has its weaknesses, but--considering the genre--they're excusable.  This is the first movie in which I've really liked Bruce Willis.  His performance was perfectly understated.  He, like Harrison Ford, always does well with the ""normal guy thrust into abnormal situation,"" and in Armageddon he does it without the over-the-top, cartoonish elements such as we've seen in the ""Die Hard"" films."

And even though I knew what was going to happen at the end, I still teared up.

As much as I can sympathize with those discontent viewers, I must humbly say ""Shut-up and enjoy the movie""<br/><br/>This is the easiest plot to break down. Destroy a killer asteroid, before it kills all of us.  The way to do this is to drop a nuke in the center of it. Nasa has no one experienced to pull this off.  The man that Nasa was hired to do this is third generation oil driller Harry Stamper, played by Hollywoods' best blue-coller-everyman Bruce Willis. Harry calls to arms his personal team of drillers to make this happen, that include his most reluctent of choices, A.J. Frost, played by Ben Affleck.<br/><br/>Directer Micheal Bay and producer Jerry Brukheimer make all the right calls for this movie, reguarding the casting and astetic look and feel of this movie.  There a golden rule to film making, and that is, if you can't make it look real then at least make it look good.  I think that this film is the best example of that rule.  <br/><br/>This was a big effects movie.  With the growing amount of films that continute to stuff movies to the gills with visual effects, it's refreshing to see this film put it's main focus on it's unique band of characters. Armageddon seems like a story motivated by the events, but it is surly more of a character motivated story.  <br/><br/>To sum up, try and forget all the compunctions that you have about the scientific inconsistencies about this film and enjoy."

","Here is 1998's summer blockbuster which delivers exactly what you would expect it to.  The special effects are outstanding as we all hoped they would and as for the story, well you saw the previews so you knew what the plot was about.  Seeing the asteroid on the poster of the movie you knew it was going to be about an asteroid so the critics going off about the plot line is kinda pointless since it was well advertised as an asteroid in danger of destroying our world.  The one thing I wasn't expecting to see was emotional performances by Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler which brought me back to see this film for a second time and then a third for free.  Despite the long length and some dumb stunts you may laugh at, this is another Jerry Bruckhiemer film that deserves a glance.  Fans of his films should not be disappointed."

Paris and New York get very battered by incoming meteor showers.  Those scenes are very spectacular.  If you're looking for a movie with a lot of special-effects, and you are an action fan, this is the film for you.  This movie is fast-paced, but still lasts 2 1/2 hours.  The only thing I thought was ludicrously silly was after a scene where Bruce Willis was shooting golf balls at Greenpeace.

A must see for all sci-fi/action fans. 10/10!!"
"DHD99","Null","1","1","9 November 2000"," More entertaining, but less satisfying
","Since this movie and DEEP IMPACT used essentially the same scenario, and appeared at almost the same time, one has to suspect they were out to compete with each other.  After watching both, I felt ARMAGEDDON was more fun, more entertaining, and more upbeat, but I'm afraid I still found it the less satisfying of the two.<br/><br/>After a meteor shower makes mince meat out of Manhattan, NASA discovers that's only a preview of coming attractions. An asteroid is heading for Earth, and if something isn't done, it's the end of the world as we know it.  NASA decides to blow it up from inside, and asks oil drilling expert Harry Stamper to go into space and guide the astronauts who'll be drilling the hole to put the bomb in.  Stamper agrees, but on one condition.  He doesn't trust the astronauts to do it right, and wants to take his own crew instead.  The problem is, these guys have never been trained for space flight, much less logged any actual time up there, and they're not exactly prime astronaut material. Okay, this shaky crew does make for a lot of genuine humor that actually enhances the suspense, because it increases the doubt as to whether they're really gonna be able to save the Earth. At the same time, you start to like these guys, so you can work up a vested interest in their fate the doesn't depend on the Earth being in danger.<br/><br/>But whatever might have been good about taking the plot in this direction, I thought it created two major problems.  First, the mood of light-hearted adventure that was perfectly fine for a movie like STAR WARS seemed royally inappropriate for a movie hat dealt with something as serious as the impending destruction of the Earth.  Granted, STAR TREK IV went for the same mood and dealt with the impending destruction of the Earth, but that was a hypothetical future Earth, threatened by something that was pure science fiction.  In this case, we have a present-day Earth, threatened by something definitely within the bounds of possibility.  The movie even begins by telling you it has happened before.  Perhaps if ARMAGEDDON had been done as an out-an-out dark comedy, along the lines of DR. STRANGELOVE  which is actually alluded to in this movie  it would have worked for me.  DR. STRANGELOVE showed deliberate, calculated contempt, but ARMAGEDDON just shows poor judgment.<br/><br/>And that poor judgment involves not only mood but credibility.  I find it hard to believe that NASA would have taken the pretty-please- with-sugar-on-it approach with Stamper. Rather, I think they would have MADE him cooperate in whatever way the military MAKES people cooperate when there's no time to argue. And if they didn't MAKE him forget about taking his own crew instead of their astronauts, they would have at least MADE him forget about that night on the town right before the mission.<br/><br/>Still, ARMAGEDDON does give you a lot of cool mayhem and destruction right at the beginning, rather than making you wait through three quarters of the movie, and it is more uplifting.  I also thought its view of how the general public would react was more believable.  And ARMAGEDDON got one fact right that DEEP IMPACT got wrong. If something that big hit the ocean that hard, it wouldn't just make a tidal wave.  It would flash-boil the water and make it rain.  But I'm afraid those selling points weren't strong enough to make me feel this was the better of the two movies.<br/><br/>Now if only someone would make a movie out of the definitive novel on the subject, LUCIFER'S HAMMER."

Boy, was I unprepared for the storm of criticism that followed the movie.  ""Unscientific?""  This from people that consider STAR WARS a science fiction masterpiece? Give me a break.  For starters, the WORST science elements of ARMAGEDDON are scientifically more accurate than any of the STAR WARS or STAR TREK films (if not the series).  If you don't believe that, pick up the CRITERION COLLECTION DVD (as I did) and listen to the scientific commentary from the NASA science advisor.  You will also find the 153 minute director's cut MUCH easier to follow (particularly during the space sequences).  Unrealistic characters?  Man, I've MET people like virtually all the characters in this movie; particularly the science geek and full time leech played by Steve Buscemi.  In fact, for a few years, I WAS that guy!  To me, this movie is a real rush. I'm sorry for you that don't ""get it.""  But, crimany, be fair, and just don't parrot the sophomoric inaccuracies of ""mainstream movie"" critics whom make a living dumping on eagerly-anticipated movies. Guys who say, ""There ARE NO 'Texas-size' asteroids"", for example.  The NASA science advisor for this movie says that, not only ARE there ""Texas-size"" asteroids, but SEVERAL have hit the earth throughout our history.  I never took the line all that literally in the movie, anyway.  I just figured that was Billy Bob Thornton's way of simplifying things for a simpleminded Texas governor whom was probably by now president.

I was having so much fun I didn't care.  Sure it was kinda cheesy, and the laws of physics only applied when the plot called for them, much like for example, how the coyote from RoadRunner fame only fell when he looked down.  It is important to note that the filmmakers don't take themselves to seriously and made the film quite light hearted and laugh out loud funny in places.  Maybe it was meant to distract us from the plot flaws.  Michael Bay is proving to be quite adept at making action films. His trademark break neck pace is slightly annoying here as the movie goes to long and the pace has sufficiently tired us towards the end. However he has tried for a smite more sentiment in this film than in his previous outings and maybe he is looking to branch out from the action film business into perhaps Period Drama's.  I think his camera work would go over well in a heated argument scene between two lovers (a lady of the manor and a stable boy), I can even seen that slap being filmed in slow motion with some nice lighting effects with a rock track back it up.  As I said before an enjoyable movie that if you haven't seen, I recommend you do , even if it is only For Steve Buscemi's scene stealing, movie making one liners.  The one thing I must bring up before I end this rant, is why would you install a forward facing Gattling Gun?

They're apparently so far up themselves that they seem entirely to have missed the point that this film knows exactly what it's doing from start to finish. It knows it's corny, it knows it's crazily larger than life, it knows it's out to push all those staple movie buttons, and so it does it all with a terrific sense of humour and, more importantly, on a scale that simply beggars belief but which - crucially - works fantastically. Contrary to what some people say, director Michael Bay does a simply tremendous job of making the whole, massive juggernaut of a movie bolt along at a terrific pace, and even more remarkably, manages to engage your emotions even while you're laughing your head off at all the hokum. Other people complain about the characters, but I struggle to recall a movie that crammed so many memorable - if, naturally, larger than life - people into a single movie. Basically this film is pure cinema. Sure, it's not an Ingmar Bergman film, but it never wants to be one. And if, as anyone with half a brain cell should see, you judge it in terms of what it does want to be, you will see that it succeeds quite magnificently. Sorry to get a bit personal with this review, but as a person who enjoys movies of all sorts, I just couldn't stand by and let arrogant fools diss a top movie for no other reason than it doesn't stay true to the 'laws of science' (sheesh, get a life guys!) and doesn't want to fit into only the small category of 'coolness' they're pseudo intellectuality permits them to admit to enjoying.

Why is it any time a Hollywood movie has to put together a group of ordinary, hard working, regular joes (men) they have to have weird and out-in-leftfield personalities.

The plot twisted very nicely and the special effects were adequate in making me believe in the rock in outer space. Billy Bob Thorton did a good job and I am gradually gaining respect for his ability as he seems to have just appeared over the last few years. The actor who was the pilot of Bruce's shuttle did an exceptional job in projecting his character, and the unhearlded role of the cosmonaut, who is a major factor in the movie is great. Ben Affelat was somewhat lame, but that could have as much to do with the way his character was written than with him. His love interest in the movie did her part as the ungrateful and big-headed daughter who eventually but too late turns around returning her love for her father.

Everybody knows that the americans are the most patriotic people in the world, but in Armageddon this patriotism becomes ridicules! Especially the scene in which Bruce Willis tries to persuade the NASA officials to let his men out to have a some freetime. Did you notice the huge US flag behind Bruce Willis? Again only the americans save the world (ok, there was this russian cosmonaut, but he was just the ""funny guy"" that almost every movie has). No other nation in the world have to put in all this patriotic stuff into a movie, EXCEPT the americans. Many many people in europe and my friends dislike this, but America is the most important market for movies so I think movies MUST BE patriotic otherwise the american audience feel bad touched. Nevertheless ARMAGEDDON is a must see, although I believe there are not many people who didn't see this masterpiece already!"

"DoctorSkyTower","7","1","1","2 April 2000"," GET RID OF THAT 'ANIMAL CRACKER SCENE!'
","I really liked this movie! Stupid plot, rediculous characters, cliche-ridden story line. The asteroid was the best character, it beat the humans hands down! It had the most wicked landscape (check out its pointy tails!!) You also get to hear the asteroid growl when it begins to break up.<br/><br/>
WARNING: A SPOILER HAS BEEN DETECTED IN THE VICINITY!<br/><br/>Lots and lots of S.F.X. At least two thirds of this flicks' special effects are dedicated to the asteroid, the real star of this film! I did like the way the guy at the beginning asked to have the asteroid named after his wife. She does the fingers at him. We also have Mr Stamper running around an oil rig blasting a shotgun at his daughter's hero boyfriend for sleeping with her on the job. An OIL RIG??? This scene should've been omitted!<br/><br/>My complaint: The romantic sub plot. It was unnecessary and simply slowed the pace. The worst scene I've ever seen in an action movie was the aptly named 'Animal Cracker Scene'. It spoilt the movie and made me physically cringe. The pretty 'bedroom interest' was a typical cliched female, sitting at home waiting for her boyfriend to come in the door. She served no other purpose!  <br/><br/>CONCLUSION? Go see this for the asteroid's sake! And don't take the performances by Mr Willis and cast too seriously, or the story for that matter, or you may be sorely disappointed."

That other movie with a similar story, DEEP IMPACT was noted for its good substance and tense moments with the citizens of the world involved. That was a disaster movie, but ARMAGEDDON doesn't worry about the meteor hurtling towards earth but the action and thrills it takes to take it out.<br/><br/>NOTE: This spectacular film has the most inspirational and tearjerking moment since GHOST and GLORY."
"Colonel Ted","8","1","1","23 January 2000"," Ignore the critics, Armageddon is lots of fun
","When the message ""65 million years later"" appears on screen after a brief voice over explaining the dangers of an asteroid hitting the Earth, you know that a movie is not going to be serious. Indeed, whether you enjoy Armageddon is going to depend entirely on your personal taste. If you can except the end of the World as a piece of pure hokum, then you're going to have a barrel of fun. If not, then you'd better watch Deep Impact. Clearly all the critics' have far too good taste and they tried desperately to bury it. The rest of World didn't quite agree. Can a $450,000,000 gross be that far off the mark? The (admittedly ludicrous) plot centers on Bruce Willis as an oil drilling expert whose sent up into space nuke an asteroid heading for earth with a motley crew of workers including Affleck and Buscemi, giving the opportunity for some truly dazzling special effect. It also make as nice change to see a city other than an American one be destroyed in a film, as Paris gets hit by one of the fore running meteorites. Yet this mindless premise is pulled off extremely well. The first half will have you laughing at the steady stream of gags and one-liners and the second will have your heart pumping over-time as everything that could go the mission does: with a vengeance. Yet unlike the 1991 Willis flop Hudson Hawk, somehow all the noise, the action, the explosions are not at all numbing as Roger Ebert and co. would have you believe. In fact director Michael Bay orchestrates it far better and the result, for all its ridiculous story and brainless action, makes for a thrilling and unforgettable time at the movies."

"Dark Scribe","8","1","1","8 January 2000"," Jaw dropping spectacle
","Armageddon without doubt is one of the most visually stunning films of recent times, but what made this film great was the different genres it incorporated. Obviously action was the most prevalent, but it had some hilarious comic touches (Steve Buscemi providing most), decent dramatics and the farewell at the end almost brought tears to my eyes. The cast was superb, good lead performances by Messers Willis, Affleck, Patton and the gorgeous Liv Tyler were well complemented by Buscemi and the rest of the shuttle crew, with special mention for Billy Bob Thornton for his outstanding performance. The American supremacy element was very present, numerous shots of the Stars and Stripes got a bit much toward the end, but that was easy to overlook in the face of its sheer quality. The score was very well done, adding much to the dramatics of the film, great music throughout. The final tearful farewell was especially special for me, as I fully expected it but was still moved, a tribute to Willis and Liv Tyler and their skill in carrying off this oft used scene. All in all, Armageddon was all I expected and more, an excellent film and one that shines far above Deep Impact and most other action films in general. I tip my hat to Jerry Bruckheimer, another brilliant effort from him, may his brilliant streak continue. 8 out of 10."

"Amanda-Roberta","Null","1","1","29 December 1999"," A Surprise
","Armageddon came out at just about the same time as Deep Impact (at least that's what happened in Malta). Having first seen the latter movie first, I was a bit sceptic about viewing another disaster movie with practically the same theme - i.e. a huge asteroid about to hit the Earth. The title itself - ""Armageddon"" - seemed to say it all. This one word - plus of course the presence of Bruce Willis - promised a movie which contained lots and lots of action, but perhaps somehow lacking in the storyline and plot.<br/><br/>However I was pleasantly surprised to find that Armageddon, yes, contained beautiful special effects and action, but with a good (although not crackingly good) plot to the boot. True, the story is hardly imaginative, but the way that it is transmitted to the audience is both emotional and extremely pleasant in the same way.<br/><br/>Armageddon might not be the most original movie ever made; however the way the story is projected, plus the addition of the emotional element (with characters you can feel for) is truly, well, if not wonderful, at least close too. Some claimed that the characters are mere caricatures; I think that after all, all movie characters are. It is up to the director and the actors to make the audience symphatise and feel for them.  And I can seriously  say that most of the actors did - make me feel for them, that is. Otherwise how could I possibly explain the tears that came as the credits rolled up?<br/><br/>A good watch - both for sci fiction fans and those who like to watch movies that make them feel something inside."
"AKS-6","5","1","1","16 December 1999"," Good entertainment in spite of flaws
","""Armageddon"" is one of those films that you are not supposed to like. Probably because it's more about special effects than an interesting script. So, having said that, I must admit that even though I didn't want to like it I actually did. Sure, I'm not saying that I like it in the same way I like, for instance, Bergman's ""Smiles of a Summer Night"" or Tamahori's ""Once Were Warriors"", but I still like it. It's not a masterpiece, but I think it is great entertainment and sometimes that's exactly what I need, two hours of watching a film that doesn't force me use my brain too much.<br/><br/>And Billy Bob Thornton's in it! I actually didn't know that before I saw this film (shame on me, because Billy Bob is one of my favourite actors). And Steve Buscemi was hilarious. Peter Stormare was kind of irritating, he needs to get other parts than the ones he's been doing lately (like a German nihilist in ""The Big Lebowski"" and Velvet in ""8MM""), he was still pretty funny though. Bruce Willis was not very good, I think we're all tired of watching him save the world or a city or whatever. Liv Taylor is not the best actress around, but then her part didn't demand much, so I guess she did alright. Ben Affleck was nothing special. I hardly remember he was in the film at all.<br/><br/>Well, good entertainment, at times a lousy script, though, and good performances from at least two people of the castÂ… I'm not ashamed to give this film 5/10."
"svswinger-2","Null","1","1","13 December 1999"," Lighten up, people
","Let's start out by saying this is NOT the worst movie of all time. Not even close. It seems the more money a movie makes, the worse it becomes in people's mind if they didn't like it to begin with. That's narrow minded, and it is apparent that Armageddon suffers from this narrow-mindedness. I am not a sci-fi fan at all, and mindless action movies are not usually my type of thing either, but I liked Armageddon. You wanna see a big-budget, money making, thin plot piece of crap, go see Independence Day or Men in Black. Not even Will Smith, who is pretty funny, could save those.<br/><br/>I can't even remember all the stupid comments I've seen regarding this movie, but all I can say is, they're entitled to their opinion. And I do recognize the plot holes in Armageddon, and the cheesy storylines, but so what? All action movies are like that, and it's laughable that the same people who ""f**king crush"" this movie will come right back and praise the likes of Star Wars and Independence Day. The same guys who will sit out in front of a theater for 3 weeks to have the ""honor"" of being the first to witness a bunch of muppets and monotone wooden actors fly around in a space pod or whatever are the ones ripping Armageddon for similar story lines. The only difference is, Armageddon is funny as hell. I understand that lots of people just go to movies looking to redeem their soul and cry their eyes out, but me, I appreciate a little humor once in awhile.<br/><br/>Like always, Steve Buscemi is hilarious here. Some of his lines are great, such as when a federal agent tells him he has a national security problem he must discuss with him, he turns and asks the girl he is with ""How old are you?"" Most of the other characters have some humor, even occasionally Bruce Willis, in his deadpan sort of way. Liv Tyler doesn't do a whole lot here, but she's pretty hot. Billy Bob Thornton is great, and there is a funny line from the guy who discovers the asteroid in regards to his wife.<br/><br/>Last but not least, it seems it would not be an Armageddon comment without commenting on the ""animal cracker love scene"". Stupidest scene in the history of movies? Please, you haven't seen enough movies. It is a silly little episode between two people in love, and if you tell me you've never done the same type of thing with your woman (or man), then you've never had one. Maybe not quite as corny, but everyone acts like that once in awhile, and to show it as a kind of final moment between two people in love, I can tolerate that. So, all I have to say is, lighten up, and stop taking yourselves so seriously."

","Put simply, Armageddon is both utterly ridiculous and enormously good fun (a bit like golf, or sex). It's also bloated and wasteful, although the fact that everything presented on the screen exists purely to be blown up, hit, knocked over or tied up seems to be the single concession to economy.<br/><br/>Don't worry about the plot - enjoy the spectacle, and the way that Steve Buscemi gets away with suckling on the corporate teat by being incredibly cool'n'ironic at the same time.<br/><br/>Marvel at the director's obsession with Liv Tyler, photographing her in loving close-up even when she has nothing to say or do. Wince as Bruce Willis messes up the vaguely original ending by being much too weepy. Gasp as the film seems to have compressed time.<br/><br/>Oh, go and see it. It's art, almost."
"Konrad-5","8","1","1","13 December 1999"," Don't dis this awesome movie
","The simple reason that Armageddon was the highest grossing movie of 1998 is the fact that it is a great movie. Sure the characters were two dimensional, sure the plot was manipulative, sure the action was gratuitous, and sure it was an exercise in American flag waving - who cares! The best thing about this movie was that it didn't take itself too seriously. The script writers gave Bruce Willis the corny macho lines and then backed these up using the wit of Steve Buscemi and the bumbling russian played by Peter Stromare. Even though the characters were shallow, they are so likeable you'll be concerned for their welfare by the end of the film. And even though you can basically guess what happens by watching the trailer, the continuing crises and regular moments of tension serve to keep you in your seat. Armageddon is so much more than a comet movie, it's an action, a romance and a comedy. And besides, how can it be bad if Billy Bob decided to star in it?"

The effects is just great and I usually don't fall for this element in movies any longer, but these really blew my mind. Action, plot and atmosphere was also very good. The only negative thing about Armageddon was the length. WHY MUST (almost) every American movie last close to 2 1/2 hour. In the 80's most American movies lasted only 90 to 120 minutes, and that is usually long enough for a movie of this type. It's usually historical drama-films which last for 2 1/2 to 3 hours."

"Adec","Null","1","1","14 August 1999"," Big dumb fun...
","Lets get this out of the way right up front, Armageddon is basically just a popcorn movie, nothing more, nothing less. A thrillride made for mass entertainment rather than for any greater dramatic purpose, and to it's benefit it doesn't claim to be anything more than that. For some strange reason a lot of critics (both the profession and armchair versions) seem to regard films made for purely entertainment purposes with a sense of derision, but personally I think that such films are just as worthy as any other type of film, after all some times all we want is to be entertained. And that is exactly what Armageddon aims for, and for me that is pretty much exactly what it achieved, entertainment, pure and simple.<br/><br/>Armageddon has all the hallmarks of a great thrillride of a film, a top notch action director in Michael Bay, a great ensemble cast all giving well judged performances and a very good end of the world premise (however unlikely). The special effects are of course top notch, as one would expect from a film of this nature, and while some have complained about Bay's fast cut editing personally I never found it to be either intrusive or annoying, in fact I think that Bay captures the whole atmosphere of the film quite well, although I did find that a couple of the action scenes weren't quite as much of an adrenaline rush as they perhaps should have been. Still the vast majority of the film works and that is all that really counts. Also special kudos must go to Trevor Rabin's superb score which manages to perfectly capture and echo the mood of the film and the impressive cinematography of John Schwartzman.<br/><br/>There are some slight problems, such as the fact that even though all of the cast played their roles very well, most notably Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Will Patton, Ben Affleck and William Fichtner, the characters for the most part just seemed a little underdeveloped, and while they were fun characters to watch do their thing I would have liked to know more about them and what made them tick, which is something I feel is very important for this type of film to be a total success, however the (otherwise pretty solid) script just didn't quite deliver enough in this regard for me. That said it's not a major problem and is indeed true of most big budget popcorn flicks, and in fact Armageddon probably tries harder than most to paint it's myriad characters on it's broad canvas, but when it comes down to it there isn't really time to delve any deeper lest you want this to become a three hour plus 'action' film. <br/><br/>Overall Armageddon is probably the best of the years blockbusters, and while definitely not perfect is still a very entertaining ride that is well worth taking for those that enjoy pure, honest, unashamedly loud blockbusters that actually deliver the fun and thrills that they are designed to. Big dumb fun done right.<br/><br/>One man's opinion. 8.5/10"

The world's fate can not be put in the hand of a group of DIGGERS :0) However, this is a very good movie that will be remembered for sometime.<br/><br/>A weird thing is that another movie : ""Deep Impact"" has almost the same story.

And in my eyes, it was. The acting was fine;Liv Tyler and Steve Buscemi were excellent, and the story was brilliant. Whilst Deep Impact relied too much on special effects, Armageddon did not. Patton's relationship with his son and ex wife is deeply saddening. Affleck and Tyler were believable, even with Willis breathing down their necks constantly. Buscemi added the humour side as always,""This is so much fun,it's freaky,"" He says with a huge, cheesy grin on his face. Bruce Willis is often getting 'stick' from critics-His temporary separation from wife, Demi Moore has caused more fuss then needed. Willis' last two films(Armageddon,The Jackal) have been crushed by critics. Are we forgetting that this is the man than brought us Pulp Fiction and The Die Hard series?

Since, Earth is threatened of being hit by a meteor, (maybe as early as 15 years from now.) there was a period with three movies being about exactly that. First off was Meteor, which I haven't seen yet (send me comments on that if you'd like), then came Deep Impact which was just to say it simple a waste of time, and last but not least Armageddon hit us with the big Brucy Bruce being right in the middle.<br/><br/>Here actors are just lining up. Except for Brucy, we have Liv Taylor (not really an actor, just the honor of being Mr.Eurosmith's daughter.) Steve Buscemi and of course lets not forget Billy Bob (no pun intended) Thornton. The movie also has a visit by the swede flagship Peter Stormare (dig that name.) Steve Buscemi must have been glad to act with his friend, Peter Stormare, since they were a good duo in Fargo. So, in other words, this movie has it all.<br/><br/>Or has it? Except for having Eurosmith making the best song for a movie ever, and I mean that. It's not much else to it. The movie is cool enough. It has the explosions, it has some America worship, fancy cars, beautiful people, uncomplicated plot, and it even has Buscemi firing off a gun, which, well, is cool to some extent. If you want to see a meteor movie, this is the best alternative. If you just want to see something with Bruce Willis in it, see Die Hard, Die hard in New York, or Pulp Fiction."
"Jsnowd","Null","1","1","23 June 1999"," I almost walked out on this movie, and I was on a plane!
","Because I can't find ""Manos:  The Hands Of Fate"" in the video stores (and haven't seen it yet on MST3K) I'll have to take my girlfriend's word that it is, in fact, worse than ""Armageddon"".  I loathed every minute of this movie. I wanted the plane I was in to crash to put an end to all of our suffering.<br/><br/>The extraordinary scientific illiteracy of this picture (the credits claim that they had a technical consultant from NASA.  Either they didn't listen to him, or they didn't bother to call NASA to see if they'd ever employed a man named Bernie who got his degree from the University of Ralph) would be forgivable if there were something else  to redeem it.  After all, we routinely forgive Star Wars, Star Trek and James Bond pictures for their absurdities.  The real trouble was that the characters were as silly and stupid as the science.  Was the shotgun scene that introduces us to Bruce Willis's character supposed to make us like him or care what happens to him? No matter how many soulful looks Liv Tyler aims in his direction, he's still an ass.<br/><br/>The rest of the characters are no more interesting or involving.  The director and editor rape and pillage dozens of other movies for their shots, giving the movie the feeling of an MTV stock footage festival.<br/><br/>That's why I damn near walked out of this movie-- 30,000 feet over Saskatchawan."

","I particularly liked the integration of authentic space footage in this movie.  Poor ole Bruce - what an American Hero! Bigger than Rin-Tin-Tin. That self-less act of him remaining to set off the bomb - truly Saturday afternoon stuff at the pictures with the kiddies stamping their feet! What would have been a more fantastic finish to this movie, just as AJ and Bruce's daughter were walking down the runway after the space shuttle had landed and received its heroic homecoming, would have been for Bruce's smoking space helmet to suddenly appear in the sky, and land on the tarmac and bounce a few times..........."
"haleyjackson","10","1","1","16 June 1999"," Armageddon, with it's biting humor can not be compared to the borish drama of Deep Impact.
","I'm tired of all the comparisons done with Deep Impact and Armageddon.  I have my opinions of course, but I think to compare the two is doing injustice to both.  Armageddon, with it's biting humor can not be compared to the borish drama of Deep Impact.<br/><br/>I recently purchased the Criterion edition of Armageddon and I love it. The visual spectacle of Armageddon makes me breathless even on a small tv screen.  The thing that I love the most about this movie is the humor. And how can you lose when you have Steve Buschemi delivering some of the best lines. (Does anyone remember Con Air)<br/><br/>Granted, I did read a comment about how, those shallow people who enjoyed Con Air and Independence Day will like this movie.  Well I would have to agree.  This movie has a lot of the same feel of the previous two, but that isn't to say that it isn't a good combination.  I enjoy being thrown into action with enough humor to appreciate what I'm going through.  There is nothing wrong with this movie.<br/><br/>Although I said I wouldn't compare the two movies, here I am saying that if you only see one of the movies, see Armageddon.  Everyone has their own opinion, but in my humble one, I like Armageddon so much more than Deep Impact that the other is just not worth it."
"Fletch-35","8","1","1","8 June 1999"," One of the true American movies...
","For many, it's easy to bash and hate this wonderful film. I for one think that it's a touching and exciting action/dramatic film. It explores the thought of life and death, and the values that come in between.<br/><br/>While the story maybe a little touchy for some ( remember this is only a movie folks ), the special effects and the masterful filmmaking of Michael Bay is what really is the heart of the film. Michael obviously takes pride in his work and his unique films show this quality. As with Bad Boys and the Rock, each of his films get better each time around.<br/><br/>Armageddon, deals with the fact that we can work together to get things done, putting our differences aside as people, without confrontations. And how love can be a powerful thing to keep one strong, no matter how far away you are from that person.<br/><br/>This movie was a blockbuster film in 1998, being the highest grossing film of the year, earning over $200 million. On video, it was the same hit.<br/><br/>You obviously need to see this film on DVD, with a high quality surround sound system. A new version of Armageddon was released on DVD resently. It has uncut footage and interviews with cast and crew.<br/><br/>Mixed reviews by some aside, Armageddon is an excellent film that will make you have a memorable adventure for two and a half hours."

"TomServo-16","Null","1","1","31 May 1999"," Pulled off very well
","Armageddon was an amazing movie!  The only problem was that it was not believable.  The chance that a group of oil drillers can learn everything they need to know about space travel in a couple of days is hard to believe. There was only one thing that made of for the unbelievable; the writing. The story was written by Robert Roy Pool and Jonathan Hensleigh.  The story was later adapted for the movie by Tony Gilroy and Shane Salerno.  The screenplay was written by Jonathan Hensleigh (who also wrote the story) and J.J. Abrams.  These five men made an unbelievable story one of the most believable stories to watch.<br/><br/>Other than the writing, I loved the camera shots!  John Schwartzman did a terrific job as director of photography.  This movie had some of the most beautiful camera shots when the story started getting patriotic or serious. I will admit though that most of the camera shots I'm talking about are of Liv Tyler.  The others are of the people of the world during the president's speech.<br/><br/>The acting job in this movie was not that bad.  I can't really say too much because I am a HUGE Bruce Willis fan.  They did though pick a great cast for an action-adventure-comedy.  The only thing about the acting was Bruce Willis playing a father figure and Ben Affleck becoming a big baby at the end crying, ""It's my job, it's my job!""  But again, no one could have found a better group of actors for this movie.<br/><br/>In my opinion, if you haven't seen the movie, see it!  If you have, buy it!  Armageddon makes a great movie to watch over and over again with family, friends, dates, or just to watch when you're in the mood for an amazing movie!"

Like the summers other comet-disaster film, Deep Impact, this film has quite a disappointing ending, but it does not stop me from giving the praise that this film actually deserves. Touchstone pictures would have done a lot better if they had looked more widely for their actors, although Bruce Willis is not as bad as many think."

Director Michael Bay is the best director ever because he treats me like the idiot I know I am. I have trouble paying attention and Director Bay knows just how to keep me watching. I like shiny objects, Armageddon is one gigantic shiny object. I sit transfixed by his technical wizardry. I hate thinking about stuff and Armageddon was the sweetest brain candy I ever saw. Hurray to Michael Bay! He is my father, ""Talk down to me father, for I do not understand!"" Until next week, when I rent Godzilla, Armageddon is the best!"

","Okay, so its predictable.  But who cares?  Rather than trying to make a movie about humanity and its end, searching for the deep answers that no one has (Deep Impact), Armageddon is from the beginning a fun movie and does very well.  Michael Bay set out to do it that was and succeeded spectacularly.  He has done a terrific job of making a movie with the best special effects and craziest plot since Star Wars.  And personally, I would rather watch Armageddon."

I'm gonna talk about this with ""Deep Impact"" too on the other page, so look for that review. My classmates don't appreciate movies. They just get mad at movies, act like they know everything about movies, and continue to see them anyway. Here's what's wrong with them:<br/><br/>1. They were in no mood to care about the characters. (I thought they were great! Bruce Willis gives another great performance in his career!. I loved the other cast too.) 2. They are obsessed with realism. They bash all over flames in space, explosions, and screaming, and they don't see how in movies, that you're allowed to do that. Movies were made to help you escape from reality. I wanted to believe there were flames in space, and sound after this movie. 3. They criticize the machineguns. The macineguns were there to shoot at the smaller asteroids. I thought the machineguns were cool. What are they wondering about why they're there for? 4. They make fun of the script, drama, and other meanings in this film. But they mean so much to me. I know I'm not crazy by saying this, because I compared myself with crazy people, and I'm sane. Armageddon was great. You have to see it from my point of view. You can't go and not care about anything. It just shows<br/><br/>how insensitive you all are."
"Vincent Vega-2","8","1","1","30 April 1999"," Analysis
","ok this is my second review for this great movie. armageddon is my favorite of all times. i must admit that the first time i saw it i thought it was pretty boring, but then i started to like it and when i saw it for the second time i already loved it. it has  everything: great score, ending, f/x, actors and above all great and i mean GREAT directing. Michael Bay for me is simply the best director of the world. Better than Spielberg or Cameron. He makes every shot seem perfect. My favorite part of the film is when the astronauts go to the shuttles with the president's speech on the background. I also loved the shuttles take off with Trevor Rabin's score, Bruce Willis promising to Liv Tyler that he will be back (it did fool me). I can't remember an actor or a character that i didn't like. The movie has some unbelievable stunts.   I would just like to thank  Harry, A.J., Chick, Bear, Oscar, Noonan, Watts, Sharp, Lev, Max, Grueber, Halsey and the others i  don't remember for their courage. I also want to thank Jerry Bruckheimer and especially Michael Bay for doing this movie. Thanks to you all. ""Armageddon"" is a kick ass ride!!!!"

Bruce Willis is my favorite actor, along with tom hanks, nicolas cage and harrison ford. ""Armageddon"" is my favorite movie of all times. my number two is ""Saving Private Ryan"".

"froggy2k","9","1","1","26 April 1999"," What's with all the gripes?
","Just saw this movie for the 2nd time, this time on VHS (not wide-screen) -- and enjoyed it as much as when I saw it in the theatre.  OK, if you're one of those who rated Shawshank Redemption as the #1 film of all time, you probably won't like this movie much.<br/><br/>But it's a lot of fun, like an amusement part ride. To enjoy it, you have to like Bruce Willis, which I know some people don't, and you have to like action-adventure movies, which some of the previous commmentators didn't seem to.  Also, Willis is playing a John Wayne type role, the good ol' boy conservative father type, so don't go looking for an eco-fable.<br/><br/>This was the best a-a movie of 1998.  Despite what previous commentators said, the story made sense, there were no plot holes, there was never a time when I thought ""Why'd you do that, you idiot"" as I've thought with better-regarded movies like SPR.  If you think you did find a plot hole, it's probably because you missed something due to the fast pacing. See it again."
"Winnie-6","9","1","1","19 April 1999"," State of the art
","It does make me laugh when people compare this film to Deep Impact.  The films are not even similar apart from the initial storyline!  Armageddon is far, far superior in every way, shape and form.  Actors - Bruce Willis (superb), Billy Bob (brilliant), Steve Buscemi (comic of the year), Ben Affleck (hunky and gung ho) and the amazing Liv Tyler VS Tea Leoni (yeeooorrgghh), Robert Duvall (booooorriing), Elijah Wood (hmmmm, there is potential, just not in this film) Morgan Freeman (ok, one exception) and that annoying Carrie from ER (how cardboard can you get???) Special effects in Armageddon leave Impact for dead.  Impact is not remotely funny - Armageddon pumps up the comedy from every angle. AND most of all - Armageddon crew had access to NASA.  Impact had to rely on a shuttle launch that has been filmed by every other film-maker too. Armageddon may not be realistic but at least it is entertaining, emotional and Liv Tyler delivers the performance of a lifetime."
"13Rose","Null","1","1","11 August 1998"," My opinion?...one of the best movies ever made
","Armageddon, action, drama, romance and comedy.  What more could you ask for? It had great special effects and at the end I could hardly control myself from breaking down into tears.  The romance is special and heart breaking, and the ""one liners"" as you call them make it a hilarious comedy!  The acting was great, it makes you feel like when you walk outside an asteroid is going to fall out of the sky any moment.  It also made me think personally about my family.  At the end you almost feel the pain for Gracie.  I mean come on, her father has just died saving the world and herself, the rest of the world is rejoicing while she is trying to figure out what she will do now without her father.  <br/><br/> This movie gets a 10 in my book."

","Given that I'm doing a PhD on asteroids and comets it was almost in my job description to see this movie.<br/><br/>My career is kind of summed up in Charlton Heston's Narration at the start - an Impact *will* happen again, it's just a question of when.<br/><br/>Of course when the time comes it's not going to be anything like this movie, science isn't as forgiving as hollywood scriptwriters. So I'm going to drop the science right away and get down to the movie, an absolutely fabulous movie were it not for the 'God Save America' sentimentality which drags this movie down. Die Hard on an asteroid. It's good to see an action blockbuster where people aren't killing each other. <br/><br/>There is something to keep everyone entertained in this movie, I laughed at a lot more than the scientific blunders. Steve Buscemi gets all the best lines, Billy Bob Thornton is great in mission control, Bruce and Ben turn in acceptable performances. and all the supporting cast hang around them to give them an environment to work in.<br/><br/>It's easy to see how this could be a better film, but even with these limitations the film still comes out ahead of everything I've seen this summer.

Bruce Willis was good and Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck were wonderful together, and Steve Buchemi was hysterical with his Space-crazy thing going on there.

Anyway, I also loved the cast of characters.  It was rewarding to have a lot of character development in a movie such as this.  My only qualm in that department is that Noonan, the pilots, and the munitions specialists weren't really defined.  But all in all, it was a great movie.

","Bruckheimer and Bay's new actioner goes well beyond their previous films, ""Bad Boys"" and ""The Rock"".<br/><br/>Michael Bay's incredible use of the moving camera and his foresight of the edited product are phenomenal.  He fully utilizes the medium of film and chooses to tell the story visually with tremendous success.<br/><br/>""Armageddon"" reminds me of those rare breeds of action films which move their audience with a deep human element in the story which was not expected when you walk into the multiplex.  Other action films like ""T2"" and ""Face/Off"" have had fantastic longevity at the box-office because they surprise their viewers with a great story at the core of the awesome eye candy.<br/><br/>Essentially ""Armageddon"" is about the power of the human spirit and its ability to triumph over all.  The personal struggles between Harry, Grace and AJ are all symbolic of the perils of an imperfect world.  But, bringing themselves together or having to deal with the heartache of being apart allows them to see deep within their conflicts and bring them to a resolve.<br/><br/>Bay's footage of people around the world preparing for their inevitable demise is so powerful that when I saw three young children running out of a bomb shelter holding toy space shuttles, tears came to my eyes.<br/><br/>
When an action film can make a grown man cry, the movie is a success on so many levels.  I loved ""Armageddon"" for reasons I would have never expected. Watch it without those thoughts of the hype surrounding the film and you will see what I mean."

Here he has three of the finest working actors working at the mo: Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck and Steve Buscemi.<br/><br/>The four of them, along with Liv Tyler and Peter Stormare and most of the other supporting cast give likable believable performances. The action sequences are  good, high-paced and very exciting.<br/><br/>This movie reminded me of ""The Full Monty"", a group of losers take on a task they are completely unqualified to do, and then pull together, needing each other emotionally, to do whatever is needed to get the job done. It attempts an intelligent ending, and has an enjoyable interesting plot.<br/><br/>Best performance in the film goes to the excellent Billy Bob Thornton, who is even better here than he is in ""Simple Plan"" or ""Slingblade"".

Well, STAR WARS wasn't very realistic either, but critics, like the hypocrites they are, always sing its praises. The main reason I enjoyed it was because it would be what me and my friends'd be like if we ever went in space.

As we approach the end of the millennium, more and more movies and programs about the end of the world show up. Liv Tyler is one of the best young actresses ever seen on the big screen. Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck did a good job on this movie. It has more FX shots than i've ever seen on any other movie this year, except maybe, Godzilla. The soundtrack is fantastic. The best song couldn't be any other than ""I don't wanna miss a thing"", by Aerosmith. This is one of the best movies of 1998, rivalled only by The Prince of Egypt and A Bug's Life. People say that movies like this are nothing more than poor crap. I strongly disagreee. A movie like this is meant for entertaiment.

","Alright people, sad as it may sound I have seen this film about 15 times so I like to consider myself as a bit of an expert on what people think as goofs.  First of all, when the Airforce Commander flew to the rig to get Harry, Harry left and yelled to Chick ""Get them paid and off the rig"".  Now they were in the South China Sea.  If they left the rig within a couple of hours, they would have made it back to the US in about 18 hours, (as said by Harry).  Now, there was plenty of time for them to all scatter as the FBI didn't start looking for any of them until after Harry and Grace had been briefed and taken to see the drilling ops.  So in natural fact, the FBI chasing these guys around the country could well be correct.<br/><br/>I am not one to only look at the good points so here are a couple of things I found to be a bit crap - but in a fun way.  When Harry was punting golfballs at Greenpeace, he threw his golfclub when Chick informed him that ""Number 2 had chewed 180 feet"".  However, Harry had the golfclub in his hands when he went to wake up AJ.  (Unless he picked another one up of course).  Also, the guys had 10 hours off the night before they left for Florida.  But they all seemed to return to their hometowns.  Rockhound got a loan from a guy he obviously knew, Chick went to see his ex-wife etc.  Let's all assume that they don't live in Houston, this would have been pushing it, to get a flight to wherever they all came from.  And just one last thing (that I can think of).  Grace was at the Cape saying goodbye to Harry and AJ and was there to watch the shuttles taking off.  The next time we see her is in the Houston control room.  Meaning she must have got a flight to Houston almost immediately after the shuttles took off.  (Probably private bloody chopper).  This rings true as the next time we see Grace is well after the Russian Space Station incident and just before they do their roadrunner thrust around the moon - some 60 hours later.   There I feel better now!"

","I could not count just how many times I have seen this film.  Twice in the cinema but several times since on video.  And it just gets better and better.  But let's not get all serious here.  It is not intended to be utterly realistic.  It is supposed to be a fun, fx movie with a plausible plot.  And indeed it is.  The characters are fun - Bruce taking on his usual role of the grumpy, world saving leader, Ben as the gung-ho jock with a soft spot for his employer's daughter, Liv as the daughter with a small but emotionally charged role and of course Steve as the genius idiot.  Although I was reduced to tears in various parts (seriously, I cried like a baby), this film makes me smile and gives me goosebumps beyond belief.  Although I believe it is time to give Brucey baby some new dialogue - (come on, what's with the ""Let's just ask God to take care of our friends"" and ""I have never missed a depth I have aimed for, and by God I'm not going to miss this.  I will make 800 feet, I swear to God I will"" - I thought his performance was first rate as a dad with a conscience.  Overall, I think it beats everything I have ever seen.  Good fun, great fx and good weepy emotion.  And Liv Tyler is amazing - with three heartwrenching scenes in the control room - ""That is my father up there"", ""I don't have anywhere else to go"" and ""That is my family up there so I don't wanna hear we hope so"".  She should be up for an Oscar."
"GluStick","10","1","1","31 January 1999"," What's the big deal?
","This movie not only had extremely tight action but had a better cast and better acting than Deep Impact. It's probably better to watch it on DVD but it's still great on vhs. The effects are very very very good. Almost as good as Independence Day. I cared about the characters. I don't know why others didn't. Be honest. Did you really want it to end the way it did. Mike Bay hasn't lost one step and I'm glad he attempted an event movie.  It had just the right amount of humor and is jam packed with action. Watch it again if you thought it was bad. Maybe you fell alseep. I know I will watch it countless times on DVD. It was probably the best of all the huge box office blow outs in the incredible summer of '98."
"Wes-26","7","1","1","30 January 1999"," ""A Great Ride""
","I could really care less for what Gene Siskel thought of this movie.  I could care less what every other critic seems to say about this movie.  This movie is great, and if you can't see that then you need to open your eyes. With a creative team of Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer you know this movie will be action packed.  But, what I thought was the real selling point of this movie was the emotions that they tried to hit with the audience. When you watch the scene, in which the fallout sirens start, you can see something so human its scary and sad all at the same time, hopelessness. The cast is wonderful, blending old and new.  Bruce Willis plays Harry, the world's best oil driller.  Ben Affleck plays A.J., Harry's aspiring apprentice.  Billy Bob Thorton plays Truman, a NASA operator that relies on Harry to save us all.  Then, there always has to be the leading lady, Liv Tyler, who plays Harry's daughter and A.J.'s girlfriend.  I can agree that the depth in this movie is not what makes Oscar pay attention.  But, to counter that, I don't want to know the story of Harry's life like Roger Eibert may want to.  In a slower film I would, and maybe it wouldn't have been bad, but I DIDN'T NEED IT.  As with every Jerry Bruckheimer film the cinimatography was excellent.  He is the master at moving the camera and slowing the scene down at exactly the right time.  In other words, the camera moves beautifully.  Now, despite what you have heard, this movie has moments of blunt honesty and deep emotions.  The scene in which Grace asks A.J. if he thought that anyone in the world was enjoying a moment such as theirs, and he responds, quote, ""I hope so, otherwise what the hell are we trying to save."" was one of the truest statements made in a recent movie. Then, there is A.J. screaming I love you as he is lifted from Harry back into the shuttle.  The rawness of the emotions are what make them work. This film would have been cheesy if it was these two sitting there on their way back to earth claiming their love and respect for each other.  A true unsung hero of this movie is the character played by Will Patton.  He was seemingly dark but really was sweet.  One other member of the cast that requires mentioning is William Fichtner as Col. Sharp.  He plays the scared, ""I only do what I am told"" fly boy so well.  And, then, the character change he undergoes is all summed up by him realizing that not always are your superiors right.  It's the little moments in this movie that really make it work.  Each of these tiny moments form up to show the own big picture.  And isn't that what life's about?  Our lives are tiny memories put together to form one incredible life."

","Once again Bruce Willis is given the simple task of saving the world in this mega-zillion-budget bigboys' joyride. An asteroid the size of Texas is about to do to us what another big rock did to the dinosaurs millions of years back (as we are told by Charlton ""Moses"" Heston in the opening credits). Swedish Peter Stormare -who steals every scene he's in as a russian cosmonaut- said to the media after seeing the final version of ""Armageddon"" that ""They cut out all the good parts!"", and apparently ever since he has tried to forget he ever involved himself in this project. The movie sure looks like they left hours on the cutting room floor, but if you just don't think too much about it what's left still makes for good friday night entertainment. Buscemi is once again left with all the smart remarks. He even does an homage to Slim Pickens in ""Dr Strangelove""! Only big quibble; watching the whole shabang makes the tagline ""For love. For honor. For mankind."" seem laughable and stupid. Sure, it ""moves"" our feelings a bit towards the end but how serious can a film like this take itself ? We're talking about a movie where oil drillers from mother Earth play Evil Knievel on an asteroid as it closes in on a head-on collision with earth! One plus; for the first time in years a movie about a crisis involving the whole planet actually shows several scenes from the WHOLE PLANET (like India, France, etc) instead of just pretending that the US is the centre of the universe. It's just about what one would excpect from Jerry Bruckheimer and an asteroid, and it's not half as bad as they say."

","Ok, so there are some improbable things that happen (space station docking the way it was shown), the movie overall was AWESOME!!  I am a  huge scifi fan and I loved this movie.  The excitement begins with Heston's dialogue and doesn't end until the credits.  The plot was believable and the characters were good.  Buscemi was hilarious.<br/><br/>I felt more of the human element in this movie that in that ""other 1998 asteroid movie"".  The action was intense.  If you are a fan of the space program like me, you'll love the scenes at Kennedy, but be able to pick out the errors (i.e., both x-71's taking off near each other).  Bruckheimer continues to show us why he is the action Master.  I will watch this movie over and over again."

Anyway, this movie lacks exactly the ""armageddon"" part (wich you can see in this other movie ""Deep Impact"", or at least a part of the ""armageddon""), but one thing that you CAN'T complain about with this movie is for being boring.. the action barely let's you breath! It's like those expensive rollercoasters that for a minute or two let's you think that you're on the verge of falling from the little car on wich you're strepped on, but then suddenly everything gets allright again even if the speed gets higher, and higher.. this movie is so cool that let's you laugh, get excited, get a little frightened and even, if you are a little predisposed, makes you cry at the end... if you like action movies with a lot of fx and not as much ""thinking going on"".. this one's for you!  :)"

","We didn't see this film in the theater.  They didn't show it in a surround sound room here, and that was a mistake. So, we waited to watch it on DVD, which was released on January 5, 1999.<br/><br/>I've always enjoyed Bruce Willis in action films (i.g.Â—Die Hard trilogy), and Ben Affleck has more than caught the attention of my 16-year-old daughter, and he impresses me as an actor with potential. But Bruce fell short of being as much a remembered oil rig expert as John Wayne was in ""Hellfighters"" (1968). And it was refreshing to see Ben Affleck's lines 1000% cleaner than in either ""Chasing Amy"" or ""Good Will Hunting.""<br/><br/>Just as in the theatres, we decided to rent ""Deep Impact"" first, then see ""Armageddon.""  Two doomsday films released in the same summer.<br/><br/>Although I really enjoyed ""Armageddon"", it was vastly predictable throughout the plot. Even foreshadowing was not subtle enough.  But the occasional verbal and visual references to classic movies (Dr. Strangelove and Pulp Fiction just to name two) tickled my movie buff receptors. And Steve Buscemi continues to be one of my favorite ""independent extras"" with his constant quips and sharp tongue.<br/><br/>The story was thin, the emotions were stilted, but the action and effects were involving.  Definitely worth an evening in your home theatre, but not a flick full of content.  The only depth to this story was the 800 feet of rock they had to drill.<br/><br/>Overall, this film gets an 8/10, mostly for the casting of the motley crew of oil drillers-turned-astronauts, and the action.  It is, afterall, only a movie.  Escapism, in my opinion, is still a movie's best attribute. If you want a space film with drama and action that is more realistic than ""Armageddon,"" I recommend ""Apollo 13."""

","While surfing IMDb for Armegeddon I poked into ""goofs"" expecting to see ""total suspension of Newtonian physics"". For exaample, in the start of the movie three asteroids hit Earth. Statistically the hits should be hit one Pacific Ocean, hit two Pacific Ocean, hit three Pacific Ocean, but noooo....hit one Manhattan, hit two Shanghai, and hit three Paris.<br/><br/>You gotta love Jerry Bruckheimer and friends. They always deliver, and Armegeddon is no exception...but you gotta suspend belief (or disbelief) first, then it's OK. Off to Jerryland to be entertained.

Most pleasing however were the characters themselves (no offense Bruce, but this ain't true of your earlier works).  Bruce Willis is credible, likeable and believable (did I really say that?).  Ben Affleck and Liv Taylor make a great couple -- wouldn't be surprised to see them matched again somewhere -- and the rest of the crew are just plain everyday people trying to do a job.

"pumpkin-8","8","1","1","6 December 1998"," Get over the details, Armageddon was a good film
","First, I would just like to say that I, and many of my friends, thoroughly enjoyed Armageddon.<br/><br/>Next, I would just like to remind the majority of previous posters that Armageddon was a SCIENCE FICTION movie.  With the operative word being fiction.  It is not supposed to be 100% accurate, nor can it be, because it is talking about things that haven't happened.  Many of the complaints people have had show up just because they are either ignorant of physics, or they just didn't pay attention.  Many of the knocks that people have made about Armageddon could have been made about the Star Wars movies.  The ""factual"" problems with Armageddon get in the way of the movie only if you want them to get in the way.  If you just sit back and watch an entertaining movie you will barely even notice them.<br/><br/>About the plot, yes they probably did take a few things too far.  Having the drilling crew be a group of complete losers was a little over the top, and they did fall into some stereotyping of characters, but in general it was fine, because the point was that these guys could drill, even if they couldn't do anything else.  The movie is in no way boring, and even has some areas of originality.  People who complain about the love story should complain just about Liv Tyler's inability to act, because it did add to the plot.<br/><br/>Last, nitpickers get over yourselves.  Armageddon was an entertaining movie and that is why it outgrossed the other sci-fi films (and all other films as well) of last summer.  Critics and lay people who criticize popular movies seem to be out of touch with what the movie going people want."

","The possible end of the world as we know it being a profound concept, Jerry Bruckheimer's Armageddon manages to be entertaining enough to allow me to forget Deep Impact's lack of impact. Although it requires a very long stretch of the imagination to suspend disbelief, the film is better than I expected and, even though I've seen comments from some who I'm sure have never liked any film that cost more than $300 to make, had plenty of story to go with more explosions than a world war. In fact, I think Mister B. could have left out 20 minutes of the character development and still have had a reasonable film.

","What is with all you people being so harsh on this movie? No, it did not have a long and complicated plot, and a lot of the scientific space stuff probably wasn't too realistic (although you'd probably have to be well read and educated in that field to truly judge; otherwise you are being ignorant) but it was an enjoyable movie. And the idea of an asteroid hitting Earth isn't as completely off base as some of you seem to think; if you were listening to the news this year, you'd know that an asteroid (the size of Texas, I should add) has been spotted and may possibly hit earth 30 years from now. Armageddon was not extremely deep and involved but it wasn't shallow either. It pulled at your emotions because you could actually put yourself in the character's place; not in the fact of going out to space, but in dealing with losing a loved one. For all you sour, bitter, ""Armageddon was crap, the acting was terrible, it had no plot,"" etc, just lighten up! Go see Grease 2 --> that'll really give you something to complain about."

There was no lack of action, humor and despite a few scientific mistakes for the purpose of action, this was just a terrific movie.<br/><br/>There has to come a time when you can just sit back and enjoy a movie for the well crafted piece of work it is.

I impulsively bought it, hoping that I would enjoy it. While it may not be the best movie ever, acting or accuracy, I felt that it touched on every emotion a movie can.  I thought it was funny, exciting, very heart-tugging, with anger as well.  No, this movie may not be for everyone, but that is why there are so many different movies out there. Some people hated ""Deep Impact"" and loved this movie, or vice versa.  That's why people make movies similar, but with details or changes in plotlines to satisfy those who didn't like the movies to which it is similar.  I am very satisfied with the purchase of this movie.  I have definitely gotten my money's worth out of it.  Sure, maybe the fact that Ben Affleck should have died about three times may ruin the movie for some, but the movie would have been awful had he and his partners died at those times.  If a movie has the capabilties to make me laugh, cry, and sit on the edge of my seat, it gets my vote."

"TheLittleSongbird","7","5","12","6 June 2010"," Not a masterpiece, but good fun besides
","There are things wrong with Armageddon, but I don't think it is a bad movie. In fact I think it more as a guilty pleasure. It is shallow in the character development, the film is much too long by twenty minutes not helped by the sappy love-story subplot and Ben Affleck got on my nerves. With its faults it is entertaining, and I do think it is better than Pearl Harbor, which had amazing spectacle but was bloated and had an awful script. So what makes Armageddon entertaining? Well, the visuals are incredible, and the music is great. I liked the script, clichéd it may be but there was enough tongue-in-cheek for me to be entertained by, and the film realises it's a parody and that it is politically incorrect something those talentless hacks Friedberg and Seltzer should have already learnt by now. The direction is decent, and the acting was good, Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Will Patton and Steve Buschemi coming off best. Overall, no masterpiece by all means, but it is not Michael Bay's worst movie and definitely not the worst movie ever. 7/10 for the entertainment value and the visuals alone. Bethany Cox"

","I'm sure somewhere inside this jumbled mess of a movie there's a decent film to be found. But alas, somewhere in the editing room, this film was hacked up & slaughtered & another notch was added to Mr. Bay's movie-shotgun of death.<br/><br/>This movie had everything going for it. Bombastic end-of-the-world storyline; awesome, state-of-the-art visual effects; amazing cast of actors that can actually act; and Michael Bay.... oh, & there's the rub.<br/><br/>I hate to take part with all the overblown Bay-bashing, but-... and it's not that the guy's a hack per se. He actually knows how to stage a frame & shoot a camera. I was even a Bay fan when he first came out with ""Bad Boys"", which had lots of style, laughs and action. I enjoyed ""The Rock"" even more. But it's here with this overlong movie trailer that Bay lost me. And subsequently with ""Pearl Harbor"" & ""Bad Boys II"". And my feeling is that it's with the editing.<br/><br/>I know he comes from TV commercials and music videos, and we do live in an MTV world, but come on. It's like, if they let a shot last longer than 5 seconds they would be afraid of losing the audience somehow. Dramatic scenes have no effect because of this, and the amazing digital fx aren't on screen long enough for the audience to enjoy. And the action sequences are too messy to follow. And I know this ain't the fault of the editors because they know too much to cut film in this style. So whether it be Bay making these choices, or the studio heads, it'd be nice for the editors to stand their ground & make the films halfway tolerable to watch.<br/><br/>Anyways, with a film like this, you either love it or hate it. And nothing anyone says will deter you either way. (1/2* out of *****)"
"forrestwrs","1","4","9","13 September 2010"," The Michael Bay School Of Film
","Armageddon was a cheese ball of a mess. Michael Bay must have worked extremely hard to make sure this movie was about as god-awful as he could get it.<br/><br/>I'll start out with Mr. Bay. The Michael Bay School of Film has three rules: Rule#1: Have stuff go wrong *constantly!* It raises tension and totally never gets annoying or takes away from the storyline! Rule#2: Explosions are good! Put in lots and lots of explosions! Rule#3: Move the camera constantly! Like, every single darn shot! Never ever pause to look at anything or develop a scene! No, we don't have the time for that stuff! A lot of the disaster in this disaster flick was really confusing. The scene where the space shuttle is destroyed and everyone inside it dies was pretty cool, but I had to rewatch that scene twice to see what the heck was going on and who was even in the shuttle.<br/><br/>Now, I won't start bashing the movie for being scientifically inaccurate. I can let a lot of that slide. I'm watching this to be entertained, not taught. Of course, it could at least entertain me. That would be nice. And a lot of the movie had moments where I was going ""Okay, no. That's where I draw the line."" For instance, they knew 18 days ahead of time that this asteroid was coming? If you know *anything* about astronomy, you know that it's extremely difficult to predict when an asteroid is going to hit the earth. You have a better chance of predicting next year's weather forecast. But what really struck me was that the movie was really predictable. I won't give away the ending, but halfway through the first act, you're probably aware how it's going to end anyway.<br/><br/>As for the screenplay and storyline itself... holy god what a mess. First of all, through the first half hour of the movie I was going ""Okay, it'd be nice if you would slow down and take some time to develop some of these characters. Or at least let us learn something about them."" And then he did slow down. Way too much. He just decided ""Screw it,"" and didn't take his story *anywhere* for a good half-hour or so.<br/><br/>And then he brutally forces a lot of the emotion in the movie. It's like in those retarded spoof movies where the filmmakers are going ""Laugh, darn it!"" except Bay is saying ""Cry, darn it!"" To give it credit, there was the scene with Will Patton and his ex-wife that was actually pretty well done. Of course, the scene barely finishes before we cut away from it (in fact, I'm pretty sure the scene wasn't quite done yet). What does he cut to? A strip club. Thank you for that, movie. I didn't start watching this to see a drama about an asteroid destroying the earth. No, I wanted to see a strip club! Continuing on, the characters were really poorly developed. A good example is Ben Affleck's character. I mean, why am I supposed to care about this guy?? He's obviously incompetent, makes all the wrong choices, and he's kind of a douche bag. He really is just useless. Am I supposed to care about him because he's in love with Liv Tyler? I'm really not sure why she is anyway, except because, as Bruce Willis even says early on in the film, she ""doesn't have any other options."" This brings me to the acting. God did these actors suck. I really expected a lot out of Willis. I look at Die Hard and Pulp Fiction and I think, ""okay, he's going to give a good performance."" But, he really doesn't. I mean, for the first act of the movie he has some non-descript accent. And then he loses it as the story progresses. Then there's Liv Tyler. At least now I know where Kristen Stewart learned how to act for the Twilight movies. Tyler's entire performance was based on moping and never ever changing her facial expression. As for Ben Affleck, he sucks. Plain and simple. He was annoying, I hated his character, and he just sucked.<br/><br/>There were a couple of redeeming actors, however. Steve Buscemi actually gave me some entertainment from his on screen persona, and Will Patton seemed to put in some effort and try. I'll give them points for giving decent performances.<br/><br/>Another very redeeming quality from the movie was the music. The soundtrack was awesome. I really just wanted to turn off the picture and just listen to the music. But, alas, I could not.<br/><br/>As for the special effects--the Oscar nominated special effects, no less--they were really cool. But they were also done in a hurry. We'd see about seven seconds of special effects and then the movie would get ADD and start filming stuff falling down somewhere. The cameraman just didn't seem to be able to stick with the scene no matter how hard he tried. Ever.<br/><br/>Frankly, this is one of the worst directed movies I've ever seen. There's hardly anything entertaining about it and the main character seems to be the $4 million explosions rather than Willis, Affleck, or Buscemi. And the characters were extremely hard to keep track of, the action sequences were thrown together haphazardly, and a lot of the logic in the movie was just bulled together. The movie was just bad. Disjointed, campy, incompetent, and bad bad bad.<br/><br/>2/10"
"g-bodyl","10","4","9","12 April 2008"," So much better than expected!
","I must say that Armageddon is the best movie of 1998! The film has mind-blowing special effects, tons of humor, and great sci-fi action. In the movie, a NASA director discovered that the Earth had 18 days before it's demolished by an asteroid. He and his colleagues trains a group of oil drillers for space only in a few days. Then the director played by Billy Bob Thornton sends the team to the asteroid and they must place a nuclear warhead in the meteor or else. I don't know why there's negative hype about the film, but I enjoyed it a lot. The all-star cast led by Bruce Willis, Thornton, and Ben Affleck was just amazing. I liked the song by Aerosmith in the film. I recommend this movie to everybody, but try to keep all the negative things out of your mind when viewing this film. I give this film a 10/10."
"sddavis63","2","4","9","25 March 2007"," At Best A Bad Joke
","Where does one begin with this movie, except to say that it's very bad. Let's begin with some of the more obvious things. First, it's hard to believe that with all of today's available technology an asteroid large enough to destroy the world could be found only 18 days before it hits! But let's assume for a moment that it's true. NASA decides that the only way to stop this from happening is to send people with drilling experience to the asteroid to implant explosives to blow the thing up. Well, maybe, but then we have to take seriously the proposition that the only people in the world who could do this are the rather motley crew assembled. We then have to believe that in less than 18 days (they have to be assembled from all over the world and then they have to fly to the asteroid, which would surely take 2 or 3 days anyway) they can be trained first to deal with space flight and then to actually work on the surface of this asteroid (surely drilling on an asteroid is a little different than drilling on earth?) It kind of makes a mockery of the whole astronaut training program doesn't it? Completely over the top performances from everyone involved make this movie cartoonish. Complete with the requisite love story between Grace and A.J. (Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck) it's really a bad joke, although the last few minutes, which feature Harry's (Bruce Willis) eventual solution to the problem weren't bad. Still, no better than a 2."

If space missions were done in this manner then we would rename astronauts as cowboys and they would no longer have to be rational, smart, or have any common sense. I call this a comedy because the writing is so bad its funny. So yes watch this movie its a nonstop Michael Bay piece of trash, its popularity reminds me how Bush became president, actually I bet the President likes this movie, i bet he takes notes so he'll know how to handle this kind of situation.

I've read so many posts from those who somehow enjoyed this movie, and who essentially said in their posts that the special effects were wonderful, viewers should sit back, stop thinking, and just enjoy the movie, etc.  Well I like to think when i watch a film.

Of course there have been a number of great movies with mind blowing special effects, such as T2 and The Matrix.  Really interesting plots, at least decent acting, and yes, good special effects.

Sure, there have been such movies prior to this debacle but this ridiculous gross of this idiot movie would seem to indicate that this style of film is here to stay, whether we want it or not.<br/><br/>We all know the premise of the film already:  Bruce Willis, deep core driller and the most unlikeable main character to grace the screen in a long time, is asked by the government to help destroy world threatening asteroid.<br/><br/>To tag along for the ride is Ben Affeck, generally a favorite of mine, whose romantic leading man character is so schmarmy as to give the strongest amongst us stomach palpatations.  Scenes between he and Liv Tyler (in yet another typically Hollywood throwaway cheesecake female role) made me yearn for a handy airline barfbag.  Romance is well and good but these scenes were painful, as if director Michael Bay learned everything he knows about romance from Hallmark commercials.

","Not only is this movie horribly, horribly bad from a movie making standpoint, it also has flaws in the science big enough to fly a 747 through. Constant, even gravity on the Mir? Yeah, right. Slingshot around the moon in less than a minute? Maybe in the Starship Enterprise. Split the asteroid in half with 1 nuke, only 800 feet below it's surface? That's like trying to split an apple in half with a capgun cap buried half a centimeter under it's skin. And don't get me started on the editing. I don't know what's gotten into filmmakers these days, but I like for movies to at least stay with one shot long enough for me to tell what's going on. The ""monkey on crack"" editing style of this movie gave me a headache fifteen minutes in.<br/><br/>Other problems include the fact that at the end of the movie, not only did I not care a bit about any of the characters, I couldn't even tell you their names. There was not a single moment of genuine emotion in this entire movie. Every time they wanted a reaction, they'd crank some Aerosmith music to tell you how you should feel in that scene. I honestly felt no emotional attachment to anyone in this movie. Other things just made no sense at all, like the machine guns on the moon rover things they had. What was that about? Were they expecting to find Marvin the Martian on the asteroid and riddle him with bullets?<br/><br/>Bad editing, no emotion, bad script, bad, bad science. It all adds up to bad movie.

Who do I trust? My science teacher, or director Michael Bay, whose middle name is Shallow and whose mental bays are routinely lapped by waves of total bull****.<br/><br/>Bizarrely, the film stars Bruce Willis, who is way cool, and Ben Affleck, who destroys cool.

Yes, this literally is a film about blue-collar American oil-workers saving the world via Independence, Freedom and nuclear weapons. It's also narrated by Charlton Heston, who loves guns and thinks multiculturalism ruins democracy. Nice.<br/><br/>The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, the Michael Bolton of movie producers. He makes jingoistic sledgehammer movies, one of his earliest being the super cool ""Top Gun"", which had enough rock-n-roll machismo to impregnate a battalion of house wives and which cast Tom Cruise as a sexy American Nazi.

The fecal matter really collides with the cooling appliance, though, when we realise that Bruce Willis, who is way cool, must sacrifice himself to save the planet. He's so brave.

It paints a back-lit corporate fantasy of rural and urban America, a land of overalls, proud faces, checkers games on the main square, couples necking in Chevrolet convertibles, and flapping American flags. A giant advertisement for itself, the film is a testosterone soaked celebration of white, male, American values. You know, like military might, Bon Jovi, strip clubs, oil fields, apple pie, Norman Rockwell and the ultra smoking Liv Tyler, offspring of an Aerosmith lead singer and an Elfish Queen.

After about ten minutes of horrible acting non stop destruction and a script with so many plot holes in it you would think it's swiss cheese you would wish that you were dead.  It starts off with Bruce and all his other red neck friends drilling for oil in what looks like the Atlantic.  Here we get to see Bruce running around with a shotgun (very dangerous) and a small explosion that had no purpose but to stop people from falling asleep.  Then Bruce and his friends get picked by the U.S. government to fly two space ships to the asteroid and blow it up.  In the movie each man gets ten days of training and half of them can't even read, and it still gets worse then this. This film has only two subjects in it that stops you from hanging yourself, one of my favorite actors who's name I can't recall (he was the bad guy in FARGO) and the astounding eye popping special effects. I give it 1.5 out of 10"

","""Deep Impact"" was bad enough, but compared to this it's a masterpiece of subtlety and artistry.  I like to be entertained at movies as much as the next guy, and I like action movies too.  But this bombastic, blow-hard insult to one's intelligence is sheer crud from its opening minutes on.  The script is complete drivel, and this is a classic example of piling on the special effects and noise and hoping no one notices how abysmal the writing is.  Bruce Willis has never been more obnoxious, and Liv Tyler gives the year's most insipid performance.  I'd like to give an award to anyone who can relate the plot of this film with any coherence while managing to keep a straight face!"

","In terms of value for budget dollars spent, ""Armageddon"" is the worst movie ever made.  The movie has nothing to say about anything; it is purely an exercise in eye candy.  It is a piece of product without feeling plugged into the machine of feature film distribution.  It is cold and cynical, believing that all the audience wants to see is physics.  Judging from the box office, maybe the powers-that-be that green-lighted this project were right. But what about the movie?  The acting ranges from passable (Willis) to gut-wrenchingly awful (Affleck).  A mannequin named Liv Tyler plays The Beautiful Girl with all the verve and passion of a piece of shrubbery. The story goes that this movie was green-lighted and put into pre-production without even a script; it would be hard to argue after viewing the results.  There are many great screenwriters out there that can't get work, and then here comes this barely-even-written film to add insult to injury.  I had heard that living legend Robert Towne (Academy Award winner for ""Chinatown"") ghost wrote dialogue for a scene or two in this film; imagine how the movie would have been if he had been hired to actually write the SCRIPT instead of just doctoring dialogue.      The movie plays with all the depth of a Levi's or Pepsi ad; it looks like a music video for the movie ""Armageddon"".  Only on a purely visual level does ""Armageddon"" work at all, and even then it is heavy-handed and obvious, with shots screaming out ""look how cool this is!"", subtle as a sledgehammer. Michael Bay, Jerry Bruckheimer and their ilk have perpetrated yet another abomination on the cinema; as if ""The Rock"", ""Con Air"", etc...weren't bad enough, now we have this piece of space debris.  At least product like this keeps the studios going so that worthwhile movies can be still be made."

","This is one of the worst.  It was almost torture having to sit through it. This movie made no sense what so ever.  The effects were cool and they casted some good actors but that's as far as they got.  I just can't believe somebody actually wrote this and thought they had something good.  The whole thing is just ridiculous.  Nothing in the plot even comes into the same universe as believable.  I tried to just ignore the silly plot and enjoy it, but it was just too much.  The actors have very serious roles in a comedic plot and it just doesn't work.  After sitting through this I wanted to ask for my money back.  They should be paying me to have to see through it, a total waste of two hours."
"starfury-3","1","3","6","2 January 1999"," A story pitch made into a movie
","Some folks know a little about how some movies are made; a person or a group of people pitch a story idea to a studio.  This is before a script is completed.  The studio either likes the idea and contracts a script, the idea is changed a bit *then* a script is written, or the idea is scrapped altogether.<br/><br/>Alas, Touchstone Pictures didn't go the latter route; instead they did something which is all too common in movies these days: they made a movie using the story pitch and didn't bother spending money on paying someone to write a script.<br/><br/>Characterization is utterly non-existent.  ""Armageddon"" seems more like a 140-minute Pepsi commercial.  Nice images of standard Americana and world culture are splashed upon the screen, trying to drag emotions from the unforunate viewer.  But without backstory or an iota of character development, the viewer is left emotionless (unless of course the TV commercial tactic worked).<br/><br/>We care little of Affleck and Tyler's ""romance"".  How do we know they are really in love?  Because of an animal cracker?  Bruce Willis' character is wasted as well.  Just who is this guy?  Where did he come from and what does he stand for?  Other than the fact that he is a great oil driller who doesn't like employees sleeping with his daughter, we know nothing of this man.<br/><br/>The only interesting character at all is Billy Bob Thorton's ""Dan Truman"". Perhaps interesting is a bit strong; we only seem vauguely attached to his character because he seems to get the most screen time.  He is the most human of the crash test dummies that are wandering around the screen.<br/><br/>The special effects, while well done, surely can't save this one.  Another insipid film came to mind when watching ""Armageddon""; ""Independence Day"". We see taxi cabs hurtled into the air (in fact, it seemed as if the meteors were aiming at taxis alone), and New York landmarks destroyed.  But comparing these two dogs of American cinema isn't doing right by ""ID4"". ""Independence Day"" seems like ""Citizen Kane"" compared to the illogical and downright awful ""Armageddon"".<br/><br/>The bright side: If there is a sequel to ""Armageddon"" (working title: ""The Rock""...oops, thats taken), it would almost have to be better than the original."

","Michael Bay was one of those director I think is criticized too much and deserves more credit for his movies, especially this one. Bruce Willis plays Harry Stamper, a veteran astronaut who is informed by NASA of a Texas-sized asteroid heading towards Earth. In determination of saving mankind, Stamper gathers a group of blue-collar workers to drill a hole through the asteroid and set a nuclear bomb inside to blow up the asteroid before it crashes into Earth. This film features a stellar cast of actors including Ben Affleck, Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, Billy Bob Thornton, Willaim Fichtner, Will Patton, Keith David, Peter Stormare, and Liv Tyler. This is one of Michael Bay's most enjoyable films. The plot is compelling and well written, the action scenes are great, and unlike most of Bay's films, this one has heart and emotional resonance. Critics were definitely wrong about this movie.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the amazing cast this film features. Bruce Willis does okay as Harry Stamper, the main character, even though his casting is a bit off at various points. Liv Tyler does a great job as Grace, Harry Stamper's daughter who is in a relationship with blue-collar worker A.J Frost (played by Ben Affleck), despite her father's disapproval. The rest of the cast was really funny, cracking hilarious one-liners here and there, especially Steve Buscemi. Some people expressed negativity to this, mostly since the film revolves around the impending destruction of Earth and is supposed to be serious. However, it wasn't bother by the humor, I thought it fit well. Aside from the cast, the action scenes taking place in space were fun to watch. These scenes includes typical eye-popping explosions that Michael Bay is known for, along with great special effects. While there is all the action, humor, and fun that many would enjoy, there is also some emotional scenes towards the climax at left me choked up. <br/><br/>Armageddon does have it's flaws.Aside from the occasionally clumsy acting, there is one scene I found a little obnoxious, which is a scene involving Ben Affleck's character singing a corny little love song to Liv Tyler's character. Overall, this movie is very enjoyable. Don't listen to what critics say, I found this film to be entertaining and fun to sit through."
"emperor_bender","7","3","7","25 February 2008"," What's wrong with people?
","When I look at the comments for this movie, I see a few things in common among all the ""critics"" here. Every person who rates this badly seems to take this movie way too seriously. I noticed America is the only country to do anything in this movie, but the story would have fallen apart if there were 20 other countries going for it as well. It's not being ""racist"". Also, the main characters aren't supposed to be ""astronauts"", this isn't Apollo XIII or whatever, oil drillers going on an asteroid to blow it up, come on, its different. We don't want another boring space movie. The main parts I'll agree with people in bringing this movie's rating down were the drama, and Ben Affleck. The drama in this movie was very misplaced. It was very long, drawn out, and plain boring. I felt no emotion watching it whatsoever, and I wasn't supposed to as this wasn't supposed to be a drama movie in the first place. Then there's Ben Affleck, the king of the drama. WHy was he in this movie? In fact, why is he in any movie? He ruins every movie he's in. He likes to steal the spotlight and even when he has it he doesn't keep my attention. I wanted him to die so badly here...oh well, one can dream right?"

Don't think I'm emotionless, for example when I saw ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" I cried very much... But this is absolutely another sort of movie, it's like hundred tons of cliché packed together in just one film. Add to this horrid acting (Steve? What have you done?) and dumb storyline. On the other hand, there are many positive moments and mainly thanks to very cool special effects and at least the movie absolutely isn't boring.<br/><br/>Made for masses, appreciated by the masses.

The acting is so over the top and dialogue so corny that the characters weren't came off as walking statements over real people. Other movies that came out around this time like Dantes peak, Volcano and Deep Impact ranged from bad to mediocre but at least they had a few characters who came off as real people with real lives.

"Aidan McGuinness","4","3","7","31 January 2002"," Oh dear...A popcorn crunching, no brainer piece of junk
","""Armageddon"" is the sort of movie that people can use to point out the decline in Hollywood standards. It's bubble-gum/popcorn/no-brains mass-market and lowest common denominator fare. It's a pile of well marketed (and somewhat executed) drivel. Leave your brains behind for this one.<br/><br/>Let's look at the things it did well first - ""Armageddon"" looks mostly pretty in terms of the visual effects - watch those cities get destroyed (although the New York one is extremely eerie). That's not surprising - when you have the likes of Jerry Bruckheimer producing it generally means a meaty budget. The movie is swiftly paced - you're launched immediately into the action and given little time to start thinking (because then you'd begin to savage it). The sound editing is also fairly spot on - sharp and crisp and generally well timed. <br/><br/>And now for all the rest... I can't let the plot go by. It's completely and utterly ridiculous. The crew have gone on record as admitting that the science of the movie is a load of cobblers and it is - sound and fires in an area with no atmosphere, gravity where it shouldn't be, never ending count-downs, a weakly contrived solution to the asteroid problem... the list goes on and on. ""Memento"" it ain't.<br/><br/>As the movie is fairly fast we're not meant to consider this (and apparently the movie producers felt we were too stupid to notice them anyway) but we cannot help but consider the sloppy direction that Michael Bey employs at times of fast action - which is shaking the camera all over the place in a manner that's meant to emulate the terror and confusion of the scene but instead merely irritates and detracts from the moment.<br/><br/>As for the acting - *shudder*. It's no surprise Liv Tyler got nominated for a Golden Razzie and that Bruce Willis actually won one for this picture. The characters are so thinly drawn and so hammy that I actually laughed when they opened their lines at the drivel they spewed. Talented actors like Steve Buscemi and Billy Bob Thornton are wasted here - you can't lend that much talent when the character you're playing is riddled with more cliches than a millipede has legs. <br/><br/>May I make a point about patriotism and family values? This movie features an American Presidential speech so cringe-inducing it makes Bill Pullman's from ID4 seem positively mellow. Let's not forget the schmaltzy family scenes we're forced to witness every now and then as families prepare for the end (good riddance to them) and the scenes of the world anxiously awaiting freedom from America (as if any other country could help out...). Then there's the love-scenes between Tyler and Affleck that make you hope they never get back together to avoid future wincings from the agonized viewer. And many other overly-sentimental poorly-executed moments that will make you understand subtlety is not a word these people are familiar with.<br/><br/>""Armageddon"" does everything brash and bold in an attempt to woo us that the shuddering mess underneath is actually a decent picture. Well - it isn't. If you can leave your brain at the door and turn off all critical faculties you may enjoy this other brainless hookum. If, like me, you're a discerning viewer than don't bother yourself the pain. The only thing I'll take from this movie is the eerie sight of the Twin Towers after the meteor strike and their resemblance to the actual attack's aftermath. Which still leaves me giving the movie 4/10."

Turn off your brain and enjoy.' I can GUARANTEE these people that I enjoy `2001: a space odyssey' or `Nights of Cabiria' or `Rear Window' multiple, MULTIPLE times more than you liked `Armageddon'. These films are more enjoyable because it is a simple fact that it is enjoyable to see something you haven't seen before, to see something that involves the viewer in the story, to have your brain engaged. `Armageddon' is so predictable and so trite as to be repulsive to anyone who has seen a blockbuster film before. It's exactly the same stuff as you've seen time and again and you know precisely what will happen next. No amount of explosions can change that.<br/><br/>I will not mince words or hide behind platitudes.

","I'm looking back at this review I wrote back when I seemed to not know any better, and I guess its one of those times as a movie critic your position HAS to change. When I first saw Armageddon, I liked it, I liked its energy and its sense of humor, and the kind of Michael Bay style theatricality that went with it. That was when I was 14. Since then I've seen the film a couple more times, and each time I saw it again I wondered how I could've given such high marks to a film that is really of low quality. Armageddon is popcorn entertainment incarnate, but it brings more of the lesser qualities than the better- cheesy, overwrought acting style (could someone please tell Ben Affleck to never cry again?), over-stylized special effects, and a sense of humor that is always the same- a little weak and PG-13 predictable in the guise of wit. There's romance, but its never as long as one might like. The ground control scenes with Thornton, maybe at times the only bits of good in the film, are also weak and over-produced. I guess as I get older and see more films stuff like this just isn't as entertaining anymore."

But you have to turn off far more than usual to watch this film. You have to give up any sense of discovery, or ambiguity, because this film has neither. You have to turn off your brain entirely,  from the pacing, the limp plotlines, to the gut churning photography where a shot more than 10 seconds long that hasn't rotated, spun, zoomed or swept is a chance to let your stomach settle. The characters couldn't utter their lines less convincing ways, the supposedly great special effects were used to support such lousy science it was far more of an affront than in the old days when lousy effects went with lousy science. Every single scene looks like a cliche commercial from some product or another. Why do astronauts have to walk in slow motion? Why do they have to have an explosion of some kind every 10 minutes or less? From exploding oil wells, exploding cars, exploding space shuttles, exploding space stations, exploding astronauts, you get the idea. Just how many explosions can people see in movies before they get tired of it?   The aptly named Armageddon will doubtless be the movie Satan chooses to use to torture people in hell, and it would probably have the damned there begging to go back to burning forever or being eaten by cockroaches after about 6 minutes. The only mildly amusing thing in the entire movie is the fatalistic Russion Cosmonaut, but you'll get better value from a 10 seconds of an old Yakoff Smirnov routine.

"Leofwine_draca","6","2","4","8 July 2015"," An effects-laden Hollywood blockbuster that works
","Another big-budget brainless blockbuster film, this bombastic offering is surprisingly enjoyable. Definitely the more entertaining of the two asteroid films released in '98 (the other being the more intelligent, but rather stodgy DEEP IMPACT), this kicks off with an effects-laden opening which shows a shower of meteorites hitting New York and demolishing/blowing up just about everything in sight.<br/><br/>Of course, it has to go downhill from there, and some characterisation mixed with lame comedy filler follow for a short while. Thankfully things soon pick up with the exciting space mission and the two and a half hour running time literally flies by. There are lots of dollops of sickly sentimentalising thrown into the mix too, for good measure, but these aren't dwelt on, thankfully enough. Thankfully the producers realised that they were catering for a primarily male audience and made the film a macho testosterone-pounder instead. And it's a good one!<br/><br/>This film's style is to have loads and loads of quick exciting scenes edited together really fast so the action keeps cutting from place to place. While this is fine occasionally, for two and a half hours it becomes a bit overdone and tiring but thankfully I didn't notice too much. A lavish score adds to the pace and for once the special effects aren't the star of the show; I think this is why this film was a success, because it's about people more than it is about the latest in CGI technology. Sure, there are lots and lots of (good) computer effects but these only serve as a backdrop to the characters in the story.<br/><br/>A good cast also help to smooth over any cracks in the film and it becomes easy to forgive. A baldy Bruce Willis is the hard-bitten hero who predictably enough gets to save the planet, I liked his performance but he showed he was capable of much more than the one-dimensional hero in THE SIXTH SENSE. Billy Bob Thornton (so good as Jacob in A SIMPLE PLAN) gets to emote and look extremely stressed as the poor guy stuck on the ground while Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler supply the sentimental dross which I could have done without. An ever-amusing Steve Buscemi lends the comic angle as the astronaut suffering from ""space dementia"" while familiar faces like Owen Wilson (THE HAUNTING), William Fichter (imagine a young Christopher Walken), Michael Clarke Duncan (THE GREEN MILE), Jason Isaacs (EVENT HORIZON) and Keith David (THE THING) fill out the welcome supporting cast. Even Peter Stormare (the thug from FARGO) appears as an overacting Russian! <br/><br/>Extra fun comes from guessing who dies next and the action doesn't disappoint either with plenty of tense moments. Armageddon is not exactly intelligent entertainment but it's a fun, easy to view film with the budget all on screen and with plenty of laughs and thrills along the way. You can't say fairer than that!"

","These days it's become fashionable to regard any Michael Bay picture with extreme derision, particularly amongst the critical community. However, upon recently rewatching Bay's 1998 blockbuster ""Armageddon"" I am forced to admit that he has indeed directed a few watchable movies.<br/><br/>The story here is fairly preposterous but what do you expect from a big-budget disaster movie? In this case, a meteor that could wipe out all of mankind is hurtling toward earth and no-one seems to know what to do about it. However, before long, NASA scientists decide that humanity's best bet is to send a rag-tag team of misfits into space to blow the meteor apart before it's too late.<br/><br/>The movie has a fairly hefty 151 minute runtime but I don't really think that it's entirely justified. There are some parts that feel like contrived diversions meant only to superficially create drama or to contribute to characterization. The movie is also guilty of being somewhat maudlin at times and also a bit too overtly patriotic. Nevertheless, over the long haul, the script holds together well enough to retain your interest without straining credulity beyond the breaking point.<br/><br/>One big asset for the movie is the loaded cast. Sure, stars Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck & Liv Tyler have all been better elsewhere but the real meat of the cast is in the supporting players. There are some of the best Hollywood character actors here like Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan, Will Patton, William Fichtner, Peter Stormare & Keith David. The filmmakers even managed to get Charlton Heston for the opening narration. It'd be difficult not to appreciate a cast like that, no matter what kind of material they've got to work with.<br/><br/>On the visual side, Michael Bay's direction is well handled but his penchant for quick cuts is in evidence throughout the film. Sometimes this works well but other times it seems superfluous (though it isn't necessarily distracting). The Oscar-nominated special effects have also held up surprisingly well.<br/><br/>Musically, the movie's a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, there's some classic ZZ Top, Aerosmith & Curtis Mayfield but on the other hand there's some Journey, Jon Bon Jovi and, of course, Aerosmith's schmaltzy Dianne Warren-penned smash ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"". Trevor Rabin's score is pretty solid throughout, though.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Armageddon"" is a worthwhile big budget spectacle. The storytelling may be a bit clumsy but the movie actually has a fair amount going for it. As far as popcorn entertainment goes, you could certainly do a lot worse than this."

","If 1969 and the moon landings mean anything to you, if you like space hardware, if you dream of flying in the space shuttle, if you like to see things blow up frequently, if you are thrilled by backwards-ticking clocks that have to beaten before the bomb goes off, the world is doomed, there is no escape, if your love of these things is big enough to forgive a so-so script and several large plot holes that you could drive an asteroid the size of Texas through, then you'll love this film. I'm guilty on all charges.<br/><br/>I knew this film was going to kick ass as soon as I heard the magisterial tone of Charlton Heston's voice-over at the beginning. When this was closely followed by a space shuttle being blown apart by asteroids and the destruction of large parts of an American city I was a very happy man. Even though I liked Deep Impact, this film is better – it destroys more things, more effectively in the first 10 minutes and thereafter grabs you by the throat and never lets go until the end credits.<br/><br/>I will freely admit that one reason this film grabs my attention so much is the extensive use of the space shuttles and the excellent NASA footage and locations. It really gives an impression of what the shuttle is like, what a launch is like, how dangerous it is. Certainly liberties are taken and things speeded up such as a docking with Mir that happens so fast that in reality it would knock the station into an orbit with Saturn. There is also the slight matter of how a shuttle survives hitting several gazillion-ton asteroids but can have a whole wall blown out by a few bullets.<br/><br/>Oh yes, the plot. Asteroid heading for Earth. Bruce Willis drills big holes for his oil company. US govt. hires Willis to dig hole and plant nuke on said asteroid. Willis recruits dirty dozen type misfits for mission. NASA training. Paranoid military types. BOOM. BANG. Backwards clocks. Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler provide lurve interest.<br/><br/>The script shows signs of being written by committee and some of the one-liners fall flat. When I introduce the law to ban trailers I will also introduce a 50 year moratorium on speeches from American presidents who say they are doing something in co-operation with the whole world whilst in reality they use one comedy Russian in the whole thing and accidentally blow up Mir in the process. I will also order directors of further Doomed Earth films to find some different national monuments to represent the other nations of the earth.<br/><br/>Anyway, these small gripes aside, I thoroughly recommend this film to anyone who, like me, enjoys brainless science fiction thrillers with loads of special effects and Bruce Willis in them. It is a sheer joy to watch and I shall be going back to see it again"
"mfnmbessert-224-279128","8","2","4","6 March 2012"," Armageddon (1998)
","Extremely underrated disaster flick, from the same year that Roland Emmerich's 'Godzilla' appeared, 'Armageddon' hits home on a more emotional level than most typical action adventures. The pacing is decent, the characters are all pretty well-developed, even though there is the occasional piece of dialog that was thrown in there to explain some things to the audience. I was thinking about apocalypse/end of the world movies, and I really can't think of too many great ones other than 'Night Of The Living Dead' which sits in an entirely different genre than 'Armageddon', and 'The Road' from 2009 which is also on a completely different scale. In the realm of action-adventure disaster films, 'Armageddon' sits near the top of the list. Maybe it's just me, but they really don't make 'em like this anymore. The characters are all just a little bit too developed, the story is a little bit too human. It tugs at your conscience, unites every person together in a sense that they are all in the struggle to fight against one common enemy, the asteroid. In a way, I am reminded of the awful TV movie 'Asteroid' starring Michael Biehn but that is again, in a pretty different realm. 'Armageddon' is serious work, our cast all play their roles nicely, Billy Bob Thornton of course got more star billing on this piece than he probably deserved, Eddie Griffin's minor role in the beginning is kind of annoying, Jason Isaacs is most convincing as one of NASA's lead scientists, Owen Wilson's role in here is something I had forgotten about also being that he pretty much quit the action scene and moved on to comedy in the years that followed. Professional Russian Peter Stormare is probably one of the film's most likable characters, but most impressive is really Bruce Willis, and that's the way it should be. He gets the audience on a more emotional level than he ever has probably, and still manages to keep that mean uncle sneer on his face the entire time, and doesn't mess around like he's making another 'The Fifth Element'.<br/><br/>All factual inaccuracies aside, like the notion of having fire in space, which we are treated to within the first two to three minutes of the film being the most obvious, 'Armageddon' stands strong as a criminally underrated disaster flick. Definitely well-worth your time compared to the trashy flicks that tried following in it's footsteps like '2012' or 'The Day After Tomorrow'.<br/><br/>'Armageddon' -----8/10. (Now I can't even capitalize 'Armageddon'? Wtf, Internet Movie Database?)"
"The-Sarkologist","8","2","4","2 October 2011"," Bruce Willis saves the world - again
","Armegeddon is defined in the movie as being the time in which the world ends. In the bible it is the name of a final battle where the world rises up against God and God fights back and wins. It is described as being a blood bath where blood is ankle deep. The reason it is called Armegeddon is because it is fought on the plain of Megiddo which, as one of my friends says, is a pretty good place for a battle. The movie, on the other hand, is a little like Deep Impact. I say a little because it seriously romps all over the former movie. Deep Impact came out first but after seeing Armegeddon you wonder why anybody would actually want to see Deep Impact. This is a much more well thought out movie with a singular plot and a lot of excitement. Deep Impact opens with a car crash and a government cover up and the period of excitement is watching a huge wave wipe out the east coast. Armegeddon opens with the destruction of the world and then goes straight into a meteorite shower striking New York city. They first think it is nukes but realise that they have a whopping great big asteroid coming towards them and they have only 18 days to prepare for it. Thus they find Stamper (Bruce Willis), the world's best oil-rig driller, and ask him to help them with the machinery to drill into the asteroid. He ends up taking his crew into space to drill into the asteroid. The movie is very entertaining with much more laughs than Deep Impact. The characters are a little light hearted and we can appreciate the jovial manner. Then there is the asteroid itself: it is a very fearsome thing that has a very Gothic feel  to it. It is mostly shrouded in darkness and it seems to be alive as his attempts to stop the miners from destroying it. We know that it is not alive, but the problems that are continually mounting upon it create a situation of utter urgency. There is no end to the excitement in the movie, and the fact that a huge shower of meteorites is heading for the earth gives way for much more destruction than Deep Impact. Armegeddon is about the end of the Earth, but we all know that the world will be saved, we know from the beginning that they are going to destroy the asteroid. That is inevitable. What we watch the movie for is to see how we get to that spot. The psychology of the movie is what is interesting. There are fears that an asteroid will come our way and there is no way we can stop it, not with out technology. There is a fear in the populace that something like that will happen so what we have are movies that reassure us that no matter what happens, we can overcome such difficulties. A scientist theorised that such a thing could happen so everybody panics. We are sheeps and will believe anything that we are told, and we are being told that we have the power to stop the end of the world. The truth is we cannot. When Christ returns only those of us who follow him will be saved, all other will have to face his wrath. Thus Armegeddon is a good movie but puts false hopes in us."

","The only reason I gave this movie more than a 1 is because it has some fun explosions and special effects. That's actually also the reason why I'm sick of watching these kinds of movies. It seems there is no attempt to make meaningful dialog or have characters that are anything more than cliché. The tough, macho overprotective father, the cute, sexy and smart, but delicate daughter, the cool, competent hero boyfriend, the token Russian that drinks vodka while the Americans SAVE THE WORLD, etc. On top of the cliché characters, the story-line was so predictable, I felt like I didn't even need to keep watching. Raise your hand if you didn't know that Bruce Willis's character was gonna go die for the world and tell his daughter's boyfriend to take care of his daughter? That's what I thought, NO ONE didn't see that coming. This movie made me wanna puke!!!"

","Even after more than 10 years, it is still a really good movie. I knew the whole story, seen it several times, but it has been maybe five years since I saw it the last time. And I still like it - as others have said; it is ridden with goofs and other blemishes, but overall the actors do really great - even those characters I don't like are performed by actors doing a convincing job of making me not like them. The digital effects are - in retrospect - not that bad. And the irony and humour is great - the underlying feel of this movie is that we are all human, we all make mistakes, but we have to make it together - or not make it at all. This movie is like a roller-coaster ride - you might still try it to get that feeling from your first time..."

","By no means whatsoever was this a good movie but you have to admit, it was never intended to be. I was just grateful alone that it smashed Deep Impact.<br/><br/>An overall comedic and rounded out cast complemented the typical one liners and visual eye candy galore. Michael Bay is just one of those directors who puts on a show for the masses. I don't think it's all that different than Roland Emmerich or even James Cameron and Steven Spielberg. Don't get me wrong, Cameron is far more skilled at story telling and at redefining the movie experience but you'll never see Cameron do a Scorsese type movie. Spielberg does the same thing. Heck, he exec produced Transformers which Bay directed. Spielberg just has a unique talent when it comes to almost all kinds of movies. He's not type cast while Bay is pigeonholed. <br/><br/>My one complement to the film was the ending. Liv Tyler wasn't all that convincing when it came to saying goodbye to her father but Willis stayed true to his hard nose characters who go out strong."
"tburke85","6","2","4","15 June 2009"," Armageddon A Good But Overlong Action Aventure
","Armageddon is a good but overlong action adventure from director Michael Bay who does show his talent with this movie but the running time of 150 minutes does weight it down a bit. Bay none the less proves to be a skilled filmmaker no matter how good or bad his movies turned out. The talented cast are admirable in their roles including Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thorton, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, Will Patton, and Steve Buscemi. Jason Isaacs, Keith David, Peter Storemare, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Owen Wilson in a brief appearance are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The special effects are state of the art even though you can tell it's CGI. The action sequences are intense but it's the scenes in between and the slow pace at times is what hurt the film the most at least to me. The music seemed to sync very well with what was happening on the screen including the song by Aerosmith and it fit the tone of the film.There was some suspense build up as the giant asteroid in space gets closer and closer to Earth while the heroes desperately try to destroy it in time to save their planet. The ending was touching but I found it to be a little predictable but fortunately the good outweighs the bad in this one. Armageddon isn't a great movie but it's not too bad either if it had been shorter I probably would've enjoyed the film more than I did. Overall despite it's flaws, Armageddon is an overlong but for the most part an entertaining adventure with just enough action, some suspense, thrills, impressive special effects, humor, a little romance, and good performances by the cast who make it worth watching at least once."

You don't always like Harry (Bruce Willis) in the movie but at the end you love him for doing what he thinks is best not only by saving the world but by his daughter as well. It wasn't that Harry wanted to be the hero. He knew that AJ had to go back alive for his daughter's sake. It was an awesome movie that had it's lovey dovey scenes but also for those who like action films, there was plenty of that too as well as the fall off the seat funny moments. A movie to be enjoyed time and time again for all to watch and love."

","Now I love this film for the sum of its parts... Steve Buscemi as Rockhound - a great actor and some of his one liners are excellent. Peter Stormare as the Cosmonaut is damn funny, and many of the actors all add something. Bruce Willis hits a chord with me as a Father, as I was in poor health and possibly leaving my only daughter. Willis had me laughing at the beginning when he tried to shoot Ben Affleck and then I was in tears as he said goodbye to his daughter. Is it 2001 A Space Odyssey, no it is not (but then I think that is highly over-rated) and am I a pretentious critic? No - I will watch a film on its merits and judge it for that. If they had tried to portray this film as a deep and meaningful comment on the human races attitude to our planet, then yes it failed miserably. Personally, I thought it was an ENJOYABLE film bit OTT in places, bit predictable in others but worth watching overall."

"Wiseguy52585","3","2","4","14 November 2006"," Michael Bay should be shot...
","This movie is more proof that Michael Bay really IS the worst director working in Hollywood today. I know that many people are quick to point out that this film is strictly an ""action"" movie, and is not meant to be Oscar bait. That's no excuse.<br/><br/>An action movie can still have a relatively intelligent script, good direction, and not ruin a perfectly talented cast of actors.<br/><br/>The only aspects of the film more insulting to the viewer's intelligence than the script are the direction and editing, both of which apparently seek to set a new record for number of useless, ineffective cuts. And the first hour or so of the film seems only moderately terrible. The only enjoyment that can be gleaned from midpoint on (after the ridiculously implausible shuttle launch) is watching and pondering how this film could possibly be any worse.<br/><br/>I guess Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay wanted to add another credit to their list of films that fall under the category of ""using corny, cheesy effects and making good actors go bad"" (see ""The Rock,"" ""Con Air,"" ""Pearl Harbor""). Such talents as Willis and Buscemi are utterly wasted; Billy Bob Thornton is even bad in an utterly useless part that serves no real purpose, other than to occasionally grimace at the horrible set of circumstances standing before him.<br/><br/>The gaping plot holes, the cornball cinematography and direction, the dialogue (essentially a series of terrible one-liners that land with a practically audible thud every couple of minutes) - they all add up to an overstimulated, overacted, overdone mess which lacks any cohesion and, after the first hour and fifteen minutes or so, only succeeds in eliciting a splitting headache for the viewer.<br/><br/>Avoid at all costs."

","That is exactly what ""Armageddon"" is about, the possibility of the end of mankind. The United States government recruits an oil driller and his employees to save the Earth, because they are the only ones capable of doing the job. The film stars Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck in the leading roles, with Liv Tyler (the daughter of Aerosmith rocker Steven Tyler) co-starring. Which actually, Steven Tyler does some music for the film, including a music video.<br/><br/>The performances in this film were spectacular, especially Bruce Willis and Liv Tyler. There are some touching moments. For example, when Grace and A.J. are out together by themselves, playing with the animal crackers, and she asks the question, ""Sweetie, do you think anyone else is doing this same thing at this exact moment?"" And A.J.'s reply to her, ""I hope so, otherwise, what the hell are we trying to save?"" Those two sentences make you think about life. And this film makes you love and care much more."

Its got all three ingredients of most movies - action, laughter and emotion - although each in their own capricious quantities. Michael Bay doesn't need an introduction and neither does his work. He is one of the best action movie directors who can really pack a punch behind his action. This movie is definitely up there with ""The Rock"" and ""Face/Off"". No character development or depth in the storyline, but why would one need it in a Michael Bay action production? Armageddon has got some astonishing special effects, edge of the seat action, is funny at times, a talented star cast, mushy emotions, moneys worth and well ... space shuttles too! What it also inexplicably has is a low rating on IMDb."

I enjoyed how there were countless one-liners that added a light-hearted approach to the most perilous of situations. Seemed like something funny was said at least once every 2 minutes or so. The casting was great...it was great to see Steve Buscemi in an intelligent role instead of playing the oddball, like he does in most Adam Sandler movies. Granted, there are some rather cheesy lines scattered here and there, but then again what movie doesn't? Occasionally you'll come across a scene after you've seen the whole movie a few times where you'll roll your eyes because you have to sit through it again. Armageddon is sometimes a little fast-paced, and I had to watch it a couple times to keep track of all the characters and what was going on with each of them. Special effects were great though. Keep in mind Armageddon is NOT perfectly in-tune with science. I've counted many aspects of the movie that don't line up with science (either realistically or mathematically), but dwelling on those errors will only prevent you from enjoying the movie. Do yourself a favor, and leave science to those who care enough to point that stuff out. Hope you all enjoyed it as much as I did!"

","When Steven Spielberg opted to jerk and move his cameras while panning Normandy at the beginning of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" I was taken in by the gesture, as it provided realism and an honest look at the brutality of war. In other words, you felt as if you were actually there, storming the shores with those brave men.<br/><br/>In 1998's vile ""Armageddon"" the cameras never stop moving. I wasn't waiting for the end credits to roll as much as I was patiently anticipating a scene during which the cameras did not flutter around like a bad MTV ad. To my bitter disappointment, Michael Bay's jerky direction simply--desperately--attempted to cover up a bad screenplay and script with attention-deficit disorder techniques. Bay's plan would have worked in a three minute hip hop video or a 30-second Super Bowl commercial, but he failed miserably with this epic waste of time and resources.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton are not just miscast in this disastrous pile of debris, they seem completely lost, as well. Now I first watched ""Armageddon"" on the big screen, after which I literally had to make my way to the nearest drug store for Asprin and stomach medicine. Michael Bay has mastered the art of big, empty, poorly executed motion pictures that, none-the-less, make millions at the box office. This has more to do with months of expensive advertising campaigns and shrewd publicity, for which Mr. Bay and company should be commended. But you get a candy bar rather than a nine-course meal, which makes for a quick rush rather than a fulfilling movie-going experience. And after the first ten or fifteen minutes of ""Armageddon"", you realize the rush is wearing off. Then the headache sets in.<br/><br/>The plot is improbable at best. If you insist on torturing yourself, I'll leave the details of the climax out. But be warned: this is supposed to be science fiction and, in science fiction, it helps to base the premise on some semblance of science fact. There is none to be found here. I was not convinced that a bunch of brainless, renegade oil-diggers could blast off into space to save the world. Not for a minute. But, like I said, if you insist on buying into a senseless plot about unlikeable characters--and you actually enjoy headaches--then run to your nearest DVD retailer and grab a copy.<br/><br/>Just don't say I didn't warn you!"

This is usually fine if it has a certain limit, but this takes it over the top.  I absolutly hate it when they manipulate the laws of physics to fit a script rather than the other way around.  Add in an attitude where the only country competent enough to save the world is the USA and not even the best of the best of the country and you get a horrible fake movie.<br/><br/>Stupidest line in the movie:""You better listen to him, he's one of the smartest men in the world""<br/><br/>I give it a 9 for special effects and 0-2 for everything else.  Which is a 4 overall."

","I do not understand the furor this movie created.  It is far far from the worst scifi I've seen in the past few years.  And I know the science is all wrong - who cares?  If the science actually mattered, the only things we could watch would be documentaries on Discovery and PBS!<br/><br/>Armageddon, like most Bruce Willis action movies is funny.  It is very very funny, especially Steve Buscemi.  Rockhound is as funny as any of his off-beat characters in Tarantino or Rodriguez movies.  Peter Stormare is excellent as the space happy Russian cosmonaut.  Bruce Willis is as always, wry and dry.  He has a splendid talent for comedy that isn't always appreciated.  <br/><br/>I'm not very knowledgeable on special effects, but the asteroid itself becomes a sinister presence in the movie.  While I realize that no asteroid ever seen looked like that vision of hell, I don't care.<br/><br/>So, if you want to see a fun scifi, watch Armageddon.  Forget the carping. Enjoy."

","I read a few comments on this movie and i think that some of you are taking it far too seriously.  This film is pile of american patrotism, some very cool special effects, some very famous faces and some incredibly bad dialouge.  However I think that is all it was ever supposed to be, none of the cast take it seriously in the film and seem to be having a good laugh rather than acting in most scenes.  Why else would the gifted likes of Bushemi, Thornton and Tyler ever appear in a film of this type?  This film has the 'die hard' thing going on, great film to look at, you will gasp, laugh, root for the good guys, cheer when the bad guys (or asteroid) get got, the only thing you won't do is think but that is okay sometimes. Imagine a world where the only movies ever made had the emotional depth of 'the shawshank redemption' or the twist ending of 'the usual suspects' we would all go mad, desperatly searching the earth for a piece of entertainment was mindless and just fun, that's all this movie is...fun."

","Michael Bay, obviously tired of being harped on for being just an action junkie, turned his focus towards the stars (literally) when he made Armageddon...a cross sci-fi/apocalyptic excursion in ignoring basic laws of physics and maintaining credibility with your audience.<br/><br/>First off, no movie with Ben Affleck in it can be good.  Everyone demanding a refund for Gigli can attest to that, those of us still wanting refunds for Pearl Harbor can sign contractual agreements to that.  I don't care if Bruce Willis is in this, Jerry Bruckheimer knows that shoving Affleck's fat face in the frame is going to get him more money in the bank than Bruce's sweaty back.  My, how times change.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Bay's shot composition is all wrong.  Ridley Scott made thousands of commercials, yet that influence is barely visible in much of his work (until recently).  With Bay, it is all-to-obvious that he came from the realm of music videos and 30-second spots.  David Fincher also came from this world, but he has superseded any and all expectations of him, Se7en and Fight Club cement that stance in the ground.<br/><br/>Where Hollywood gets these plots from is anyone's guess.  This is apparently one part Dirty Dozen, one part SpaceCamp, one part Moonraker, and a pinch of Star Wars thrown in for good measure.  In other words, it's scraping the bottom of the barrel.  Using ""Leaving on a Jet Plane"" as a sentimental song and the equally inexpressive Liv Tyler was a faux pas on Bruckheimer's part.<br/><br/>Overall, one big dumb movie, that's all there is to it.  1 out of 5 stars."

The acting is a career low for everyone involved, the script is beneath contempt, and Michael Bay's direction is the cinematic equivalent of a war crime. <br/><br/>Quite simply, the production, release and success of this movie ranks as one of the darkest hours in the history of mankind.

","In my opinion, this was the better of the two ""end of the world"" movies that was released in 1998. The other movie I'm referring to is Deep Impact. Now while this movie was OK, the plot was definitely not as well done as Armageddon. You never really got to know those characters, and when the astronauts had to crash straight into the comet (which was nothing compared to the Texas-sized asteroid) i could've cared less. I didn't care if Elijah's character saved his wife, or if they all died. But in Armageddon you find yourself falling in love with all the diverse personalities of each character. Harry Stamper with his deep love for his daughter, A.J. Frost with his ""I'll do it my way"" attitude, Oscar Choi with his hilarious comments, Bear with his kindness, Rockhound with his obsession with women. Not to mention the wonderful cast of actors and actresses that played them: Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, Michael Clark Duncan, Steve Buscemi, and of course the amazing talents of Owen Wilson! (if you haven't noticed, Oscar was my favorite character!) And at the end of this movie you find yourself bawling over the great losses, or at least i did. Definitely another great Michael Bay film."

"boondocksaint20","Null","2","4","1 February 2003"," Though flawed, an emotional and exciting thrill ride!!
","I don't get all of the critisms on this movie at all.  Apparently, this is one of those movies that some people really love and some people really hate.  I've encountered my fair share of both types of people over the years, which even though I liked it, I have to respect, in a way, that if an overwhelming amount of people didn't like it, then obviously it is not a movie for everyone's taste.  That's perfectly fine by me, I know there are movies out there that others love that I really disdain as well...but in this case, to call this movie a 'gold polished turd' is really stretching it.  Sure you have your stereotype characters...this IS a Jerry Bruckheimer production afterall...he is by no means a genius director or producer, but he has a formula that works about 2/3 of the time which is to make loud, fast paced, action packed movies with huge budgets that are thrown at our faces at a million miles an hour.  Movies like The Rock, Gone in 60 Seconds, and Enemy of the State all have this fast-paced, testosterone feel to them...but since most of them succeed in entertaining us, what is the big deal?  My question is this, were the people who truly hated this movie totally bored with it?  If the answer to that question is claimed to be 100% true with said person, I find it incredibly hard to believe.  But anyways, that's enough on that subject.<br/><br/>I really like this movie, though by no means is it one of my personal favorites, it is still one of those that I love to watch every now and then. I saw it with my girlfriend at the time, twice in the theaters and we loved it each time (it was the first movie I had ever seen more than once in the theater).  I swear though, most movies (except maybe Glory, Saving Private Ryan and Shindler's List) can't make me feel the emotional extremes that I love/hate to feel in a movie, but this one always does.  There are several scenes in particular that get me every time, ***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** one of which was when Will Patton's character, 'Chick', is walking off of the shuttle and there is his ex wife and child waiting for him.  The look on his face gets me every time.  Also, the moment of reckoning when Colonel Sharp realizes that Stamper can drill to the maximum depth and decides not to ignite the nuke.  Both scenes always give me a cold shiver, which to me is welcome.  You have a good script, good characters and wonderful special effects in addition to that feeling of humanity that looms around the impending doom that is headed towards Earth.  They truly did an incredible job making space feel almost as claustrophobic as it really is.<br/><br/>My major complaints, of course, are with the direction, mostly.  It seems choppy and uneven in places, and a few scenes seem like they were cut too short.  Also, the characters are often given stupid lines and there is a slight air of cheesiness throughout the whole movie...but other than that (which are actually most of the complaints you will hear from those who simply hate this movie) I really like this movie and think honestly that it got a really bad rep by the sanctimonious critics.  I can't believe that 'Deep Impact' another movie with basically the same plot that was out at almost the same time as Armageddon, got better reviews than this one.  Deep Impact was a horribly acted, boring and sophomorish attempt at trying make the audience cry...it was all sappy and not exciting at all.  Armageddon, though sappy at parts, does in fact succeed in many scenes, especially the end which made most people cry in the theater when I saw it.  Also, the movie tries not to take itself too seriously and it, most importantly, is fun!<br/><br/>So anyways, if you haven't seen it already, I encourage you to forget the rather harsh negative reviews on this one, check your brain at the door, and enjoy this emotional thrill ride. 8/10 stars.  That's my story and I'm sticking to it."

I was surprised over and over again at how blatantly the story disregarded what-ever happens to be on it's way to where-ever. It seems that the writers and producers collected every short cut in every sci-fi movie and then hid behind the old I didn't start it - clause.<br/><br/>In fact when I think of what the writing process had to be like, a Monty Python sketch comes to mind. The one with Graham Chapman as the producer, and the terrified writers flying out left and right.

Despite an exciting and engaging beginning the movie soon becomes a blend of amateur melodrama, bad writing, cliches and hammy performances. I'm sure everyone has seen this by now but just in case it's about a group of miners who are sent up to space to blow up an asteroid before it wipes out earth. Although Liv Tyler eventually became a good actress her performance here leaves something to be desired. There's no chemistry between anyone but it's all quite goofy and messy. I'm actually a fan of Jerry Bruckheimer I enjoy his balls to the walls aesthetic when it comes to making movies but the film is an absolute dud.

","Armageddon was the most hated movie by film critics for years. It was the second movie in 1998 about a huge asteroid tumbling towards earth. The other movie was Deep Impact. Considered to be the ""serious"" one of the two movies.<br/><br/>There is not much story here. Harry Stamper, an expert oil driller is brought in by NASA to help them with a plan to destroy the asteroid before it hits earth. That's it. A cast of roughnecks as they are called go along with Harry into space to land on the asteroid to drill a hole big enough to get a nuclear bomb far enough to blow up the thing. Armageddon was directed by Michael Bay. And even though this was his 3rd directing gig it was the first of his movies that he showed the most of his directing and editing rapid fire style that he known for. Personally he has taken this to the limits especially in the Transformers movies. It is supposed to be adrenaline pumping action but at times it is so over the top that it is exhausting. Armageddon is like that. Big, loud and exhausting at times. But, it's fun. As much as I agree that this movie is as dumb as anything ever to hot the screen it is just fun. The cast includes Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thorton, Liv Tyler, Owen Wilson and Steve Buscemi. Among other less known actors. You would say that this movie comes under the ""so bad it's good"" category. Maybe so.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","I always watch a few minutes of this movie whenever its on, trying to understand the ""hatred"" that viewers supposedly have for Michael Bay films. I never do. I can only ever make sense of it by assuming that the masses need objects for communal hate, just as they do for communal love. In this way, Bay has unfortunately become an emblem of tasteless, disposable cinema. So Steven Spielberg = good, Michael Bay = bad. This mindset is what Orwell called the ""gramophone mind"". In principle there is little difference between the aforementioned two; Steven's films are only slightly less empty than those of Bay.<br/><br/>On pure filmic grounds there is just one really huge problem that this movie has, and thats the editing style Bay adopts once we're in space. The jazzy, frayed film-cutting is very unpleasant, and, as it turns out, a poor choice. Because ironically, while its intended to pump up the volume, it actually makes the viewer numb and squanders any excitement the action scenes might generate. Such head-pounding montages add up to over an hour of the film. Other problems include an overkill of gay mano-a-mano moments. Liv Tyler is obnoxious. And, this movie essentially has no characterization; most of the characters are meatheads and have interchangeable dialogue.<br/><br/>The money-men haven't held back; this is a massive, massive project. Apparently they got access to actual NASA labs and facilities. And Bay has shot it beautifully for the most part. The creepy asteroid is the most surreal and outlandish place we've been to since since the derelict spacecraft in Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. The Armadillo is as awesome as the Nolan Batmobile. I think that, with some reasonable adherence to space science and a leaner, more well-organized screenplay, this could have been a much more balanced movie. Bay's previous 'The Rock' is better, and also has great humor.<br/><br/>The current generation of film viewers is a lazy one, having gotten used to relying on Tomatometer percentages rather than individually analyze & evaluate a film's merits & demerits. Armageddon is indeed an out-and-out corporate product, but it has undeniably inventive visuals. Image is the language of cinema, and if Kubrick is the Kafka of film, beginning the transformation of image grammar, then Bay must be kinda like Dickens, the master of conventional storytelling.<br/><br/>The detractors of Armageddon are the equals of Jerry Falwell."
"freemantle_uk","4","0","0","8 June 2009"," Bayham Disaster Movie
","Like most of Michael Bay's film they are a lot of problems with this film, being too long, bombastic, overly edited, has poor acting and dialogue and very right wing. Armageddon is one Bay's poorer films.<br/><br/>The premise is simple, an asteroid the size of Texas is about to crash into Earth in 18 days. They has been a meteoroid shower destroys a NASA space shuttle and causes destruction in New York City. NASA and the American does not revile the fact that the asteroid was going to crash into the Earth. NASA also believe that a nuclear strike would not destroy the asteroid, so decide that they need a team to go onto the rock and drill a Nuclear bomb into it and destroy it that way. No NASA team is trained to do it, so NASA controller Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) tries to recruit Harry Stumper (Bruce Willis), an oil driller who has a reputation for drilling in tough environment. He agrees to help but only if he could use his own team.<br/><br/>The plot is complete rubbish. It's easy to poke holes into it, such as surely wouldn't NASA notice an asteroid the size of Texas much earlier? Why not just train a team of astronauts to do the drilling (Ben Affleck pointed that one out)? Why such an complex and expensive plan? Why not just get America and Russia to fire every missile they could at the rock? The film also breaks the laws of physics at many points. Such examples are how could a Space Shuttle land on a asteroid and how could an asteroid have Earth like gravity?<br/><br/>Armageddon follows the two maxims of disaster movies; first America is great and second, what ever can go wrong will go wrong. This happens all the time in the film, such as the Russian space station blowing up, a space shuttle getting destroyed, one of the drilling missions flowing off into space, the other space shuttle nearly can't take off and it goes up to the last second before the bomb blows up. Also it shows its America that saves the world, that the Russians and even the Chinese are backwards, gives the shuttles the names Freedom and Independence.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise to me is that J.J. Abrams co-wrote the script and he is a man who brought the world Alias, Mission Impossible III and the new Star Trek film. The film is too long, and drags very quickly. The film is also trying to be funny and most of the time the jokes fall flat.<br/><br/>As a director who is most of the time derided anyway, Michael Bay does a really poor job here. He cuts too much so you can't see what's happening and they are many continuity errors. Such examples are when A.J. (Ben Affleck) is shot and changes which leg is shot and when the French Bulldog attacks Godzilla, from toy models to a giant balloon: a poor editing job there.<br/><br/>The acting is hit and miss. Bruce Willis tries his best, but it's not his best work. Liv Tyler was hit and miss. Ben Affleck is poor as always. Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson and Michael Clarke Duncan offer comedic relief, at least they have gone on to do better things. The strongest actors were Billy Bob Thornton who is excellent actor and Will Patton, whom character Chick does at least seem to have some depth to him.<br/><br/>There are some positives. They are excellent special effects and action sequence, especially when New York suffers the meteoroid shower. The score is good, but can be overbearing at times.<br/><br/>At least most of the people involved have done better things afterwards. Michael Bay did the Island and Transformers. Bruce Willis: Sin City, Live Free or Die Hard. Liv Tyler: Lord of the Rings, the Incredible Hulk. Michael Clarke Duncan: Sin City, The Green Mile, etc...<br/><br/>It best not to see this film unless you really turn your brain off."

The technical details, the reasons they wanted THIS man instead of someone trained for space duties... I just find that my suspension of disbelief fails me here, and I simply found myself saying, ""Yeah, right."" However, that being said, the humor of the story is great. It's subtle, not in your face, and Willis, as always, has some excellent sarcastic zingers done in such a subtle way, that the laughter just sneaks up on you. Comedy is a nice twist for him. In the end, I honestly have to say that I was not expecting what happened. I figured, ""Oh, this is going to be sad, the kid is going to die, and Willis's character will learn a lesson, and him and his daughter will be so close...blah blah blah - blech!"" When that WASN'T what happened, I must honestly say, I was both pleasantly surprised, and I cried. Yes, me, the woman who very rarely ever cries at any movie, cried at the way this one ended.

","The latest testosterone-saturated blow-'em-up from producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay (The Rock, Bad Boys) continues Hollywood's millennium-fueled fascination with the destruction of our planet. There's no arguing that the successful duo understands what mainstream American audiences want in their blockbuster movies--loads of loud, eye-popping special effects, rapid- fire pacing, and patriotic flag waving. Bay's protagonists--the eight crude, lewd, oversexed (but lovable, of course) oil drillers summoned to save the world from a Texas-sized meteor hurling toward the earth--are not flawless heroes, but common men with whom all can relate. In this huge Western-in-space soap opera, they're American cowboys turned astronauts. Sci-fi buffs will appreciate Bay's fertilizing of technology, even though it's apparent he doesn't understand it as anything more than flashing lights and shiny gadgets. Smartly, the duo also tries to lure the art-house crowd, raiding the local indie acting stable and populating the film with guys like Steve Buscemi, Billy Bob Thornton, Owen Wilson, and Michael Duncan, all adding needed touches of humor and charisma. When Bay applies his sledgehammer aesthetics to the action portions of the film, it's mindless fun; it's only when Armageddon tackles humanity that it becomes truly offensive. Not since Mississippi Burning have racial and cultural stereotypes been substituted for characters so blatantly--African Americans, Japanese, Chinese, Scottish, Samoans, Muslims, French ... if it's not white and American, Bay simplifies it. Or, make that white male America; the film features only three notable females--four if you count the meteor, who's constantly referred to as a ""bitch that needs drilling',"" but she's a hell of a lot more developed and unpredictable than the other women characters combined. Sure, Bay's film creates some tension and contains some visceral moments, but if he can't create any redeemable characters outside of those in space, what's the point of saving the planet?"

","Or for that matter,ANYONE'S hearing. That was the question that I had from watching this film in the theater almost exactly ten years ago.<br/><br/>This movie had the audacity to pick on another fellow summer flick,Godzilla,and while that big-budget Roland Emmerich film was certainly replete with its own over-bloated budget,frenetic special effects and silly dialog,it at least was FUN,never trying to take on any air of seriousness or emotional grand-standing like this film.<br/><br/>YOu're probably familiar by now with it. Texas-sized asteroid head for Earth. NASA,in the person of a sober,reasoned chief(Billy Bob Thornton,still hot from his Sling Blade win from two years before)decides instead of using their best and brightest to do the dirty work,enlist the help of ""the best"" team of oil-drillers(led by a sweaty,sardonic Bruce Willis). Of course,as a meteor that size hurtles to Earth,there is,of course,the natural doom that comes with it and this film spares no time in pounding away the gravity of that,with slow moving tracking shots of people all around the world looking to the sky,slow shots of large American flags,slow-mo shots of astronauts and the drill team as they're heading for their capsule(and destiny,it's implied).And of course,pre-requisite romance involving two of the cutest and least interesting characters in the show(played in utter earnest by cute Ben Affleck and pretty Liv Tyler). Wrap it some drippingly earnest Aerosmith music,and you've got ""winner"" stamped all over it.<br/><br/>A little aside here:no trade secret here but as this was released about a month after Dreamworks' Deep Impact,it and DI get comparisons to each other. To me,while DI was about as much fun to watch as watching a cancer patient slowly die,I still came away with more respect for that film than this sort of cowboy,""EArth's gonna blow up unless U.S.A. sends their toughest to save the day. YEEEEEEEHAAAAAWW!!!"" film,which,besides being unnecessarily LOUD(which I think was no mistake by the filmmakers to amp the volume of an already noisy film,evidently under the principle that ear-splitting=memorable),the movie also commits the following crimes: science that was written for people who flunked science class in high school(fire and noise in space come to mind instantly);working my favorite element of this film Steve Buscemi as a likable,if sleazy,comic relief for about two-thirds of the film before trying to turn him into a treacherous character toward the end(maybe the reverse of his turn in 1997's Con Air); practically wasting Owen Wilson and character actor Will Patton in the flush to keep the cameras steady on Willis,Tyler and Affleck;not making up its mind whether it wanted to be a brainless-but-enjoyable summer action flick,a patriotic type thriller or a semi-comedic buddy-to-the-third-power flick.<br/><br/>Another reviewer said that how DI and A differed was a matter of tastes,that people who appreciated thoughtful,more realistic dramas would appreciate DI,while action-lovers would go for A. Perhaps so,but I happen to enjoy a good brainless action figure like the next male,and I STILL found myself angry after this film. Perhaps it was mostly about my hearing that made me steamed,but that should account for something where your film enjoyment goes,right?"

","I enjoyed this movie even thought I'm getting tired of these kinds of movies always taking up 15 screens at a 20-screen theater.  It does the job it says it will do, the effects are adequate, and the characters are funny.  I strongly advise that you take some aspirin before and after you see it, because this movie is a pounding assault on the senses.  I'm glad I didn't see it in a theater because everyone I talked to said that it was way too loud.  I laughed when I read that Disney executive Joe Roth said that they probably wouldn't have made this movie if they would've known how expensive it was going to cost.  I think what he MEANT to say was that they wouldn't have made it if they knew it was only going to make 200 million dollars in the U.S., because that was probably how much it cost.  No doubt they were expecting a $300+ million super blockbuster like ""Independence Day"" or ""Jurassic Park"".  Poor babies.  Oh well, I don't think Bruce Willis or Michael Bay or Jerry Bruckheimer will be out of work any time soon.  It's too bad Bruckheimer doesn't produce thoughtful movies like ""Thief"" anymore."

Most of the characters are awesome, and the story while dumb is very cool and exciting!, plus Bruce Willis is simply amazing in this!. The opening has an hilarious bit with Eddie Griffin and i thought it had some cool emotional moments as well, however if only Ben Affleck wasn't casted!. The finale is excellent and very emotional, and i thought Liv Tyler was great in her role, however she didn't have much chemistry with Affleck. The ending is cool and Steve Buscemi cracked me up throughout the film!, plus i thought Willi's acting was fantastic!. The character development is actually really good, and some of the action scenes blew me away, however i must admit i was bored at the start, but that's OK, because it soon becomes an action packed thrill ride!.It's pretty well written and made and i thought Willis and Affleck had a great emotional moment together as well(even though Affleck over did it badly), plus one of the funniest moments in the film for me is when Willis starts shooting at A.J (Affleck). This is big dumb at it's finest, it starts of a little slowly, but really picks up in the 2nd half, with incredible effects and lots of exciting action, and i say it's a must see!. The Direction is great!. Michael Bay does a great! job here, with wonderful camera work, awesome angles, stunning visuals, adding some cool atmosphere, using great set pieces, great zoom in's and zoom in's and lots of other cool shots as well, plus he kept the film at a very fast pace for the most part. The Acting is excellent for the most part!. Bruce Willis is amazing as always, and is amazing here,he is extremely likable, hilarious a major bad ass, is fantastic in the acting department, played one of his coolest characters, did wonderful in his emotional scenes, was intense, and i don't know how how he put up with Affleck but he did!, he was amazing! (Willis Rules!!!!!!!).Ben Affleck stunk up the screen just like i expected him too, his character is extremely grating and unlikable, he had barely any chemistry with Liv Tyler, his animal cracker demonstration was laughably pathetic, and he almost had me fooled at the end with his scene with Willis at the end i almost felt sorry for him, but he over did it big time with his crying, he was awful!.Liv Tyler is stunningly beautiful, and did excellent in my opinion with what she had to do, i liked her a lot, however her chemistry with Affleck was off. Billy Bob Thornton is very effective in his role as the NASA administrator, and was quite likable. Steve Buscemi is absolutely hilarious, and cracked me up throughout the film, i loved him!. William Fichtner is a very solid actor and here is no different he had a rather unlikable character at 1st but i soon liked him. Will Patton is great here he had a cool character i liked him lots. Owen Wilson is fantastic as always, and is very funny here, i just wished he had more screen time! (Wilson Rules!!). Michael Clarke Duncan is good with what he had to do i liked him. Peter Stormare annoyed me with his accent and his Russian character, i wished he didn't stay alive. Ken Hudson Campbell(Max Lennert ),Jessica Steen(Jennifer Watts, Shuttle Freedom Co-Pilot),Keith David(Lt.

"sdrshadow","1","3","8","26 March 2002"," An explanation for the outrage.
","I would like to address the people who say that it's just an action movie, chill out, etc... I, personally like brainless action movies, but there has to be a limit. My limit came when I saw this piece of Hollywood garbage. I won't go into the plot or details of innacuracy, everyone else has done such a great job of that already. I just want to say that the reason some feel so passionate about this is because we have seen certain movies that show the heights of the creative mind at work, you can see the sweat of Welles when you watch ""Citizen Kane"", Kurasawa's passion in almost anything he's done, and even today watch Kenneth Brannagh's ""Henry V"" and you see an incredible acheivement in filmmaking. When I watch a film I want to see the work, the passion, the love of film. I feel when you watch something like this there was no passion(except for a quick buck), no love of the movies or the audience, nothing but macho flag-waving cliches.<br/><br/>Just so you know, some of the great action flicks that actually have some meaning and passion behind them include: First Blood, Saving Private Ryan, Leon:The Professional, Lawrence of Arabia, The Longest Day, and tons more I can't remember right now. Look for originality and passion not just action on top of action."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","2","5","21 November 2015"," Haters be damned. I will always love his one.
","I was going to start this review off by saying what a guilty pleasure this flick is for me, but you know what? No. I am unapologetic in my love for Michael Bay's Armageddon. It's a titanic blast of pure adrenaline and emotion, cruising along on that slick, hyper real sensationalist action fever that only Bay can sustain for 3 freaking hours straight. Call the guy what you will, there's just no denying the fact that he has incredible skill in forging spectacle and large scale disaster scenes of heart thumping magnitude. Yes, Armageddon spends some of its time in the cheese drawer, and some of it us flag waving, melodramatic hallmark Bay, but for me thats excusable, when you look at the sheer achievement in sound and fury on display. Not to mention the touching love story (cynics and cinephiles everywhere hate me right now lol). Who doesn't tear up at Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler's scenes. I know I can't look at animal crackers or listen to 'Leaving On A Jet Plane ' without thinking of the two of them. Also, forget about the science or logic with the plot, just sit back, flip the snob switch off and enjoy three blissful hours of popcorn movie enchantment. Bruce Willis is his roughneck self as Harry Stamper, oil drilling prodigy who is drafted by NASA (in the earnest form of Billy Bob Thornton) to fly up and drill a hole in a giant asteroid that's on a collision course with earth and threatening to destroy all mankind. They're to drill the rock, plant a nuke inside it and blow the sucker up. NASA is appalled at the rowdy nature of Harry's crew, and race to get them flight ready in the small window of time they have before the asteroid gets too close. Meanwhile, the world panics and awaits the result of their mission. Harry's crew is a wild bunch of dudes, including hotshot AJ (Affleck), horn dog Rockhound (Steve Buscemi), giant man child Bear (Michael Clarke Duncan, RIP) and Chick (Will Patton, just so moving in scenes with his family). Harry's daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) and AJ fall hopelessly in love and provide a huge emotional core for the story, Tyler in particular gives quite the performance. The scenes on the asteroid have have a sharp, shredding quality as the team navigates a nightmarish rocky terrain, directed by with crisp class and efficiency. The cast is a positively biblically epic lineup of recognizable faces including Keri Russell, Keith David, Jason Isaacs, Grace Zabriskie, Owen Wilson, Udo Kier, Charlton Heston, Eddie Griffin, Peter Stormare as a ridiculous Russian astronaut and William Fichtner in a standing ovation worthy turn as a troubled flight specialist. Anyone who's who a big enough fan of this knows of Arrowsmith's music video of their song 'Don't wanna Miss A Thing' and how it wrenches open tear ducts upon each new viewing. There's also a stirring score by Trevor Rabin that gets me every time.This is a film where you have fun. Not pick apart every artistic detail and complain about all the bombastic overkill. That stuff is half the fun. The film critic/cinephile is a preening, pretentious cat, sitting on a fence and surveying cinema to scoff at movies like this that don't any of their precious subtext or lofty themes. Armageddon is a big, messy golden retriever that runs up and playfully bats the cat right off the fence into a pile of action movies, reminding it what movies were meant for in the first place: entertainment. And in that category, boy does this baby deliver."

","The praise for this film has not dwindled much since it's inception. The movie is perhaps one of the finest films of the past twenty years. The title is "" Armageddon "" which is synonymous with the end of the world. It's appropriate as this film purports to show what would happen if a gigantic size asteroid were to strike the earth. The story concerns the fate of the planet and what the earth's brightest men would do to save it. Concluding the best way to stop the rock in outer space, a brilliant research scientist Dr. Ronald Quincy (Jason Isaacs) devises a plan. The best drillers in the world are recruited to fly into outer space, land on the traveling asteroid, drill 800 feet into it's surface, plant a nuclear bomb and split it in half. The man requested is Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and he is told by Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) the director of NASA that he has been selected to save the planet. Reluctantly, Stamper agrees but insists on taking his own crew which includes Ben Affleck, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi as Rockhound, Owen Wilson and Michael Clarke Duncan as 'Bear.' The special effects in the movie are incredible as is the top notch acting by Peter Stormare as Lev Andropov the Russian Cosmonaut and Keith David as General Kimsey. Overall, the film story is terrific and the major components are deeply emotional, exciting and superb. The result is a major achievement for the movie industry and a well deserved honor as a Classic. ****"
"film-critic","9","2","5","15 April 2008"," A Framed Picture that would make Norman Rockwell proud...
","If Norman Rockwell and Orson Scott Card had a child, in a bizarre new world, they would have written the screenplay for ""Armageddon"". An uncompromising look at what goes into the word Americana, Michael Bay has crafted a story that is pumped full of so many clichés that it becomes an entertaining, full-throttle action film that can be watched again and again. With a surprising cast and superb special effects, Bay uses the camera to create powerful artistic images coupled with the staples of what makes films of this nature unique. In this reviewer's eyes, ""Armageddon"" is one of those films where Bay has tricked the common audience. It is a typical summer blockbuster in every sense of the word, there are explosions, there are great lines, there are out-of-this world scenes, but he does this while incorporating hidden messages throughout. Perhaps I am looking a bit too deep into just another science fiction action film, but when ""Armageddon"" came through the DVD player, I wasn't ready. I was a nay-sayer to Criterion for adding this film to their collection, but now  in 2008  it makes perfect sense. Michael Bay has created a picture-perfect image of America. He has taken our desire for the inanimate, our non-perfect hero, slices of us through images of the Midwest (or of a time that we may have forgotten), and our religion to be the best and transformed it into a film. Yes, this is a science fiction film, yes this is the film about the big asteroid that only Bruce Willis can stop, and yes  Ben Affleck does attempt to act  but it is perfection. If our country was eliminated, and we needed a film for our history books  I wouldn't argue with ""Armageddon"". Now, let's let the argument begin.<br/><br/>The acting, come on, it's ""Armageddon"" people, but Bay is notorious for at least creating enjoyable characters. Buscemi is always worth the screen time, while Will Patton rounds out the voice of reason. The looming voice-over by Charlton Heston seemed to suck me into the story, while Willis and Affleck's banter seemed over the top, and at times annoying. They played their parts perfectly, yet it still had me on the edge of my seat. Liv Tyler gave it her all, and the way Bay filmed her (less words more emotion) was perfect. She carried the weight of her father and soon-to-be fiancé well into the asteroid. Compliments should be handed to Mr. Thornton as well, the man has a pair of chops on him, and if he could avoid the angry comedian films, he could remember that he has the talent. He was the epitome of NASA, the genius that had to work on the worst budget to save the world. Rewinding back to the notion that this is America in all of it's glory, these characters work perfectly. Willis' character reminded me of a mortal superhero. His ability to drill anywhere was his power, and his sense of nationalism, his idea of patriotism, bled from the screen. ""Armageddon"" played like a comic, with your muscling characters, cheap jokes, picture-esquire landscapes, and simple fix to a big problem. Again, it was cliché  all of these characters can be seen in any other film close to the same nature or entitled ""summer blockbuster"", but with Bay, he seemed to be saying more. Affleck was the only downfall on the character side. He was Ben playing Ben; there wasn't that sense of anything outside of comic timing and love interest needed. He wasn't Bruce, he wasn't anyone except filler.<br/><br/>The story was simple. Bay simply used the K.I.S.S. method to compile the script (the Keep It Simple Stupid), asteroid headed to Earth, nobody saw it, and it is up to Bruce to surrender to the beast. It is Mr. Michael Bay that must be complimented for this film. While other critics will argue that this isn't anything but drivel, I found it to be symbolic, surreal, and honest all at the same time. While other films will show America in a way that only the educated will see it, Bay throws it right in our face and we are unable to stop it. Golf on a cruise liner, Willis portraying this ""everyman"", the types of cars that our characters drive, the fact that upon completion of this task everyone want inanimate objects (power, sex, money), one cannot help but wonder what Bay is attempting to say about our culture. Michael Bay is the director of gluttony. I can attest that I couldn't stand this film upon viewing it the first time. I was horrified to see it in the Criterion gambit, but watching it again  older and wiser with film  I am happy to see it in the collection. ""Armageddon"" is America. It is the birth of the superhero, it is the cliché Americana that we face everyday; it is exactly what makes American cinema  well  American. Bay, in this film, has captured the truth. What makes this summer blockbuster even more enticing is that there is just a sprinkling of explosions, and most don't happen until the final third of the film. He has tricked us, made us believe that this is a no-brainer of a film, when it is in fact chalk full of symbolism that the faintest of film aficionados can smile under their breath.<br/><br/>Overall, as I begin to sound more and more repetitive, ""Armageddon"" - the Criterion release - blew my mind for the first time although it was my second viewing. I am eager to re-watch again Bay's ""The Rock"" which also found a Criterion release, with skeptics on both sides. The Norman Rockwell vision, the lack of any real science fiction until the third act, and the detail of the characters without devoting hours upon hours to them, made for strong  unparalleled cinema. <br/><br/>Grade: ***** out of *****"
"Sleeper_1972","10","2","5","10 March 2008"," Put Your Guns Down, I'm Not A Michael Bay Fanboy!
","I don't belong to the apparent elitists who despise Michael Bay's film-making because he doesn't direct Schindler's List or Pulp Fiction, but I don't belong to the fanboy cult of Michael Bay either, I just enjoy a good movie every once in a while and Michael Bay just so happens to have a few of them on his resume. Michael Bay is to big budget action movies as Hitchcock is to thrillers or George Lucas is to science fiction. He makes films that are loud, fast, action-packed and quite frankly, fun to watch. Isn't that what movies are supposed to be about? Armageddon was probably the most anticipated movie of 1998 (other than maybe Saving Private Ryan) . I'd rank it in my top two or three of 1998 (The others being Saving Private Ryan and American History X). It's not the next Schindler's List and it doesn't strive to be. It stars Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler in the main roles. The supporting cast is underrated, well-balanced and fun to watch, from Michael Clarke Duncan, Owen Wilson and Steve Buscemi down to lesser know actors Marshall R. Teague and Jessica Steen.<br/><br/>Yes, the plot and premise may not be the most believable, but neither is King Kong, Lord of The Rings or Star Wars. These pseudo-critics on IMDb whine about ""poor science"" behind the movie, or the poor plot or the stereotypical cast. You know what? Who friggin' cares? It's a movie that's made for sheer fun, for entertainment, for bringing your family to enjoy a couple of hours of action, thundering explosions, fast vehicles and a little romance. Armageddon, despite what the Ebert and Roeper apprentices in here think, is entertainment at its best. Stop whining and enjoy yourself.<br/><br/>We are all familiar with the story by now. An asteroid the size of Texas is on path to impact with Earth, which would destroy all forms of life on it. The world only has 18 days until impact. The only way to stop it is to blow it up from the inside by drilling to its core. For that, NASA recruits the worlds's best deep-core driller in Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and his renegade drilling crew. The crew, along with some NASA astronauts and an unlucky Russian cosmonaut, journey to the asteroid and embark upon the mission to destroy it and with that, save the entire planet.<br/><br/>Along the way, the crew endures despite losing lives, having to overcome huge obstacles, and having to make decisions that will affect not only the world but themselves. The movie is filled with a few emotional moments that will bring tears to some eyes, a score that is grandiose and is a large part of the film, and strives to be patriotic and the cinematography reflects it. I couldn't help but feel patriotic and moved while watching the movie. The sound and visual effects in the movie were awesome, which its four Oscar nominations reflect. (Home theater aficionados will also appreciate the visual and sound effects in this movie).<br/><br/>This movie is a lot of things. It's fun, it's moving, it's sad and it's romantic. Above all, it's one of the more entertaining movies I have seen. The cast had a lot of chemistry together and seemed to have a lot of fun which is reflected in the film. This was Ben Affleck's first big box-office action movie and he gives a good first effort. Bruce Willis takes on the role of Harry Stamper with ease like the action movie veteran he is. Liv Tyler is sweet as Harry's daughter and their emotional goodbye is to be remembered.<br/><br/>With having said all that, the Criterion Collection release of Armageddon is a treat. It offers 2 commentary tracks, one featuring the director Michael Bay, actors Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer has comments on several interesting things. Affleck's commentary is sometimes very funny. The other commentary track features the Director of Photography and special effects crew. The commentary includes interesting details, including background information on the characters and filming locations. Note: The commentary is raw and sometimes laced with profanity, although the movie itself is rated PG-13, for reasons explained in the commentary.<br/><br/>Although it's not much, this collection is also a Director's Cut and has a couple scenes added, notable of which is Harry Stamper's character visiting his father before launch. Some other scenes are cut slightly differently, adding some depth to the story.<br/><br/>The Gag reel on the second disk is extremely funny, raw, and not your typical ""behind-the-scenes"" documentary. The second disk also features a tremendous amount of information on the special effects and includes many different trailers and promo material. The Aerosmith music video for ""I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing"" is also included, although I've never watched it, and probably never will.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Armageddon was the second-highest grossing film of 1998 narrowly behind Saving Private Ryan. That might be something for critics to think about, because obviously A LOT of people saw this movie. All in all, don't listen to the critics here trying to become the next ""Top 500 reviewer."" See the movie, it's a blast."

All of the naysayers are of course exactly right. It is all of these things and more tactless synonyms besides. If you take every one of these criticisms into account, however, and nevertheless make a conscious effort to approach the film in the right frame of mind, then I still maintain you can have a lot of fun with its blunt attitude.<br/><br/>It's an overblown comic-book tailor made for teenagers and grown up kids, alike. Embrace it's sheer ridiculousness; chomp popcorn and grip your seat in synch with the deafening musical cues that are helpfully provided. It's meant to be an assault on your senses and nerves, just like the wildest ride in an amusement park. Logic doesn't enter into the exercise, and nor should it, either. This is a slam-bang experience, and Michael Bay is your consummate purveyor for these types of things. I ask those who would still gripe fruitlessly: What the heck else should you be expecting????!!!<br/><br/>Sometimes you have to learn to appreciate 'big and dumb' if it's 'big and dumb' that's at least aiming for mass appeal.

","While blending action and comedy maybe a known recipe for success, how about action, comedy, and the end of the world? After seeing the movie Armageddon I now know that such a combination is not only possible but in this case a recipe for an extremely entertaining movie. Michel Bay also known for such movies as Bad Boys and The Rock, manages to pull together all the critical elements necessary for a good film in Armageddon. The all star cast includes Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, and Liv Tyler just to name a few. To add to the great cast are good special effects (including a meteor shower in downtown New York) and a rocking musical score including bands such as Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, and ZZ Top.<br/><br/>The basic premise of the plot is that a giant asteroid is detected on a collision course with earth. After NASA studies the asteroid they determine that the only way to destroy it is with a nuclear warhead placed precisely on a fault line in the middle of it. The next step they take is to call in some of the world's best deep core oil drillers (led by Bruce Willis) and give them the task of drilling an 800 foot hole on the asteroid in which to place the bomb. Over the course of their endeavor this ragtag group must overcome a variety of challenges with the fate of the world hanging in the balance.<br/><br/>Despite the serious subject matter Mr. Bay manages to integrate a great deal of comic relief without going over the top (More like Bad Boys than Rush Hour). It is this fine tuned balance in which humor and action blend that makes this movie great. An example of some of the humor can be found in the following quote:<br/><br/>When the asteroid is first discovered by an astronomer he calls it into NASA while his wife sits next to him:<br/><br/>NASA Director (Billy Bob Thornton): Now listen Karl, this is top secret. Astronomer: Sir, I'm retired navy, I know all about classified. But one more thing. The person who finds her gets to name her right? NASA Director (Billy Bob Thornton): Yes, yes that's right, that's right. Astronomer: I wanna name her Dottie after my wife. She's a vicious life-sucking bitch from which there is no escape.<br/><br/>Aside from the action and humor this movie manages to turn one of the characters into a hero and by the end you find yourself rooting for him. Don't worry about the fact that this is a Sci-Fi movie, it doesn't slow you down with technobabble and there are no life sucking aliens. As far as plot goes this movie may not be some great work of art, however the plot progresses in good fashion. While for the first time viewer the occasional minor twist livens up the movie, the plot as a whole is good enough so that it does not rely entirely on suspense or shock value (No M. Night Shyamalan here). Simply put, this movie has a high re-watch-ability value shifting it from the rent  for  a  night to the buy  for  your  collection category."

","What's REALLY bad about it? Is it just because it involves taking the life of a human? Well, that's not enough reason for society to be so negative about it. Wars, diseases, murders, they're all around us. Death is a natural, normal thing. Why would you oppose someone trying to take their own life? Isn't it HIS life? What do YOU have to do with it? I say that because I just watched this ""movie"". For fear I might put those questions of mine into practical use, I'll stop any other references to this...thing. Not for me, but for the ones who love me and depend on me.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's religion-influenced cultural convictions. Maybe it's the delicacy and squeamishness of the average person. Maybe another reason. In the end, suicide is not that dramatic or Earth-shattering a disaster as some think it is. By exterminating humans on a constant basis, death is giving life to this planet. Otherwise, there would be no place for a foot and we'd have to look for other planets. It's all part of a grand-scale cycle of life. We really should not think of death (particularly suicide in this context) as but a way for more life to exist.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you want thoughts like mine, go ahead and watch this thing. *Googles the net for least painful way to die*"

Come to think of it, nobody could have saved this movie given the script and the cardboard cut-out characters. Liv reduced to ecstatic smiles or on the verge of tears throughout, drunken Russian cosmonaut doing drunken things with a stupid accent, a bunch of happy-go-luckiest saving the world, half the time you cannot recognise the characters through their astronaut suits.<br/><br/>And lets not even mention the physics this teaches. Drilling holes on an asteroid, oil spills in a space station... Crash landed a space shuttle? No problem - get a ride back on a different one.<br/><br/>With films like this it would not be a shame for an asteroid to score a direct hit on California.

","The summer of 1998 was mostly unremarkable, with the majority of films failing to impress. The overblown Godzilla was a humongous letdown, as was Armageddon's rival Deep Impact. Armageddon came out champ of the summer season (along with Saving Private Ryan, Lethal Weapon 4, and There's Something About Mary). But none of these films managed to push past $217 million, which would be absolutely unthinkable now, inflation or not.<br/><br/>Despite the relatively low box office returns (just a smidgen over $200 million), the marketing machine for Armageddon was in our faces everywhere, and I feared it might burn-out audiences before release. I know I felt a little cynical when I went into the cinema that day, my expectations very low.<br/><br/>I've said before that Michael Bay does himself no favors. The man knows how to make a blockbuster, but he's utterly clueless when it comes to making a good film. Armageddon is the only film in his entire resume that I find watchable and entertaining, though he still should have held back some scenes (the notorious animal cracker love scene really should have been dropped).<br/><br/>A big boulder of iron ferite hurtles through space, knocking smaller meteors toward Earth (thinking of breaking a frame on a pool table). NASA recruits immature oil driller Harry Tasker and his band of roughnecks to go into space and nuke the comet before it ends all life our little blue planet. With an 18-day countdown it's going to be very, very close.<br/><br/>Although it took a total of 18 writers to staple the screenplay together, Armageddon succeeds in almost every area where Deep Impact failed, plus more. The soap opera is kept to a minimum while the action is ramped up, delivering one hair's-breadth escape after another, all to the sound of Trevor Rabin's amazing score, which the life blood of the movie. The huge cast of fine actors, the SFX, and the action would all be significantly inferior without Rabin's soaring tunes, which turn many of the key scenes into wordless music videos of visual storytelling.<br/><br/>That's not to say that the acting isn't notable. As a matter of fact, Bruce Willis is surprisingly effective, as is Will Patton, who rarely gets a decent role in mainstream movies. Though, as with Con Air a year before, Steve Buscemi owns every scene he's in (tying with Peter Stormare). Just ignore the horribly miscast Ben Affleck whenever he appears. He's the only real weak link of the movie, to the point where you ought to switch off during his screen-time.<br/><br/>As the only truly exciting blockbuster of the 1998 summer season, Armageddon defines a lackluster year, and elevates Michael Bay's classless resume.

When all the women in evidence are either twerps or bitches? Surprise, we aren't in 1940 anymore. And, incidentally, we aren't in 1960 either. Round about then I was a kid somewhere in East Europe, and the flag-waving in Armageddon brings back all sorts of creepy memories. So it's the Stars and Stripes instead of hammer and sickle - same difference when you get it jammed down your throat.<br/><br/>Interestingly, I happened to watch Armageddon within two days of Space Cowboys. The similarities are striking, and Space Cowboys actually achieve a lot of what Armageddon attempts and flops at. Space Cowboys genuinely integrate comedy, drama and romance throughout the entire film in a way that Armageddon achieves only in the sales pitch. Yes, it's another entertaining Hollywood movie and as such basically predictable, but it does keep one's interest up as to _how_ the unlikely crew will manage to save the world. The characters - men and women - do rise off the cardboard and inspire genuine feelings of sympathy, identification, suspicion, or hate, as the case may be. And, just as a sample, contrast Space Cowboys' truly touching final trip to the Moon with the tacky, soppy, unintentionally comical finale of Armageddon!<br/><br/>So, for a bit of honest space action entertainment, skip Armageddon and put your video rental money on Space Cowboys."

At least it was when it was released.<br/><br/>Now, in 2020, a new dimension of entertainment opened itself to the thinking viewers - you can observe and study the genesis of the staples and cliches of now big names like Michael Bay and J. J. Abrams.<br/><br/>Michael Bay with his tons of epic-slow mo, explosions, women objectification and USA fetish.<br/><br/>And J. J. Abrams with his constant tension build-ups, trailer dialogue, emotional but nonsensical scenes, ""what, it doesn't make sense? who cares! excitement! excitement!""<br/><br/>I'm not going to dig too deep into this just because there is nothing to look for.<br/><br/>If you've never seen this film, watch it once with your brain completely shut off. You might enjoy it. As for us, the 80ties and 90ties kids, we can revisit this film from time to time to remind ourselves of the time that was less horrible than 2020ies."

","Armageddon is a testosterone and adrenaline cocktail, with almost no intelligence added for flavoring. It's the latest in a line of increasingly-stupid action pictures that amazes audiences with flashy special effects and nifty action sequences, but leaves them high and dry in both the character and story departments. Armageddon is like a video game crossed with an amusement park thrill ride, and, to a certain extent, it can be enjoyed on those terms. It's certainly better than Godzilla, not because it's any less preposterous, but because it is occasionally exciting -- a quality that could not be ascribed to any moment of the big lizard's tedious romp through New York."

Dan Truman who is stressed out that his new astronauts might not be able to handle space training as we taught this film is fiction we see 25 yrs later they landed a satellite on a meteor maybe in the future this could become science fact. These asteroids also decimated New York soon thereafter. Then, NASA discovered that there is an asteroid roughly the size of Texas heading towards the Earth, and when it does hit the Earth, the planet itself and all of its inhabitants will be obliterated, worse, the asteroid will hit the Earth in 18 days. Unfortunately, NASA's plans to destroy the asteroid are irrelevant. That is when the U.S. military decides to use a nuclear warhead to blow the asteroid to pieces. Then, scientists decide to blow the asteroid with the warhead inside the asteroid itself. The only man to do it, is an oil driller named Harry Stamper and his group of misfit drillers and geologists. As he and his drill team prepare for space excavation, the asteroid is still heading towards the Earth so we have a huge cast for this because there's is two teams independence and freedom on two space shuttles with the cast as follows is Will Patton ...

The acting is great from pretty much all accounts, even Ben Affleck does a good job here coming to the rescue but the team are undermined by earth because they don't believe they can do it but Bruce character turns out to be a hero in the end a we see his last transmission to his daughter this film is so underrated"

","As you can probably see by the star rating, i'm one of the people who loves this film. I am a Die Hard Bruce Willis fan. All characters were superbly cast. Buscemi as Rock, Affleck as AJ, Tyler as Grace, Thornton as Truman. All of them work well together and showed a very great chemistry, The relationship between Bruce and Affleck was simply put ""Great"" Thornton does a perfect job as a NASA employee. Their character just fit them. An asteroid the size of Texas is detected heading for Earth. It will wipe out all life on the planet if it hits. NASA decides that the only course of action is to plant a nuclear warhead deep into the asteroid to split it in two hoping it will safely pass Earth. They send a team of oil drillers led by Bruce Willis to drill the hole and save the Earth.<br/><br/>This is a great disaster movie utilizing the directing skills of Michael Bay, a great action movie director and when teamed with producer Jerry Bruckheimer they create some of the best action films around. The effects in this film are incredible with an out of this world story line and a cast of greats that includes Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Owen Wilson, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan, William Fichtner & Will Patton. All great actors and all bring so much to the film, but the greatest performance is by Steve Buscemi who steals every scene he is in playing the character of Rockhound.<br/><br/>This is an effects heavy film, but it works. The film is about chaos and destruction and the effects are relentless in the portrayal of the destruction. The spectacle of smaller asteroids crashing down to Earth is amazing to watch. Many people were put off with the effects of chaos and mayhem, but the film wouldn't have worked without it. However this film manages something most sci-fi films fail in. It manages to get you emotionally involved. I know many people that got teary eyed at the end of the film (me included) and that is something rare in a sci- fi/action film.<br/><br/>Love it or Hate it, but this is a very emotional film especially with the Soundtrack and the last scenes. Well deserves a better rating then it has!"

It is made up of canyons of sculpture, seas of painting and mountains of poetry. These landscapes span the globe. This environment is populated with all the human souls that have ever lived. You are with them, in a city of televised skyscrapers.<br/><br/>The date is July 1st 1998.<br/><br/>Terrible rumours have been circulating. People have been whispering about a giant meteor. An intergalactic behemoth, they say. Something made of the same matter from which Planet Art was formed, but which is instead a grotesque parody. An abomination on a collision course. An extinction-level event.<br/><br/>A grim face appears on the colossal screens above the city.<br/><br/>""I address you tonight not as the President of Art, but as a citizen of humanity,"" booms a loud voice. ""We are faced with the very gravest of challenges. The cinema calls this day 'Armageddon'. It is the end of all things. All of you praying with us need to know that everything that can be done to prevent this disaster is being called into service: our ability to create plots without holes; our entrenched knowledge of basic screen writing; the grasp of logic to determine that installing a simple hatch for exiting a spacecraft makes more sense than installing a hotel elevator - with 'freedom' written upon it; the ability to understand a machine gun has no place on a NASA funded meteor drilling mission, and that 'Space Dementia' is about as likely to make a drilling expert fire bullets at mining equipment as Sea Alzheimers is to make an ecologist drop torpedoes on whale sharks; every step up the ladder of realistic emotional expression, every adventurous reach into artistic originality; even the horrible soap operas that we've watched have provided us the tools to wage this terrible battle. Through all of the chaos that is our history; through all of the wrongs and the discord; through all of the pain and suffering; through all of our times, there is one thing that has nourished our souls, and elevated our species above its origins, and that is our integrity.

"crash21","1","1","2","3 November 2015"," A tribute to the oil drillers?
","This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Armageddon is nothing but a giant action scene, they are running back and forth so much, with actual lines that are so rare that you can't barely understand what is happening in any scene of the whole movie. The only lines seem like they are devoted to the drillers that are (supposedly) saving our planet. I always thought dramatic dust and oil coming from the drillers was what was helping to destroying the planet to begin with.<br/><br/>I can't help laughing so much at the drama through Armageddon, it is nothing but an action scene devoted to get people loving the oil industry and the Space Shuttle. If anything, they wouldn't have used the shuttle, and the military would probably be doing most of this, simply in an attempt to knock it off-course, as last resort would they be blowing up the asteroid. I think ""Armageddon"" should have been named just plain ""Awful"", because it is awful."
"zinkeman","4","1","2","6 May 2015"," Maybe I just don't like Michael Bay
","One can always count on Michael Bay to make the most ridiculous, clichéd, over- the-top movies in any genre he dares tread. This goes over doubly so for his 1998 apocalyptic disaster movie, Armageddon. I am not entirely certain why I find this specific disaster so disaster movie so distasteful. I usually enjoy these types of disaster movies. There is so much fun in speculating on the supposed ""big one"", no matter the type of disaster it is. And there is nothing bigger than a world-destroying asteroid impact. All the pieces fit for a very fun movie, but the execution is done so poorly that it leaves a sour taste in my mouth. First though, let me discuss the things I do like.<br/><br/>The effects of the movie are beautiful, it's no wonder it was nominated for an Oscar in that respect. And model for the asteroid, while unrealistic, does go with what the film intended it to be. All the sharp spires and jagged rock and the ominous sounds of it really do a good job of transforming this big inanimate object into an antagonist. Unfortunately, that's all the good I can find in the film.<br/><br/>The storytelling itself is bad, the characters are not memorable, and the movie is rife with plot holes. How is it easier to train oil drillers to be astronauts, than astronauts to be oil drillers? What are the chances that every time a smaller asteroid struck, it hit a major city? Why was a romantic subplot shoehorned in, when they could have easily done a great bromance that would make the drillers more memorable?!? A day after re-watching the film and I had to go online to remember whom the drillers other than Bruce Willis were. <br/><br/>Also the science of the actual movie is just bad. If NASA did not know about the asteroid 18 days before it hit, they would not know about until it actually hit. Few, if any of the smaller asteroids would make it through the atmosphere without breaking up. And of coarse, an asteroid the size of Texas would do enormous damage to the biosphere, but it would not kill everything and make Earth a lifeless husk. Perhaps a few other scientists other than Billy Bob Thornton should have been consulted.<br/><br/>Honestly, I think the only reason I really do not like this movie is because it's a Michael Bay movie. No matter what genre he does, it will always be plenty of shock and awe and effects, and never any story and substance to go with it."

","Armageddon is one of the most recognizable films in all of cinema, but not so much well liked. This is very divided, with very few people claiming the whole movie to be a masterpiece. I liked it. I didn't LOVE it, but you know.<br/><br/>This is a blockbuster meant to make money. It is evident that millions of dollars were put into this, hence millions are needed for the movie to be any sort of success. Director, Michael Bay does his first and best super-explosive picture. Bay makes many high-powered explosions just for the heck of it. Starring in this is Bruce Willis along with Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler and Steve Buscemi, all giving subpar performances with awful dialogue. Luckily, the negatives don't last...long.<br/><br/>Armageddon is the twin of Deep Impact. Both are about humans preparing for a massive comet heading toward Earth that will cause extinction. While Deep Impact is more serious and accurate, Armageddon is mostly a mess of it. In nicer terms, this is the fun version. The first hour and some takes place on Earth with the preparation and subplots. Early meteors hit and Bruce Willis is angry that his daughter (Tyler) is seeing a handsome coworker (Affleck). There's huge explosions and violence just for fun. The acting is bad too. Everything (almost) is inaccurate and unrealistic. Deep Impact is far better. Even the background music and Aerosmith songs weren't enough to fully brighten up any scenes. But the take-off scene when they head into space is when the movie gains ground. The visual and sound effects are amazing and the set pieces are awesome too. Sadly, them being in space is way too long. Bay abuses his privilege. Good thing the ending is truly good.<br/><br/>2/4"

Chasing asteroids or comets is not a smart idea ever, has anyone ever heard of tail debris. As for when they landed at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral being that they had just been walking around on an asteroid they most likely would have been quarantined not have been running around shaking hands and slapping backs in congratulation of a job well done.

","This picture has the plot line of ""The Green Slime"" (1969) absent the slime. Check out the original and see. In addition to Robert Horton (who knows who this is?), and Richard Jaeckel (the sergeant in the ""Dirty Dozen""), it has Luciana Paluzzi (the lollapalooza from ""Thunderball"") - be still, my beating heart!! You have the asteroid, the collision course with Earth, the NASA references, and the explosives planted directly by space ship landing to obliterate it. Admittedly, slime is a pretty big element to omit and still consider it the same. The tension between the two male characters is there; however, in ""Armageddon"", it is because the Bruce Willis doesn't trust Ben Affleck with his daughter, Liv Tyler. The original plot has the two men as rivals for the woman. Special effects have grown exponentially in almost 30 years. All the space ship scenes are models (way cool; I would have loved to have them as toys 40 years ago). The slime is pretty much soap bubbles with food coloring, and inflatable rubber with lights inside. The monster, however, wouldn't even have made it in the TV show ""Lost in Space""!"

I guess the fault lies in the romantic comedy syndrome: if you know he's going to get the girl how do you make the journey worthwhile; same problem here - I never, not for one second, believe that the oil drillers won't succeed.<br/><br/>The film is surprisingly by the numbers - with huge effects a crushingly loud soundtrack, and some fun, but all in all, it will never be anything other than a boy's own adventure in space.

Is it enjoyable? Surely, it is a perfect move to take a date with, or to watch at home while texting and chatting. There are few, if any, inside references or loops on the story. The first 10 minutes give you all the character nuances you will need.<br/><br/>As for the special effects, they are nice but thankfully they avoid the ""Independence Day-trap"" of killing even a shallow storyline for the sake of showcasing the ability of its visual effects engineers.<br/><br/>To sum it up, Armageddon is a typical summer action movie, not much concerned about complexity.

"Danielramos16","4","1","2","25 July 2008"," The most overwhelming movie ever made
","Armageddon is pure entertainment, and it's meant to be fun. On the other hand it's a film that tries way too hard. It's an action, adventure, Sci-Fi, Comedy, Drama, Romance, and Disaster movie all mixed into one! Then throw in a gigantic budget, an all-star cast, dazzling special effects, explosions, a cheesy love story, over the top humor, and lots of music. Add that all together and we have the most overwhelming movie ever made. The viewer is just bombarded with this barrage of special effects, music, cheap jokes, and romance, I felt my brain was overloading. If your looking for pure Fun & entertainment then you'll probably love this film. Of course you have to be prepared to suspend disbelief in order to enjoy this movie and ignore the obvious flaws. <br/><br/>1.) First off there is an asteroid the size of Texas hurtling towards Earth. In reality the largest asteroid ever discovered was about the size of a small city, there isn't an asteroid of such freakish size anywhere near our solar system.<br/><br/>2.) NASA only becomes aware of the asteroid after a meteor shower and when they do discover it they only have 18 days before it hits Earth. In reality we would have a few years warning that an asteroid of such size was coming that close to us. NASA telescopes are very powerful and can see beyond our solar system, so they would have to be blind to miss it. We'd have plenty of warning.<br/><br/>3.) being that we'd have plenty of warning we'd also have plenty of time to prepare. So the whole story of Armageddon is now out of the question. NASA would train a rag tag group of undisciplined oil drillers to go into space in a few days on this mission to drill a hole into the asteroid and blow it up with a nuke cause the astronauts know nothing about drilling. In reality they would most likely have the drillers train their astronauts in drilling for months maybe even a year for this kinda mission. The oil drillers would never have been prepared for the rigors of space travel in such a short period of time.<br/><br/>4.) Asteroids are usually more rounded, not funky looking like the asteroid in this film. The Comet in Deep Impact was more accurate to the shape and look of asteroids & comets.<br/><br/>5.) NASA doesn't have cool advanced looking shuttles that fly like fighter aircraft like the ones in this movie. It would take months for them to make such a ship. And they wouldn't be that stupid in installing gatling guns on the armadillos in the event Steve Buschemi goes nuts.<br/><br/>6.) In the movie the team Drill a hole 800 feet deep to plant a nuclear warhead in the center which would split the asteroid in two and divert them in opposite directions, both of which would miss the planet. In reality if the asteroid was that big they would need to drill the hole about a hundred miles into the damn thing, and it would take more than one Nuke to do the job. The asteroid would also not split in half and miss the planet, It would most likely fragment into a few pieces and probably still hit. At 800 feet it would probably just make a big crater.... at best!<br/><br/>7.) The team swing shots around the moon at 11 G's in order to get behind the asteroid. In reality at 11 G's they would either pass out or die. <br/><br/>8.) Asteroids don't have gravitational fields. <br/><br/>9.) biblical inaccuracies: in the bible Armageddon is described as the epic battle on Earth between the forces of good & evil. So is the asteroid embodying evil or something, it's just a freaking rock.<br/><br/>Is it just me or is there is always something going wrong in this film. Atlantis destroyed, Meteor showers, cities destroyed, team members clash & bicker, The Russian space station explodes, they land on the hardest part of the rock, the military panics and tries to blow the nuke up from Earth, then the Nuke won't explode so someone has to stay behind to blow it up. Nobody likes constant drama in their lives why would we want it in this movie. It also tries too many times to be funny at the most unexpected and unnatural times.<br/><br/>How can Liv Tyler's character fall for Ben Affleck's character? Affleck plays someone who's so annoying, so whinny, and immature. No wonder Bruce Willis doesn't want them getting married. That scene where Affleck & Tyler are having a picnic and he plays animal cracker safari on her belly was the most retarded thing I ever saw, in fact it was kinda weird. In fact many of the characters were over the top & dramatic.<br/><br/>For all it's fun Armageddon simply lacks any intelligence. It's all brawn and no brain. Like I said if you looking for just entertainment you'll enjoy this film, if you like your films to be somewhat intelligent then you might want to save your money. Try not to take Armageddon seriously."

The basic concept of ""Armageddon"" comes a little bit too late in the beginning, but it is clear that the earth will be meeting up with the biggest asteroid NASA had seen in decades. Knowing that the asteroid will mean the near total destruction of earth if it hits, NASA makes up a big plan that will involve even people who were not from NASA, including Harry Stamper, a long-time oil drill worker, who was picked for this wild mission. At that point, he was engaged to Gracie and planned to get married after the mission.<br/><br/>The mission to keep the asteroid from knocking out earth was simple-- two teams will land on the asteroid, drill a hole in it, and put a nuclear bomb on it.<br/><br/>But the bomb has to be on remote detonation mode, and this detonation must occur within about 300 miles (the imaginary zero barrier) from earth. If unsuccessful, Earth would not be as extant as it is now.<br/><br/>The first step was for the crew to meet up at the Space Station around 120 miles from earth. They do and meet at least one cosmonaut, but a broken fuel line causes a backdraft explosion of most of the space station--but fortunately, the crew gets back to the shuttle before they all die.<br/><br/>The second step was for the two space shuttles, Independence and Freedom, to go around the asteroid in space, and try to make one of the toughest landings ever in space history. In addition, the moon truck called The Armadillo would be used to assist in the drilling of the bomb.<br/><br/>After dealing with the landings, the hard work begins. Soon there is a problem about the remote detonator; one team member wants to blow it up soon; another says he must dismantle the bomb so it won't go off. NASA officials do override the detonation of the bomb but only for a short time. Then the bomb rearms itself and then it was up to the team to disarm the bomb, but it was done.<br/><br/>A rock storm almost completely destroys the team's drilling of the rock to put in the bomb, but Stamper loses one of his men. But even worse, he finds out that the remote detonator for the nuclear bomb is out of action.<br/><br/>All of the focus as the big asteroid approaches Earth was on the AVHRR, or the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiograph. The AVHRR tracks the asteroid approaching zero barrier--that is, once the asteroid passes it, no nuclear explosion or anything else will keep that asteroid from hitting earth with devastating results.<br/><br/>Then, a conflict between AJ (played by Ben Affleck) and Stamper, because Stamper's fiancée, Gracie (Liv Tyler), can only watch this daring mission. The crew decides to draw straws to find out who will hold the bomb and blow up the bomb manually and give up one's life on the asteroid rock. Stamper almost refuses to do the task---and AJ decides to sacrifice his life to blow up the nuke--but at the very last moment, Stamper forces AJ out of the task, deciding that he will do the sacrificial task.<br/><br/>Stamper then gives the extremely bad news to Gracie in space; their marriage plans are now irreversibly gone, and Gracie cries at his last words. <br/><br/>NASA observers then feast their eyes in awe at the approaching asteroid. As Stamper was about to detonate the nuke, the other team members re-fire the shuttle engines but they find out that the shuttle can't blast off from the big rock. The team works quickly because if they can't get out fast, the shuttle will burn up in the earth's atmosphere on the rock, meaning death for all of them. Then a cosmonaut fumes over the engine breakdown and slams on the engine's controls several times and then, they hear a sound the team loves to hear...the engine finally starts, and the team blast the shuttle away from the rock just in time--about 2 minutes before the rock hits the zero barrier.<br/><br/>Stamper himself then faces a new problem--still another rock storm, almost knocks him unconscious. But he gets up, gets the bomb control ready, and saying his last words in honor of Gracie, he manually presses the button---and then---he does it! Stamper dies as the bomb blows...the surviving shuttle team sees a bright flash that signals to them that Stamper had gave his life... and the bomb does its job...breaking up the asteroid into two halves just about 1 mile before the breach of the zero barrier.<br/><br/>But all of this success came too late for the people of the South Pacific and Paris, who got hit hard by smaller asteroids that were the precursor of the biggest asteroid, causing massive destruction and thousands of deaths. That asteroid reminds me of something like a punishment by God for all the sins people make on earth."
"ray-280","7","1","2","6 May 2007"," Misfits save the world...again
","It started with ""The Dirty Dozen"" and continues to this day: a group of misfits, rejects, outcasts, lowlifes, and undesirables possess a unique skill set required to save humanity from destruction. The situation, as always, elevates the misfits over the mindless bureaucrats who reluctantly have to turn to them.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is Harry Stamper, the world's best oil driller. He is called upon by NASA, in the persona of Billy Bob Thornton (Dan Truman), the red-tape cutter who assembles our heroes. Keith David (Lt. Gen. Kimsey) plays to type as a Colin Powell clone whose orders are to destroy the mission whenever possible, while William Fichtner is Col. Sharp, a bureaucrat at heart who still thinks when necessary. Stamper's crew includes the men from his oil company, an ensemble of Ben Affleck (A.J., his future son-in-law), Michael Clarke Duncan (""Papa Bear,"" a jolly black Giant), Ken Hudson ""Quiznos Baby Bob"" Campbell (Max, a grown up, dumbed down version of Bob), Owen Wilson (Oscar, the space-cadet geologist), Steve Buschemi (""Rockhound,"" and the guy you know your daughter will talk to despite your warnings), and Will Patton (Chick). These men have worked together for years and are like family.<br/><br/>The ""armageddon"" project is based on current events, namely the realization that it's only a matter of time before earth is struck yet again, with most life forms not surviving. In the movie, there is 17 days to train the crew, fly them to the asteroid, and have them drill an 800 foot hole, into which a nuclear warhead is detonated, hopefully splitting the asteroid. Along the way, they pick up Peter Stormare (Lev), the Russian space station cosmonaut who gives the mission its international flavor, while reminding us that Russian astronauts are superior to American oil drillers.<br/><br/>The cinematography is what makes the film work. The plot plays out very predictably, as most movies of this type do. You won't be surprised by what you see, but you will be amazed at the visuals and snicker more than occasionally, as the egalitarian message of the film is driven home.<br/><br/>A good, not great, movie, but hardly one you need to avoid."
"vip_ebriega","8","1","2","24 April 2007"," Michael Bay directs a different kind of ""rock"" in big-budget disaster film.
","Review summary: Put your mind to rest and wallow in the mindless, summer excitement.<br/><br/>To start with, ""Armageddon"" was a fine film, but it relied too much on its wealth on special effects and big-named cast to give audiences a charm, but it misses a lot from what it needed. There is simply no comparison of this film to its counterpart ""Deep Impact"". Armageddon lacks a deeper human dimension. But what the heck! This movie's fun! <br/><br/>The reason for the comparison is they both show the same plot, they both give as a glimpse of the end-of-the-world, by a comet, and a group of ""saviors"" who try to blow it up and save the world. This time, it's Bruce Willis and his oil rig crew who are hired by NASA to pilot two space shuttle to blow up a large comet (aka ""The Global Killer"") before it hits the Earth.<br/><br/>The plot of course, is easy to take. I mean how hard will it be to understand a plot of a killer comet and a group of oil rig workers who sacrifice their lives, I guess the longest range of time will be 5 seconds. Stupid, yes, but its so wrong, its just all right. The characters, of course, don't sum up for too much, considering that the film stars big names (names like Bruce Willis or Ben Affleck may have you quite disappointed) . If the film added more to what it can offer, it would have turned out better. But as it is, Armageddon is worth a summer movie thumbs up and a big bowl of popcorn.<br/><br/>Rating: **** out of 5."
"maryel-merme","10","1","2","2 January 2007"," A TERRIFIC ""Cheer 'Em Up!"" Film
","I think this is THE best ""feel good"" movie made in decades. Although the story line is far-fetched, it is a true ""stand up and cheer!"" action packed, funny, dear film. Saving the planet is depicted as a group effort and not left up to one superhero.The photography is breathtaking, the soundtrack is unbelievably fine, and there couldn't have been a better cast chosen. Also, Bruce Willis sold his performance as Harry Stamper in a split second during a scene in which he crosses the deck of the oil rig, talking a mile and minute but reaches out to help an employee move a piece of heavy equipment, never breaking stride or losing his conversational pace. That particular movement is so well done, he becomes believable in the role. A GREAT FILM!"

","this film were amazing i cry every time i watch it ... its a totally must see! some funny aspects and a adventurous parts it has an amazing soundtrack to it which makes it more effective and it beats any other films i have ever seen! its also very addictive (well to me anyway) well i noticed no problems with this film what so ever! especially when harry gives up his life for his daughter (grace) and her fiancé i think it was well not sure? not sure anyway i'm going to see it again now just reminded me to oh yeah and before i do that i got to go by some tissues for when my eyes pour with sadness( it think thats a bit over the top)"
"wereuat06-1","8","1","2","15 December 2006"," It is what it is...
","This movie seems to be a movie that many people love to hate. I don't see why it has such a bad reputation. It is meant to be an Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie, and it definitely lives up to this. It is what it is. Many people have tried to compare it to Apollo 13, but that's like comparing apples and oranges. They are entirely different fruit. Apollo 13 is based on a true historical event (Docu-drama), while Armageddon is an Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie. It has plenty of action and adventure, a lot of humor, and a bit of romance.<br/><br/>Is the story realistic? Not hardly, but name ANY Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie that is. That's why they call it Science fiction. For those who criticize this movie, nothing will change their minds. However, if you haven't seen Armageddon, take a chance, watch with an open mind and try not to let all these negative reviews spoil your enjoyment of a really fun movie. Remember, a movie is meant to be funny with a somewhat story, I find this movie to be a good 2 and a half hours of mostly laughter and great punchlines. This is a great movie if you let it be. I give this movie an 8 out of 10."
"angsttaler","10","1","2","5 December 2006"," emotional
","It made me laugh and it made me cry! A high charged emotional film that I love! I don't feel it is another Independence Day in the least. Its more emotional then Independence Day is. Independence Day had more fiction then Armageddon. There is every chance that we may come up against a big asteroid the size of Texas etc that could kill off man kind - well more of a chance then little green men taking over Earth like in Independence Day. Most movies ARE fiction so what can you really expect? Maybe there was also hidden meaning behind things in the movies such as sending up a bunch oil drillers, some being on the wrong side of the law to one being a total horn bag that hangs in strip bars opposed to sending up a team of highly trained astronauts. Maybe that was to point out that you don't have to be a person who has ""school smarts"" or rich or famous to help this country, this world. Just be able to do what you do the best you can do! Some of the characters in the film just get you laughing so hard while there are times when you feel that lump rise up in your throat and feel your eyes start to water. You just have to love Steve Buscemi's character in the movie, he cracks me up through the whole movie. We all know there are chick flicks etc and I think maybe this is a sci-fi chick flick. Men didn't find it that great as they wanted the blood, guts and glory kind of film. But for women such as myself it was one of THE most touching movies of the time!"
"chipandluna","9","1","2","4 September 2006"," This is the best movie of all time!
","I loved this movie. The only reason I cannot rate it 10/10 is because they kill off some of my favourite characters (Oscar and Max, for example). If a person was told that this was a comedy before watching this film, they'd believe you. It is definitely more funny than thrilling, but it does have some shockers. The camera's shots were less than desirable, and I think with a better cameraman the movie would be perfect. And also, what is the director's obsession with the colour blue? Blue lighting, blue meteorite, some of the space craft and uniforms are blue. There are other colours, Jerry. But otherwise this was an awesome movie and you must see it!"
"ireallyhopeithurts","7","1","2","28 August 2006"," A review of Armageddon by me. shocking really.
","OK, I'm the first to admit it, I'm a bit of a film snob. The thought of big budget US movies with so many famous names that they can't all fit on the DVD box makes me want to run away and hide. In a box with no holes. Underground. But on holiday in Scotland with nothing else to do on a Tuesday night, i opted to watch Armageddon rather than listen to my dad give us the potted history of The Isle of Mull, thinking i could at least laugh at the bad acting and melodrama. <br/><br/>The opening scenes didn't disappoint, they were suitably badly acted and melodramatic, and as i didn't check the credits, i hadn't realised that i had opted in for Liv Tylers weird ass body shape and crappy airy-fairy voice. Introducing her as the 'smart' daughter seemed too incredulous even for Hollywood. But i'm rambling; although the plot was implausible, when Bruce Willis our big Captain America calls in the help of his oddball team in the forms of Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, and t'others, i was in stitches right up until Liv Tyler had to share a scene with Ben Affleck. <br/><br/>Steve Buscemi's performance was priceless, even when playing sleazy weirdo's he's got this amazing comic touch and an ability to make you care about his fate. If he had died I would have stopped watching. Maybe. I was actually quite surprised he didn't, i swear he always dies in films. I felt a bit sorry for Owen Wilson too, he didn't get enough screen time, even if he does have the weirdest nose ever, and I was genuinely surprised that they didn't sweep back and pull Bruce Willis from the brink of death, doom and destruction, in true Hollywood style. But ah well, I didn't exactly miss him.<br/><br/>The angst scenes with Liv Tyler were unnecessary. As were the love scenes between her and Ben Affleck. In fact, her entire performance was unnecessary, i reckon they only cast her cos tehy needed a chick. Come of think of it, if they wanted a chick in the movie they should have put one on the mission. Bruce Willis was watchable, he's not a great actor but he knows what he's good at and sticks to it, and I like some of the films he's been in (Army of the 12 monkeys, 5th element) and Ben Affleck was so inoffensive i forgot he was there for most of the film. Oh yeah, i just remembered there was a chick on the mission, i forgot her too.<br/><br/>Anyway, onto the bulk of the film, where they drill holes in an Asteroid and nuke it, I thought this was formulaic, but tense all the same. Probably because i'm paranoid about the end of the world. The special effects i thought actually added to the drama, which is odd because I could usually do without them. The great part about this was that it wasn't even taken too seriously, Steve Buscemi's space dementia picked me up at times where i felt any more layers of tense situation would make me explode. some of his one-liners, if not particularly original, were delivered expertly and with just the right amount of laughter at himself. I love Steve Buscemi, I really do. I want him to rule the world. And that pseudo Russian guy who didn't sound Russian (I dated a Russian bloke OK, I know what tehy sound like) he was funny too. I've forgotten his name but he's been in some good films. <br/><br/>So anyway, they save the world, everyone (including me) is very relieved, Steve Buscemi makes it back to earth (i'm even more relieved) and the film ends. It was good, I felt satisfied with it. If I'd seen it in the cinema I would have felt that i'd had enough thrills and laughs for my money. And Steve Buscemi! ^___________^<br/><br/>Maybe i'm a little biased. I have a soft spot for overly-long films, and films about the end of the world (because i'm paranoid about it), but anyhow, apart from King Kong (which i loved, also overly long!) I'd say this is my favourite Hollywood Blockbuster; it was tense, injected humour and sorrow in similar amounts, it was professionally done and very slick, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I found myself actually fearing the end of the world, even though i knew it wasn't going to happen, and... come on, Steve Buscemi! I love him!<br/><br/>Oh my Gosh I'm a freak! I just wrote 750 words on Armageddon! Make that 766."
"ithinkmynamesbrandon","10","1","2","17 June 2006"," A story of love, sacrifice, and the greater good.
","Armageddon draws tears every time I watch it. A group of miscreants led by Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) go into space to save the planet. They completely disregard the importance of their life in regard to the lives of the other people on Earth. One person, however, stands out and makes the ultimate sacrifice. Harry Stamper sacrifices himself not just for the sake of the planet, but for the sake of the love his daughter, Grace (Liv Tyler) has found with A.J. (Ben Affleck) A.J. drew the short straw and was chosen to sacrifice himself for the people of Earth, but as he is making his way to do so Harry rips A.J.'s oxygen supply and throws him back onto the ship. He tells A.J. to take care of his daughter and he takes the responsibility of saving the planet."

","It's not a cinematic winner or probably even close, but I can't help loving this movie. It makes me laugh and cry EVERY time I see it.<br/><br/>I love Liv Tyler even if I have to see Ben Affleck with her. The thing is just this - Ben isn't so bad. He's not emotionally closed off like he seems in most other movies. Plus - he's playing a real guy - not like his other movies where the ""real guy"" isn't so real.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is also hard to take for me regularly, but I like the fatherly love he shows - even when angry. It's great. So, it makes me laugh and cry - what's a girl to do! Plus Steve Buschemi = who couldn't LOVE HIM!!!! He needs to be in more movies. It's GREAT! watch it - it's a little far fetched, but it's great entertainment - you won't be sorry you watched."

And you can also see that the film has been nominated for 4 Oscars. The movie also has romance in it, witch is quite important for a good movie like this. I think this movie deserves at least 7 on the vote-rate but of course; the taste of movie is always difference."

","I heard someone once say, that a movie is a great movie when you watch it again and again. <br/><br/>This is one of those movies. <br/><br/>It is not the best out there, but it is entertaining and fun. Please remember that this is a MOVIE and you must suspend reality for a couple of hours. When you do that, you can truly enjoy the experience. <br/><br/>I was taken on an emotional roller-coaster. I felt the love of a father, the joy of a new relationship, the loyalty of long time friends and much, much more. On one of the message boards here on IMDb, this movie made many top ten tearjerker movies. It is filled with action and heart. Give it a chance and let yourself be taken to space.<br/><br/>""I understand that you are handicapped by a natural immaturity, and I forgive you."" - Grace Stamper"
"Jakealope","6","1","2","9 May 2006"," Great Escapism, Hollywood at it's best
","It had all the classic new Hollywood schtick: a collection of irascible psychopaths, nerds and ruff neck drillers and oil explorers, under the lead of Die Hard himself. Willis sets the tone in the beginning when he tees off a golf ball from his drilling platform at a Greenpeace boat. The plot is simple and compelling: Earth will be destroyed by an asteroid unless Willis and his crew, with some interesting astro & cosmonauts flying the ultra useful and dependable space shuttle(Peter Storer as a whacked out Russian cosmonaut, great), to drill a hole in the asteroid and blast it in two with a hydrogen bomb.<br/><br/>Real basic stuff, good action and special effects and it's unpredictable. Eliminate the Ben Affleck - Liv Tyler love angle, she plays the boss's daughter, and the drecky song by Aerosmith, replace it with more action, and the movie would be 2x as good. If you ae looking for heavy themes and deep meaning, you will be disappointed, but if you want something entertaining and colorful, this is your ticket"

I like this movie because it shows us that now, humans can stop this natural nemesis. Especially now, because this movie was aired 5 years ago, I think. The actors are great and the plot is awesome. But I wondered how could a bunch of oil drillers find themselves on a trip to an asteroid? I think they were very lucky, I wish I could go into space for free.

"dhreid","8","1","2","19 March 2006"," Exciting with Fantastic FX
","I really thought this was a really good sci-fi flick. There is superb character development, lots of recognizable actors and tremendous action. Even though the basic premise of the film has been done so many times before, they do a good job with this version. It's pretty long but it could have been longer or even a TV series. The film must have been great in the theaters on a wide screen. I hate widescreen DVDs and TV movies since they either cut off the actor's head or feet or stretched horizontally. There is love, humor, sadness and best of all lots of excitement. There is hardly a shot or scene that lasts more than three minutes. They really pack a lot of stuff into this flick. This is not the best sci-fi I have ever seen but it ranks up there with the best,,,and no monster or aliens."
"dgl1199","8","1","2","27 February 2006"," Fantastic fun, but not without problems
","This film underscores the difference between the movie, and the BLOCKBUSTER. This was created with the latter in mind. What is sacrifices in acting, plot, and versimilitude it more than compensates with just one hell of a great action film. It wasn't created to change lives.<br/><br/>The bad stuff first, who thought Liv Tyler could act? I mean look at her, she's awful. Ben Affleck is also a terrible actor, but this was the better of his performances. Then there's science and Hollywood science. I was not an astrophysics major but even I could tell that this film was re-writing most of the scientific premises mankind has known for centuries. Little things like the shuttle's approach to the asteroid through a cosmic shower of rocks at 22,000 MPH was just a little hard to believe. Fire and wind on the asteroid, the Evel Knieval Armadillo jump, on and on. It's moments like those who say ""hey wait a second.."" and then you just have to let it go. Oh and let's not forget the ""impenetrable titanium alloy skin"" on these shuttles. Except when it comes to bullets.<br/><br/>Otherwise this film was amazing. Very entertaining, very interesting. While many flame Bruce Willis' acting ability I have always thought he brings a sincerity of spirit to each of his roles. His performance was warm and likable. I thought Billy Bob Thornton was the best thing in this film. The supporting cast of ""retards turned astronauts"" added a comedic, yet human, dimension which worked great. The patriotic tenor of the film was unmistakable, yet not obnoxious. By then end of this film even I shed a tear or two. And thats's really all it's about. Escapist pleasure, pure and simple. And hey let's face it, if the film simply reproduced real physics and real space travel then, well, I think we could say we've already seen The Right Stuff.<br/><br/>Loads of fun, great post-view conversation material, and unexpected swerves make this film a hit.

","When I first saw this movie it was at my age 18! Me and my girlfriend at the time went to the cinema and I was not expecting anything more the a good :-) time. It took me five minutes to realize that this was more then just a great time. I loved Bruce Willis from before and just more after this. What can you say about a girl like Liv Tyler and how cool can a man be, I think the answer is Steve Buscimi.<br/><br/>I am from Sweden so the acting from Peter Stormare just make the whole thing better. I do not think that I can present to you how I feel for this movie. I have seen it on week days on my own, at the cinema with my old girlie and on Sundays with a hung over. Every time at least a couple of tears have been dropping from my eyes. When? At several times in the movie, for example when the mother tells her little child that the man on the screen is not a salesman but his father and of course when they meet at the landing field. When Bruce is the coolest man in the world and putting Mr. Afleck in to the shuttle, oh my god it is almost dropping a tear when I write this. <br/><br/>10+ is all I can say, if you have not seen it please do and if you have seen it please see it again!"

","This movie is absolutely amazing. I cried through all of it. Some people see this film as boring and dull....hello?? What is wrong with them? This is like one of the best movies ever made in my opinion. With an all-star cast including, Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler, who couldn't resist it? Any movie including Bruce and Ben can be an amazing one. The special effects when they're in space is really really good and the astronauts all form a special bond which is very warm and it made me cry and cry and cry....really it did.<br/><br/>The end is just to upsetting. I am not going to say what happens because it will ruin the plot and i do not want to be added to the black list but u will die of sadness. (not literally). Anyway everyone knows what happiness in the end don't they? Everyone must have seen this movie."

","I have seen bad films in the last few years and I have seen Armageddon. I thought it won't be hard to better Deep Impact, a near identical film made a few months earlier but this failed in all ways I know.<br/><br/>This film does not innovate or cover new territory. Like so many films before it a disaster is imminent and ""heroes"" have to risk all in their lives to save the world. Tacky. The film-makers premise is to entertain but most people lost interest soon after the lame computer graphic introduction, Including a destructed Chrysler Building which, now appears like a September 11 terrorist attack.<br/><br/>One of the most hopeless and pointless films of the 1990s."

","Bruce Willis leads his men, a group of eccentric guys that have drilled for him all over the world, into space when NASA calls for help when news of a giant meteor coming toward the Earth hits. Director Micahel Bay does a decent job with this disaster/end of the world flick, but let's be honest here. This is no great film. It has lots of action, weird, one-dimensional characters quipping humourless one-liners, and a plot with little gravity toward any kind of reality. It is a very entertaining film yet does not compel like something like Independence Day or The Day After Tomorrow. I even enjoyed The Core more(no pun intended). Willis gives his action hero performance of little depth and Ben Affleck - well, the less said the better. Liv Tyler is nothing more than scenery, and the rest of the cast is pretty much one stereotypical character after another: the guy on the bike, the annoying man who talks all the time, etc... The guys playing these roles are fun to a degree. I enjoyed seeing Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Buschemi, and all the rest. But none of them are real at all. The only performer I actually thought brought a little credibility to his role was Billy Bob Thornton as a head at Nasa who had a leg infirmity not allowing him to go on the mission. Bay does have some wonderful special effects of cities being destroyed and the meteor itself is quite impressive. And the ending - though coming right at you straight on does have some poignancy to it and at the same time a bit of ridiculousness as well. I am not giving Armageddon a bad review but it is an average, action film at best."

","Armageddon is one of those movies, which require a theater to back them up: if you would take away all the special effects, great sound track and sound effects you would have a pile of mediocre written drama. And couple of funny jokes.<br/><br/>I saw Armageddon in theater when it first came out and I was pretty pleased with it, I got what I wanted: a piece of popcorn flick, which didn't require brain activity in any level and I was entertained.<br/><br/>But, I've also seen this movie from TV couple of times and I must say, small box isn't doing any favors for this flick, it's just not the same, effects wont make your chair tremble nor do those special effects look grand. Actually this is one of those movies which will age very badly and it does all ready look old in certain places. But hey, maybe someone will remake this after 30 or so years. We'll have 3D holographic effects by then I wager.<br/><br/>So, anyway, if you are gonna watch this movie don't do it because you need a brain puzzler ala ""2001: Space Odyssey"", but do it, if you have decent home theater and you need to turn your brain off for a while. That's what this movie does best."

","Armageddon is the story of a team of oil drillers who end up becoming a space crew that must destroy an asteroid the size of Texas which will destroy the earth. There, I just gave you the whole film synopsis in a nutshell. This is one of those flicks where you just have to sick back and enjoy it. You have to throw some of the things you expect from serious filming to the curve because it is obvious that the directors did the same thing.<br/><br/>The film defines what a summer film should be. Mindless and more mindless while making the audience laugh and cry. There is a saying that the majority of the nation's moviegoers go to the movies to get a break from reality. Moviegoers want to be shocked. They want to laugh. To cry. To have their life changed. But I digress. On with the review. We have explosions. Explosions. And in case you missed it the first time, more explosions. There are plenty of laughs, witty lines, and funny situations. And unless you're some stone hearted person, the ending of the film will get a tear or two from you. I thought the montage of Harry Stamper's daughter's life(which is in turn his life in a way) flashing before his eyes before he blows up the asteroid(and gives his life as a result) is one of the most touching moments of film I've ever seen. It always makes me emotional. I highly regret not seeing this film in theaters.<br/><br/>7/10"
"Wulfstan10","4","1","2","15 March 2005"," Less than Mediocre
","This film simply is not good. It is far from the worst film I have ever seen, but it is simply mindless entertainment, a fact which even most of those praising it admit. This alone does not make a bad film, as not every film has to be deep or insightful, but this movie is extremely mindless and in order to succeed as entertainment it must be pulled off really well. This film is not.<br/><br/>The basic plot is, needless to say, not original. Again, while originality alone is not necessary for a good film, it is just one of many things wrong with it. The lack of originality is hit home by the fact that Deep Impact, exploring the same issue, came out about the same time (and, I think, is a much better film).<br/><br/>The film is, moreover, thoroughly predictable. The story, the characters, and the ending are all predictable. The only exceptions are actually worse than predictability because they involve events or apparent jokes that are either tasteless and inane, or surprising simply because they seem completely out of place and inappropriate (see below).<br/><br/>The acting, events, and development of the plot range from mediocre to simply inane, with stupid people in places they shouldn't be, and people doing utterly moronic things at utterly inappropriate times. Apparently, some of these elements seem to have been designed for humour, but they come across as just stupid and out of place. Other bits of humour are simply crude and tasteless.<br/><br/>In short, this film lacked in pretty much every aspect: intelligence, originality, predictability, development, etc. Thus, even for pure entertainment ""disaster"" films, it simply does not shine at all and is a mediocre production even among mindless films. The result is quite boring and not worth the time. It did not fail uniformly terribly in all aspects, though, and there are many much worse films out there."
"internut-6","3","1","2","4 January 2005"," Suspending disbelief is one thing, suspending common sense is another
","This film contains some of the most dreadful physics that I've ever seen. They spin the space station Mir with the shuttle docked to it to create gravity. Perhaps this was done to save the producers the cost of renting the 'vomit comet' to film the zero-g sequences as was done in Apollo 13. However, not only would the docked shuttle tear itself from it's moorings in reality, but the station is shown rotating on it's axis where in one scene, an actor was climbing a ladder and there was gravity there! So they cheesed out on the effects and still didn't get it right! My other beef with this movie is the plot device where you the viewer are told that something must happen in X amount of time, and then of course you get down to the last possible second before the thing happens. This movie overused this plot device worse than I've ever seen. I can take it in every other Star Trek episode, but in Armageddon, the first time it was exciting, the second time it was OK, by the third time I was checking my watch and figuring out if I could hit the popcorn stand and be back before Bruce saved the day."

A meteor is heading for earth & the American government decides to save us all by training a bunch of tabaco chewing redneck oil drillers to be astronauts.....er, wouldn't it have been quicker to train the astronauts to be drillers? This film was worth watching for one of the greatest comedy moments on film, i refer to the final scene when the guy that was the fly in the ointment at ground control walks up to Liv Tyler and says 'please let me shake the hand of the daughter of the bravest man i've ever met' (Brucie) oh pleeeese ( pass the sick bucket) Is it any wonder that the rest of the world has such a low opinion of the American public.

I think it is impossible to see that scene without tears. It is a very serious scene, but I felt Harry's deep love toward his daughter.<br/><br/>Armageddon is as thrilling as Titanic. But it is more moving than Titanic because it tells us much more than Titanic---not only love between a man and a woman but also love between a father and a daughter and friendship.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie especially to young women because I believe it will make them realize their father's love which they take for granted.<br/><br/>I rate this movie at 10/10."

First of all, I want to say cheers to the many who agree.  And now my why:<br/><br/> It is an entertainment movie.  For all of you who have seen this and expected something serious, and Oscar worthy, Buuuu!  That is your folly. This movie is great action, well placed humor, interesting settings and scenery, great special Fx, and some good jokes/messages about life of today. How else can mankind tackle an astronomical problem but with the help of all the world?  Yeah, some flag waving, but if this movie was made in Italy, I'm sure they would have the right to display their tricolor as well.<br/><br/> Did I say anything about great acting?  No.  But I will say actors like Buscemi, Patton and Stormere deserve kudos. Plainly, this movie is fun.  It can be watched over and over.  It has good emotional value, and Michael Bay's style of directing is at times misunderstood.  At first, I found the pacing and quick cuts distracting, but that is exactly what this movie underlines; the quick time frame it all takes place in.  It is a trademark of Bay's, noticible in other films, that give this film and others their pace.  He is precise and curt, but manages to add in the subtle (upsidedown flag on Mir, the little skull head on the Armadillo's stick) points and views that make this a great film.<br/><br/>So go ahead and rip on it, refuse to watch it.  Your loss. This is not the best film ever, but it is well done and good entertainment."

","*light spoilers*<br/><br/>OK, I admit, the physics of this movie are plainly ridiculous, much of the acting (Affleck) is cheesy and the story is predictable.<br/><br/>But this movie succeeds in creating a dense emotional atmosphere, not towards one of the characters, but to the setting itself. Best example: You don't care WHO gets to manually detonate the bomb at the end. You only care THAT the bomb is detonated so that the mission succeeds. This emotional bondage is greatly created by a very thoughtful use of slow-motion and an intensely gripping musical score.) And you feel a great satisfaction that it DID succeed, a feeling that touches your conscience so greatly that you feel deeply emotionally involved with the protagonists. I have to admit that the feeling is so intense that the final scenes brought tears to my eyes. Next to ""Armageddon"", only ""Titanic"" has ever succeeded in doing so.<br/><br/>I also have to disagree with quagga about the ""Hail to the US""-thing of this movie. I know a lot of End-of-the-world-movies who exceed the US-patriotism, like ""Independence Day"".<br/><br/>So, this movie has many flaws, sure, but it touches even the intellectual (!) viewer on a level that he surely did not expect.

","I sincerely have watched this movie over a thousand times, and many others, and this film will always hit my top ten spot. People may think other-wise, but I have no idea why. Its content and characters are excellent. It's also very realistic.<br/><br/>The plot is that an asteroid as long as Texas and six miles wide is aimed for Earth, and a deep core drilling team is called in by NASA to dig 800 feet and nuke it. Harry (Bruce) plays a father who has his fist clenched into his hand on his daughter, on top and it is a typical thing a father will do these days with a daughter, be on top, but too much. This film has action, explosions, drama, comedy, sexuality, language, and reality. It isn't like a big laser, each character has a different personality. You can see it to be awed, to clap, to cry, to laugh, to be amazed.<br/><br/>
I think the writers did a fantastic job, and the beginning with Charlton speaking the narration was the best, introducing the plot, and giving you chills running down your spine and arms. I mean, I have never liked the main actor to die, but to die so nobally was incredible, because realistically and honestly, some men won't do it. By far, I give this film a 9.6, for it lacked a few qualities, but not really, and I recommend it to anyone to watch, and enjoy."

The concept of rugged and social castaway oil workers teaming up with NASA/Air Force officers, and even a Russian Cosmonaut, makes for a very colorful and entertaining atmosphere.  Even Affleck and Tyler's romantic bit, which detracted somewhat from the movie for me, couldn't kill the story.  Surprisingly, it added to the ending (I won't give anything away except for ""Give this to Truman"")<br/><br/>While there are some scientific errors (i.e.fire in space), they didn't detract from the movie.<br/><br/>I really liked this movie.

","Armageddon is neither the best, nor worst, movie ever made.  Reading some of the previous comments here, it is apparent that some people may have forgotten the whole concept of what a movie is supposed to provide; namely, entertainment.  While some films, admittedly, are based in fact, Armageddon is A FANTASY.  How is anyone going to be able to make a film about (Spoilers ahead:) the potential end of the world and do so accurately?  This film isn't supposed to be a training manual for how to save the world, merely an entertaining ""what if?"".<br/><br/>Yes, the idea of the government calling on Bruce Willis to drill into the center of an asteroid heading for Earth is preposterous.  So what?  It's not as if there would be any reason for anyone at the Pentagon to have given any serious thought to this particular chain of events happening beforehand, is there?  Even Billy Bob Thornton (who was surprisingly understated in his role) admitted to Willis that there was no back-up plan.  If they had a better idea, they would've used it, don't you think?<br/><br/>Had Willis and his crew played this completely straight, the entertainment value would've been nil.  Armageddon was basically about a bunch of, essentially, misfits banding together to save mankind.  Any flaws in logic in the script, to me, were most welcome.  If I wanted to watch a documentary, I would've tuned into PBS.  This was a good old-fashioned rah rah kind of escapist film.  Willis was nothing like his typical wise guy character;  choosing, instead, to create a flawed man who was devoted to his job, as well as his daughter.  There were enough special effects to keep even the most jaded viewer happy.<br/><br/>The bottom line?  Armageddon is exactly what you would expect a movie about saving the world to be like.  The stereotypical characters that are a must in such films are pretty much all represented here.  Does it work?  I would say a definite yes."

But as a whole, it clicks. I've read reviews complaining about how the film was edited, but if it was not editing in the manner it was, it would have been interminable experience to sit through. (It was a two and one-half hour movie. It did not feel like a two and one-half hour movie. That is a sign of...GOOD EDITING..)<br/><br/>Let's look at some of the bits in the film: you have a bunch of roughneck oil drillers who have commissioned to save the world.

I won't spoil how this winds up, but someone does something in this film that can be best expressed in one word: messianic.<br/><br/>I have seen this film multiple times since its release and each time, I find getting weepy each time.

And lets not even get into the basic premise, that NASA would send a bunch of hard drinking, hard fighting rough necks into space as mankind's last and only hope to save the planet.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm being too hard, but I found this movie to be inane and pointless.

I haven't laughed so hard at a sci-fi-comedy since ""Mars Attacks!"". Almost from the very start you could easily tell that the movie, though purportedly about a horrific doomsday scenario - namely, an asteroid the size of Texas careening into planet Earth (where everybody in the world lives, wouldn't ya' know it!) - never intended itself to be taken too seriously.<br/><br/>It seems that every serious scene or sequence in the film was immediately followed by something totally comic or ludicrous. And it just got ludicrouser and ludicrouser as the film went on. By the time Steve Buscemi's character, Rockhound, got ""space mania"" and had to be duct-taped to a chair, I was nearly in stitches from laughing so hard. [If the ""real"" end of the world is even half as funny, well, I'm ready for it NOW.]<br/><br/>The movie is chock full of wonderfully wacky characters and off-the-wall dialogue that (assuming you have even a smidgen of a sense of humor) should keep you at least grinning, if not guffawing, throughout. The movie is filled with rapid-fire action sequences, almost none of which is remotely believable or even scientifically possible, but hey, it looks good, and it just adds to the overall zaniness of the film.<br/><br/>So for all of you space cadets who are out there in space looking for a great science fiction drama about the end of Earth, but instead found ""Armageddon"", a truly decent space comedy, I now command you to get on the radio and call back to Earth: ""Houston... We have a comedy."""

If saving the world was really on the line, wouldn't we want the smartest and the most capable people up there? (Remember, the movie opens with Willis, the leader, recklessly wielding a gun; this act is repeated later by another actor yet). This movie did nothing to convince me that Bruce Willis and his boys could do the job to begin with, much less better than anyone else.<br/><br/>The script is full of annoying asides and wisecracks that we expect to find in a Bond movie. Here they're out of place and annoying, if we're supposed to take the seriousness of the threat of the end of the world. Maybe that wasn't the intention. The movie was incredibly formulaic for such a long movie. I was able to predict many of the plot turns long before they occurred because of that. The movie's breakneck pace was off-putting too, racing from one special effects scene to the next. However, the special effects were pretty good I must admit. Many of the musical bridges were annoying; because, they were too loud and muffled the dialog. Some of the songs had little to do with the scene they were used in, like Sweet Emotion for instance. It was one big, dumb, long, loud, empty-headed, extremely shallow music video, like many one finds on MTV. It might have worked better as camp, with Aerosmith playing on the asteroid perhaps. After a promising start, the movie just seemed to fade away and become more routine (formulaic) with each passing minute, despite the intensity of some isolated scenes. After the movie, we are treated to the Aerosmith video of the complete version of the Oscar-nominated song, which lost to When You Believe from Prince Of Egypt. ** of 4 stars."

Assuming you have the requisite amount of matter in your cranium that can be distressed, how can this movie not give you a headache?  It's loud, moronic, and insufferably long, and the A.D.D. editing just makes the ordeal that much harder to tolerate.<br/><br/>Another reason I looked up ARMAGEDDON was to see why and how a movie nobody seems to like made over $200M at the box office.  It's dismaying to discover that people who think highly of this movie really exist.

"TheEtherWalk","4","1","2","17 November 2002"," Only so-so movie, but the FX are great!
","The movie Armageddon is typical Jerry Bruckheimer fare. It combines a massive budget and plenty of special effects with an average script and semi-serious plot.<br/><br/>Where do I begin? Armageddon is a lopsided movie. The premise is that an asteroid the size of Texas (?) is headed for earth and a team of oil drillers are employed to stop it. The movie sounds serious, but it is really a comedy.<br/><br/>Most of the asteroid scene is an error because the only things they would be able to hear is each other's voices. There are too many sound effects on the asteroid to make it believable.<br/><br/>The best parts of this movie are the visual effects which were outstanding and Steve Buscemi who provides comic relief as the hilarious Rockhound. The beginning scene in NYC is quite well done, but after that the plot seems to go downhill. How is it that the guys on the oil rig have not heard about the disaster in NY? And don't even get me started on the whole nuke-on-the-surface-wouldn't-work thing, because it probably would. That scene on the Russian space station was so far-fetched that it blows my mind. But again, that's most Jerry Bruckheimer movies.<br/><br/>Then there is that whole manual-detonate thing at the end. Why didn't NASA think of that in the first place, rather than trying to detonate the bomb on the surface, killing the whole crew? This was a weak way to add drama to the script.<br/><br/>The dialogue is funny in some parts, but in most scenes it is just stupid. That might have something to do with the fact that the movie had 9 WRITERS!!!<br/><br/>Overall, I think people are too hard on judging this movie. People have given it 1 out of 4, and some people have given it 3 out of 4, but no one has given it 2 out of 4. So I will. I give it ** out of **** or 5/10."
"mentor397","7","1","2","16 November 2002"," Has anyone seen this movie without a chip on their shoulder?
","Sometimes I wonder about the people who watch movies and those who comment on them.  This movie was never meant to be the end-all scientific question/debate/answer on the subject of asteroids.  I find it interesting that many of the people who complain about the movie either find fault in nonexistent problems (cups of coffee falling in space - that was back at NASA!) or they assume things they know nothing about.  The solar system is a big place, and asteroids four times the size of Texas are found at regular intervals much less ""just"" the size of Texas.<br/><br/>   It's true, this movie jumps around a lot.  But they have a lot of story to cover.  And, i'll say this for the movie, unlike Deep Impact - which is just as cheesy, this movie does keep your attention riveted.  From it's comedy to it's music, to the shifting scenes, to the actors themselves, everything happens right after another.<br/><br/>    This movie fulfills in some part a fantasy of many people.  Being called to save the world because they know something other people don't.  Sorry to ruin your theories guys, but NASA astronauts don't know everything.  Often they are trained and trained and trained on specific tasks for years - just to eliminate mistakes.  When you've only got eighteen days to train someone to do something important, you want to pick someone who's good enough to handle unforeseen problems that might arise.  Drilling a hole in space isn't like rock collecting, it's something that requires skill and practice.<br/><br/>    Some science critics apparently haven't watched the movie before they complained about it.  The moon is far more than a thirty minute trip. Truman tells the astronauts good morning.  That means a day has gone by. Gravity, even if it is far less, still works in space.  ""Heavy"" - i.e. massive objects will still ""fall"".  I admit the sounds was extraneous, but who complains about sound in Star Wars?  And for people who argue that NASA would never run a mission like this, think about it.  How many times has NASA had to identify, plan, and execute a mission in 18 days?  How many times has the Earth truly been in danger of existence-threatening events?<br/><br/>    My only complaint was the scope of the movie.  It tried to do too much while still keeping it exciting to the average viewer.  As a result, scenes are cut until they're only on a shot for a few seconds and then the camera is off to the next scene.  It's hard to believe how much they actually do in such a short time, but its effect is measurable.  This movie just keeps on going."
"LebowskiT1000","10","1","2","14 October 2002"," All in good fun, but not excellent.
","Ever since this film and ""Deep Impact"" came out, I've been unsure as to which I liked better.  I've always been leaning towards Deep Impact, so the other day I watched ""Deep Impact"" and today I watched ""Armageddon"".  I have to say that on the whole, I liked Deep Impact much more.  But that doesn't mean that Armageddon isn't a good movie, in it's own right, Armageddon has some good things going for it.<br/><br/>Armageddon is much ""flash-ier"" than Deep Impact and definitely more action-oriented.  You can tell that director Michael Bay went for the ""what looks coolest"" approach, which is fine with me, but sometimes he went a little too far.  Michael Bay also seems to like going for the ""absolute worst case scenario"" / ""get there just in time"" sort of situations.  As I said, Armageddon has some good things going for it.  The story is pretty good, the acting is quite good, there is a great deal of humor, a lot of great lines, and some superb special effects.  Also, this films plays the ""romance chip"" much more than Deep Impact does, so if it's romance you want, then this is the film for you.<br/><br/>There are a bunch of superb actors in this film, including Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, William Fichtner, Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan, Peter Stormare, Jason Isaacs, Ken Hudson Campbell, and Keith David.  All of the cast did a fantastic job and I really liked their characters!  I thought they were all very unique and quite interesting to watch.  Their interactions were great to watch as well.<br/><br/>All in all, I thought this was just a fun, action-packed, humorous, sci-fi story, with a touch of romance.  I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, but it should appeal to a wide variety of people.  Also, don't start watching this film expecting a completely realistic film, because this isn't.  It's just a fun story, with a lot of cool things to look at.  I would say that if you're torn between watching ""Armageddon"" or ""Deep Impact"" and don't plan on watching both films, then go with Deep Impact, but as I can see from the reviews on this site, it seems that everyone disagrees.  Some like Deep Impact more, some like Armageddon more, some (like me) like them both, and some hate them both.  So, I'm not really sure what to tell you.

","After a meteorite storm ravages New York City, NASA discovers that an asteroid the size of Texas is speeding toward Earth. With just eighteen days before impact, NASA executive director Dan Truman (BILLY BOB THORNTON) discovers that he has only one viable option -- to drill a hole in the asteroid and then plant and detonate a nuclear bomb hoping that the internal explosion will split the rock into two pieces that will miss Earth. Thus, Truman enlists Harry Stamper (BRUCE WILLIS) and his deep core oil drilling team, known to be the best in the world. Harry's got other problems, however -- most notably trying to keep one of his gung ho workers, A.J. Frost (BEN AFFLECK) ,away from his beautiful adult daughter, Grace (LIV TYLER). Even so, Harry realizes he has to go and save the world and agrees to do what he can. Thus, he and team -- which includes Frost; his best friend, Chick Chapple (WILL PATTON); a squirrelly geologist, Rockhound (STEVE BUSCEMI); big man Max Lennert (KEN CAMPBELL); and an odd assortment of other characters train for their dangerous mission.Blasting off into space aboard two space shuttles, Harry and his team are accompanied by NASA astronauts Colonel Willie Sharp (WILLIAM FICHTNER), co-pilot Jennifer Watts (JESSICA STEEN), and mission specialist Gruber (GRAYSON McCOUCH). There they dock with a Russian space station where cosmonaut Lev Andropov (PETER STORMARE) joins them after a calamitous accident. From that point on, the assembled team races toward the asteroid. Encountering various obstacles and bureaucratic blunders back on Earth, Harry and his team race against time to drill eight hundred feet into the rock, plant the nuke, and blast off before the asteroid plummets into the Earth, completely destroying it in a fiery Armageddon. This is a great film and one of the best that came out this summer with a great mix off action,comedy and drama and much more entertaining than DEEP IMPACT and if you like Michal Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer then you will not be disappointed.

Although Armageddon made more money, Deep Impact had a much smaller budget to begin with.  Therefore making a larger percentage gain. Armageddon had terrible acting. The special effects were good but there was nothing groud-breaking.  However, that is the definition of a summer blockbuster.  If they wanted an Oscar winning performance, they would have had an entirely different cast.  In my opinion, Deep Impact was the better film. If you're looking for lots of FX, loud noises, and numerous one-liners, see Armageddon.  If you're looking for plot, acting, and a movie that won't ruin your ears, see Deep Impact.

","This is a good movie, great at times and too much to handle at others.  It's still worth seeing (and definately more enjoyable than the putrid Pearl Harbor).  The characters are pretty well done with some depth to all of them, and they're likeable and different (unlike Pearl Harbor).<br/><br/>This movie shifts gears from drama to comedy to action, and even though it's a little akward they do each part well (the comedy scenes are fantastic). There's also a nice romance between Tyler/Affleck (helped along by the theme song by Aerosmith and a cover of a John Denver tunes).<br/><br/>The cast is great, with Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, and Michael Clarke Duncan among others. They turn in very entertaining performances.<br/><br/>Still, the last half-hour or so gets into a few too many cliffhangers to suspend disbelief, which takes away something from the movie.  It's still an entertaining ride despite this critical flaw.<br/><br/>And anyone who calls this the ""Worst Movie Ever"" obviously hasn't seen a lot of movies.  This is certainly on the upper end of blockbusters.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

My uncle watched it once and his chronic nostril acne vanished the next day!<br/><br/>""What the heck is WRONG with you, Gremlin?"" they ask, appalled by my degenerate point of view.  ""How can you POSSIBLY hate this movie?""<br/><br/>Let me count the ways:<br/><br/>ONE is for the fact that ""Armageddon"" proposes that it is easier to train a bunch of oil drillers to be astronauts (without a single one failing any test, and with a deadline set by a gigantic asteroid about to knock us out of orbit and send us screaming into the center of the sun) than it is to show a professional space team how to operate a drill.<br/><br/>TWO is for the destruction of New York City being practically forgotten after it happens.  You'd expect something like that to at least make the national news in a few seconds but there's no mention of it once we're on the oil rig in the next scene.<br/><br/>THREE is for the introduction of Bruce Willis' character.  He's supposed to be the hero.  The audience isn't going to like the hero all that much if, the first time we meet him, he's chasing his daughter's boyfriend with a massive shotgun.  (Well, you wouldn't THINK the audience would like him.)<br/><br/>FOUR is for how a single character dies in ""Top Gun"" (the Bruckheimer/Scott movie I actually like) and we're bawling, while the entire population of Paris is wiped out in ""Armageddon"" and it barely raises an eyebrow.<br/><br/>FIVE is for how everyone I've met enjoys this movie over ""the Truman Show"", which is like preferring the taste of dog food to Filet Mignon.<br/><br/>SIX is for how there's Earth normal gravity in the space station and the asteroid unless the plot requires for it to be less, so Ben Affleck can play Evil Knevil.<br/><br/>SEVEN is for how there are Dramatic Sunsets everywhere on Earth at the same time, ignoring time zones and the International Date Line.<br/><br/>EIGHT is for the Inevitable Red Wire/Green Wire Bomb Disarming Scene.  First of all, I'm not a detonation expert but I'm pretty sure government issued bombs do not follow this pattern.  Second of all, *ahem* THE GUY TRYING TO DISARM THE BOMB BUILT THE DAMN THING IN THE FIRST PLACE!!! Shouldn't he know how it works?<br/><br/>NINE is for the Touching Finale where a character must sacrifice himself so that he can set the bomb off, exploding the asteroid and saving the planet. So why in the heck does he feel it necessary to give a Big Long Soliloquy AT THE LAST MINUTE, THREATENING EVERY SINGLE CREATURE ON THE PLANET WITH AN AGONIZING DEATH, so he can say farewell to his friends?!?<br/><br/>TEN is for that damn Aerosmith song.  It's their only number one hit.  Of all their songs, that Dianne Warren penned tripe is the most popular.

","Okay, most of you people have got this movie ALL WRONG. This movie is NOT supposed to be especially realistic. It is suppose to be fun, and entertaining, and above all, DRAMATIC.(ie: the music video-like launch, failure, and landing scenes.) I personally think this movie is fantastic because of the drama of it all. Bruce is awesome in this movie (although he was better in the Sixth Sense, and he was pretty darn cute in the Fifth Element), but ANYWAY, he is still incredible, as always. Ben Affleck did a good job of playing the loving, try-hard, innocent, little-boy type in this movie. There are some times you just want to jump in and give him a big hug. Liv Tyler was awesome as the pathetic, troubled, split-between-two-men Grace, and Will Patton was SO cute playing Chick. The rest of the characters just added more color and fun to this already colorful and fun drama! Okay, I admit, it was a little far fetched sometimes, and really unbelievable. I STILL argue and get angry about parts, even as it being my favorite movie. And as for the american flag syndrome Armageddon seems to have, its okay. Its suppose to be that way. And it gives us Americans a certain amount of pride- if you have enough immagination to let this movie give you that patriotism. Yes, I am implying that if you don't have immagination, you will not enjoy Armageddon.

In fact, there were some things i had to roll my eyes at. However, as a whole, i would say the movie was very entertaining.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that it should be taken as what it was intended to be, just an enjoyable movie, not as a documentary on ""What to do if the earth is in danger of being hit by a large asteroid.""  Yes, it's a bit silly, a bit implausible, but that's why it's called entertainment.  I have enough realism right here at home. If there was something that I thought was ridiculous about this movie, it was the number of times that the U.S. flag appears. I'm not saying this to be un-patriotic, but PLEASE, during my second viewing I counted 137 flags.  I can understand a motif, but it was so over-done that it became a cliche.  If any anti-flag-burning legislation ever gets passed, copies of 'Armageddon' being burned will deliver stiff penalties. I think the U.S. has the potential to be a great country, but if this was the message they wished to convey, I think a movie that WASN'T about saving the world would have been more appropriate. 8 out of 10"

You root for the oil drillers big time, and I personally felt quite bad when 'Deep Blue Hero-stuff' Man was killed in a crash. I think they should have kept Owen Wilson on. His guys seemed to be the one who was actually enjoying himself up there.<br/><br/>I thought the shots round the world, showing the reactions in India, Africa, Europe, the US, Turkey, etc. to the explosion above were handled Very well, the music swells and is quite moving to boot.<br/><br/>Other things to look for when seeing it-check out Will Patton's little scene with an ex-wife and his son; where he strains to let them know he has regrets, and is going to somehow go away and make up for his past failings...That is a good scene, well handled if somewhat short. I liked it.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is flat in some of his lines but is alright all in all. They could have used more pacing, and slowed up on the break neck MTV style editing that they throw at us for the whole film; there is plenty going on there to enjoy if you look for it, and they didn't need to race through so fast.<br/><br/>Having the two killers from Fargo-Buscemi and Leb there again is a hoot; and you will like Leb believe you me.

Parts they could have done without-the shotgun scenes(are these the same people who we see on the asteroid, one saying 'I love you!!!' with tears streaming down his cheeks? Hmmmm...

What it doesn't present is one good reason to sit through it. The all too familiar premise regards a meteor heading towards earth. That's right. Where else would he hurl too? Bruce Willis heads a team that would be no more suitable for a Kool Aid commercial let alone a trip to Mars. They launch into space and perform a drilling task. Director Michael Bay basically creates noise. His previous film The Rock is also a noise case but at least it is entertaining. This film is about as entertaining as setting oneself on fire and rolling around in gasoline. This is one of the worst performances out of Bruce Willis who goes from attempting to gun down her daughter's boyfriend to shedding tears with him when he decides to sacrifice himself. Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler do unquestionable things with animal crackers although it never occurs to them to eat them. Billy Bob Thorton should fire his agent for his flat role. It is as if he wandered onto the wrong set and was requested to help a film that is beyond help. Will Patton even got dragged in on this explosive diarrhea of a film.

Weathering the release of Deep Impact two months earlier, Armageddon relies on its bigger budget, bigger explosions, and bigger intense build-up of non-stop crises, and larger than life predictable entertainment to overcome a slow start to outperform Deep Impact. This big action adventure relies on a scripted pattern of hanging by your seat mini-episodes loaded with exaggerated humor, superhero outcomes, and light-hearted banter, especially from wacked out Steve Buscemi. This action fantasy is almost pure entertainment with the requisite love interest, the human sacrifices, and the frantic mission controller. This movie pushes all the audience buttons, moves at a whithering fast pace, and glorifies the Russian stereotypes to an almost embarrassing degree."

","OMG, this movie wouldn't end! Michael Bay takes an ""epic"" approach to purely schlocky crap on the screen. Gee, do we need any more hackneyed stereotypes of Southerners? (Don't worry, I'd rather slit my wrists than live under the Mason-Dixon line!) However, this turd revels in perpetuating stereotypes of ""woiking-class"" types from down South that even a Thomas Dixon would object to. Oh, and let's spice things up in the endless lull of drilling into the asteroid by having Paris wiped out. NYC doesn't look like NYC (gee, are there subway stations for 53rd & 58th streets?? A native New Yorker, I didn't know about them!), & of course it doesn't matter what Paris looks like, since it's all conveniently wiped out. Blecch!"

","There is entirely no point in listing the plausibility holes in this production. One might as well protest the impossibility of Superman defying gravity, or wearing his red underpants over his blue tights. This film is obviously not about the technicalities of travelling the solar system, astronaut training, the practical applications of nuclear power, intercultural fraternisation in outer space, or similar topics.<br/><br/>Instead, it seems to be about team spirit, meeting challenges, family values, doing the right thing, handing the torch on down the generations, self-sacrifice, and the built-in dumbness of corporate suits. Corny and as old-fashioned as anyone might wish, but I found it entertaining, and even enjoyable. I've seen Billy Bob in a number of films now and find it curious how he manages to be different, yet the same, in all of them. Interesting to note which members of the squad were disposable."

","Armageddon is a Deep Impact-like movie where an asteroid is discovered to be on a collision course with Earth after a meteor shower destroys a space shuttle and hits New York City. The asteroid is big enough that if it hits Earth, it will kill all life. Oil rig drillers are asked to fly to the asteroid and drill a hole in it and plant a bomb to blow it up. They blow it into two pieces which don't hit the Earth. This is a great movie in that the special effects are very good and it's very fun and intense. It opens with a depiction of an impact that is thought to have killed the dinosaurs and a narrator commenting on that. One of the top few best scenes and maybe the best scene is where Paris is hit by a meteorite and is destroyed in a huge explosion."

","This movie hasn't a good atmosphere, which I think is a bit important for a space movie. Instead we have stereotypical heroes from America, who are sometimes too stupid for this mission! Some scenes are also so stereotypical like the necessary ""Success in the last second"".<br/><br/>I normally like movies set in space and this has at least an interesting story, but four Oscar nominations for this movie is just an insult to other space movies... and ""The Core"" has not even a simple nomination!

","I'm not a softy per se, but a film of this magnitude and suspense leaves you with an empty feeling when the #1 hero of the film DIES at the end. See, the whole movie is intended to make you apprehensive as to whether they will ""make it"" or not, not just save the world. So, at the end, when you're supposed to be putting your fist up in the air saying ""yeah!,"" you're having a let down because Bruce Willis is walking off to his death, essentially. I would have preferred an ending in the ""Bruce Willis Style"".... you know, he and his crew DO come back, and he gets back to NASA to deck the guy responsible for not allowing him to finish the mission he was told the crew was hired for... even if it HAD to be the President of the United States! I really felt like this would have been a ""9"" movie if not for the killing of the main hero. But this movie took my emotions and built them up, up, up, and then right before the end, they changed the ""excitement"" I was feeling into a huge sorrow... and that's not the way I wanted to feel at the end of this exciting movie with characters I grew fond of. It's sort of like killing off Will Smith or Jeff Goldblum at the end of Independence Day.... it just didn't WORK for me, sorry........"

Don't see it, whatever you do. It's not entertaining at all. It's a lie! A big meteorite stone thingy is coming, and it's gonna destroy the earth. I know the solution! Bruce Willis and his macho buddies. Somehow they manage to become astronaut in only a few days. They build some kind of spaceship and a space car in less than a week, and then send all the machos out in space to stop the big bad stone. I normally like Liv Tyler, but her I just felt sorry for her. She just cried through the whole movie. Steve Buscemi the same. He is a brilliant actor, but somehow he ends up in this crap movie, which is still a mystery to me... The only good thing is the Aerosmith song ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"", which is kinda cute."

","Imagine, if you will, that Art is a planet. Imagine that this planet has a super-heated core constructed from compressed human intellect. Around this core is a mantle, formed from the fiery emotion which the intellect generates. And at the surface of this mantle is the crust: the final, coolest extremity of this hypothesis. It is made up of canyons of sculpture, seas of painting and mountains of poetry. These landscapes span the globe. This environment is populated with all the human souls that have ever lived. You are with them, in a city of televised skyscrapers.<br/><br/>The date is July 1st 1998.<br/><br/>Terrible rumours have been circulating. People have been whispering about a giant meteor. An intergalactic behemoth, they say. Something made of the same matter from which Planet Art was formed, but which is instead a grotesque parody. An abomination on a collision course. An extinction-level event.<br/><br/>A grim face appears on the colossal screens above the city.<br/><br/>""I address you tonight not as the President of Art, but as a citizen of humanity,"" booms a loud voice. ""We are faced with the very gravest of challenges. The cinema calls this day 'Armageddon'. It is the end of all things. All of you praying with us need to know that everything that can be done to prevent this disaster is being called into service: our ability to create plots without holes; our entrenched knowledge of basic screen writing; the grasp of logic to determine that installing a simple hatch for exiting a spacecraft makes more sense than installing a hotel elevator - with 'freedom' written upon it; the ability to understand a machine gun has no place on a NASA funded meteor drilling mission, and that 'Space Dementia' is about as likely to make a drilling expert fire bullets at mining equipment as Sea Alzheimers is to make an ecologist drop torpedoes on whale sharks; Every step up the ladder of realistic emotional expression, every adventurous reach into artistic originality; even the horrible soap operas that we've watched have provided us the tools to wage this terrible battle. Through all of the chaos that is our history; through all of the wrongs and the discord; through all of the pain and suffering; through all of our times, there is one thing that has nourished our souls, and elevated our species above its origins, and that is our integrity. The dreams of an entire planet are focused tonight on the brave movie critics travelling into the heavens. And may we all, citizens the world over, see these events through. God speed, and good luck to you."" The screen goes blank.<br/><br/>And Planet Art falls silent."

","Yet another prime example of what I term the ""Michael Bay method of movie making"", you take an overdeveloped script with every cliché in the book and pump in decent actors and have them ham it up oh and make sure you throw everything you can at the screen at such breakneck pace. Oh, don't forget some really annoying slow motion editing that enhances nothing in the scene. The rest of the editing should be scattered an choppy and top it all of with a blaring, to the point of annoying music score, Place in blender and mix it up, with no lid so it spill everywhere, and voilà! You have a ""Micheal Bay frothy shake with absolutely no nutritional or substantial value""! Enjoy! ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Michael Bay movies are So bleeping annoying! Its been 12 years since this festival of inept mediocrity came out and Bay still gets work. This movie was a real waste of such a talented cast like Willis, Afleck, and Thornton. The script feels like it was written by people that never elevated from junior high dialoage. The effects are acceptable, but not nearly enough to salvage the rest of the film. Of course when Bay is at the helm, making all the decisions, they is no hope for you movie at all. In conclusion: Michael Bay you suck."
"amichnea","10","1","3","13 July 2009"," Rewatched this film last Saturday
","Well I read the review done by Marcus Eden-Ellis from United Kingdom last week and though it to be quite silly, but since I did not see the film recently I couldn't comment. On Saturday as I was flicking through the channels and my missus was sleeping next to me I saw Armageddon on TV, so I started watching it until 1 AM... and today I am going to comment on some of the points that were criticised.<br/><br/>First of all: THIS IS A FICTIONARY FILM!!!! You watch it as fiction, it is pure entertainment. But if you want to be scientifically accurate... there is no proof to say this film is inaccurate... hence the fact that no one on Earth flew a ship onto an asteroid to blow it up... I hardly call that stupid. Remember the world used to be flat until not so long ago, and people got burned at a stake if they said they could fly.<br/><br/>I honestly watched this and 11 years on and I still think it is brilliant just as when I saw it in the cinema. It makes you connect with the characters, you actually feel sad and I bet some people cried at the end. It has plenty of action... and will keep you entertained.<br/><br/>My Defence for the film: Why didn't NASA send its own astronauts?? well let's see, the job was to drill on a new terrain never drilled on before. The drill team have been at it for over 30 years... so professionals... that was their jobs. Just like the pilots for the ships, I could ask why didn't they teach the drillers how to fly the ship and send them without pilots? Oh and if NASA did decide to send its pilots instead of the drillers the film would become Deep Impact:) how about that eh? I have to agree that they didn't need the Gatling guns... specially since they were trying to save space and weight.<br/><br/>""12-inch diameter drills that make 36-inch diameter holes"", well lets see the drill head was a lot wider than the pipe... guess that details was missed out by the viewer.<br/><br/>Sun glasses in a space helmet? who cares... I can drop down shades in my motorbike helmet with the click of a button... why wouldn't that be possible in a space suit? Animal crackers scene... what was wrong with that? Couple being silly... romantic...<br/><br/>'personnel trackers' on astronauts? wow that would be very very hard right? since these days you have personal GPS systems to track your kids, dog, wife:)... etc ""Ben Affleck succeeds in singlehandedly causing the whole joint to explode in spectacular Hollywood fashion."" and I though the space station blew up because of sparks and faulty fuel lines... but maybe I need to watch it again for the 10th time just to make sure.<br/><br/>""800 feet into something the size of TX is less than a pinprick"" glad people paid attention to the fact that the asteroid was a lot wider than shallow, so yeah flat way size of Texas, deep... no idea they didn't say but 800 feet was enough to cause the fissures and blow it up.<br/><br/>A gun smuggled onboard? Well since it was a military/NASA/government with civilians I would say that would be acceptable.<br/><br/>I think I covered most of the bad points, but wait the best one: ""Space Dementia"": Space dementia is the term NASA uses to describe the hypothetical mental condition a few astronauts experience when they're in space. This can be contributed towards feelings of insignificance, insecurity lack of social contact and the astronauts awareness of total isolation from the human race. The truth is actually stranger than fiction. In NASA's guidelines for space station emergencies and crisis's there is also guidelines on how to handle mental breakdowns What should be done when a fellow astronaut goes bonkers? Astronauts are instructed to bind the stricken flier's wrists and ankles with duct tape, restrain the torso with bungee cords and administer strong tranquilizers.<br/><br/>All in all I think I said enough, 11 years on and this film is a classic, has brilliant actors, good action, love story, humour and it allows you to connect with some of the characters."

","Too heroic, too melancholic, and just a typical American movie.<br/><br/>I've watched it 7 or 8 times. It is very often to see it on TV. I almost sick of it. But after so many times I watch it I realized that this movie is too heroic at all, and I don't really like it.<br/><br/>I give it 5 as I like disaster movie. It is good enough to watch but don't blame me if you find so many romantic moments in this movie. Yes I might classified this movie as a romance movie too.<br/><br/>Watch with your partner, and maybe you'll get your zone too.<br/><br/>I prefer Deep Impact than this movie since Deep Impact is a bit more realistic and less-heroic-romance moments.<br/><br/>I guess I thought this was too heroic because I saw Bruce Willis in this movie."

","Fun, exciting, movie with an amazing cast. Take Michael Bay's sometimes sloppy directing, J. J. Abrahms screenplay writing skills, Bruce Willis's awesomeness, and throw them all together, and you get Armageddon. I would have rated this a 10 out of 10, but Ben Affleck is in it, and his character (Like every other movie he's in) ruins parts of the movies, yet his character NEVER dies. And Bruce Willis always dies. What's with that? I need a movie where Bruce Willis kills Ben Affleck character. It can be sponsored by Afflack and it can be called ""Afflack presents: Affleck getting killed by Bruce Willis"". The title kind of gives the whole plot away, but it tells you what you're getting. Despite the sometimes choppy directing (STAY ON ONE SCENE FOR CHRISTS SAKE! 2.3 seconds IS NOT ENOUGH TIME FOR ME TO TELL WHATS HAPPENING!"") and Affleck's performance, this movie rocked. What makes it more awesome is they are actually filming at NASA, the first (and only) film to do so. They are using authentic NASA spacesuits valued at over 2 million a suit. In the film, they work with over 19 billion dollars worth of equipment, including a spaceship, an oil rig, and an underwater simulator. It's simple, the movie is flat out awesome."

","This could have been good, if they hadn't tried to make it so Star Wars-ish. Such a disastrous scenario is indeed possible, and an emergency mission to blow up the meteor might be one way to fix it.<br/><br/>But not like this. The Shuttle is given capabilities that are impossible. In fact, the whole mission is so full of bad science that it makes Spielberg look like Einstein. The only part that's believable is when Ben Affleck singlehandedly blows up the Russian space station. I believe he could really do that.<br/><br/>There is far too much attempted humour; this is supposed to be the ultimate disaster movie, after all. Why did they think it needed to be funny as well? And then there is the usual Amero-centric viewpoint. Half of Asia gets blasted away. Wow, that was lucky, it could have been us.<br/><br/>Did I mention clichés and stereotypes?

","This movie never ceases to entertain me, even on the 50th viewing (maybe a little exaggerated) last night I was still crying my eyes out at the ending. After reading many reviews and comments I have the impression that people were expecting some sort of deep and insightful look into humanity and society... but I think that it's easy to see that this movie never promised anything of the sort, and was not trying to achieve that. It is an action blockbuster of the end- of-the-world sort. Clearly this movie is out to entertain at all costs- which it does in spectacular fashion. The cast is awesome- some find Bruce Willis overbearing but he always delivers in these situations; Ben Affleck hasn't looked this hot since before or after this movie. The script and screenplay is dramatic and in appropriate this-could-be-the-end style, and i seem to be the only one that found it very funny (in the appropriate parts!). The special effects are, of course, great- and I love the fact that the asteroid is almost turned into a character itself. Quite frankly I think you just need to let yourself go with this movie: don't ask questions, don't think about it, just let your emotions go. It does actually have a ( yes slightly corny) message about humanity's ability to band together in the face of adversity, which i think is always a nice reminder. If you have a little faith, just watch it."

Grace is the kid who, quote, ""learnt about the birds and the bees from Freddy Noonans tattoos"". Graces fiancé, AJ Frost is played by Ben Affleck, good looking and talented. Steve Buscemi and Owen Wilson bring most of the comedy into it as Rockhound (Buschemi) and Oscar Choi (Wilson).

"mr_popcorn","6","1","3","23 October 2006"," Michael Bay's Armageddon
","Plot: A huge Comet is headed for earth. As it does not consist of one big piece, but of a cloud of rather small pieces plus a main rock the size of Texas, little impacts are recorded long before the big one is scheduled for collision with earth. Harry S. Stamper and his drill team are selected to land on the main comet as they are the only ones who can work the special drill Harry developed. Their mission is to drill 800 ft. into the comet to place a nuclear explosive device. The explosion of the bomb will break the comet in two, and the two pieces will pass earth on both sides. This task has to be accomplished before a certain ""dead"" line, or the comet parts will not fly by, but hit earth.<br/><br/>The movie, has its few pros and cons. The pros are that the visuals were stunning. Seriously, I have never seen New York like that before. Raining meteorites the size of a basketball, a 150mph flaming basketballs for that matter hits New York and destroys almost half of the city. Flaming cars go flying everywhere and the Empire State Building crumbles to the ground. hmmm. The destruction of Paris was a sight to behold. A very huge asteroid about the size of Vatican (this isn't the main asteroid, its still in space, this is like the one that got off earlier) hits right in the middle of Paris and *poof* one flick of the finger and Paris was blown to bits. You can see the famous Eiffel Tower collapse and be reduced to rubble. Some Asian country unfortunately got hit also by the meteorite shower. It hits all the places it can possibly hit. But, that's not it. Wait until you see their perilous journey through space. The effects were outstanding. I have to say, though I am not a scientist, the planets, asteroids, comets, meteors and all that Heavenly stuff were accurately visualized. Another pro is that they blended all the genres successfully. One scene gives you a taste of intense action, another gives you a tearful of drama and on the other hand you'll laugh at the witty comments and one-liners. It was blended well. The actors were very good too. Bruce Willis gives an excellent portrayal as the leader of the ragtag crew Harry Stamper. Billy Bob Thornton was great too. Though he is not in the frontlines, I can feel his character's feelings through his emotions. Other casts include Steve Buscemi as 'Rockhound', the genius of the team. Michael Clarke Duncan as 'Bear', the big, husking brute that's a force to reckon with. Owen Wilson's character (Oscar Choi, the Geologist) though died earlier than I expected gives off some witty one-liners that I can't forget. Ben Affleck, gives a good acting. Some parts of him in the movie were great, some were not. I dunno. I can't feel him in some of the scenes. But, that was SOME parts only. All in all great choice for a cast list.<br/><br/>Sound score were top-notch. It gives you the mood that you are in space with them. The only con I noticed is a major plot loophole: Isn't it easier for NASA to train professional astronauts to drill than train expert core drillers to be astronauts? My 2 cents.<br/><br/>Anyhoo, 7/10. Overall, job well done."

","Firstly, this is not as bad as some people are saying. I'll admit: it's almost 99% scientific flaws, the final part was so cheesy that I was just laughing, and the directing is confusing, with loads of random explosions and people yelling. But, if you're willing to suspend your disbelief and try not to become too engrossed with the glaringly obvious scientific flaws, this can be quite enjoyable.<br/><br/>But this is nowhere near as good as some say. This does NOT deserve anything above a 6 or 7 out of 10. I just can't believe some people think this is the best movie ever. Okay, there are countless other movies that are far worse, but there are countless others that are far better. I just burst out laughing when the supposedly intelligent director of NASA decides to send a bunch of incompetent oil drillers into space. If the movie was a parody than this would be understandable, but this was advertised as a serious end-of-the-world drama. Explosions are inserted at every opportunity, and the plot holes are overwhelming in number, as are cloying Americanisms. The scientific flaws are just so glaringly obvious that you can't help but notice them. I know films like this are not renowned for scientific accuracy, but this is a film that demands scientific accuracy. It's just a Hollywood blockbuster, some cry. Yeah, but you can't help but laugh when suddenly a rock storm occurs for NO REASON other than to kill off a few cast members, and in the most predictable manner meteorites don't just land anywhere, they land in New York. And when they hit New York, they don't just hit any place in New York, they hit the Chrysler Building, Grand Central Terminal, the WTC... But despite all these innumerable flaws, despite the laughable sequences, despite the cheesy melodramatic typical Hollywood ending, there is still an enjoyable film to be found. If you can ignore the scientific errors, plot holes, and other mountains of flaws, then this can be quite a fun ride."

","An exercise in excess. Everything is overblown and overdone. The music is too much, the acting is too much, the editing is too much.

Layer overblown music on top of that and have everyone yelling at everyone else, everyone acting full blast. Add in a some overblown emotional scenes that are there as some attempt to fill in the story. Billy Bob is about the only guy who somehow remains slightly above the hackneyed level of the script. And of course you don't have sound in a vacuum, but I suppose someone thought incessant sound added to the (nonexistent) excitement."

The love scenes are paltry, as is really, the whole movie. But still the love scenes stand out as especially vapid. Willis is alright, but he still cannot pull off that sentimental scene with Liv where they cry.

","Armageddon is an excellent movie and I watch it over and over again. I'm not a critic of movies, I know what I like and what I don't. I love this movie and I think the casting studio did a wonderful job on selecting the cast. A lot of the movie is serious)after-all an asteroid the size of Texas is headed for earth) but the funny lines that are placed all through the movie. Even though there's tension between Capt. Willie Sharpe and Harry Stamper the teamwork they demonstrate on the asteroid is good. It shows how important teamwork is even if you don't always get along with the people you work with. I also read the ""goofs"" in the movie, there's one line in there that I don't see in the ""goofs"" and that's where Harry is talking to Truman and Quincy about his drill (that NASA had stolen)Harry says ""that's because you have the cams all wrong Mr. Withers"", but who cares, I don't I just happen to catch it.

","I hated this movie. I hated the absurd plot. I am confident in saying that not one complete minute of this film is plausible, or even remotely believable. Some sci-fi films are far-fetched (i.e. ""The Matrix"" or ""Blade Runner"") that still retain at the very least internal logic. I hated the crappy sentimentality. Not for a second did I buy any of the emotional content of this film. I hated the ridiculously unnecessary camera-work. The camera is never static, and there is no legitimate reason for it to be so. I hated the fact that the film contained good actors (Thornton, Willis, and possibly Aflac) that were playing silly roles. To say that they were cardboard cutouts is to insult cardboard cutouts. The Care Bears have more emotional depth than these characters. In other words, I hated this movie."

","Armageddon. There are several problems with this film. One of the areas that it lacks in is believability. (I cannot believe for a moment that NASA would hire oil drillers to destroy a comet heading for Earth.) This movie is too Hollywood for my liking. It is the typical thriller story about ultimate disaster and the average American having a chance at becoming a hero and finding romance or becoming a hero through self-sacrifice. This film was released in the same year as Deep Impact, but unlike Deep Impact (which focused more on characters), Armageddon was more scientific. I would not recommend this film unless you are a big fan of the typical Hollywood 'thriller' genre. Even then, to avoid disappointment, don't expect a great film."

So you think that Con Air is realistic as opposed to Armaggedon? what planet do you live on Pal? Bruce Willis is classic in this movie as Harry Stamper and the ending was such a tear jerker.

They have to destroy that rock. 2 space ships went outerspace. But, unfortunately 1 gets destroyed but some people in it survives.

","Well, I really don't know exactly how plausible this all is, but it's hard to deny this is a fun movie to watch.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is very good as a supposedly world-renowned drilling expert, asked to save the world by flying up into space, landing on a hurtling asteroid, and drilling down into it so a nuclear bomb can be implanted, hopefully causing the asteroid to disintegrate and float harmlessly past earth.<br/><br/>It feels funny writing that last paragraph, but it actually works in the movie. Obviously, this is the type of movie to put your brain in neutral, and just enjoy it for what it is.<br/><br/>Willis manages a crew of misfits that can best be described as ""motley"". Billy Bob Thornton does very well as the sober, earnest NASA mission controller. The action is excellent, and the tension is palpable as this motley crew races against the clock, and fights off deadly elements to save the world.<br/><br/>This is very well done, and you end up rooting for this bunch, and get a huge lump in your throat at the end.

There's a sub-plot involving Ben Affleck being in love with Harry's daughter, but it's groan-inducing (the 'animal crackers' scene being one of the most horrid ones involving Mr. Affleck ever). But face it the star of the film is the asteroid itself, as it's a blockbuster. Shut your brain off, munch the popcorn and ooh and ahh at the special effects if you must.

"tdglory49","8","1","3","28 June 2005"," One of the best movies I have ever seen.
","I've watched this movie a number of times, and it remains one of my all-time favorites. I know that a number of people, namely critics, hate this movie, for reasons that continue to elude me. In my mind, this is a fun, big-budget movie with great acting.<br/><br/>The premise is that NASA and its director, Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) has discovered that a meteor the size of Texas is going to hit the Earth in eighteen days and cause a complete extinction of nearly all life on the planet. After putting all their heads together, their best idea is...to drill into the asteroid's core and blow it up from the inside?! So they call in the best of the best, Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and his team of oil drillers.<br/><br/>As for the acting, while I'm not a huge fan of Thornton (""Monster's Ball"" ""Friday Night Lights""), he did a more than serviceable job as Truman. As always, Willis (""Sin City"" ""Pulp Fiction"" the ""Die Hard"" movies) is inherently likable and can deliver any one-liner, no matter how corny it is, and make it seem bad-a$$. Liv Tyler (""Lord of the Rings"" ""Inventing The Abbotts) plays Harry's daughter Grace who has grown up on oil rigs with her over-protective dad. While I'm not a fan of Tyler, either, she did very well in this movie. Ben Affleck (""Good Will Hunting"" ""Changing Lanes"") plays A.J., the young driller who is constantly at odds with Harry but also happens to be engaged to Grace. While everyone and their mother currently seems to be in a ""Ben Affleck is the worst actor ever and deserves to rot in hell"" mode, this movie is yet another movie to refute this claim. Affleck is confident, but not cocky, and like Willis, is both inherently likable and has some pretty good one-liners. In fact, of the four stars in this movie, Affleck is probably the best.<br/><br/>Harry's crew also includes his longtime friend Chick (Will Patton, ""Remember The Titans"" ""Gone In Sixty Seconds""), the big Bear (Michael Clarke Duncan, ""The Green Mile"" ""Sin City""), the horny Rockhound (Steve Buscemi, ""Con Air"" ""Fargo""), the cowboy-like Oscar (Owen Wilson, ""Starsky and Hutch"" ""Zoolander""), Noonan (Clark Heathcliffe Brolly), and Max (Ken Campbell). Keith David (""Pitch Black"" ""Crash"") plays General Kimsey, who opposes every move NASA makes, and Jason Issacs (the ""Harry Potter"" movies, ""The Patriot"") plays NASA's super intelligent scientist. William Fichtner (""Crash"" ""The Perfect Storm""), one of my personal favorite actors, plays Colonel Sharp, one of the astronauts who must help guide the team on the asteroid. If you haven't been able to tell by now, the supporting cast is an all-star one and does a brilliant job.<br/><br/>The effects in the movie are very good, and it is obvious this was a high-budget film. Yes, there are some anomalies and other oddities, but for crying out loud, it's a movie! It's allowed to change things (to a degree) to help them be more entertaining. There are mistakes like this in all movies simply to make it more coherent, dramatic, etc. As long as this doesn't bother you, you should be pleased with what this movie has to offer.<br/><br/>My biggest complaints are that in some scenes, especially those containing spaceships, it seem to have gotten edited too fast, leaving a bit of confusion as to what exactly's happening until the dust settles, and that the dialogue can be corny on some rare occasions (""This is one order you shouldn't follow and you f**king know it."")which is surprising considering J.J. Abrams of ""Alias"" and ""Lost"" fame is listed as a screenwriter. Neither of these flaws are that detrimental.<br/><br/>So in my opinion give this movie a shot. You may be pleasantly surprised."
"north-julie","10","1","3","10 June 2005"," my favourite film of all time- enjoyable from start to finish
","I was twelve when this appeared in cinemas. Me and my cousin had the choice of seeing this, Lost in Space or Godzilla. I wanted to see Lost in Space, and my cousin wanted to see Godzilla. In the end we came to a compromise; we'll see Armageddon. It looked decent enough, and its advert was on the t.v in every ad break so we though Why Not? Suffice to say, I'm glad we went to see this.<br/><br/>Starting with a spectacular scene of destruction involving a space shuttle, moving onto a spectacular scene of destruction in New York, and then bringing us into touch with the plot, this film never once lets up with its pace. Its so fast and energetic, and you never have time to ponder any inaccuracies or errors. If we want to be highly entertained, this will suit you to a tee.<br/><br/>Performance wise, this film hits every note on the head. Bruce Willis has always been a great actor to me, and in Armageddon he excels as cynical, hard edged and deeply patriotic father Harry Stamper. His daughter Grace is played by Liv Tyler, a beautiful girl who has been very understated in her role. Credit where credits due, she carries the slower more thoughtful earthside scenes well, linking to great effect with the impressive Bill Bob Thornton. Some people have said that Armageddon didn't give enough focus to what was happening on Earth while the asteroid was being dealt with, but Tyler and Thornton cover their end well.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck. He's always had that slightly annoying presence, and recent flops haven't helped him either. But here, back in 1998 when he was given fourth billing in a Michael Bay movie, as opposed to when he was first billed in Michael Bays Pearl Harbour, he is actually quite likable. Not having to carry a movie is better for him, as lets face it he won't ever win a best actor Oscar. Here though, he is quite endearing as AJ, the young oil driller who is led by his feelings, and not his brain. Indeed, it is hilarious when Willis says 'you all right kid?', and Affleck answers with 'yeah of course, considering I've never been this scared before in my life, ever.' he has that boyish appeal, and here is when he really did look like he had a good career ahead of him. Nowadays of course, its different.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are great as well. Steve Buscemi is gifted as a comedian, albeit a slightly weird one, and he has a lot of fun in his role. Although admittedly you do want to slap him when he starts going crazy and firing the machine gun (which after repeated viewings of the film i still haven't worked out where it came from).Keith David is always good value, and he gets the biggest laugh in the film when the astronauts start singing, and he turns to Thornton and says 'so trueman, this is who you found to save the planet.' the subplot involving him and the 'secondary protocol' is unnecessary, but it does have a certain 'this could happen' feel to it. Its easy to see President Bush making the mistake the President in Armageddon made, and trusting his advisor's over NASA, causing the death of the planet. Will Patton is good as Willis' best mate, and Michael Clarke Duncan, Peter Stormare, and William Fichtner are all humorous and lovable characters. The acting by some is slightly weaker than you'd expect, but this is a big dumb summer blockbuster and Oscar winning acting is never going to be likely.<br/><br/>The effects, backed up by the huge budget, are astounding, and standout sequences are the opening destruction raining down on New York and the shuttles take off. The meteors are well realised, and the asteroid looks incredibly menacing in evil, surrounded by green/blue gases and chunks of wicked looking rock.<br/><br/>A brilliant soundtrack, coupled to Trevor Rabins haunting and melancholic score gives the movie energy and emotion when required. Indeed, in the beautifully written sequence where Willis says goodbye to daughter grace is superbly done, with the great acting coupled with Trevor Rabin working his magic to draw every extra ounce of love and sadness from the scene.<br/><br/>You can easily say the film has problems, not least in Michael Bays inability to keep his camera from moving in six directions at once, and the need to keep every shot down to less than a second in length. But this is a summer film, so sharp editing is required to keep the action sequences going at a lightning fast pace.<br/><br/>Overall, this is great film. And if you don't shed a tear when Willis blows himself up with the asteroid, or when Patton is reunited with his son, you aren't alive.<br/><br/>Essential viewing!"

","Dear friends, and fellow patrons of the arts. I beg of you, heed my warning when I say if you had a choice of viewing this film, or cleaning your toe jam, I'd consider a two hour career in the cleaning of toe jam. This movie was an insult to movies period. It has been a few years since I have seen this film, which by the way, was by pure peer pressure, and I still have a fresh disdain toward every aspect of this movie. Let's start with the cast, which looked promising as they all have had very good performances in other projects (yes,even Afleck in Mall Rats and Chasing Amy was more entertaining). For this movie, they all did it for one reason; the money. There can be no other reason. The plot was infantile. The dialogue was shallow and unimaginative and the chemistry between them all was pathetic. I blame this open wound entirely on Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer, which are with out a doubt the worst collaboration in movie making history. The two of them could be better as a super villain duo plaguing the world with their vommitous films. Last and certainly not least, this movie also got my nod for the cheesiest scene in cinematic history. These super villains wanted us, the audience, so desperately to believe that they were sincere when they had the little boy running to his parents with a small American flag in front of a mural of President Kennedy. My friends, I know I may have blasted a movie that some of you hold dear to your hearts. If that be the case then perhaps a career in toe jam cleaning is in your best interest instead of praising bad movies. For those who appreciate quality film, please don't waste a thought on seeing this. I rate this film 0/10."
"dee.reid","10","1","3","19 June 2004"," ""Armageddon"" rocks!
","Love him or loathe him, you have to give director Michael Bay the thumbs up for the enormous craft and ingenuity that goes into his films. It may be that his films are overblown yet are entertaining, have horrendous yet amusing dialogue, and have wooden yet colorful characters. But you seriously have to ask yourself, what great action movie does not have those qualities? OK, OK, some may not, but we're not talking about other action pictures, we're talking about the films of Michael Bay. Those who say that his films are crap seriously bother me because I have found it extremely difficult to believe that they were not at all entertained when they have paid good money to see his latest action flick.<br/><br/>He obviously likes to blow stuff up (see ""Armageddon"" or ""Pearl Harbor"" to see what I mean), but you have to give him the praise that he richly deserves  for that he has an eye for detail, in fact such an eye for detail, that he may just be the best modern action filmmaker alive today. He lavishes in detail and great camera shots of one single frame around a character or object. To make this story short, his films make for captivating, if not necessary viewing for any true action fan. His films are never boring; he keeps dialogue to a minimum and he just keep you entertained for the running time.<br/><br/>Bay was an accomplished music video director before scoring his first hit in 1995 with Martin Lawrence and Will Smith in the buddy-cop action film ""Bad Boys,"" and would later re-team with them both for ""Bad Boys 2"" last year. However it wouldn't be until the following year that people really knew who Michael Bay was when he directed the Alcatraz thriller ""The Rock"" with Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris as the leads.<br/><br/>Now we're at ""Armageddon,"" which was released amidst hostile reviews and received quite a tongue lashing from critics in the summer of 1998. Its story about an asteroid (dubbed a ""global killer"" by NASA) and the team of civilian oil drillers who are recruited to land on it and drop a nuke down a hole in its surface took a backseat to some really inventive special effects.<br/><br/>Even if you don't buy the story or its characters, you could at least lavish in the special effects and the production. The antagonist of the film, a jagged, almost hellish goliath of a rock that's hurling towards planet Earth at millions of miles per hour, takes a terrifying life of its own once we see its surface. This is where our director Michael Bay comes in. <br/><br/>He wants to show us his vision of Hell, which is his vision of this asteroid that's intent on wiping out everything on the planet; this also gives the ""Armageddon"" tagline a little deeper meaning: ""It's closer than you think."" ""Nothing would survive, not even bacteria,"" so says Billy Bob Thornton after briefing Bruce Willis and company at NASA in one of the films early scenes.<br/><br/>As Jeanine Basinger, a professor of film studies at Wesleyan University, comments in her review of the film on the Criterion Collection DVD (Bay is a former student of hers), ""Yes, it [Armageddon] gives audiences a lot to absorb. Yes, it cuts quickly from place to place, person to person, event to event. But it is never boring, and never less than a brilliant mixture of what movies are supposed to do: tell a good story, depict characters through active events, invoke an emotional response, and entertain simply and directly, without pretense.""<br/><br/>If you are a die-hard action fan (I'm not, though my movie collection would probably suggest otherwise), don't pass up Michael Bay, because in the end, he's just giving the audience what it wants.<br/><br/>10/10"

If I want to think hard and be challenged, I will read a book thank you very much, movies to me are an escape and should be an enjoyable experience.  This movie was that for me.

","When I first saw this movie in the theaters back in 1998, I left the theater not remembering a single moment from the film. Watching it again on television, I began to remember the film more vividly in all of its disgusting and audience-insulting decadence. By watching it again, I discovered five reasons to advice everyone to stay as far away from this film as possible.<br/><br/>Reason number one: The movie is schizophrenic<br/><br/>The story is about a crew of drillers sent to destroy an asteroid heading for earth. Pretty simple, huh? But this mess of a film is so sloppily put together by Michael ""Ed-Wood-Reincarnate"" Bay, that it comes across as unbalanced. Many will argue that this is supposed to be a summer film, so we'll compare it to other summer films. Is it supposed to be a free-for-all action film in the sense of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark?"" Then why does it get so melodramatic with the characters instead of allowing their individual quirkiness to run rampant? Or is it supposed to be a more serious adventure in the way that ""Apollo 13"" was? If so, then why doesn't the script display one ioda of technical knowledge of space? Listen to the NASA commentary on the Criterion DVD and you'll hear for yourselves. So as a summer film, it fails to find it's feet.<br/><br/>Reason number two: Who the hell are these people?<br/><br/>Every great story has a character that we either like and want to see succeed or despise and want to see fail or crawl out from their rut. In ""Armageddon,"" all the characters are permanently stuck in a rut. Let's go through the cast: Bruce Willis, a stereotypical father who doesn't want the daughter to get involved with his best driller. Ben Affleck is the pretty boy who stares at pretty girl Liv Tyler with googly eyes throughout the film. ""Armageddon"" fails to give either Affleck and Tyler any sparks or any reason for Willis to resent Affleck (first he likes him, then he hates him, then he needs him, then he resents him, then he mourns him, then he takes pity on him - come to think about it, Affleck has a more believable love story going on with Willis than he does with Tyler). The rest of the cast seem to rely on stereotypes as well, wasting such talent as Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, et al as background, never really adding anything more than scenery to an already bland film.<br/><br/>Reason number three: Ed Wood is alive, well, and directing Pearl Harbor<br/><br/>Let's try to rationally put these scenes together. Helicopters arrive at an oil rig during a sunset (sunrise, whatever), then two seconds later, it's day. Say it was a long trip, huh? How about the fact that every time a helicopter flies by in this film, the earth and sky are instantly painted orange, regardless of what the previous scene was? A little too convenient, no? Though some may argue that this is a trademark of Michael Bay, one should think that trademarks shouldn't have to rely on time and space in order to work properly. Sunsets are scenery. As for the set up of the shots; they are over-dramatic (soap operas have more subtle direction than Bay), poorly organized, and framed terrible. He always seems to be pointing the camera up at someone. Extra #4 does not always need a hero shot. A good director knows that a camera is merely a tool for a director to focus the audience's attention on something in a scene (a good example is to look at Robert Altman's direction of ""Gosford Park"" and notice how at least two things are taking place in one scene). As for the camera constantly moving the way that Bay likes it, this is not directing, this is overcompensating.<br/><br/>Reason number four: ""Can you reach into the glove compartment and pull out my brain medicine?"" - Homer Simpson<br/><br/>Movies like ""Armageddon"" show little to no respect to an audience. They seem to say that if we shove a bunch of action scenes together, have a pop song on the radio, and worry little about the story, then the audience will see it. ""Armageddon"" is such a film that seems to have been constructed not by writers, but by a focus group and sales meetings that show the statistics of moneymakers. Yes, the Hollywood industry is just that, an industry, but it is also an art form and an entertainment forum. Bay has argued before that he likes to make films for audiences. If this is true, then he should stop trying to pound the audience into liking him with his overly boisterous films and focus more on telling the stories that he wants to tell like a competent director should. Remember, the great stories are the ones that can relate a deep story to a vast audience.<br/><br/>Reason number five: The success of this film is the first step to the oblivion of good risk-taking films.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, Hollywood is a business that wants to make money, which it should not be condemned for. Everyone wants to make money. Remember the immortal words of the good Affleck film ""Boiler Room"" when he said, ""whoever said money is the root of all evil doesn't have it."" But it's when these cookie-cutter movies become successful that we begin to see more dumbed-down films like them. If over-hyped and over-produced movies like this succeed, then it will open the door for other ""Die Hard on a subway"" and ""It's like Armageddon meets Tomb Raider"" pitched films. As an audience, we should demand more. We should demand more films that appeal to our intellect as well as our instincts. Movies have become depersonalized and we should encourage the filmmakers of today and tomorrow to tell stories that they enjoy. I will leave you with the final words spoken by Jay Sherman in ""The Critic"" when he said, ""If the movie stinks, just don't go."""

No scene lasts more than 4 seconds. It's BOOM BOOM BOOM for 2+ hours. No long camera shots, just quick edits. Why?

And like Dolly, his accent comes and goes. I guess Bruce's big ego let him get away with it. Liv Tyler's accent is awful. Everyone else (Ben Affleck, Billy Bob, Steve Buscemi) are given the usual forced dialog that comes in most PG or PG-13 movies, done in monotone. Yuck.<br/><br/>Just like a Britney video, everything is overdone and maximum money is placed on everything, making it so cheesy.

This, added with the fact that we see some great actors (Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi, Ben Affleck) selling themselves out for a good paycheck, and this is also the saddest film of the year.

","What does it mean to say that an asteroid is ""the size of Texas""?  Is the asteroid Texas-shaped?  Is its diameter that of Texas north-south, or east-west?  Or is it that the asteroid has the same volume as a sphere with a diameter the same as that of a circle with the same surface area as Texas? That seems to me to be the most charitable reading.<br/><br/>This is the kind of inane discussion the characters in ""Armageddon"" might as well be having, for all the concern they show over the imminent end of all life.  They discuss the matter as if they're talking about the annual tax return deadline.  To be honest, I think taxation worries them more than death - which is exactly the mean-spirited attitude you'd expect from a loud, over-edited, the-stupid-shall-inherit-the-Earth Bruckheimer parable. If this were a book, it would be a paperback, it would be sold in newsagents, its title would be in silver letters, and each paragraph would be one sentence long.  Possibly two.<br/><br/>One worthwhile thing, though: we get to see what a good actor Bruce Willis is.  Objectively speaking his character is insufferable.  He gets his jollies by whacking golf balls onto the heads of Greenpeace protesters.  His over-the-top protective attitude towards his daughter, while I'm sure it's meant to be cute, is only just this side of perverted.  In short, he's a jerk.  If we nonetheless like him - or at worst, fail to dislike him - this is entirely due to Bruce Willis.  He can make any character charming.  Part of the secret is knowing how much charm too use; too much charm is as bad as too little, and Willis knows never to turn the `charm' knob higher than necessary.  In `Armaggedon', it's set at maximum."

","`Armageddon'.  **.  (1998, USA, 144, PG-13. Directed by Michael Bay starring Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck). After about 45 minutes of `Armageddon' I was really enjoying this movie.  The earth was about to be smashed to smithereens by a meteor the size of Texas.  To illustrate that this collision is going to be really bad, the director and special effects crew started the movie with a fantastic meteor shower that almost takes out New York City.  Following the shower, NASA rolls out its secret nuclear stockpile.  A stockpile that's been designed to blow up earth killing rocks from outer space.  The only problem is the President's Chief Science Advisor got a C- in Astrophysics.  Dropping a nuke on the meteor won't help.  First you have to drill an 800-foot hole in the meteor, drop the bomb in the hole and then blow up the meteor from the inside out.  NASA forgot to train the astronauts in the art of drilling.<br/><br/>Not to worry, Harry S. Stamper (Willis) is the best driller in the world. He and his crew of misfits can be trained as astronauts in 12 days, fly up to the asteroid, drill the hole, set off the bomb and save the earth.  So far so good, I'm not kidding I liked `Armageddon' up to this point.  I knew some of the guys had to die on this mission.  One of the crew is black (Michael Duncan).  Will Hollywood once again kill the brother or have they been listening to Roger Ebert?  (Ebert exposed this dirty little Hollywood trick of always killing the black guy in several of his reviews.)  Anyway, the training is complete, the personal situations are set up for a three-hanky ending and Freedom and Independence are ready to blast into space.  Unfortunately, the story breaks down into one explosion after another (gas leak during refueling, BOOM; meteor shower on landing; CRASH; broken drill rig, gas leak, meteor quakes, etc., etc., etc.).  The ending is all too predictable.  But in the end, oops I don't want to spoil it for you. But do yourself a favor and find a friend that's seen the movie and ask them to tell you how it ends.  Save your money and time for something better."

"Altaira","1","1","3","6 July 1999"," Utterly Mindblowingly Awful
","Counting the two Problem Child disasters, this is the third worst movie I've ever suffered through.  At times I wondered if ""Armadgeddon"" was a really a movie at all: at its heart it's simply a bunch of predictable explosions strung together by a plot thin enough to break through with a feather.  It's Hollywood at its pathetic worst. Let me back up my stern dislike for this wreck.  First, so many laws of basic science dealing with gravity, heat, and other apparently non-important ideas are broken, I will not attempt to list all the anomalies.  Second, things are constantly being blown up.  Now, that's to be expected in the typical Action/Summer Blockbuster, but it happens so many times in Armageddon we are tired by the first quarter of the film.  Things explode for the sake of exploding.  I'm curious how many of these disasters happen in the movie, but I don't have the patience to sit throught it again and count. Another fatal flaw: Everything must go wrong.  Sure, a plot requires conflict, but so many things get...well, messed up, it's actually funny. Seriously, I sat through this ""thrillride"" and predicted the next scene. I was right, oh, 19 times out of 20.  My one mistake was when I didn't bother to guess.  It is sadly, sadly predictable. Then of course, we have that obligatory dramatic scene near the end when Our Hero (I will not reveal his identity if someone out there, heaven forbid, actually wants to see this monstrocity) takes a few moments to tell the world goodbye.  Hello--he's supposed to be saving them!!!  At this point, every second counts as that giant rock of mass destruction hurtles toward Earth! So there is the demise of Armageddon.  There's much more that really damns the whole movie, but I can't go into more detail or this review will span several pages.  My advice:  Don't waste your time!!! If you want a big end-of-the-world-is-swiftly-approaching-film, rent Deep Impact.  That isn't a good movie but slightly better than Armageddon.  May this movie be shoved into the darkest bowels of Hollywood demise."

","Armageddon was the one movie that I saw this summer that actually tempted me to get up and leave.  And I'm poor, so wasting money is not something I like to do.  The only reason why I sat in that uncomfortable chair in that crowded movie theater with my friend was the fact that I was having so much fun riddling it with sarcasm and bitterness.  Michael Bay needs to find a genre(for lack of a better word) and stick with it. The special effects were good...but I didn't care because, silly me, I went into the theater expecting a decent flick. Now I know big budget explosion movies make a crap-load of money and I do enjoy leaving my brain at the door soaking up the special effects from time to time, but this just made me want to wretch.  As for the performances... Bruce Willis was Bruce Willis, Good ol' Bill Thornton was the only character I actually believed in, and the rest were pathetic stereotypes that I've seen in so many movies before.

"jaylewis-2","1","1","3","5 January 1999"," Don't insult our intelligence, Hollywood!
","I'll be the first to admit two things, firstly that I am very critical of movies and second that I am a cynical person. I owe the first attribute to the fact that I've seen a lot of movies. And one reason that I'm cynical is movies like Armageddon. I hated this movie more than even ""Howard the Duck,"" ""Surf Ninjas,"" or ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It."" Why hate this movie? First of all, in a summer that featured masterpieces like ""The Truman Show"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" plus good movies like ""There's Something About Mary,"" ""54,"" and ""Deep Impact,"" this piece of trash was the top-grossing movie. (By the way, ""Deep Impact"" was a surprisingly good movie.) Second of all, it's rehash. I'm getting extremely tired of these disaster movies. This is the third ""...there's an asteroid/comet heading towards earth!"" movie released in the last two years. Aside from movies like ""Asteroid"" and ""Deep Impact,"" there have been similar theme movies as well. There was ""Volcano,"" ""Dante's Peak,"" and yes, I would even count ""Titanic"" as the same genre. Third, we come to the movie itself. For lack of a better word, ""garbage"" is the best description I can think of. It has a sappy Hollywood romance to appease the female viewers while at the same time, it has an equally stupid and unbelievable action part to keep the male viewers from being too bored. In this aspect, it is much like ""Titanic,"" although at least ""Titanic"" made some semblance of an attempt at a realistic presentation of the action sequences. ""Armageddon"" was boring, unrealistic, and unoriginal while at the same time showing some of the most pathetic acting skills I've ever seen making it the absolute lowest of the low in my book. Hollywood knows just which buttons to push to create a movie that supposedly everyone will like while keeping the brain work to a minimum. It is a sad but true fact. On a scale of 1-10, this movie gets a 1, and it was lucky to earn that."

","Βay and Bruckheimer have created this film based on what they think the public wants to see, not based on a story or message that they want to convey. In far too many respects, I get the feeling that plot elements, dialogue, or settings are inserted because of their mass appeal, and how they will look in 30-second TV spots. This is to action films what ""Moonraker"" was to the James Bond series: an utter contrivance, in which characters and logic are sacrificed in order to set up an unlikely but visually spectacular situation. Just as Bond was returned to his roots in subsequent films, we can only hope that those responsible for this film realize that they've pushed the envelope (and their luck) far enough. Now that we've narrowly avoided extinction from an incoming Texas-sized cliché, one hopes that the next film from Bruckheimer features a better plot and more intelligence, not a bigger disaster with a dumber redneck hero.

I laughed where I wasn't suppose to and sometimes I was dead serious where I should have laughed because I just couldn't believe how far they are going in absurdity. It is just typical American-Hollywood cowboy stuff bulls****. Story is so shallow. The sad thing is that it made 200 million.

Despite the slightly unrealistic scenario (the drill that drills in a comet and places a nuke inside) it is a well played movie. I remember one scene really good that made a big impact on me. It's a shot made after the comet was made public. You see a bunch of cars and campers on a street with everybody outside of their car with the air raid siren in the background. The fear on people their faces was so realistic. Every time I hear the air raid siren, I think of that scene (wich is every four weeks on Monday here in The Netherlands). The ending was a bit cliché. I saw it coming from miles away. In all these types of movies the main player dies. And in the way it happened, as a sacrifice, really made it too cliché.

","Armageddon (1998) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>A mammoth asteroid is on a collision course with Earth and it becomes clear by NASA that if it hits it'll be the end of mankind. With just a few weeks to do anything, the plan is to land a spaceship on the asteroid and then drill a nuclear bomb into it, which will hopefully throw its course off. Who ya gonna get for such a job? Well Bruce Willis, of course! <br/><br/>Armageddon is a film I remember watching and somewhat enjoying when it first came out. I mean, you're had someone cool like Willis, young stars like Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler, a great supporting cast with the likes of Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi, William Fichtner, Michael Clarke Duncan and Will Patton. You've also got several Aerosmith songs. You've got a lot of loud action and big-budget special effects. What wasn't to like? The critics of the time ripped the film apart for how stupid it was and how it didn't have any logic to it. At the time I wondered if critics realized they were watching a summer popcorn movie. I revisited the film nearly twenty years later and I must admit that it really hasn't aged well and in all honesty it is pretty awful. The performances are at times quite embarrassing and especially with the really lame dialogue that they have to say. I'd also argue that the logical issues are all over the place and in fact some are so bad that you can't help but laugh.<br/><br/>Is Armageddon awful? I'm not sure I'd call it awful because there are some fun moments scattered throughout but you have to question why the hell Michael Bay has never learned that his films need editing. For this thing to clock in at 150 minutes is just nuts and it really drags at a very slow pace and especially the ending, which just seems to take forever. The film should have been a fast and fun picture but instead everything just gets stretched to the point where you don't care.<br/><br/>The special effects are obviously quite good and it's fun getting to see so many talented actors even if they are just cashing paychecks.

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","7","1","4","31 May 2015"," It has acouple problems but nothing anyone will loathe
","Back around the late 1990s, Hollywood started becoming obsessed with making movies about the end of the world. Some of which bordered on the edge of unrealistic while others wanted to really scare the crap out of its audience with what sounded and looked like plausible science. Whether it be shifting plate tectonics like Volcano (1997) or the devil himself in End of Days (1999), someone thought up of some way the world would end. For director Michael Bay, his idea was more patriotic, although perhaps a little too self-righteous. Although the plot of the movie is not mentioned to be in accordance with the Mayan calendar, the way it comes across is pretty much ""the end of the world""-ish. What's more surprising is that Michael Bay finds this to be his worst movie. I think he should check his list again.<br/><br/>After NASA discovers a gigantic meteor the size of Texas is headed towards Earth, the head of NASA named Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) orders the recruitment of oil driller Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) to head up to space to knock the ""global killer"" out of orbit. Stamper accepts but only after the rest of his drilling crew comes with him. The rest of the drilling crew contains AJ Frost (Ben Affleck) who's also dating his daughter Grace (Liv Tyler), Chick (Will Patton), Rockhound (Steve Buscemi), Bear (Michael Clarke Duncan), Max (Ken Campbell) and Oscar (Owen Wilson). The supporting cast also includes William Fichtner, Jessica Steen, Peter Stormare, Keith David and Jason Isaacs. Thankfully, for a cast this huge Michael Bay had some credible writers for this production. Penning the official screenplay for this film was none other than Jonathan Hensleigh (Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995) and Jumanji (1995)) and a young J.J. Abrams. As a whole, the story is proficient at working with what it has. Most of the characters mentioned prior do have a definitive personality and also portray genuine emotion.<br/><br/>Then again, there are some moments that hint at the typical Michael Bay shtick that always feels unnecessary. Being that the movie is 2 and a half-hours long, there definitely could have been some trimming on the sides. Some scenes either had no relevance or meaning to the story and did not further the plot. All they did was emphasize how silly some characters can be written. Most likely the running time could have been cut down to 2 hours. The only other part that wasn't needed was the love subplot going on between AJ and Grace. It felt forced and clichéd. Making matters worse was Liv Tyler's acting ability. She wasn't horrible but she had a very stiff face and in some cases she became quite obnoxious portraying her character. Delightfully, there are enough supporting characters to make-up for her. The most interesting belonged to William Fichtner's role as a space astronaut caught between his code by NASA or what his gut says. His exchanges with Bruce Willis are quite the attention grabber.<br/><br/>The most entertaining act of the film (and rightfully so) is the final act. It is there that we see Harry Stamper and his crew work as a real team and seeing that happen and how they handle various situations is an intense ride from beginning to end. This also goes pretty much for the cinematography and special effects. All of which blended in nicely as well. The director of photography for this production was John Schwartzman and for what was depicted on screen, it still holds up today. There are large wide panning shots of landscapes but most of it belongs to the meteor, which does look heavy on CGI. Again though, the special effects are something to admire too. For it's time, it could have looked a lot worse but even today it still looks decent.<br/><br/>Musically related, the score was composed by Trevor Rabin. Rabin, who's main forte is in the synthetic aspect of film score, does not deviate from what listeners would normally hear. Much of his music contains the same kind of generic electronic keyboard rhythms and action cues. Surprisingly however, Rabin provides a very memorable and emotional power anthem that acts as the movie's main theme. Although there was no Armageddon 2 (and hopefully never will) the fact that Rabin made such a memorable theme for the movie is commendable. It has a very heroic like tune that makes the jobs being done truly feel a difference is being made. As a recommendation for anyone looking to collect Rabin's score, the best would be to go with the bootleg edition. Most of Rabin's score do not contain more material than 30 or so minutes. But the bootleg for Armageddon (1998) is a little over an hour and a half. It's hard to find film scores with such detail so if you can get a hold of it, I suggest you do.<br/><br/>Like other Michael Bay films, it has a few areas that needed trimming with unnecessary scenes that make the movie longer than it needed to be. Plus, Liv Tyler's acting is noticeably irritating on screen. Other than that, Bruce Willis and the rest of the supporting cast work well, the music is recognizable and the third act to this sci-fi nail biter is quite a ride."

","This movie was so perfect that i can watch it over and over again.i seriously do not understand how this movie got such bad ratings even on IMDb.this movie was nominated for four god damn Oscars and mind you it takes a whole lot of hard work just to even be nominated.i think this film did really well in all aspects-the acting was on the spot although there was not much character development in it but everyone did their job and i think that adding an extra cosmonaut was really good idea of adding a bit humor to the movie when they gt into space-again a great job done their by Micheal Bay. all the acting went out perfectly well even the lead actors were absolutely amazing. but there would be no movie if it was'not for the special effects introduced into this movie,which was absolutely amazing and nothing short of amazing and together with the theme songs to go with it this movie was full of action and drama and also you know that touch of courage and love and so on. i can watch this movie over and over again not even hesitating. unlike most of all you people out there i am going to give this movie a very well deserved 10/10. well done mostly to the cast crew and direction team and most thanks goes out to the special effects team-well done."

","The story line is stupid. I agree. Who on Earth can imagine such a stupid story line in which a bunch of ""drillers"" are contracted by NASA to drill a hole on a meteor and drop a nuke bomb in it. Congratulations, Bay. You just lost 5 points for accepting to direct a film with such a bad story line. 5/10. Wait, because it is sci-fi, I'll give you back .5 point. 5.5/10. Now if you have trouble with sci-fi movie, why bother being at the show at the first place? Now this is when the cast, the OST and the scriptwriter save the day. Each of the actors, actresses of this movie perform an extraordinary effort. If you don't cry when seeing Harry Stamper's last moment, I suggest you get over yourself already. Steve Buscemi, Bruce Willis, Peter Stormare and Owen Wilson add enough funny moments for a sci-fi movie. 8/10. Way to go, Bay. The scripts add another point for Armageddon. What all the characters said is natural, sometimes funny. But natural. 9/10. Finally, you can feel the action as you go along the movie. Some so-called action movie don't have it. Why, because of the music. And the film OST: I don't want to miss a thing appear at the right time, at the right place shines the movie. It is, indeed one of the best OST. 10/10.<br/><br/>People often have a problem. They watch too much garbage before and when it comes to Armageddon, they become null. I mean, come on guys, it's Armageddon, it's the end of the world. Of course, it's some crazy-ass, unrealistic stuffs. What do you expect? It's an excellent movie for what it set out to be."

Its just such a warm hearted family movie and you can imagine yourself caught up in the situation, it sucks you right in and has you believing every word Harry Stamper tells his daughter Grace. The ending is so outrageous but so believable you'd have to be stone hearted not to shed a tear.

The characters engage you, the situation grips you, and the storytelling is so finely done that the flaws fade like early-morning mist over a lake.<br/><br/>This movie has so many flaws that I can't explain how this could happen, but the good points overcome those flaws so well that this movie is in my ""top ten of all time"" for sheer viewing enjoyment. As hackneyed as they are, I cry at the sad parts, and cheer at the high points.<br/><br/>As other reviewers have noted, this is a movie without deep thought or message. Many of the ""important"" aspects of movie making have been ignored, or missed badly. But, when the show starts, the audience is glued to their seats - because, without all of those fine, thought-provoking elements that others miss, this movie still entertains. And that seems to be what they wanted to do - not sell a message, not dazzle with deep thought - but simply entertain. And that, it does in a fashion that is unsurpassed.<br/><br/>Fine casting, great acting, one helluva story to tell - who cares if it's absurd? It's still one helluva story, and told darn well."

The characters are cartoonish, very sketchily drawn. Despite the heavy subject matter, there's more clowning around in this movie than in most comedies. The  attempts at humor in this film were lost on me. I mean, is this  comedy, drama, adventure or suspense?<br/><br/>The script was not convincing in any of these areas. Bruce Willis has done excellent work in 12 Monkeys, The Fifth Element, Pulp Fiction and other films. Here, Armageddon's desultory, louder-is-better approach works against him, Liv Tyler, Billy Bob Thornton, etc. This movie really disappointed me."
"Michael Kenmore","1","1","4","1 August 1998"," Armageddon sucked--practically everything
","(1/1/2017 Update for corrections; written as is.)<br/><br/>Armageddon is the complete waste of talent, time, money, and effort involved in the making of this utterly preposterous and sensational action movie.<br/><br/>It's riddled with clichéd and idiotic plot concepts, lame acting, hokey love story B-plot, endless parodies of countless movies such as 2001, The Right Stuff, and The Abyss. <br/><br/>The opening credit sequence was really crap, it's the same ""Genesis"" sequence in Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan. The excessively edited movie looks like it was trimmed frantically by Edward Scissorhands stoned on cocaine laced with meth and crack. <br/><br/>The obnoxious and loud soundtrack gave me a pounding headache. Some certain scenes in Armageddon looked like it was a commercial shoot. The U.S. flag-waving glory while dissing the third-world regions is very cynical and insulting. I won't even elaborate about the utter lack of scientific accuracies that caused the disbelief and totally insulted my intelligence.<br/><br/>Overall, Armageddon is another stale and repetitive popcorn movie fare churned out from the BS Hollywood machine to make the quick bucks on purpose. IMDb has proved that there are the total of 9 writers who contributed to this P.O.S. movie, which is a total waste of the writing talents who sacrificed themselves for greed. <br/><br/>The question is, will there be more like this? Possibly.<br/><br/>Because the domestic audiences with short-attention span and the low I.Q. demands it. Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer should be shot for dumping this execrable and overtly sensational movie on us without warning. All they really care about is that they got us to shell out our hard-earned money, only to endure the excruciatingly bad movie."

","I'm going to try to put this in simple, small, easy-to-understand words, in case anybody who likes this movie happens to read this. I actually gave it attention. This is just background noise and I actually sat there and gave it my attention. This is a tremendous movie - an emptiness so colossal it humbles. Michael Bay isn't a human being, he's an MTV factory, a plugged-in Tin Man with a TV for a head. He gets paid millions to rob countless audiences of their time. Michael Bay is a low-key real life Supervillian, killing you slowly, one pixel at a time. Roger Ebert, in one his most dead-accurate assessments, called this movie a two-and-a-half hour trailer. Flash, bang, noise. Meaningless. Even for Autistic children this would be challenging - mentally challenging. Our heroes, who work on an oil rig, have to blow up a meteor hurtling towards the earth, cue training montage, challenges to overcome, one of the guys heroically sacrifices himself to save the world and they blow it up at literally the last possible second - this is a Saturday morning cartoon made into a 2 1/2 hour live-action C.G.I. husk. Figures coming from the guy who's literally spun Saturday morning cartoons into public insults. There is not a single redeeming aspect to this.

No feeling for pacing - every important scene goes like 10 seconds, it's impossible to evolve any kind of emotions. Plus it feels like the same 2 songs are playing over EVERYTHING which try to give it a more 'epic' feeling, which kills the vibe more, cause you can't save a bad script by putting music over everything. Sparks and explosions everywhere for no reason. Rock colliding with rock = explosion. Rock colliding with wooden house = explosion. This is so shallow.
Also the plot has so many trashy illogical parts, unfortunately overweighing the good parts.

","It's a truism that there's no accounting for taste, but the fact that this backed-up sewage could get a higher rating than the flawed but several-orders-of-magnitude superior Deep Impact really stretches that point. Of course, there are people who think Two and a Half Men is funnier than the the late lamented 30 Rock, so go figure. <br/><br/>Sad to say, it's films like this that give popcorn blockbusters a bad name: screechy, empty, stupid. I don't mind checking my brain at the door of the local cineplex for a couple of hours, but I do mind when it's clear the screenwriters checked their brains even before they sat down at their Macs. That's probably a prerequisite for anyone who works with ""director"" Michael Bay, whose idea of entertainment is to trap the audience's collective head inside the cinematic equivalent of a pinball machine and then proceed to batter it into a coma. I guess that's someone's idea of good time. Hey, if you're that someone, knock yourself out, or rather have Bay do the job for you. It's part of his contract. <br/><br/>Like most Bay atrocities, this damn thing is excruciating to watch. I found myself gripping the armrests of my seat,not because of the growing suspense unfolding on the screen but because of the sheer cynical crassness of the whole enterprise. There are the mechanically orchestrated ""beats,"" the paint-by-numbers characters, the flat dialogue, the cheesy jokes. Oh, well, at least one of the writers, J.J. Abrams, went on to do really great, imaginative stuff, so put this down to someone just looking for a nice fat paycheck. Which he got.<br/><br/>Yeah, the special effects were OK, and if I were still 5, that would probably be enough. But it's not because I have this problem: I grew up.

Stamper and his drill team are selected to land on the main comet as they are the only ones who can work the special drill Harry developed. <br/><br/>Their mission is to drill 800 ft. into the comet to place a nuclear explosive device.

","There's a whole meteor shower full of flicks about rogue rocks dropping in to blast us all in to cosmic talcum powder. Some good, some poor but this space debris ranks as the lousiest. Circumstances are dire: if a meteor impact doesn't kill you, then the movie will bore you to death. <br/><br/>Scientists detect a meteor on collision course with Earth, and decide to nuke it in to space rubble. They entrust the nukes and the fate of the Earth to guys with the following qualifications: they blow up stuff at an oil rig or something. They're selfish, reckless, childish, and yell a lot with limited vocabulary skills. Just the kind of winners we need to save the planet from imminent destruction. <br/><br/>Rarely has an ensemble cast collectively turned in such abysmal performances. People faced with the prospect of the end of the world, (or saving it) act like they're at a frat party. Willis looks like he's doing a Jackie Chan impression. Affleck appears to be doped up on medication. Billy Bob appears to be suffering amnesia or delusions. As for Buscemi, Wilson, Duncan, and others, they all stink so bad they'd offend a skunk. <br/><br/>To be fair, here's the good: decent special effects. <br/><br/>Back to the awful: the script. The lines are pitiful. We get the self-sacrifice bit near the end, which is as convincing as a used car dealer's claims. Some of things are lame, like the flying bus nonsense, but the movie can't even make you laugh at its stupidity. That's because it's basically irritating. Most of the people are obnoxious, and their churned out human interest stories don't work.

","First of all to a question one commenter wrote, did Owen Wilson die in any other film? yes in the other crap film Anaconda. This is one of those films that Hollywood make for the American audience. They think they are stupid and they will watch any film full of stars and action, explosions and the like. Hollywood don't like their audience to think, and this film in the first twenty minutes proves it. The earth will be demolished in 18 days ( so far so good ), so NASA get Bruce Willis, ( best driller in the world ) to come and help. So, they come and pick up Willis and his daughter, ( played by Liv ) off a drilling platform in the ocean and take them to NASA headquarters. Willis comments on the fact that in 18 hours they have been apologizing to him for the inconvenience. So, lets say it took a couple of days to explain to them the situation, why oh why did the rest of the crew leave the platform?? And how the hell did the role of Ben Affleck, in a couple of days set up his own company and started drilling? If you also notice he has a board with his name printed, and its RUSTY for crying out loud, in a couple of days. Where was he drilling, under acid rain. This is only the start and it was enough for me. I didn't enjoy the film at all. Please Hollywood if you are going to spend all this money on a film, do the decent thing and treat us like adults who understand a little bit."
"Robert_duder","9","1","5","6 May 2007"," Another Bruce Willis classic action...always one of my favorites since the day I saw it for the first time
","It was July 1st, 1998...Canada's Day for those of us who are Canadian. I skipped the fireworks and decided to rush out to see the new Bruce Willis movie entitled Armageddon and that day brought me one of my favorite movies to date even 10 years later. I caught it again recently expectantly while on vacation on TV and was impressed all over again. An ensemble cast that makes the film funny, edge of your seat action, huge special effects, amazing director and production and even a terrific story line amidst a rather predictable plot that had been done before and has been done since in one way or another. Many write how much they hate Armageddon but at well over 300 million dollars grossed and even some Oscar Nominations for effects and sound and such...somebody loved it and I was one of them. I have even read some who called Armageddon campy and I can't agree with that at all. Top notch special effects, and a huge budget ensured that even the wildest plot seemed feasible and real. You were strapped to your seat the minute they left the planet right onto that asteroid and then all the way back to Earth. It was the thrill ride of the decade.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis led the cast of slightly unknowns at the time as world class oil driller Harry S. Stamper who lives his life on his oil rig along with his now grown daughter Grace. Willis plays this character to a ""T"". Some would say it's his 'usual' character but in this case Harry Stamper is the usual Willis. He's macho, and oozing testosterone and the brighter of the group and he's a concerned father and a determined driller. He's a self made man and won't let anyone tell him how to do things. Willis is a powerhouse on screen. He was at his finest. Liv Tyler is Willis' daughter Grace and doesn't get a lot of screen time compared to some of the other cast members but she still does well showing the emotion and playing the romantic lead opposite Ben Affleck. Affleck plays young, head strong and very stubborn A.J. Frost who is in love with Stamper's daughter much to his dismay. Affleck and Willis butt heads on numerous issues but in the end are like father and son. They have great chemistry together and even the romance between Affleck and Tyler which is like a sub-sub-story works well and really adds to the plot. The supporting cast is just about brilliant and really jump started some careers...Billy Bob Thorton plays NASA administrator heading up this mission from the ground Dan Truman. Although the role is a little small he still manages to make the best of it and really give an emotional performance. Will Patton is terrific as estranged father and husband ready to be a hero 'Chick' Chapple, Steve Buscemi is good and important but a little over zealous as the woman hungry and a little deranged 'Rockhound.' Owen Wilson is pretty good as the cowboy Oscar Choi who gets some humorous one liners but I'm still not sure what his purpose in the mission was. Michael Clarke Duncan is terrific as the heavy lifter and operator 'Bear' Kurleenbear, Peter Stormare practically steals the show as stranded and reluctant cosmonaut Lev Andropov. And William Fichtner (who seems to pop up in various character roles) plays the lead NASA Astronaut on board Colonel William Sharp who butts heads with Willis on numerous occasions and holds his own against him.<br/><br/>Michael Bay is no stranger to action films and definitely has his own wild style when it comes to directing and producing. He directed amazing action flicks like Bad Boys, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor and The Island (which I liked!!) and is bringing to life the Transformers this summer. His gritty realism in the face of what otherwise would be the unbelievable makes him a master of this genre. He can make you believe anything and then take you on a wild ride as though you were sitting right there with them. Armageddon is the type of movie where when the ball gets rolling you could stand with your jaw dropped and not move until the credits role because the action is literally non stop and it's almost stressful to watch everything unfold one scene after the next. If somehow you haven't seen Armageddon you're missing out on one of the most fantastic disaster, action epics of the last decade. Please I insist you see this one because you'll enjoy every minute of it and it doesn't disappoint fans anywhere!! 9/10"

","The second (and better) of 1998's dynamic duo of garbage about heavenly objects on a collision course with Earth - although this says more about the lousy quality of the earlier Deep Impact rather than any specific accomplishments of this ordeal. A giant asteroid is on a collision course with Earth and NASA taps oil rig worker Bruce Willis and his motley band to travel to the stars to intercept the asteroid, drill into it and blow it to pieces before impact. Naturally precursor fragments hit Earth first to give us a small taste of the disaster that could be coming. The entire scenario is ludicrous, but the film knows it and seems to revel in it. Dumb can be fun if done well, but Armageddon is not particularly well done, despite having some promising elements. Lead Willis normally has two settings depending on the project - smarmy and lifeless. Since this is a ""crowd-pleasing"" action flick, he trots out smarmy and manages to be thoroughly obnoxious. Look quick for Owen Wilson and Michael Clarke Duncan as some of the lesser members of the team. Billy Bob Thornton acquits himself nicely slumming it up as a sympathetic NASA official. Will Patton also manages to turn in a ""real"" performance as another oil rigger. Ben Affleck manages to be appealing in his first ""big budget"" effort and Liv Tyler is coltishly sexy as Willis' daughter and the token love interest. Keeping in the spirit of the film's overwhelming machismo, she gets to stay behind and look fretful while the ""real"" men do the work. Actually Jessica Steen accompanies as a co-pilot, but since someone forgot to write her a role she is fairly irrelevant. The screenplay is a mess - there is barely any sort of character development and suspense is marginal at best. The tone is jingoistic to the point of nausea - there are so many flags flying that it seems like Fox News Channel at its most pandering. The cinematography is like ball-bearings in a blender with assorted eyeball-burning flashes thrown in for good measure. There are literally no sustained shots for more than 3 seconds and action scenes are often incomprehensible due to so many non-stop quick cuts. A real endurance test visually with nothing there mentally to pick up the slack."

","......I have written this so you don't have to.
Let's put aside a few issues such as training oil riggers to be astronauts rather than astronauts to work drilling machinery; that the explosive device most likely would not have had an effect on an asteroid the size of Texas; or that that the asteroid would not have generated enough gravity for the crew to walk on; or most unforgivable, the person who was specifically asigned to the crew because he knows about this ""U.S. built bomb"" but has forgotten whether he should cut the red or blue wire; all this could have been overlooked if it wasn't for the weak script, dull action scenes and distinct lack originality. If you want to watch a film with a meteor in it then try Maximum Overdrive or if you want a generic world ending disaster movie you won't have to look hard to find a better one. At least you will feel entertained rather than enduring this and you wont run the risk of being comatose by Ben Affleck."

Liv Tyler lives Grace, at the height of her beauty, that even not participating in the action still brings us emotional moments with the interaction between her dad and her boyfriend. Ben Affleck is decent in the role of A.J., incarnating the typical reckless hero guy who is in love with the beautiful girl and that ries to win the trust of his jealous father-in-law, who at heart loves him and is like a father to him too.<br/><br/>Is it cliché? Yeah. But it's a cliché that manages to entertain me for almost 3 hours and still manages to pull tears at the end. The scene of Harry switching places with AJ and giving his final speech to Grace always makes me cry and if that part doesn't bring you any emotional reaction, you not have a soul or a heart... And I can't finish without to say the supporting cast is great too, especially Steve Buscemi, who is perfect on paper comic relief role."

","This isn't entertainment, it's a Michael Bay movie.<br/><br/>In case you don't know who Michael Bay is, he is a director noted for his explosions and even bigger explosions, on the big screen. He doesn't care about the script, acting or how realistic the movie is, except that the movie have massive explosions and destruction of a variety of objects.<br/><br/>This movie, is terrible. It's a joke and deserves to be deleted from the history of mankind. It sucks so bad that it makes Waterworld look like a masterpiece. It is unrealistic, unscientific and filled with fallacy after fallacy and topped off with deus ex machina galore.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is filled with hits from that period only to promote the movie a little more. The movie is loaded with A list stars and A list side kicks. It even has Liv Tyler, daughter of Steven Tyler lead singer of the band Aerosmith who's songs appear in this movie.<br/><br/>While I like Aerosmith songs, Liv Tyler is an example of a person who got special treatment because of her father's fame and influence.

","I recently watched this movie again. It had been many years since I last saw it and the wife had never so thought we would revisit it together. Firstly, just try not to overthink it. Yes, the plot makes no sense really, yep, scientifically it is most definitely incorrect and the acting and scripts are not great. It will never be thought of as Oscar winning material. It is though Saturday night easy watching and quite enjoyable and still worth a watch. It has not really dated too much. The film in my opinion is about 45 mins too long. The first half is the most enjoyable as we see the global killer asteroid heading towards earth and we meet the crew who must stop it. Bruce Willis gives a normal Bruce performance, Steve Buscemi is great fun and has the most laughs. Ben Afflecks 'AJ' the supposed hero is actually really annoying. It all actually just gets a bit tiring and boring when they actually get up in space and meet the comet, a fatal flaw in what is primarily a space movie. It gets a bit too loud and hectic and you kind of long for the end. Anyway, I still did enjoy rewatching it and so if your a bit younger and yet to see it, give it a whirl. It's not that bad."
"TimBoHannon","2","0","3","12 November 2018"," Does Michael Bay Want to Hurt Us?
","I felt an unpleasant, adrenaline-like sensation during much of the runtime of ""Armageddon."" That feeling was not from thrill, delight, joy or entertainment. It was rooted in anxiety. This movie was made to combat alcoholic hangovers. If some genius makes this an in-flight movie, such person should be arrested for violating the Eighth Amendment.<br/><br/>I propose a new law--no more ""Meteors Heading for Earth"" movies. ""Meteor"" focused on the diplomatic aspect and failed to entertain while ""Deep Impact"" highlighted the plight of a few dysfunctional people on Earth. That latter is so painful to watch that I wished the meteor would hit quickly so we could all get on to more enjoyable tasks such as catheterizing ourselves.<br/><br/>After a comet plays bowling ball with the Asteroid Belt, several displaced rocks reach Earth, conveniently hitting only our largest cities. I call them homing space rocks. Yes, it is a *comet*. NASA uses the term meteor, but meteors are smaller than asteroids. Meanwhile, trouble is brewing on Harry S. Stamper's (Bruce Willis) offshore oil platform. When he finds his daughter (Liv Tyler) in bed with A.J. (Ben Affleck), he chases A.J. around the facility with a shotgun. Apparently he is not aware of what happens if his shot penetrates an oil pipe.<br/><br/>NASA director Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton), who should switch last names with Stamper, selects Harry and his crew to drill a hole in the *comet* and insert a nuclear bomb to split it and deflect the two halves away from Earth. Harry and his crew (including Will Patton, Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson and Ken Hudson Campbell) learn to be astronauts in 12 days. While the training scenes last far too long, they are the most interesting part of the movie. The shuttle is piloted by William Sharp (William Fichtner) and Jennifer Watts (Jessica Steen). A Russian cosmonaut (Peter Stormare) joins the party when they refuel.<br/><br/>Boring and annoying describe the movie's first half, but once they enter space, the assault begins. Upon landing, the crew discovers that the *comet* is prone to earthquakes. The smaller the solar body, the more unstable the tectonic plates, I suppose. In any case, a lot of commotion and destruction ensues. Director Michael Bay creates and edits it as aggressively as possible. Different shots are strung together at incredible speeds while lights flash and an extreme amount of sparks fly. The acting mainly consists of people shouting at each other and running around in near-panic while the music raises the hyper-scale to maximum. ""She's gonna blow,"" ""the clock is ticking"" and ""we have no time"" dominate the dialogue. Only Stormare and Thornton stay calm enough to act well throughout; others have their moments, but not many.<br/><br/>What equipment NASA has created! The shuttles, ground vehicles and space suits are apparently made of flexible diamond. They take repeated beatings but remain in fine working condition, except when the script calls for something to blow up. Amazingly, Sharp has trouble disarming his own bomb, which only reminded me of a better scene in the video game ""Max Payne.""<br/><br/>""Armageddon"" may be Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay's answer to ""Independence Day,"" but they forget that ID4's main strength was that it spent more time resting than moving. Bay tried for a stand-up-and-cheer ending, but 150 minutes of loud, hostile movie-making does not give me the urge to cheer for anything. ""Armageddon"" is the definition for ""sound and fury signifying nothing."""

","I just re-watched this movie with my little kids (skipping the PG-13 parts of course). This is by far one of the most awesome and memorable disaster films of the 90's! <br/><br/>And it is still very very enjoyable today. My kids who love rockets and space travel stories thoroughly enjoyed this as well.<br/><br/>There's been a lot of complaints about it not being ""scientifically accurate"". I have 5 words for those people: THIS IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY! It's a movie! So long as the ""science"" is acceptable and believable to majority of audiences, and it is entertaining, then that's fine. This is not PBS or some Discovery channel documentary. I believe this genre is called ""Science FICTION"". Emphasis on the FICTION part. <br/><br/>Sometimes what makes a good movie is not good science. Take Star Wars for example. Scientifically accurate? Heck no! Great movie? Totally! This goes for Armageddon. I like that instead of professional astronauts, they bring in a rag-tag team of oil drillers and those guys save the world. This movie packs excitement, awesome effects, a decent plot, and believable ""science fiction"". And it made me cry--which is saying a lot as I usually do not do that. Bruce Willi's character's sacrifice and the ""goodbye"" call to his daughter was very touching. His daughter putting her head down with her hand on the screen after they talked spoke volumes. This movie is awesome. If you've never seen it, GO AND WATCH IT! Or go watch it with people who've never seen it!"
"brchthethird","6","0","1","14 November 2014"," Overstuffed but serviceable popcorn flick
","If there is one positive thing about Michael Bay and his movies, it's consistency. From his very first film, it was clear what he was about: explosions, hot women and awkward humor. In almost 20 years, nothing has changed and upon watching Armageddon, it seems like this is probably his purest film marketed to the widest audience possible (since R-rated movies are limited to ages 17 and up). <br/><br/>The story is about an asteroid which is headed towards earth. NASA recruits a team of deep core drillers to be trained as astronauts, so that they dig a hole in an asteroid where a nuclear bomb will be placed. Along for the ride is one of the most impressive ensemble casts ever, although a lot of them don't really get to do that much. Most of them are also nothing more than caricatures rather than fully developed characters. The best performances come from Bruce Willis as Harry Stamper, the leader of the drilling team, and Billy Bob Thornton as Dan Truman, the NASA guy who recruits Stamper in the first place. There's also Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi, Liv Tyler and several other recognizable actors who round out the cast. <br/><br/>So, what worked? For starters, the filmmaking and cinematography was appropriately epic and restrained, especially compared to the hyper-kinetic style which Bay was to use with the Transformers movies. With the exception of a few intense sequences, one has a sense of place and the action is fairly easy to follow. This film also has impressive visual effects, probably the best that 1998 had to offer. Of particular note are some outer space asteroid sequences and a nicely done destruction of Paris. There was also rather good practical effects and use of miniatures, which was a nice change of pace from today's CGI-obsessed blockbusters. <br/><br/>Moving on to where this movie falls short. One would think that with such a great cast that the movie would be outstanding as a result, and you'd only be partially correct. While the film does have a lot of individual moments that are funny, or touching, nothing really coalesces. Instead of fully-formed characters, you mostly have stereotypes and caricatures, which is rather sad for a movie that lasts 150 minutes. There's also a romantic subplot between Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler that could have been completely left out. Of course, then they wouldn't have had an excuse to include one of the sappiest songs that Aerosmith has ever recorded (and whose lead singer, Steven Tyler, is Liv Tyler's father). There was also some pacing issues, namely that the first hour compresses about two weeks of training, and then the remaining 90 minutes takes place over the course of about one or two days. And of course, we get all the standard Michael Bay-isms. There's a ridiculous amount of explosions, misplaced ""humor,"" leery shots of scantily clad women (from one scene in a strip club), upward facing camera angles and lots of slow motion (although not as much as some of his other work). <br/><br/>Put together, the various ingredients which make up a Michael Bay movie do, for the most part, work here. It's not deep, and it's not trying to be either. This is popcorn entertainment at it's finest, and for sheer spectacle this is one of the best summer blockbusters ever made. That being said, I usually demand more of my movies and prefer not to have to turn off my brain very often to enjoy a movie. There are lots of people who absolutely love this stuff, but I'm not one of them. I thought it was passable entertainment, and certainly not one of Bay's worst (I'm looking at you, Transformers 2)."

"kathrynatrand","8","0","2","4 April 2013"," Like ""Die Hard"" you will like ""Armageddon""
","Armageddon is what most expect from Bruce Willis; it is much like his ""Die Hard"" films, all action, not much plot, you get it without having to figure out any hidden mystery.<br/><br/>The picture begins with NASA faced with a disaster, not a war as they first presume, rather it is a Earth destroying large meteor heading straight for earth, which all destroy all life on earth. Nuclear experts tell the heads of government no nuclear rocket will as much as deflect this huge meteor. They say it may be possible to blow it into peaces, which will pass Earth if a nuclear device was buried inside the meteor, as that will cause the needed pressure to explode the meteor, yet that is not possible because it would require humans to fly to the meteor and drill a deep hole to place the explosive in the centre. <br/><br/>Enter Bruce Willis; he is that lone individual who lives beyond the conventions of society. He has made a career out of drilling where most cannot, or will not attempt. Like him, his men are all on the edge of social convention; they are good at one thing, drilling and taking risks and getting into trouble!. <br/><br/>We see into Willis' character in the beginning when he finds out his one love, his daughter, has fallen in love with a man just like him, while Willis accepts being a reckless character, he does not want this life for his daughter; he has higher hopes; she should marry into respectability.<br/><br/>Willis, it seems clear, respects and admires, yet dislikes socialites; he finds then too restrained, too civil and Willis is one of the best portraying the outcast hero with a good conscience. All his men are like him, in one way or another, they are social misfits who have a propensity for eschewing social convections. One is a genius with two doctorates, yet he prefers the high dollar rough-neck work, and loves taking risks; he is a degenerate gambler. Another is like a Hells Angel, another, the perpetual adolescent. You get the picture, they are all misfits; however, they have found a way to earn money through the most individual of them all, their boss, the one man they admire, Harry Stamper, the ultimate super ego of all tough guys!<br/><br/>When the high government officials, who of course are the USA, as we know, when it comes to big weapons and missiles, the US is still tops at developing such devices, they locate Harry for his drilling expertise. However,Harry is not too impressed with the government trained conformists; they copied one of his drills and assembled it wrong. He tells Dan the man (played with excellence by Billy Bob, who seems believable, a feat in itself), his chosen crew are inept at doing the job and that it would take real drillers, his own men to get the job done. <br/><br/>When the government officials meet these misfits, they cannot believe these men could follow their way to the public connivance, yet alone manage a mission for trained specialists! Here is the twist"" Dan knows it is a big risk, yet he knows it is the only chance to save the world, use derelicts, or die! <br/><br/>Off they go with a few astronauts flying them to the meteor, salvation by the wildest! <br/><br/>This is typical Willis at its best, just as one sane person imagines a man could do what Willi8s does in ""Die Hard"", this is a pure fiction adventure fir entertainment. There is no need for suspension of disbelief, as all this action-packed picture is not much different that comic book heroes where the bad boys have redemption.<br/><br/>Willis dies in this one, blown into infinity by the nuclear blast, a fitting death a super hero. Now his more sane, I mean more attuned to the conventional, his daughter's love mate can take his place and be married; we assume they live happily together, taking the same risks, but A. J Frost, (played great by Ben Affleck), as the cooler man who will take replace Harry; he is not as hot as the volatile Harry Stamper-your- lights-out if you anger him. LOL! <br/><br/>If you like pure fictional adventure and the ""Die Hard' movies, you will ;like this longer movie with none stop action. It has the same pace as ""Die Hard"" more a bizarre cast of bad boys with good hearts and us not as slow as ""Last Man Standing"", ""Unbreakable"", or ""Hostage"", along with other movies staring Willis. with the exception of ""The Jackal"", which is excellent, yet less fantastic.<br/><br/>I would say, given its length, it is right up there with the ""Die Hard"" films and the somewhat comic tragedy ""Striking Distance""."

I visualize the sci-fi progression something like this:<br/><br/>1968: ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" <br/><br/>1979: ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" (which towers alone in the Trek franchise -- a profoundly spiritual TRIUMPH) <br/><br/>1986: ""Aliens"" <br/><br/>1998: ""Armageddon""<br/><br/>Some might object that I omitted ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" (1977), but it really doesn't fit the list. Don't get me wrong, it's good for what it is, but it's just too kid-oriented.<br/><br/>In any event, I hated ""Armageddon"" in the late 90s and never cared to see it again. My dislike was a combination of the whole ""blockbuster"" syndrome with its fast-editing to please those with ADHD approach and, believe it or not, Roger Ebert's scathing denouncement, which illustrates the power of words.<br/><br/>Well over a decade later I picked up a copy earlier this year (super-cheap) and finally viewed it a couple nights ago. Wow, was I entertained! Despite my dislike of fast-editing techniques, the story pulled me in right away and held me to the end. Yeah, some of the melodrama is too much, like Willis' scene with his daughter (Liv Tyler) near the end (rolling my eyes), but the filmmakers actually put some depth into the story and it mixes well with the action and humor. Their best move was to focus on character so that we knew and identified (with) the many individuals before the last hour's non-stop suspense and action kicked-in.<br/><br/>Speaking of the humor, there are some laugh-out-loud lines, like the one on not paying taxes, ever.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the star-studded cast is great and I especially appreciated the inclusion of Keith David and Michael Clarke Duncan (RIP).<br/><br/>The film is rather long at 2 hours and 31 minutes (the DC adds two additional minutes), but the story maintains your attention and the suspense, action and F/X are literally senses-shattering.<br/><br/>FINAL WORD: Yeah, it's a shameless, over-the-top ""blockbuster,"" but it tries so hard to entertain that you can't help but respect it. Besides, in addition to the disasters, action and humor, there's some actual depth to the characters and story. Take, for instance, Willis' character stumbling upon Affleck and Tyler during an intimate moment where Affleck literally covers her with kisses while she just eats it up. Willis stops, looks, and reconsiders his stubborn position. Then you know why he does what he does at the end.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+ or A-"

This being said, if one may question another; have you watched the movie Armageddon, 8 out of 10 certainly would shoot back with the reply ""Yes"".<br/><br/>The song I don't want to miss a thing debuted at number one at the billboard top 100. Performed by Aerosmith, this song has been the largest hit the band has ever done. This was also the first time in 28 years that Aerosmith topped the billboard top 100 charts. What more is needed to elaborate the greatness of the movies soundtrack? Simply said, nothing!<br/><br/>This critic was whistling this tune when the urge to relive the Armageddon experience sprung. Up until this point Armageddon was out of sight and out of mind but not forgotten. It is certain if this article is being read by this time one can still recall the movie. A selected few may even treat themselves to another viewing. <br/><br/>Armageddon: The place where the final battle will be fought of good and evil (Ref www.dictionary.com)<br/><br/>A certain interpretation of the above context was written into a screenplay by Jonathan Hensleigh and J.JAbrams. Both names well acknowledged in the film industry for their contributions. Collaborating with Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay this screenplay saw its way through to cinemas near you in 1998. Collectively the above names have given you the following titles. JUMANJI, DIE HARD, SUPER 8, LOST, THE ROCK, BAD BOYS, PEARL HARBOR, TOP GUN, CON AIR, PIRATES OF THE Caribbean & REMEMBER THE TITANS.<br/><br/>A Michael Bay signature always has been his astute choice of sound tracks and his visual effects. Ranging from Armageddon, PEARL HARBOR & TRANSFORMERS this signature move is evident. Nominated for 4 Oscars at the Academy Awards in 1999 Armageddon stood out in the following categories. Best Sound, Best Music; Original Song, Best Effects; Visual Effects, Best Effects; Sound Effects Editing.<br/><br/>The earth has 18 days left. Mankind is challenged with its worst nightmare; total annihilation. 65 million years ago historians and science suggests that a similar catastrophe wiped away the dinosaurs and all living things that roamed the earth. The earth as we know it is in direct course collision of an asteroid the size of Texas and the earth's last line of defense and its only line of defense is Harry Stamper(Bruce Willis) and his oil drillers. NASA has no choice but to send up two teams into space in order to save the earth. <br/><br/>The short synopsis makes it sound a sci-fi that would drive away an audience that dislikes the genre. Armageddon is many other things over a base of sci-fi. This is a story of love, self realization and redemption that is enchantingly woven around a situation that personifies human emotions in times of adversity. <br/><br/>Starring Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton, Will Patton, Michael Clarke Duncan, Owen Wilson, Steve Buscemi, William Fichtner, Peter Stormare and Liv Tyler Armageddon could not have needed a better cast. The cast begins the journey apart with slight hints of connection between each other. Like two hands fitting perfectly into each other they move closer and knit into each other that each life lost on the rock is felt hard by the viewer. Each sacrifice made on the rock tugs on the viewer a little bit harder and may even force out a tear. Personal favorite of this critic would be the only main female cast member Liv Tyler. The trauma of watching the only family she knew going into space to save a world that she did not understand, the agony of knowing that only one of the men she loves is returning back to her and the joy of knowing that one is at least returning to her. An absolute ball of thread her emotional path is and the then 20 year old actress delivered without holding back. Bruce Willis as always does not disappoint the audience. A hint more of Owen Wilson could have been slightly more welcome to promote more comic relief. The lack of Wilson is filled in by Duncan and Buscemi who nails the deal.<br/><br/>Opening on the 21st B day of Liv Tyler Armageddon is one of the greatest stories told by Michael Bay. Mixed reviews do fly in the vast ethos of critics which is obvious and is the norm. However the greatness and the simplicity of this story will never be forgotten. <br/><br/>A must watch movie and for those unfortunate few that have missed out on this marvel ; add this to your movie bucket list.<br/><br/>TITLE: Armageddon DIRECTED BY MICHAEL BAY STARRING: Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton, Will Patton, Michael Clarke Duncan, Owen Wilson, Steve Buscemi, William Fichtner, Peter Stormare and Liv Tyler RATED: PG13 RATING: 09/10 RUNTIME: 151 MINUTES"

I like ID4 but hate the sub-plots. Ditto for ""The Day After"" and ""2012"". A special effects ""popcorn"" movie has to be fun to watch. This one is. The earth destruction scenes work in this one. The disaster camera is not directly aimed at the Eiffel Tower, White House and pyramids (though it comes close). The Army's ""secondary protocol"" is logical. With the magic of DVD, it is possible to shorten this movie to a more watchable 2 hour length by skipping the 1/2 hour training and prep chapters. I believe that all the last-second near-misses are intentional, paying homage to Indiana Jones and James Bond films; and most of the humorous scenes are intentional also. Not so in other ""disaster"" films,including Titanic. So there is about as much ""Techno-Talk"" as the worst Star Trek Movies, and they made several mediocre ones. A bit far-fetched? Sure.

Then, there is a massively terrible threat that may wipe out all that this father cares about, so he assembles his team and strives to save what he loves. At the end of the movie is one of the most touching scenes in any movie, where the father sacrifices himself in order to save all of humanity, namely his daughter and her lover, so that they may marry each other and live a happy life.

There is something kind of romantic or ethereal about Armageddon's primeval appearance.<br/><br/>One of the advantages (for the viewer) of being in space I suppose is that it forces Michael Bay to cut down on explosions (seeing as there is no air in a vacuum for combustion). It means that him and screen writer J.J. Abrahams must turn to more effective devices for generating adrenaline. Michael Bay in Armageddon almost gets away with being non-gratuitous, but not quite. There is a teaser sequence in the first act where New York gets bombarded by a smaller meteor shower which as a plot element serves no function other than giving scientists the hint that something bigger is on the way. He should have let the movie build towards its spectacle rather than rush to it.<br/><br/>Armageddon for the most part does what it sets out to do. For that it deserves some credit. Most of the people you go to will probably bash it, but I can certainly recommend it on the grounds of an adrenaline rush (just don't watch it on your Ipod)"

","A deep core drilling team lead by Bruce Willis and including Ben Affleck and Steve Buscemi are the Earth's only hope to prevent a massive asteroid from devastating the planet. Despite there lack of experience in space they are the only ones with the requisite skills and thus are sent to land on the aforementioned asteroid. We also have Liv Tyler as both the daughter of Bruce Willis and the love interest of Ben Affleck. While Billy Bob Thornton rounds out the all-star cast as the NASA Administrator.<br/><br/>Sure it's ridiculous with plot holes as big as the 'Texas sized' meteor, and the intrepid shuttle crew is faced with one contrived potential disaster after another, not to mention a heap of incredibly obvious emotional manipulation. The scene where the Russian cosmonaut and the Russian space station are introduced is incredibly over the top. But it is still an exciting adrenaline filled summer blockbuster, though far from the best of its ilk.<br/><br/>On a few positive notes, the special effects are for the most part quite good for its time, the performers are likable and the emotional manipulation despite its heavy handedness can still be effective.<br/><br/>The shots from the second unit which feature a vast array of citizens from all over the world waiting for the oncoming disaster and for the Americans to save the day of course are so ambiguously commercial that you could slap any corporate logo in the world on top and produce a very nice looking 30 second television commercial."

","I have watched this movie 20-30 times...as I watch this movie each year about 4-5 times showing it to my students (dead days when half the class is gone anyway...like today). Now 11 years old, each year I reminded at what a good movie this.<br/><br/>I realize there are a lot of critics of this movie and that there are challenges with the movie, but in all fairness, this movie has just about everything a good movie should have. I mean, unless you are wanting to watch a non-fiction movie, then this is the perfect fiction story. First the movie starts with action. There are so many movies today that are good...but just never get that WHAMO start that Armageddon starts with. The movie has tons of humor, so many lines that are just down right funny that this could almost be called a comedy. I have seen comedy movies that aren't as funny as Armageddon. It has romance...a real love story. The presidential montage with the incredible music score raking you across a range of motions from a father who messed up, to a dying father to a father saying good bye to his little girl, is just down right brilliant (brings tears to my eyes just writing this...and every time while watching it).<br/><br/>The tension building from get go is what makes this movie and the middle 10 minutes probably the most dramatic movie ever. The movie reminds me of how fragile life is...and how fragile our existence on this planet is, really. I think the message that the president reads is very well written and very dramatic.<br/><br/>I think the acting is really well done. The all star cast is perfect. Bruce Willis is flawless. Billy Bob is great. Keith David (Kimsey) is hysterical. The suspense...although you guess how the movie is going to end before it begins, is enough to keep you glued to your seat. The cinematography is incredible with great lighting, composition, filming, scenery, shallow depth of film, etc. The pacing is also very well done with very few slow spots.<br/><br/>So, sure you can poke holes in lots of technical details, but Armageddon is perfectly entertaining...and based on just about every other movie I have ever seen (and I watch a ton of movies and shows) is the best all around movie ever."
"FlorianSchirner","8","0","3","10 February 2009"," Can't understand the critics
","OK, first I admit, I love this movie! That said, i wonder about the strong hate-critics this movie got, even here on IMDb. Some criticise the shallowness. Hey, it never intended to be a drama that teaches us a moral lesson. It even sets it straight, from the beginning, that it touches the meteor-crashes-on-earth subject way more unrealistic than movies like Deep Impact or Meteor, which are surreal too they just pretend to be more realistic.<br/><br/>Some critics said that great actors were wasted in small, insignificant roles. Well, first, no one forced these actors to take the roles. Then some, like Duncan or Wilson, were not at their peak back then. And I must say that even Owen Wilson's role (the most insignificant in my opinion) has its highlights. And some roles (esp. Affleck's and Thornton's) have more depth than in other popcorn movies. I find the general acting level quite strong, considering the type of movie. Of course we have seen deeper performances from Willis, Duncan, Stormare, Buscemi and Thornton, but those were in other genres.<br/><br/>Some say it claims only the NASA and thus the USA could deal with any crisis....well this is an American movie. And the USA are still the biggest movie market. I guess that if this movie would have been made by a Chinese company and filmed in China it would show China as the superior nation. One critic here claimed that the movie showed only blond white American kids rejoicing at the meteor's destruction. As I recall it this is plain wrong. Celebration all over the world is shown.<br/><br/>I find this movie quite entertaining, which is the ultimate goal a movie should aim for. It may have some weak moments, but it is just so cheesy and pushed beyond every reality that it becomes funny, tense and emotional. I especially love the scenes of the Affleck/Tyler relationship which are sweet, romantic but not too cheesy. Foremost the goodbye scene with the rendition of ""Leaving on a Jet plane"".<br/><br/>So...if you can enjoy an entertaining movie which never pretends to be intellectual and is solidly made, watch Armageddon."
"Jerique","9","0","2","10 January 2009"," You don't want to miss this one.
","Armageddon is one of the most acclaimed films of all time and not because of how great or entertaining it is. It's because it's a film premise that can be easily related to. You can feel and sympathize with each and every character.<br/><br/>It's got a huge ensemble cast of A-list actors anchored by Bruce Willis. I know that Bruce Willis is the lead protagonist in the film and receives most screen time and thus, probably most praise. However, I believe, Billy Bob Thornton and William Fichtner really shine most of all. Thornton is not really known for dramatic roles and when it comes to this film, he knows what he's doing almost as good as Tom Hanks. William Fichtner is a favorite of mine because I've seen him in so many roles now and I still can't get passed this performance as it's so mesmerizing.<br/><br/>It's not just those three top list actors either, though they powerfully show their intense passion for acting, but also there's the likes of Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Owen Wilson, Michael Clark Duncan, and many many more. It's a ensemble cast, I think, which only amplifies this movie's powerful inspirational premise.<br/><br/>As the movie begins, Dan Truman (Thornton) and the rest of NASA find out they have 18 days before an asteroid the size of Texas will destroy Earth and all mankind. It's up to NASA to train Harry Stamper (Willis) and his crew along with Colonel Sharp (Fichtner) to drill a hole, drop a nuke and save the world.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses, there's a friction between A.J. (Affleck) and Harry about Harry's daughter, Grace (Liv Tyler) and A.J.'s relationship. Bonds between Harry and Truman form, and all the while you begin to hate General Kimsey (Keith David) as he's not helping the already chaotic situation.<br/><br/>At the time of the film's release, Armageddon was one of the highest grossing films and a very high budgeted film. It also boasts some of the most amazing special effects and visual effects to boot. As a tear jerking film, the only downfall to the film is all the factual, geographical and continuity errors. But if you're looking passed the errors to see the film for it's entertainment and not pedantic reasoning, you will enjoy Armageddon.<br/><br/>It's known as one of the most epic disaster films of all time along with The Day After Tomorrow and 2012. It's no wonder why Michael Bay is known for his high-action, fast-paced blockbusters nowadays when you see Armageddon as basically his proving ground. It's a great film for all audiences and should not be missed."

","This movie is thoroughly entertaining and that after all, is what movies are all about. Quite simply one of the best disaster movies out there, packed with emotion, tension, humour, romance and action. The bond between the characters is really amazing, you actually feel the friendship between them all. The way the film builds up, introducing the characters in their own element first adds to this. Bruce Willis is great as Harry Stamper, the best oil driller in the world. The government brings him in with the intention of drilling deep into an asteroid on a collision course with earth and dropping a bomb to split it into two. There is no two ways about it, he accepts the job in order to save mankind. They are rushed through basic astronaut training and sent up into space and thats where things really take a turn. The movie is highly enjoyable for many people. People who might not like it are people who think they are cleverer than everyone else and read too much into every minor detail. This is a blockbuster, leave your brains at home and enjoy!! Deep Impact is another movie based on a similar scenario but doesn't come close to this movie. Also The Core is really similar in terms of the mission but again, the unity between the characters is not there."

","Armageddon is your typical Michael Bay movie: Loud, Stupid, shallow, but ultimately very watchable, humorous and spectacular too.<br/><br/>When I started watching this movie, I was not disappointed. The introduction on the oil platform was very funny, and Bruce Willis hitting golf balls into a Greenpeace boat was something that made men laugh loudly. The roles were played well, and it was all amusing. The fun lasted, and lasted, right until the moment that the president gave a speech about how America is going to save the world etc, etc, and the all the drilling idiots got onto the rocket.<br/><br/>It all went downhill from there. The silly but fun humor was replaced with gung-ho patriotism, the action scenes were stupid and the events became so far-fetched that not even the most beautifully filmed explosions couldsave the movie from drowning in epic retardation. A sad case because the movie started off quite alright, but ended up being a complete train-wreck.<br/><br/>I still give it a six because I found it entertaining, but very shallow and silly and with a poor second half. The special effects, the soundtrack and the way it was filmed (Bay's frenetic, constantly moving camera has been appealing since it worked so great in the Rock, and it has never lost its charm since if you ask me) made up a great deal to me (plus, the first 60% of the movie WAS entertaining, so a 6 is to me quite an adequate grade)."

Enough said!<br/><br/>Why the acting of (Ben Affleck) is that bad? And how could he make even more movies? Well, I have heard the great late (Vincente Minnelli) saying once in an old TV interview: ""Not every star should be a good actor!""<br/><br/>What is that anyway?

Ben Affleck is his usual wooden, shallow self, but I was able to forget about him. Liv Tyler has some gutsy moments near the end, but her love scene with the animal crackers has to be an absolute cinematic low-point. Bruce Willis? He does his macho act, and there are bits and pieces where you can see genuine emotion registering on his face, but any actor could have played this role--it doesn't utilize his personality to any particular advantage.

"AdderCowley","6","0","1","11 April 2007"," OK apart from Affleck
","To be honest I don't feel Armageddon is a bad film. I found it entertaining and a decent way to spend an evening when nothing else was worth seeing. However there were quite a few things that annoyed me intensely.<br/><br/>Firstly the ridiculous romance between Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck. She could have chosen any other character. Steve Owen for example who is even the right age for tyler as you hear Bruce Willis commenting that Owen's character was ""like 5 minutes older than her"" Affleck is simply awful. By far and away the best character is surprise surprise Steve Buscemi, who delivered a great performance compared to the young lovers dribbling over each other using animal crackers as metaphors to the serengetti.<br/><br/>The second most annoying thing about this film is that I found the constant America F*** yeah style theme completely destroyed any story that this picture had. You just can't take it seriously when the American boy ran, with the American flag on his shirt to the American astronauts. Also all other forms of life other than America seemed completely obsolete in this film. Every country (especially the middle-eastern countries) always seemed to be in shadow. While every American setting was a slow-mo of some US kids running towards somewhere. Damn it was annoying!!!. Also the fact that the Russian cosmonaut seemed permanently stoned and the British genius is thwarted mentally by Bruce Willis when discussing the drill design. WTF?<br/><br/>Also most of the characters seemed to change or disappear! For example when the company of misfits have been told the outcome of the Earth, one character appears and then you don't see him again EVER! He is only mentioned once when Affleck is shouting hysterically at the Russian saying Two of his friends are know dead. I seem to only remember Steve Owen's lifeless corpse. One, not two.<br/><br/>Anyway back to character development. The characters which seem to change the most are Willis who goes from hard-core driller to sentimental Christian mentioning god every few lines. And Liv Tyler who changes from head strong rebellious 20 year old to weak minded soppy child by the end of the film. The only character that doesn't change (apart form the cosmonaut, but let's face it there hardly going to concentrate on him) is Affleck who is constantly screaming out ridiculous lines such as ""Harry I love you"". Not great.<br/><br/>To the positives, most of the characters were likable. Bear, Steve Owen and the guy who plays chick are decent characters. Also Steve Buscemi and the Russian were probably the best in my opinion. However this brings back the Affleck situation, and this is where the film falls. Nobody can like Affleck's character. Telling Bruce Willis to chill when Bruce is chasing him on the oil rig just makes himself looking pretty stupid. Also the relationship with Tyler, the I love you Brucey scene and an poor overall performance are strong reasons to say that Affleck was pretty bad I'm afraid.<br/><br/>Liked most of the characters, OK story, decent no-brain Saturday night film but several serious flaws makes Armageddon an average film."

This may be the only film where any 2 minute sequence taken right out of the film could be used as a trailer for the film itself. I don't think any of the main characters are absent from the film for longer than a minute. The acting is b-movie standard. The special effects are pretty good for 1998. Whenever I see this movie on TV, I watch it to the end, bitter and disgusted, but fascinated. A car wreck fails as an analogy because they are not quite as entertaining and nowhere near as fascinating. As an example of the Bay and Bruckheimer excess style of film-making, it might be the best, because it is science fiction and action combined in a manipulatively effective way.

","I watched this movie about six years ago and I recently did so again. If I remember correctly I did not like it at all the first time and I appreciated it slightly more this second time.<br/><br/>This movie is obviously on a big budget. The effects are mostly top notch (except for one or two ""impacts"") and the cast is impressive. However, there are some elements that destroy the overall impression of the show.<br/><br/>Firstly, whoever decided that Peter Stormare should act as a crazy Russian astronaut should be fired. Being a Swede and a fan of Peter, I'm pretty sure he can play a Russian character well. But his performance in this case is plain stupid, both with respect the lines uttered and the acting. So... something must be wrong with the script. I'd like to see Peter as a professional Russian astronaut instead.<br/><br/>Secondly, the action scenes that take place on the surface are so intense that it is nearly unbearable to watch. It is a total chaos that lasts over thirty minutes with too few moments to catch one's breath. In addition to this, the events that unfold are simply not credible. I'd like to see a much more sensible and stripped down version of this part of the movie.<br/><br/>Finally, the scenes that involve flying space shuttles are too action-biased. The shuttles are maneuvering like if they were a couple of MIGs, at zero safety distance, while bouncing off car-sized ice blocks like ping-pong balls.

","This 'schlock-buster' should carry a government health warning. If you play it in your DVD machine, you are in serious risk of opening a rift in the space-time continuum and disappearing without trace into it - so bad is this 'movie'.<br/><br/>The fact that this movie was so successful is evidence of the true desperate state of modern Hollywood cinema, and the continual commissioning of films that appeal to the 'lowest common denominator' - although I truly dread to think of the 'lowest common denominators' that this film actually appeals to!!<br/><br/>I think Hollywood were just conducting some kind of proving trials when they made and screened this film!

","I have to say that I had low expectations for the movie before viewing it. All the people around said it was great, but I perfectly knew what they like. They like Aerosmith's song which is indeed great, they like the amazing special effects which had coasted a lot, they like the comedy side of the movie and of course many girls who love Affleck who according to my opinion is a really bad actor who tried not to be one, failed and now he is nothing. And all these things plus the reviews and the ratings I read in internet, gave me a clue the movie would be a huge disappointment since I am a big disaster kind of movies fan. Well, I've been right, but at least I was prepared.<br/><br/>The movie is really commercial. It's been said, but I will say it as again. We have over #100 million budget, we have a romance between Hollywood stars Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler and many other famous actors, who are popular with the fact that they rarely agree on becoming a part of the cast of a commercial movie if their names aren't written with big letters on the screen. Such as Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi which are highly respected actors that I also like a lot. They could play many characters in many different kind of movies. They could improvise, they could turn tasteless lines into hilarious jokes. On the whole, they could turn small movies into really interesting, funny or dramatic motion pictures, people love and will always love. Such as Fargo in Buscemi's case or A Simple Plan - Thornton. And to be honest, I am really disappointed they took part of Armageddon. Thornton plays a smart and refined man involved in politics if I remember correctly. Buscemi is one of the members of the deep core drilling team which is sent to save the world by destroying the asteroid which is about to vanish the world.<br/><br/>What I didn't like - well, I guess I've been already understood. I pointed out bad factors. The story is dull, artless and silly. It is so obvious that the movie depends on the effects and the dramatic ending that it's ridiculous. At least movies like Deep Impact and Godzilla have something special that might be considered as art. At least it ain't that obvious that the movie is made of financial purposes. Other than that, bad performances from all the huge stars. The jokes ain't funny, the lines are absurd and sometimes, they doesn't make sense at all. In fact, I recently read that on the stage, Ben Affleck has asked Bay whether it would be easier if they teach astronauts to drill, than drillers to becomes astronauts and Bay's reply has been simply ""Shut up!"" which is a really funny story which perfectly shows the creators's desperation.<br/><br/>And enclosing, I'll give an explanation why I give 4 to the movie. Well, I like ""Don't Want to Miss a thing"" and I was impressed by the special effects which are obviously the only good thing in the movie. The first scene is memorable. These are the the only 2 good things I liked about the movie. Michael Bay is an average director, but The Rock and both Bad Boys were hundreds of times better than Armageddon which was, is and will always be one big bad movie."

Armageddon was much more bearable to watch because you feel no emotional bond with the characters - people die predictably (the plot was predictable enough that I knew somebody, most likely Harry, would sacrifice himself in the end), the dialog is mostly one-liners, and it uses most schlocky action-movie bits - the nuclear bomb is disabled in seconds (and it uses the stupid which-wire to cut trick, even though the guy was a military expert who was supposed to know how the bomb worked) and in one of the final scenes, Harry triggers the bomb with seconds before it is too late.<br/><br/>Overall, a good movie to borrow from the library (I wouldn't waste my money on renting) for a few cheap thrills.

","This asteroid movie was released only two and a half months after Deep Impact, which did well with critics and audiences, but apparently this one made more money, directed by Michael Bay (Bad Boys, The Rock, Pearl Harbor). Basically the Earth was hit by an asteroid millions of years ago, and it will happen again, it is just a question of when? After a series of small meteor strikes in New York, NASA are shocked to discover a meteor the size of Texas is hurtling towards the planet, and will hit in just over a month! NASA scientists, led by Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton), plan to drill into the core of the rock, trigger a thermonuclear detonation, and break it into two pieces that will safely pass Earth. The original plan was to have professional oil driller Harry S. Stamper (Bruce Willis) train a group of astronauts to use the drilling equipment, but he sees the only way to complete the mission is to volunteer himself, and bring his crew with him. Stamper's crew consists of Charles 'Chick' Chapple (Will Patton), Rockhound (Steve Buscemi), Oscar Choice (Owen Wilson), J. Otis 'Bear' Kurleen (The Green Mile's Michael Clarke Duncan), and A.J. Frost (Ben Affleck), who is in love with Stamper's daughter Grace (Liv Tyler). The plan is for two rockets to refuel on a Russian space station, then sligshot around the moon, coming up behind the meteor, landing on it as central as possible, and drilling at least 800ft to plant the nuclear weapon. After all the astronaut training, the motley oil-drilling gang, joined by professional astronaut Colonel Willie Sharp (William Fichtner), take off, they manage to refuel at the space station, but disaster strikes when a fire breaks out, its sole cosmonaut Lev Andropov (Peter Stormare) helps them evacuate. It gets tense for NASA when they lose communication for a few moments when the rocket goes behind the moon, but it manages to successfully sligshot around it. But then the debris coming from behind the meteor causes problems, one of the two rockets is badly damaged and crashes, while the other just about lands without trouble. Stamper's crew in the landed rocket start the drilling operation, the other half of the crew, including Frost, have survived the crash landing and start to travel back to the others. The meteor atmosphere causes many problems, with one or two crew members being killed by various incidents, and communication with NASA going awry, but Stamper is relieved when Frost and the others return to help. The surviving crew members successfully drill 800ft, but after an earlier mishap, the triggering device for the weapon has been damaged, meaning that someone will have to stay behind to trigger the blast. After drawing straws, Frost is the unlucky person that will stay behind, but Stamper escoring him grabs the trigger himself, and manipulates his way to take it, he is willing to sacrifice himself, he wants Frost to be happy and marry his daughter. The rocket blasts off, and Stamper detonates the nuclear weapon just in time before the blast would devastate Earth, and the rock has successfully broken into two pieces that pass Earth, and in the end, Grace and Frost get married. Also starring Keith David as General Kimsey, Jason Isaacs as Dr. Ronald Quincy, Chris Ellis as Flight Director Walter Clark and Udo Kier as Psychologist, with opening narration by Charlton Heston. This movie seems to be more about star power, special effects and thing going wrong, you could argue it is more style over substance, I agree the love story element is a little dumb, and the concept of drillers becoming the ones that save the world is a bit inconceivable, but it is certainly exciting, and the Oscar nominated ""I Don't Want To Miss a Thing"" by Aerosmith (lead singer Steven Tyler is Liv Tyler's father) is a great song, a worthwhile science-fiction disaster action adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound. Good!"

","Without a doubt Armagedden has to be one of the worst all star films since Ishtar. From Bruce WIllis sleepwalking through his role, to Liv Tyler's over-dramatic performance, this film almost falls into plan 9 from outer space territory, but with none of the campyness. This god awful turkey disproved one theory: You can make a really bad film, despite having Steve Buschemi in the cast. What we simply have is yet another big budgeted, Hollywood mistake. I honestly tried to give the movie a chance, but often found myself laughing and things that weren't intended to be funny. I'm a long time fan of sci fi flicks, and I've seen some really bad ones, but Armagedden takes it's rightful place in the dishonorable roll. Thankfully, there will be no sequel. Armagedden is another example of late 90's film making. A movie whose soundtrack was better then the film itself (example, Godzilla). Remove the ultra cheesy animal crackers track, the one with the spoken words of Aerosmith's I don't wanna miss a thing, and the soundtrack is great, even with the sham verison of Journey on the album. Unremarkable special effect, a script that appears to be have written during a drinking binge, and overwrought, and chew the scenery acting doom what could have really been a decent movie. Alas, yet again, we're stuck with another example of why Indy films do better then Hollywood."

","Although Armageddon is pretty good, I still like Deep Impact better because it shows how the world would react if a commit was going to hit. I think Armageddon kinda got of subject. What i mean is for more than half the movie,The main characters were still on Earth and were sort of goofing off. They didn't seem to care that the Earth was in danger. And the movie didn't show how the world was reacting to the threat. It didn't get emotional until the very end. And I wont lie, I did get a little teary, but it was kind of like the director wanted more of a comedy than a drama. Now if some director would combine Deep Impact and Armageddon, that would be a great movie."

","File this movie under ""they put the entire budget into the special effects, not the story"" category. The special effects looks great. It is easy to mess up asteroids slamming into Earth, but Armegeddon takes care of that side of the equation well. Now, if only they put as much effort into the story, we'd have a good movie. As it is, it's a nice movie to look at, but a terrible movie to have to sit through. Who's bright idea was it to make deep-sea oil drillers the men who will save the world? I like Bruce Willis, but if our lives were in Hudson Hawke's hands, I'd immediately invest some time in parachute-less skydiving, I think I'd have a better shot of seeing the next day. Ben Affleck, I like him in certain roles, but again, I'm not looking to him to be the hero, especially one as emotionally dopey as he is in this film. Now Billy Bob Thornton, if he's running the mission, I'd feel a little better, though it was his idea to send oil drillers who have had no training in working in space on the mission, so maybe his decision making is questionable. I had problems with the movie's logic, which can be covered up with awe-inspiring effects, but the relentlessness of the stupefying plot was difficult to ignore. The ending is cliché in every sense of the word, and maybe one day we'll actually see a movie where the world ends because they sent a team of oil drillers into space! Ugh... what were they thinking? Why not send lawyers into space? At least, that would be a good start."

Action movies can be entertaining and great and I don't look for them to be even 50% realistic, but when they're as full of holes and macho garbage as this one is, it's a complete turnoff. When a scene is suppose to be serious but instead it makes you laugh, you know something's wrong. Throw in Ben Affleck and now you have a genuine pile of poop. Affleck is your average arrogant moron with no talent but Hollywood keeps marketing him for some reason, I guess just to add that final touch of crappiness to a movie they know is already bad. He's in the same category as Jerry O'Connell, totally useless and annoying. Watching Affleck play a tough guy, much less a hero space dude, is like watching Richard Simmons play Hercules.

"barnabyrudge","5","0","1","22 December 2004"," Has impressive moments, but insists on being shamelessly corny rather too much of the time.
","""Armageddon"" in its biblical sense refers to the final battle to decide the fate of the world. And this 1998 action movie wastes no time in placing the world in grave danger as an asteroid the size of Texas heads towards the planet, threatening to wipe out life as we know it. Armageddon is undeniably exciting in parts, but it frequently undermines itself with set pieces that are too over-the-top for the film's own good, and some embarrassingly corny dialogue and situations.<br/><br/>NASA scientists learn that an asteroid is on collision course with earth. Their only option is to destroy the rock before it hits, but in order to do that they need experienced drillers who can burrow to a depth of 800ft, plant a nuclear bomb in the hole they've made, and blow up the offending asteroid. The only team who have the expertise to carry out the required drilling work are a bunch of misfit oil-drillers led by Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis). The top brass at NASA aren't exactly thrilled at the prospect of placing the fate of the planet in the hands of these unrefined, blue-collar layabouts. But since no-one else can do the job, Stamper and his cronies are put through rigorous space training before being sent to intercept the asteroid and save mankind.<br/><br/>Where Armageddon comes unstuck is in its insistence on overcooking its ingredients at almost every possible point. For instance when the heroes dock at the Russian space station to refuel, what's the point of the big action sequence in which the routine refuelling procedure goes wrong and the station ends up blowing up? It's not a genuinely exciting scene - just an artificially contrived sequence shoved in there purely so that the audience can be subjected to more explosions and last-gasp escapes. There are many similarly exaggerated scenes which lose impact due to overkill - Buscemi's bout of space dementia; the dumb scene in which a trio of men drive across a gravity-less canyon; Willis's absurdly noble and polished final speech just minutes after he's elected to sacrifice himself to detonate the bomb; the TV-commercial-style scenes of kids running around with toy space shuttles celebrating the destruction of the asteroid; etc. These scenes really grate on the viewer, because they are overdone to such a degree that they insult our intelligence. That's not to say Armageddon is all bad. It's done with its tongue in its cheek and so manages some occasional flashes of self-deprecating humour. Also, occasional sequences are quite exciting, with good editing and photography, and in a few scenes the action is suitably exciting because it isn't bled dry of all credibility. The performances vary in quality, but Patton is good as one of the drillers and Stormare has a nice role as an eccentric Russian cosmonaut. Armageddon is an OK popcorn picture for the undemanding, but its identically-plotted 1998 rival Deep Impact is unquestionably better."

","Right before the turn of the millennium, all these apocalyptic Armageddon films (Deep Impact, End of Days, even South Park Movie anyone?) were hugely popular. Fascinated by the seemingly impending disaster of the Y2K phenomenon, we moviegoers flocked to the theaters like sheep to see these films, caught up in a monotony of ""End of the World"" scenarios. However, Armageddon somehow stood out compared with the others.<br/><br/>Maybe it was the cast. The star filled cast of Willis, Thornton, Affleck, Tyler, Buscemi, and Wilson is a start, but the performances were actually quite good under the circumstances. Harry Stamper (Willis) is believable as a lifelong oil driller. Affleck, not so much, but in the defining role of his career (to that point), he did a good job. Though the scripting of his love for Stamper's daughter (Tyler) is cheesy at best, by the end of the movie there seems to be a real connection between the two. It's not by any means a masterful script, but then nor does it pretend to be. It's a special effects action romp on an imaginary asteroid hurtling towards the earth at (literally) breakneck speed. Forget how corny it seems that the setbacks keep occurring one after another. Forget the mistakes with the actual physics of space - ""Fire in space? How?...There's no air!"" as well as a scene where someone tosses a pipe in the air and it actually comes down (""This asteroid is so big it has its own gravitational pull?"") - Forget all that. If you analyze anything here, it won't work. But then if you analyze the Ninja Turtles, Spider Man, or the X-men, they won't work either. While Armageddon will undoubtedly fall short of the ranks occupied by those comic book/video game (and now film) deities, that doesn't mean it can't be enjoyed, even by those of us who do have, and like to use, our brains. Just sit down, grab some popcorn, suspend your disbelief, and watch the movie. And when it's over, don't discuss it except to give praise to the actors where it is due, talk about the cool effects, or mention the awesome Aerosmith song ""I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing."" To apply reason and rational evaluation to a film in this genre would be as catastrophic as, well, an asteroid the size of Texas slamming into the earth."
"justins_dream_catcher2003","Null","0","1","22 September 2004"," The Meteor Explodes
","In the movie ""Armageddon,"" there are numerous different things going on at once. Harry (Bruce Willis) is taken to NASA, along with his daughter Grace (Liv Tyler), to find out they need his help so they can drill into the center of a meteor which is headed for Earth. As the movie progresses, Harry rounds up most of the crew that helped on the oil rig, and they undergo training for space. After training, they're sent up to drill and only have eight hours to drill into the center of the meteor, make it explode, and get back to Earth. They run into problems and only a few make it back alive.<br/><br/>In the movie the meteor explodes and all is well. Michael Bay's message is not all that clear. He's telling us that with the technologies of science, anything is possible. But at the same time, he's telling us that there is still danger, and that a simple gust of wind can change the outcome of the goal.<br/><br/>I found this movie explosive, although I didn't really like the idea of Harry blowing up in space. With the bad, comes the good. The good is that Earth was saved, and that A.J (Ben Affleck) returns alive, so he can possibly marry J-Lo (and then later on when they divorce, Grace). A.J runs his own oil rig, and basically plays Harry in Grace's life. But also in this movie, the special effects were intriguing. I've always wondered how they did what they did. They use special lights and backgrounds, and mix them together. And, just for future reference, the meteor explodes and misses Earth."
"Cephyran","8","0","1","13 September 2004"," Campy, occasionally romantic...
","Reading a lot of other reviews, I get the sense this movie isn't very popular. Granted it's got a fairly star studded cast - Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan, and all those other familiar faces you know you've seen before. That could be one of the film's faults - they stocked their hopes on a popular cast, and didn't pay enough attention to the plot itself. As far as plot, I'm always entertained by disaster movies, particularly the disaster part. For me, the best part of the movie is the foreboding atmosphere built up by the superficial damage that the tiny fragments create. Everything after that is just filler. At the same time, I personally feel the one other strong point is the romance between Tyler and Affleck, and the conflict they have trying to build their relationship around the cynical father, Willis.

","An unforgettable experience. Mainly because it was such a rip off. Although the film starred usually talent actors (Rhames, Affleck, Buscemi, Wilson), it was obvious that this was a major payoff. Who could resist a Michael Bay film when you're an actor. What more assurances do you need that people are going to see you in work. I only give credit to the great Steve Buscemi. Being the only character with any kind of charisma and personality, he stole the show. And I could not believe he arrived back and Bruce Willis didn't. That was the only part that I enjoyed. Overall, easily one of the top 50 worst movies of all time (along with every other Michael Gay or Fairy Suckheimer film). Not to sound too immature, but that is what films such as these have done to society. I challenge Michael to make a film with real impact, and a real meaning. But where would the money be in that?"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","5","0","3","14 July 2004"," Barely managed to sit through this mess of special effects and general lack of anything else
","After just barely sitting through this film, I can say with almost 100% certainty that I will never even glimpse at one minute of this film, if I can avoid it. The film has a fair amount of explosions and what I imagine is expensive special effects, but generally lacks anything else. The film has little to no character development, which pretty much puts the main characters in two major groups: those who will survive, and those who won't(mind you, none of these will we care about, no matter if they die or not). The little character development there actually is, consists of cliches and various badly recycled formulas for character development scenes. What's worse(well, almost, anyway) is that the characters themselves are cardboard cutouts, cliches, and stereotypes of the worst possible kind; believe me, you'll cringe, you'll feel bad for the actors, hell, you might even laugh, but probably not at the right times. Which brings me to my next point; the humor all feels so forced, and most of the actors share zero on-screen chemistry, which just makes it look awkward and unfunny. The film also has far too much of what is supposed to be humor, which just feels extremely misplaced in what was supposed to be an action/disaster flick(I guess, but it's so messed up that it's very hard to tell). One of the things that really baffles me, is the way the characters are introduced; from the very moment Bruce Willis appeared on screen, I hated his character(you'll find out why when you see it yourself). The same goes for Ben Affleck, and pretty much the rest of the cast. Even Steve Buscemi was someone I had hostile feelings against, even though he did do a fairly good job, and did have some funny lines, scattered about in this film. Liv Tyler offered a few extenuating qualities, mostly by being darn attractive(if you don't mind me saying so) and fairly talented in her performance. The plot is close to being completely incoherent, and lacks any real structure or pace. The acting is good enough, I guess, but is ruined beyond repair by the cliche characters. The humor is mostly unbearably stupid and juvenile, but Buscemi had a few moments and good lines. The special effects are decent enough, but mainly consist of stuff blowing up, which seems fairly unimaginative. The first hour or so of this film is almost bearable, but then the film tries to be serious(it pretty much only starts trying to be serious at this point) and then the quality of the film drastically declines until the point where the film almost becomes completely unbearable to watch, mostly due to the characters cliche-like qualities, which the film suddenly ignores, obviously in an attempt to flesh out these characters, which it fails horribly in, since they are, in fact, cliches, and absolutely nothing more. The film is overly long and pointless. I can(obviously) not really say anything positive about it, since I really didn't find anything about it to meet even my very lowest expectations. If you ever find yourself watching this, do yourself a favor, and either turn it off, or fast-forward to the next interesting scene(which could take quite a while). Nothing unmissable in this feature, sorry. I recommend this only to huge fans of one or more of the following: disaster flicks, Bruce Willis, Steve Buscemi, Ben Affleck or Liv Tyler. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, as it is really *that* bad. I reluctantly gave this film a 5/10, mainly for actually having one or two scenes that are decent, and for having decent enough effects. Also, Liv Tyler is a bit easy on the eyes, which I guess played a more or less small part in my rating, too."

"combatreview","Null","0","1","10 March 2003"," THINGS EXPLODING 2: MORE THINGS EXPLODE!!!
","There is a point in this film where Mr. Steve Buscemi's character Rockhound opines 'this is like a goddam Greek tragedy'.<br/><br/>I would suggest a contrary argument, which basically runs 'No it's not.' Unless one is perhaps comparing it to an unhappy love affair with a Cephalonian Fishwife, and while that sounds altogether more believable I don't think I can be forgiven for dismissing this as the most likely intended meaning of the comment.<br/><br/>(To be entirely fair, one could argue that the principal relationships in the film, between Tyler, Willis and Affleck display a certain Elektra-complex quality, but this is frankly about as Greek as it gets. Unless one counts the relationship between 'fellow warriors' Willis and Affleck)<br/><br/>However, I am distracted from the meat of the matter.  Another line, spoken this time by Willis, claims that he has never aimed for a depth he has not reached.  Armageddon certainly proves this.  It is a remarkably bad film, even by the standards of the Hollywood blockbuster in which inanity masquerades as dialogue, and overblown special effects shoulder everything else out of the picture.<br/><br/>Indeed, it is at times difficult to believe that this film was not meant as a joke - it comes across as a grotesque parody of the MTV-style action film pioneered by Tony Scott when his leash was still held by Simpson and Bruckheimer.  With Armageddon, Michael Bay cements his position as directorial Dark Apprentice to Tony Scott's Emperor Palpatine, and produces a work which fulfils all of the brain-damaged potential that lay unexploited in such restrained and considered exercises as Top Gun.<br/><br/>For example, why does everything in this film explode?  Everything explodes! I'd seriously be worried if I was related to Bruce Willis in this film - he can't go anywhere without the place exploding.<br/><br/>Which is not to say that I totally disliked this film, believe me.  It has a certain reckless enthusiasm which sweeps you along all the time you don't attempt to think or anything; Peter Stormare is enormous fun and ends up stealing the show as Crazy Comedy Russian, and there is a certain amusement to be gained from the variously ludicrous degrees of seriousness displayed by the other cast members.  Bruce Willis also delivers a performance that is by far his most layered and effective, if one discounts for a moment his turns in The Jackal and Hudson Hawk.<br/><br/>To speak personally for a moment, Armageddon will always have a special place in my own heart; watching it in the cinema I found myself laughing out loud in an extremely obnoxious manner, so much so that I later realised my selfish treatment of other audience members and wrote and complained to the cinema.  They should not, I argued, allow individuals to spoil the cinema experience for everybody else, and while I didn't exactly mention that it was I who had behaved so appallingly, I did demand that they do their best to prevent it from happening in future.  They very kindly insisted that I accept a voucher which allowed me and three friends to attend another showing of any film I wished absolutely free, where I was assured there would be no further disruption from unruly patrons (and indeed, I was quite pacified on this occasion).  You may count it as a mark of just how bad Armageddon truly is that even after this experience I felt that I had been a little bit cheated for having to pay for the privelege of seeing Armageddon in the first place.<br/><br/>It's fun, don't get me wrong - but the fact is that, like having a Big Mac, taking Class A drugs, or consorting with East European women who insist on getting married in a hurry, this is a rather likeable experience - but extremely bad for you.<br/><br/>Armageddon, as many of the intended audience for this film doubtless know, is said to be the location of the last battle against the forces of the Antichrist as predicted in 'Revelations'.  There is little of this in the film 'Armageddon', but the very fact of this film's financial success might lead us to suppose that at least in cinematic terms the battle has now been lost."

I mean, we can avoid to care about the macroscopic goofs of the plot... that asteroid, first of all, is not an asteroid but a planet, it's just weird to think we cannot see an object of such dimensions if not 18 days before it crashes on earth, and how the heck could you break it in two parts just putting a bomb 800 ft underground?? If it really has the dimensions of Texas it must have a diameter of several hundreds of Km, no matter how flat it is, the smaller diameter must be at least about 150 Km, what can a bomb do at 800 ft??? Just a crater, that is, and anyway a complicate mathematic calculus and precise estimations should establish the exact place where to drill and put the bomb, not just ""land somewhere where the ground is softer and do your work"", and if the ""asteroid"" takes a rotatory movement because of the moon gravity effect you can't just keep the old plan 'cause there's a precise moment in which to detonate the bomb, or one of the two fragments could keep running towards the earth... and so on... But as I said, who cares about that, the real problem here is that everything is too manifestly predictable... you just need to know what the movie is about and you'll know what will happen... ok, maybe you can't know exactly who'll die and who'll live, and who'll be the hero (but you can guess), but nothing, really NOTHING, can surprise you, even just a little, along this story.

This movie spawned a series of sequels and ripoffs, none of which was as good as the original, as it is usual in these cases. The latest of this bad imitations, and probably the most ridiculous, is ""Armageddon,"" a centaur of a movie in which the old world-goes-blooey theme gets spliced with the Dirty Dozen concept.

","Although the film fails in traditional aspects such as plot, characterization, and feasibility, it succeeds in being what the producers probably wanted: a roller coaster ride, possibly unrivaled.  Notwithstanding the cheesy plot and gratuitous patriotism, this film is a feast visually, sonically, and emotionally.  Sure it is manipulative, but so artfully done that I enjoyed it most of the time.  It's a long movie with some definite slow scenes, and some annoying scenes as well.  The whole storyline involving father, daughter, and fiancÃ© was tedious and just used to prop up the tear-jerking sacrifice and salvation at the end.  On the bright side, it had a seemingly unlimited visual effects budget.  The music by Trevor Rabin and Harry Gregson-Williams is a masterpiece by itself and all the more impressive when supporting the visuals.  You are pulled through joy, sorrow, laughter, and sheer adrenalin-rush.  There are many memorable visual sequences from the film, and even some memorable quotes and facts about asteroid collisions.  One that was especially appropriate mirrors a theme from the novel _Lucifer's Hammer_: Never before has a species had the power to prevent its own extinction."

If you've lived in a cave since the invention of space flight, you may be in store for some surprises.  Otherwise, check your brain at the door.<br/><br/>Even without picking apart the factual errors, it's hard to not be distracted when the entire premise is ridiculous (you've got a meteor the size of Texas and dropping a bomb 800 ft below --- not even a quarter mile --- is supposed to obliterate it?  Only if the bomb is a box of 'Armageddon' VHS tapes).<br/><br/>In true Titanic wanna-be fashion, the story intermittently focuses on the young love between Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck.  Tyler is cute and precious, which is about all this type of roles requires.  Ben Affleck is perfectly bland as the young stud.  He seems like a nice guy but let's face it, he is nothing but a creation of old-school Hollywood trying to promote some working class white guy as the next hot thing, when in reality he is absolutely average in every way.  Their romance is so freeze dried that violins start blaring at 11 everytime they come within a 10 foot radius of each other (that is, when Aerosmith's latest hackwork song isn't being played in the background).<br/><br/>Let me say that I don't require high intelligence or class in my movies, but c'mon, don't try to BS like this.

","I usually avoid most summer 'action' flicks, because I can tell by the ad campaigns that they are going to suck big time. Unfortunately, I got dragged to this at the multiplex, and my fears were more than justified.<br/><br/> ""Armageddon"" is as bad as big-time blockbusters can get. It's no fun to rip it, really - it's just too easy of a target. What bugs me is all the self-righteous comments on IMDB from users trying to justify their own low, low, LOW standards to discriminating moviegoers like myself.<br/><br/>
There is something called ""suspension of disbelief"" that is the basis for enjoying films or plays. It means that the creators attempt to present a story in a reasonably plausible fashion, in order to allow the audience to forget they are watching something fictional and react as if the events were actually occurring. THAT is why this movie is so hated - it makes no pretense of believability or originality, it just tries to beat you into submission. When I am paying $9 to see a movie that cost more than $100 million, I should not have to turn off my brain to get my money's worth.<br/><br/>
 Check out some of the classic action movies, like ""Road Warrior"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", the original ""Terminator"", or, more recently, ""Braveheart"", and you will see the difference.

Some movies I've seen such as Face/Off and The Mummy were able to, despite their script and plot problems, be at a fun entertaining level enough to make up for their faults. Armageddon fails with action scenes that make no sense, have way to high a frequency of cuts, and are just messy and too loud. If a movie is made purely for eye candy it shouldn't taste like dirt. I give Armageddon a 3 out of 10."

","ARMAGEDDON starts off like a house afire.  After a pretentious prologue narrated by no less than Charlton Heston (but without plugs for the NRA) and showing the configuration of continents umpteen million years ago as being exactly the same as it is now, the movie pops the clutch and goes into high gear.<br/><br/>New York City, the present day.  Under the opening titles, a young man rides his bicycle into Manhattan with his strange looking but still cute dog riding in the basket.  Once in Manhattan he comes into confilict with a street vendor selling Godzilla figures, which the dog promptly tries to eat.  Meanwhile an Asian couple is stuck in traffic, and the woman is complaining to the cab driver that she wants to go shopping.<br/><br/>Without warning huge chunks of rock are streaking from the sky, buildings are exploding, vehicles are bursting into flames, the top of the Chrystler Building is sheared off and falls into the street below, crushing cars and pedestrians unlucky enough to be in its path.  A hole is blown in the street and the young man tries to rescue his dog.<br/><br/>People are in motion, things are happening at a breakneck pace, adrenaline is pumping.<br/><br/>And all too soon we cut away and never see these characters or New York City again.  Director Michael Bay starts all over again with a new setting (an offshore oil rig) and new characters who are neither fresh nor interesting.<br/><br/>The rig is run by Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis).  His awesomely lovely daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) lives with him and a dozen or so men on the isolated rig.  Harry is amazed that Grace is deep in a romance with A. J. Frost (Ben Affleck), one of his crew members.  And Harry is the hero of this movie, the man whose job it will be to save the planet, but he's too dense to figure that his daughter would get in a situation like this on this rig in the middle of nowhere?<br/><br/>Lord help us all!  Would someone go over to the auditorium where DEEP IMPACT is playing and see if they can talk Robert Duvall into coming back with them?  Now there's a man who can inspire confidence.<br/><br/>DEEP IMPACT was a very good movie on its own.  Compared to what passes for entertainment here, DEEP IMPACT seems more like a latter day CITIZEN KANE.<br/><br/>Really, there's noting wrong with Mr. Willis's performance here.  But the script (by a total of ten writers, always a bad sign) doesn't really give him anything to work with.  Late show fans will recall the situation with his daughter and Affleck as recycled from John Wayne's THE HELLFIGHTERS.<br/><br/>Pretty soon Willis is in Houston at NASA and the big brass are telling him that he and his crew need to do the whole astronaut training bit in a period of days and then go blow up the asteroid roughly the size of Texas which threatens to crush the world.<br/><br/>So he and his crew go through the training (lots of recycled material from THE DIRTY DOZEN HERE) and finally do blast off.  Before they leave Ms. Tyler and Affleck make goo-goo eyes at each other while songs by Aerosmith (featuring Liv's dad, Steve) play on the soundtrack.  If this had been directed by John Waters, he could have had some creepy fun with that.<br/><br/>Paris blows up.  Singapore blows up.  But since we don't know any characters in either city, that's just so much special effects.  Oddly enough, it seems as if the killer chunks of rock will not strike anywhere with a population of less than several million people.<br/><br/>There's one special effect worth noting, though.  It's a major conceit of this film that if the sun is shining on the U S of A, it's shining everywhere.  There's no nonsense about time zones or the earth's rotation or anything like that.<br/><br/>There are two performances of note here.  Most amazingly, Steve Buscemi plays one of the drillers.  After all those independent films he's made, here he is in a big piece of mainstream crap to get a nice check so that he can go on making quirky independent films.  Way to go, Steve.  Cash those checks, hold your head up, and walk on.<br/><br/>One of the big cheeses at NASA is played by Billy Bob Thornton.  Billy Bob hasn't made many movies like this, and he creates a three-dimensional and interesting character.  Since director Michael Bay doesn't seem very intersted in the actors, just the explosions, I guess there wasn't anyone to stop Billy Bob from doing good work.  He plays a man who would have been an astronaut were it not for physical limitations, and he's teriffic.<br/><br/>The astronauts blast off and the story grinds to a screeching halt for an interlude on the Russian space station, which blows up very loudly as the astronauts make a hasty exit.  Then the astronauts try to plant a big bomb on the asteroid which, for whatever reason, has grass and water on it although there's no atmosphere.<br/><br/>The finale involves self-sacrifice, probably because audiences responded so positively to the same element in DEEP IMPACT.  There's a scene that, oddly enough, builds to a point where it actually has emotional impact: if Michael Bay had known that, the scene probably would have been cut.<br/><br/>More stuff blows up.<br/><br/>The surviving astronauts return to Earth, and there's a wedding.  Nothing else blows up.  Except the audience, when they realize that they've blown $5 or more and a whopping two hours and twenty-four minutes.<br/><br/>With any luck this will be the end of the current cycle of disaster movies. Anyway, I liked them better back in the 1970's when they featured actors whose tv shows had been cancelled but still had some recognition factor.<br/><br/>Parents' note- the PG-13 rating is for some language and sexual innuendo and violence.  The violence mainly consists of stuff blowing up, with very little attention to those people who might be caught in the way.  And it's very, very loud.  The film might be disturbing to children under junior high age.<br/><br/>On a five scale, Pops gives ARMAGEDDON 1.5 skyrockets."

"MadReviewer","6","0","1","30 April 2001"," Held Back By The Weight Of Its Own Excesses
","The problem with blockbuster films like `Armageddon' is that they want to do everything.  They want heartbreaking romance, pulse-pounding action, gripping drama, slapstick comedy . . . all in the same film.  Trouble is, few films ever succeed in accomplishing this tricky blend of different genres.  `Armageddon' isn't one of them.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, `Armageddon' starts out as a disaster epic, with a Texas-sized meteor hurtling towards Earth.  This meteor will obliterate all life on Earth unless a group of oil drillers can somehow fly to the meteor, drill a big hole into the side of the meteor, and blow up the meteor with a sizeable amount of nuclear explosives.  Mixed into this disaster epic is a full-blown romance, comedy, serious, thought-provoking moments, and a smattering of other scenes designed to give `Armageddon' the feel of a true Hollywood epic.  What comes out instead is a true, bloated Hollywood mess. <br/><br/>`Armageddon', which at least looks cool and has the superficial sheen of a Hollywood blockbuster, is weighted down by a barely there script and awkward shifts of tone.  It's hard to take a character's impassioned speech about saving the Earth seriously when he's only been cracking jokes about the matter only moments before.  Shifts in mood like this look effortless and natural when they're done right; the shifts between comedy/drama/romance/et cetera in `Armageddon' are labored and forced.  <br/><br/>The story suffers from major plot holes as well. Forget the logistical impossibilities of `Armageddon'; even simple stuff gets made unbelievably preposterous.   For example, the meteor is the size of Texas . . . but the drillers only have to drill down four hundred feet into the meteor's surface?  Hey, why bother drilling at all, if that's the case? There's a tedious section of the film involving the Mir space station that does nothing but waste film, there's enough crashes and accidents to fill twelve action films, let alone one - `Armageddon' reeks of excess, and suffers because of it.<br/><br/>As Harry Stamper, Bruce Willis saves this film from being unwatchable crap. Even if the story's ludicrous, he makes Harry Stamper a quiet, reluctant, slightly believable hero, and more importantly, he makes Stamper somebody an audience can root for.  Willis is good enough to single-handedly pull `Armageddon' out of the trash and make it at least entertaining.  Also good is Michael Duncan Clarke as `Bear' - he comes across as a person, rather than just as a cartoon character, and as such he's someone to root for as well.  Ben Affleck is completely bland and forgettable as A.J. Frost, as is Liv Tyler as Harry Stamper's daughter Grace- considering they're the two romantically linked characters, it makes for a fairly uninteresting romance. If the Harry Stamper character didn't care so much about Grace and A.J., both of those characters would've been a complete waste of screen time.<br/><br/>Still, `Armageddon' deserves credit for trying to hit a home run, even if it only wound up with a cheap single.  The movie's still kind of fun, in a mindless, dumb sort of way.  If you're in the mood for a decent, cheesy popcorn flick, rent it, and watch it on a big screen TV with a killer sound system.  But only watch it once, unless you want the plot holes to drive you utterly mad.  <br/><br/>Grade: B-/C+"

","Armageddon was an extremely painful movie to watch.  It is just so cheesy. Let me begin by addressing several technical flaws in the movie.  First of all, we're told that the asteroid is the size of Texas.  Let's assume that it's diameter is as wide as Texas.  About 900 miles.  So they have to drill 450 miles into the asteroid to blow it up.  Not possible.  Next, we're told that the space shuttle is made of titanium so it can't be destroyed.  The kinetic energy of any object in space larger then a pebble is massive.  A piece of paint once cracked the windshield of the space shuttle.  So this indestructible space shuttle sounds cool, but it's not possible.  The space shuttle banks and turns in space like a conventional plane.  Uh, that doesn't happen.  There is no air in space and so the rules of aerodynamics do not apply.  Next we meet crazy Yuri, or Ivan, or Yakov Smirnoff or some other dim-witted Russian stereotype at Mir.  The space shuttle docks with Mir and begins ""auto rotational gravity"" or some junk like that.  Wake up morons, rotation does not create gravity.  The Earth has gravity because it has mass, not because it rotates.  If the Earth stopped rotating you would actually weigh 5 ounces more at the equator, you wouldn't fly out into space.  And, if you stand at the north pole, you aren't rotating at all, but you don't fly into space.  Are you hearing me Bruckheimer.  Also, Mir contains a huge supply of rocket fuel.  Is the fuel solid oxygen like the shuttle actually uses for it's boosters, no it's some sort of liquid.  And Mir has some sort of attic or basement that you can crawl through.  Man, that's bad.  I can't even talk about the asteroid, it's just too embarrassing.  Besides this childish action, we have to see the American flag in every scene like blowing up asteroids is our patriotic duty as Americans.  I guess since the end of the cold war we need a new enemy to fear.  Take that you evil asteroid.  So if you can look past huge plot holes, bad science, bad acting (Buscemi plays a stereotype of what he usually plays), and altogether cheeziness, you'll love Armageddon."

"Speechless","4","0","1","18 November 2000"," Like watching the tip of a spinning propeller blade
","Armageddon is just one dilemma after another, and you can sense the desperation with which each new obstacle/problem was added to the film.  I still don't understand what causes the Russian space station to explode, other than the movie's general need to have something blow up every few minutes regardless of cause or effect.  Later in the film there is a retread of the always dependable which-wire-do-I-pull-to-defuse-this-bomb routine, which works in many movies but just doesn't make sense here.  It's not a terrorist bomb--the astronauts work for the organization that made it, NASA, who in any acceptable circumstance would have thoroughly briefed everyone about the bomb and told them exactly what wire to pull should such an emergency arise (or, even better, put a STOP DETONATION SEQUENCE button somewhere on it).  And then Steve Buscemi just starts randomly shooting stuff because apparently he didn't think they were in enough trouble yet. That's how this movie works--bad things happen for these astronauts, and it doesn't matter how or why they happen as long as they happen.  The film would have been much, much better if it had just taken a couple of these dilemmas and developed them more, but the story ended up being a constant barrage of obstacles and setbacks that just end up canceling each other out. You know these guys are always going to be in trouble but then just barely scrape through, and what should be exciting becomes an onslaught of boredom.<br/><br/>
But it's the editing that really derails this movie.  It's impossible to tell what's going on in the action sequences because they're edited so quickly.  You see something for less than a second and, while you're still trying to figure out what you just saw, you see something else, and then something else, and after a while you just give up and let the movie take off without you.  There's no reason for it.  Braveheart and Gladiator used hyper-editing to convey the chaos and randomness of battle; this film uses it to dull us into believing we're watching something exciting or stylish or interesting, even though we're not.  Or maybe it's so we can't see how fake the special effects are, I'm not sure.  Armageddon is a brainless event movie that actually forces a high degree of effort on the part of the viewer, and that's something that should never exist.  You go to a movie like this to relieve stress, not increase it.<br/><br/>Have fun with this movie if you can."

","I could compare this movie to a dozen badly made (though surely more cheaply made) sci-fi flicks (Meteor comes to mind), but the real comparison that I arrived at was to the crappy full motion video games that came out in the early 90's. You know the ones where you would bop the joystick right, then left, and maybe hit the action button? The whole movie proceeds in a series of sequences like this, except for a few treacly touchy feely scenes where the movie grinds to an utter halt. At least my ear drums had a chance to heal.<br/><br/>About halfway through the movie, the characters board a space shuttle to go in the space. At this point in the theater, I literally turned to my wife and said, ""Well, maybe it will get better from here."" No such luck. I will confess to being a science weenie, and it bugs me somewhat when sci-fi flicks play fast an loose with the facts. Nevertheless, effective storytelling gets me past that. Armageddon is an insult to the American movie-goer, almost as if some foreign movie company had typed up a script, saying all along ""Who cares if we show grass on the asteroid (no joke)? Those stupid Americans won't know the difference!"" Then the evil multinational corporation would run screen tests that would tell them they need more explosions and less dialog. Now that I think about it, I think a movie about the making of Armageddon would have made a better movie.<br/><br/>Listen, some bad movies are still fun, like Highlander, or Remo Williams...this movie has no joy in its heart. It is coldly cynical and corporate and dead. Please don't support it by renting it.

"thirdi","6","0","2","8 March 2004"," Heavy on the cheese, but still fun
","I'm a sucker for disaster movies. As for ""Armageddon"", I can see why a lot of people dislike Michael Bay films, he pretty much represents the current state of Hollywood big-budget mainstream movies. However, I like to think I'm not a ""film snob"" who automatically hates anything that Michael Bay does just because it is big-budget Hollywood fare. Yes, most of his movies are shallow exercises in corniness; unrealistic, garish, obvious and over the top. The style over substance argument is a valid one. But it is foolish to write off any movie strictly because of where it comes from. And sometimes they turn out to be a lot of fun, and very entertaining. Besides, disaster films just have an inherent corniness built into them, as the all time cheese-fest ""Titanic"" proved (James Cameron gets a free pass, he's still a genius). Truly, since the ""Airport"" and ""Towering Inferno"" movies from the 70's, isn't this really what we should expect from disaster flicks?<br/><br/>Probably so, and such is the case with ""Armageddon"", one of the ultimate hokey-but-fun disaster movies ever. I often have to remind myself to judge a movie for what it is, or more to the point what it is meant to be, not for what you want it to be. And using that logic I was able to really enjoy this movie. First of all, you have to admit it's just a fascinating subject. Yes it's been done before (no less than in the same year with ""Deep Impact""), but I can never get enough asteroid/comet stories. They set up the impending doom nicely here and Billy Bob Thornton is excellent as our NASA guide to the end of time. There's very little scientific explanation of the asteroid/comet threat on screen, but they throw us enough bones to get into the story.<br/><br/>The problems with ""Armageddon"" lay mostly with the characters. Most of them are kind of annoying. But some of them are very likable (Billy Bob, Bruce, Owen and Will Patton mainly). The special effects may not have been realistic, but they're still great to look at. Lots of corny dialogue, but amazingly there are some genuinely tender moments that pull at the heartstrings as well. The kid with the toy space shuttle, that got me. They didn't really focus much on the social effects of such an event, instead opting to make it an adventure film about dudes landing on a comet. Which is fine, although some of the sequences did drag. And its hard to keep track of all the minor disasters that occur while these guys are trying to stop the big disaster. The biggest problem of all, of course, is the fact that oil-diggers would never replace astronauts on a mission like this. But again, turning part of your brain off is key to appreciating movies like this.<br/><br/>""Armageddon"" works because it's fun escapism, that's what it's supposed to be. Not every indie film is a ""gem"", just as not every heavily marketed studio movie is complete crap. Big budget Hollywood still manages to pump out a decent movie now and again. And once in a while a few breakthrough and distinguish themselves from the parade of trash that the idiot studio execs green-light. If you've forgotten this or gotten too ""film school cool"" to remember, go back and watch ""Die Hard"". As for comet movies, if I had to choose, I liked ""Deep Impact"" a little bit more, although it had issues too. Overall, ""Armageddon"", despite its problems, is still worth seeing."

The crew go through the usual battery of wacky highjinks. But when it comes time to save the earth these guys are cool customers. It's drivel. There are numerous close calls and near deaths, as well as the requisite ""good buddy"" who dies for the cause and following tearful scene. The effects are impressive and I think all the script money went to the effects department, because the script is no where to be found. In place of dialogue are many speeches, witty comebacks and all the usual spats of dialogue that absolutely nobody uses in their daily life.

","Armageddon definitely sets the record for fooling the most people into thinking it's a good movie. When I first saw it, I was blown away. I loved every second of it! It was exciting, it was spectacularly done, the acting was great, the dialogue was funny, I couldn't think of a single thing wrong with it. Obviously, I bought it on video. Then I watched it at home, and saw for the first time what an awful movie it is. <br/><br/>Armageddon manipulates the emotions of the audience like no other disaster movie ever has. The romantic scenes (like those in The Rock) are clumsily and randomly thrown in (this way it will appeal to women, too, and therefore make more money in the box office). The tough guy acting, particularly (and CONSTANTLY) on the part of Bruce Willis as Harry Stamper, the world's best oil driller, was terrible! There were so many scenes in this film that were thrown in for no other reason than to get a meaningless laugh or broaden the target audience that it began to get tiring trying to figure out which ones actually had anything to do with the story itself. <br/><br/>Besides all that, there were also horrible discrepancies in the storyline. Early in the film, Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) describes the effects of the asteroid collision as ""basically the worst parts of the Bible."" Even the name of the film, ""Armageddon,"" is taken straight from the Bible. Given that, you have to wonder why there are so many times when the characters (mostly Stamper and Truman) ask God for help, ask God for just a little more time, pray that ""God be with them."" Why are they asking God for help?! They just finished pointing out that it was God that sent the asteroid! Why WOULD He help? You can see how the hypocrisy of religion even manages to wiggle its way into Hollywood films.<br/><br/>The dialogue of the movie also took a lot away from several of the action packed scenes. The phrase ""She's gonna blow!"" is uttered so many times that by the time the scene's climax is reached it has no effect anymore. The predictability of the ending is also a serious disappointment. Furthermore, the logical errors were a little disturbing. For example, there was moderate WIND on the asteroid, as well as clouds of dust and smoke floating calmly around. That's funny, I thought we were in SPACE traveling at 22,000 mph.<br/><br/>As a whole, Armageddon is an edge of your seat action thriller, but there wasn't a whole lot of effort put into it beyond special effects and sheer financial purging. It's never boring, but the structural, logical, and storyline problems take away a great deal from what could have been a spectacular disaster film."

Which was better, this or ""Deep Impact""(or perhaps the question should be, which was worse?)?

"TMC-4","Null","0","1","4 March 2000"," Entertaining, but Ultimately Falls Apart As It Progress
","Somewhat surprisingly, Armageddon ultimately falls apart when it finally gets into full swing with its premise.  Perhaps the biggest flaw in this movie, is the quick editing technique throughout.  The camera tends to cut to another character or shot before another person is even finished with a sentence.  The editing creates the illusion that numerous situations are happening all at once.  Because of this, the movie pretty can be confusing at times in spite of the fact that it can represent frantic situations fairly well.  Not to mention that the quick editing technique grows somewhat tiresome after a while.  On certain occasions Armageddon can fall into the area of repeating itself.  Besides the style of editing, the camera will every once in a while, use slow-motion shots of people all across the world and even some action sequences (e.g. scenes that involve drilling at an asteroid) seem similar. Along with that, certain scenes in space and their outcome (although benefit from moving at a fast pace) can get predictable as they progress on certain occasions.  Although the drama is somewhat sappy and manipulative, it's redeemed to a certain extent mainly by a moving musical score.

","The second asteroid related movie of the summer is not all it's cracked up to be.  The film starts off with a brief, special effects laden meteor shower, which is entertaining, but then the film goes downhill.  Armageddon tries to mix many different genres into it, action, drama, romance, but doesn't succeed in any. In  fact the film is more enjoyable when it doesn't take itself seriously and decides to dish out some jokes, most of which come from Steve Buscemi.  It goes for about an hour or so of pointless training exercises getting ready to go into space, and it has no point to it.  The plot is also terrible.  If there is one reason to see this movie, it's the special effects, they are cool, but that's about it.  Oh, and if you do go, sit in the back, this movie is very, very loud.<br/><br/>* *"

","I can't remember a louder, more cacophonous assault on the senses since Batman Returns. An asteroid the size of Texas is heading for Earth, so out of all the geologists and astrophysicists in the world, the leaders of NASA and the free world pick Bruce Willis and a bunch of alcoholics and assorted losers to go into space on a highly specialized mission to blow up the asteroid. Hey, makes sense to me...So they are brought together, Seven Samurai style, and sent to train for the mission. Meanwhile Bruce, who was shooting at his future son-in-law with a rifle, though no assault charges were filed, gets him along too. Liv Tyler is the daughter and love interest, but she just hangs around, all lopey-dopey. And she's always allowed onto highly restricted areas even though she has no direct involvement with the project. They finally blast off in two souped-up shuttles, and that's when all the noise and commotion starts. They land on the asteroid while being constantly bombarded by asteroid fragments in the most annoying quick-cuts and camera jostling I've ever experienced. As they walk around on the asteroid their weight is normal, like on earth, but when it comes time to jump a yawning chasm, that's when gravity goes away. By this time all the noise was giving me a headache, so I forgot whether they blew up the asteroid and made it out alive. I guess they probably did, but I'm not sure."

","I didn't bother spending a penny on it, but my brother happened to see it for a buck on his college campus. So here's what he thought:<br/><br/>Armageddon is by far the worst piece of cinematic trash since Kevin Kostner's, ""The Postman."" Due to the enormous amount of technical inconsistencies found in this film, the subject will have to be addressed in my upcoming treatise entitled, ""How Armageddon Has Violated Science."" Sections will include, Astronomy, Mechanics, Statistics, Thermodynamics, etc... The overall experience of watching this movie can be likened to a trip to the bathroom that has suddenly gone awry. At first the s**t flows smoothly: the menace of the approaching asteroid, and the group of characters that will be pitted against it are given their crude and brief introductions. Regular action movie shit. Nothing to sweat about. Then there is an explosion of diarrhoea which refuses to cease the flow of its mucky blobs for an excruciating two and a half hours. It comes in the form of downright moronic characters whose main repertoire of macho yelling and grunting is framed by MTV style editing which alternately flashes images of gray, crumbling asteroid turf (reminiscent of nothing other than feces), and dimwitted faces of the men. Some action sequences filmed this way actually make even less sense than an average music video. In some places it becomes next to impossible to figure out exactly what's going on, even though the movie's outcome is just as predictable as that of Apollo 13's. Could the world really end? Could these idiots actually save the planet? It's obvious that they will, but by they end you wish that they would all perish. Making violent, gutter trash men the heroes of the picture, the movie also does a terrible injustice to women, making them look like whining, insignificant, subordinate nervous wrecks. ""Armageddon's"" poor quality and its blatant and distasteful use of US patriotism to please audiences places it behind its horrid rival, ""Godzilla."" After watching both, an intelligent person will become convinced that a generation of people raised on movies such as these would not survive an encounter with an asteroid."

The story is stupid, some of the dialoges are embarrassing and when the movie is over, all you can think of is the main question: Why bring a mini-gun to space?

The wipeout of a city like Paris is only good for a nice FX and that it might be useful to get help from the rest of the world never occurs to the NASA scientists. Well, if you've seen ""Deep Impact"" you know the drift.<br/><br/>Then let's talk about physics - the way it is treated in this movie would make Mr. Newton spin in his grave. Gravity on an asteroid the size of Texas? And apparently just as much as on earth, the way the protagonists moved? Well, to get that going the asteroid would have to have the weight of Earth on as much room as Texas has. The density would be so high that no matter if you used a 10000 watt drill or a toothpick to dig a hole the result would be the same. <br/><br/>But somehow the gravity also seemed to fade out on story-line convenience, when one of the landing vehicles is able to drift over a wide valley on the asteroid by a little thrust of its boosters. We are not even talking about ""why"" these vehicles were armed with heavy guns.<br/><br/>Now about the actors: Liv Tyler is a fine young woman, although not a fine young actress. Bruce Willis as her father is like Arnold Schwarzenegger as Ghandi. Overall the entire cast seemed to not really know what they actually should be portraying, so the fault might not be on the actors, but on the bad storyline.<br/><br/>If this movie would not pretend that it has to be taken serious, you could actually enjoy it - as a movie rental for a boring Saturday night.

Liv Tyler might pay homage to screen legend Ava Gardner, since she has the glamour and beauty of legendary actresses, and Bruce Willis in a role that foreshadows Charlton Heston's roles in the 1970s disaster films.  The opening narration by Heston might be homage to his other noted works, as well as his affiliation with the 1970s disaster flicks.<br/><br/>

Engineers, astronauts, and pilots are very skilled and knowledgeable in their fields, but they don't know diddly about drilling.<br/><br/>This really was a wonderful opportunity to highlight the abilities of unsung men who have technical capabilities, rarely highlighted in Hollywood films. It is also interesting to see how NASA wrangles with the construction crews' various legal, medical, and psychological problems.  For example, ""Bear,"" the biggest and strongest of the bunch jumps into an impromptu flex after being told by a NASA egghead how awful his cholesterol is.  Its pretty clear that if these boys are going to save the world, the planners are going to have to take a back seat to knowledge and knowhow.<br/><br/>If the film had stuck with this premise it would have scored big.

When you shoot for the 12 year old boy in the audience you will almost always get his attention.  However, Hollywood should ask itself a question.  Is that tried and true formula for box office success worth it in the long run?  Is it really worth tossing good screenplays to the wind for the sake of slow motion , computer generated effects?

In short, it is something like a cross between ""Die Hard"" and a slew of terrible B-grade 50s sci-fi movies.<br/><br/>Probably the worst thing I found about ""Armageddon"", however, was the constant, CONSTANT implausibilities throughout the movie. Here is a few...<br/><br/>1) It is considered easier to train 9 oil-rig workers to be astronauts rather than train 9 astronauts to dig a hole.<br/><br/>2) The ""Russian Space Station"" (as it was only ever called in the movie) carried a heap of liquid oxygen to refuel the shuttle. Lovely. Pity the shuttle also needs a heap of liquid hydrogen as well.<br/><br/>3) With 2 space-shuttles coming in, the ""Russian Space Station"" starts to ROTATE to ""provide gravity to make it easier to refuel"" -- not to mention making it an extremely dangerous and almost impossible task to dock two space-shuttles on it! (One wonders if it was to make it easier -- and cheaper -- to film these scenes rather than have the astronauts in zero-G)<br/><br/>4) Whilst sling-shotting around the moon, the astronauts experience 11G of acceleration. Humans black out at around 9-10Gs. But here, of course, Bruce Willis' friends were busy screaming ""yeeehaaa!"" at the time.<br/><br/>5) When setting down on an object in space, one doesn't send one's shuttle screaming in for a crash landing. One slows down, matches velocity and gently sets down on the surface. Since all the asteroid fragments are moving at more-or-less the same velocity as the asteroid, you don't have the added hazard of screaming thru clouds of fast-moving rocks; you just gently puff your RCS thrusters and drift past. Wouldn't look as spectacular, I guess...<br/><br/>6) When you crash your shuttle onto an airless asteroid, bits of it don't sit on the surface and burn with nice cheerful fires, putting out smoke that gets whipped around by the wind...<br/><br/>7) When you're equipping your space-shuttles, you don't put 9mm handguns in special lockers as standard equipment, and finally...<br/><br/>8) When you design your ""asteroid rover"" vehicles, why in God's name do you mount whopping great remote-controlled chain-gun turrets on them?????!!!!!<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour. Don't, under any circumstances, waste your time with this movie.<br/><br/>I give it * out of *****, and that's only because of the great CGI shot of Paris getting nuked by a meteorite.<br/><br/>Phil"

"smarty-13","Null","0","1","14 July 1999"," Giant asteroid on a collision course with earth
","ARMAGEDDON ( rating * * out of 5 )<br/><br/>This stomach-churning display of overt patriotism is brought to you by those maestros of big budget fairy-floss, Jerry Bruckheimer, Michael Bay and a host of writers who all seem to have had a go at striking the correct mix of worldwide insignificance and giddying imbecility. Congratulations gentlemen, success is yours.<br/><br/>'Armageddon' is about a giant asteroid on a deadly collision course with earth. Stunningly original I know, but this is where it gets really good. If the world is in trouble, who do you call? That's right, the United States of America.<br/><br/>With considerable flag waving they come to the rescue of us kulaks who call this third rock from the sun home. Between high fives and puerile dialogue, they pool their seemingly undefeatable resources to atomize this pesky asteroid. Now watch carefully Russia and China, and see how this sort of annoyance is dealt with.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis' performance is ultimately cold and arrogant - about as detached as a dislocated finger where his personality is left flapping in the breeze. We can only hope that one day Mr Willis will grow into his head.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck's character was in desperate need of a good slapping, Liv Tyler was anemic and ghoul-like in appearance and I was surprised that her image actually showed up on film, and Billy Bob Thornton was very good - one of the reasons this film secured its two stars.<br/><br/>The feeble attempts at humor were about as subtle as smashing your funny bone with a ball-peen hammer, while the machine-gun style editing and the lambasting soundtrack was comparable to having pieces of your skull being chipped away by a mallet and chisel.<br/><br/>After Bruce Willis delivered the line, ""Six billion people on the planet, why did you guys call me?"" the cracks were showing, and with the immortal utterance, ""The United States government just asked us to save the world, does anyone want to say no?"" I was ready to regurgitate the contents of my stomach.<br/><br/>If it wasn't for the humans in this movie, one could easily mistake it for an animated caricature. Obviously Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck were cast because Rocky and Bullwinkle weren't available.<br/><br/>As the film progressed into its grand finale, I must admit, I found myself getting involved with what was happening even though the cutting was harsh and left me wondering at times what the hell was going on. Ultimately though, the overall production was fuelled by its huge budget and its essence was nothing more than suds and lather. I do recognize that there is a huge market for this kind of thing and Jerry Bruckheimer is the master of tapping into it.<br/><br/>It is a little sad to see a flotilla of potentially good actors capsizing in a sewer of feeble-mindedness here, but I believe they are their own worst enemies. I'm sure the pay-checks are what lured them to this movie rather than the project's alleged distinction.<br/><br/>It can be argued that there is a place in the grand design for entertainment aimed at the lowest common denominator, but to spend millions and millions of dollars on it just seems like it isn't worth the effort. If this is the only way the audience can be amused, then I have grave concerns for humanity's collective level of consciousness."
"Dr.Jolly","6","0","1","13 July 1999"," A pretty good movie, until they take off into space.
","You've got a disaster movie about an asteroid coming straight to Earth and a possibility of killing all human kind. Than you put Bruce Willis in the starring role and cast a wide collection of colorful supporting characters. With all this, it would be impossible to make a boring movie. In fact, this was beginning to be the best disaster movie since the Poseidan Adventure, but then they took off into space and this movie went all to hell. Bruce Willis basically plays himself as the best oil driller on Earth and is called up to destroy the asteroid heading to the Earth. Of course, Willis needs his crew to get the job done. Ben Affleck is a good young actor, but he needs to choose better roles, because all he does in this movie is place himself as a teen idol stud and not a promising actor. I think Liv Tyler is highly overrated not only in looks, but also abilities. Consider that Tyler was out-acted by Alicia Silverstone in the Aerosmith videos, that is very sad.Thankfully, led by Will Patton and Steve Buscemi, the rest of the crew is wonderful and sets this movie off with a bang during an excellent first half of the movie, showing them training and pulling off non-stop comedy and intelligent dialogue. But like I said before, than they had to take off. As soon as you see space in this film, it takes a huge nose dive. At this point, Billy Bob Thornton gains a big chunk of control in this movie and that isn't good. Thornton did a great job in Sling Blade, but since that he has virtually done a terrible job in anything since and this is no exception. The whole space mission is hobbled through the fact that too much happens with questionable possibilities. Buscemi goes AWOL, but somehow becomes a hero. Than you have to see Willis meet his fatal ending. It really sucks to see Willis die in anything. Plus, was it just me who notices that there space outfits change colors all the time while they're up in space? I don't know what they were thinking when they did the last hour or so of this film, but it seems like there were two directors and screen writers on this film. This movie is headed into history as being a great disaster film and turns into just a fun movie to watch for a while. Bruckheimer has yet to find anything as good as Top Gun still. I give this movie a 6 out of 10."

The situations, of course!, were preposterous.  The science, of course!, was ridiculous.  The characters, of course!, were cardboard cutouts sliding from dumb predicament to dumb predicament.

DVD, the filmmakers revealed that they were absolutely seriously trying to make a straightforward mainstream action flick for teenage boys.  People apparently cried at that mawkish stuff that seemed so knowingly planted to trigger obvious emotional tugs.

"RNeary","Null","0","1","12 June 1999"," Say what?
","Probably not the worst piece of crud I've ever seen, but absolutely the loudest, and, given the high budget, the dumbest. (I've seen sf pictures costing fifty thousand dollars that were tighter, smarter, better and more convincing.)<br/><br/>This picture is a timeless tribute to sheer idiocy. We laugh at many of the dumber science fiction flicks of the Fifties on Mystery Science Theater 3000, as if somehow we've evolved beyond them, become superior, in the last forty years; but give ARMAGEDDON special effects from 1958, and it would be as absurd as ATTACK OF THE 50-FOOT WOMAN.<br/><br/>We all know that movies sometimes stretch logic in order to accomplish what the writers want; but usually when this happens, it's a last resort, and the picture feels sort of apologetic about it. ARMAGEDDON, however, makes it the only resort. It positively lurches out of its way to turn logic into road kill.<br/><br/>Why is it necessary to show a pointless two-second shot of jet pilots scrambling across a runway, a la TOP GUN? Everybody in the audience knows the country isn't under enemy attack. In general, why is it necessary to see three quick shots of everything, when two longer ones would do as well? As Pauline Kael said about 1941, it's like having your head stuck in a pinball machine for two and a half hours, and it gets damn tiring.<br/><br/>Why is it necessary to have the two space shuttles take off about two hundred feet apart? Wasn't anybody in the movie's version of NASA familiar with the rather large fireball generated by Challenger? Have that happen to one of these ships on liftoff, and there goes the world. And why do the shuttles seem to fly within each other's exhaust wash half the time? Would the movie really have been less exciting if it had been fifty percent smarter and fifty minutes shorter?<br/><br/>I can't buy the argument that we should excuse all the sloppiness here, because it's ""only"" an action film. Movies like AIR FORCE ONE, CRIMSON TIDE, THE TERMINATOR and STARSHIP TROOPERS prove it's always possible to grip an audience by the throat, without cutting off the air supply to the brain - but first you have to have talent."

Sentiments such as these allow filmmakers to spend a hundred million bucks to make films that are mediocre at best.

Armageddon is full of bad space science, but beside that particular brand of pickiness, it has a silly plot, generally bad acting, and inexplicable behavior by the characters. From a science point of view, the spaceships fly like fighter jets, gravity exists where it shouldn't, astronauts completely mishandle volatile fuel (I know they are just ""oil drillers"" but no space agency would ALLOW such stupid procedures in the first place), and nuclear weapons are given much more power than they actually have.  Here is a fact: If an object the size of Texas were heading toward us, with the few weeks' warning the characters had, there would be NOTHING we could do about it.

Greenpeace is portrayed unsympathetically early on in the movie protesting the oil drilling (is that even a real cause of theirs? Save the oil?).

","Armageddon was one of the movies that was a tossed up by the critics and loved by the public.  When I first saw it, I was in the first row with my neck bent trying to watch the movie.  The theater was packed.  I thought it was a very good movie indeed, with nice special effects.  Only when I watched it at home for the first time, did I really enjoy this movie.  It had a plot, but no one thought that a bunch of rough tough oil drillers could go up and do that.  Maybe they couldn't.  The fact is that it moves you emotionally at the end.  I was sad, but happy at the same time.  I overall enjoyed this movie very much.  I give it an eight.  This movie was up on the sound enhancement too, and that is why I couldn't hear my girlfriend say goodbye when I walked out of the theater.  I didn't care, I went home and iced my neck."

","In my deepest hopes I'd like to think that somewhere in Hollywood one of the producers of ""Armageddon"" wakes up after a fitful night of sleep, splashes cold water in his face, and looks at himself in the mirror, thinking, ""My God, what have I done?""  But I know the truth is they're thinking ""people went to see this movie, let's make more!""<br/><br/>It's easy to see what they were planning on; take the formula of ""The Rock,"" add in some good 'ole boy characters to liven it up, and a healthy dose of patriotism, and you get a movie everyone will love and have a good time with.<br/><br/>At least ""Armageddon"" showed me what happened to all the Junior High drop outs who never did anything but get into trouble ended up at, they're working on off-shore oil rigs.  A key to any movie is liking or identifying with the main characters; but here they're like the loud next door neighbors, you just wish they'd go away.  When they get let out to see ""what they're trying to save"" and they make a beeline to a strip joint, maybe we're better off getting pulverized by the asteroid.<br/><br/>And in a tradition that runs from Fred Flintstone and Archie Bunker, brawn and know-how takes the place of training and skill.  I'd love to see it where a highly trained and educated scientist or engineer can do the job, rather than Bruce Willis stepping in the door and telling everyone in two minutes how things ought to be done.<br/><br/>Finally, about all the scenes of run down small town America with little kids running around in denim overalls toting US flags and toy space shuttles- let me put it to you this way, I'm an American midwesterner in a small town, and I couldn't believe the false patriotic hype.  May this movie mercifully slide into obscurity."

The biggest problems with this movie are that it goes on way too long and tries way too hard to be moving. Spending twenty minutes on the asteroid scenes would have been much better than spending a whole hour. Also, at the end of the movie, I almost laughed at the absurd way in which it tries to make you cry.  Anyway, if you want to spend your money on something related to this movie, buy the soundtrack.

","At first, I watched the whole thing, now, I watch the action.  I honestly think Michael Bay is a great action movie director, but the buck stops there.  The quote 'dramatic' unquote scenes are some of the clunkiest this side of a Roland Emmerich film.  Thankfully the movie has great visual effects and fine sound effects (pain-inducing as they are).  The script is beyond dumb, it is built for the brain dead.  It wouldn't have surprised me if a 'laugh' or 'cry' caption appeared at the proper moment.  Bruce Willis isn't horrible (that little tear running down his face at the end was a nice touch), but he is far from Oscar caliber.  Liv Tyler is starting to wear out her ""pouty whiner' act, and Ben Affleck's role had me desiring to stick a shotgun up his ass and pull the trigger.  One thing that I really can't help but notice is how blatantly poor the science is, such as the mysterious phenomenon that allows India and the US to watch the asteroid explode in broad daylight (maybe the Earth really is flat...), and the infamous space station sequence.  It would have been really cool if they had gone for some accuracy and had some actors walking on the ceiling while others walk on the walls and/or floor, but that's asking a little too much.  The only way I can watch this movie now is in widescreen, with the lights off and the Pro Logic surround turned WAY WAY up.  Sadly after two hours even this approach can't save this overblown and rotten piece of eye candy."

They say things that only someone like a well-trained academic would say. And the happenings are very ""illogical"". But I can't for sure say if the  scriptwriter and the director are both totally out of their minds, or if the film was being cut down quite a lot, so that we, as the audience, miss some relevant happenings an dialogue.

It can then be seen for what it is: inane, foolishly written for five-year olds, and set for the MTV attention span,(and even they would have trouble with all the nonsense thrown at us).

","** 1/2 out of *****<br/><br/>When I saw this movie´s trailer, I got excited beyond belief. I knew that like in Deep Impact, America would manage to save the day...again...in the same year. Don´t get me wrong, I love the United States, specially Disneyland, Houston and Las Vegas. But why is it that when the world´s in danger, us third world countries have to wait for americans to save us? I know it´s because we don´t have the economical resources, but what we do have is extremely brilliant people...but let´s get back in track...<br/><br/>I think that what happened with Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer was the same thing that happened to Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich. Bad Boys and The Rock were excellent movies. So what they did, was to think of an excuse and with it create a ""story"" and put it on film.<br/><br/>I expect when I go to the movie theater, to see more than things being blown up... I expect to see some story, care about the characters or something. None of this things happened with Armageddon.<br/><br/>For starters, Bruce Willis was cast to act as Bruce Willis, at this point, I really can´t remember his character´s name. Now, there are some irregularities with this movie... Explosions and sound can´t happen at space, because there´s no oxygen! Remember elementary school? With no oxygen there´s no fire? Steve Buscemi´s character (from whom I can´t either remember his name) starts firing a remote controlled automatic machine gun...Why would they carry a machine gun into space? Did they expected to fight some aliens, or to even find any? I loved Jonathan Hensleigh´s writing on Jumanji and Die Hard:With a Vengeance...but, what happened to him on this one? The lines of his characters were so irrelevant, that I really dídn´t care for them: ""The clock is ticking"" (Why is this line so famous?) There was another scene that excited me when I first saw it, but then I thought about it and was kinda illogical...If they´re activating the nuke, to detonate it from earth, by simply pushing a button, is there a reason for the weapon to have a timer? Or was it just an excuse for the ""clock is ticking"" line, or for the blue wire/red wire sequence? The other thing that was an assault to my senses, was the vertiginous direction. No image lasted more than 5-6 seconds. There were some scenes where I couldn´t understand what was happening. I did liked the New York destruction scene, but is it easy (or logic) to hide an asteroid the size of Texas, after the massive destruction of a city, to the whole world? What I did liked about this movie was that I was so worried about Willis´ team succeeding in their mission, that all improbabilities slipped past through my mind. Trevor Rabin´s score was excellent, but it was difficult to pay attention to, it with all the sound effects. This movie is better in just one thing than Deep Impact, it cares about the world´s reaction. In Deep Impact, the matter was treated as a local problem, without caring for the rest of the world. I do love action movies, and even vertiginous ones (The Rock, The Peacemaker and Crimson Tide) but if you make an excessive use of your cinematographic elements you can make a mess out of your movie."

","Well, they say that when you watch/read science-fiction, you have to leave your disbelief at the door...but this was ridiculous.  Armageddon was one long, continuous, unbelievable scene.  In the opener, a meteor falls from the sky, scoring a direct hit on a large Polynesian man, causing an explosion powerful enough to heave cars into the air, but miraculously leaving unscathed the 10-pound, so-ugly-he's-cute dog with which he'd just been fighting, as well as its owner.  From that scene, I knew my eyes were in for a painful ""oh, you gotta be kidding me"" rolling experience.  And I never did get past the fact that I was asked to believe that NASA could put together a mission to simultaneously send *two* space shuttles out past the moon to blow up an asteroid ""the size of Texas"" with one nuclear warhead (okay...they sent two, but only one was expected to be needed and, in the end, actually used) with only 18 days to work with, from the first moment they even realized they had a problem, to the end of the mission.  Come on...these are the guys who need a couple of years of planning to send one shuttle into earth orbit!  That's why we have four shuttles... so they can be rehearsing three, while one is actually putting on the show.<br/><br/>Maybe I would've enjoyed the movie more if it hadn't been so predictable. But, not once in the entire movie did anything surprise me...from the deaths of the peripheral characters, to the time-worn use of countdowns reaching their final seconds before success is achieved.  My God, they even had a ""which wire should I cut to defuse the bomb?"" scene!  I thought we put that to rest in the Lethal Weapon series.  This is supposed to create suspense? The group I was with formed a quick pool to guess what the timer would reach when they finally shut the detonator down (""what do you think?...less than a second left?  2.4 seconds?  more than 5???"").  But was there ever any doubt that they'd defuse it?  No...not really.<br/><br/>And I'm not even going to go into the physically-impossible special effects. I'll leave that to the people who went home after the movie and worked out the actual gee-forces that would be involved in the slingshot maneuver around the moon.  I'll just say to any director out there...please...just once in a science-fiction movie, don't let a space ship swoop and dive around asteroids, like some high-tech Piper Cub.  Space shuttles have wings so they can land, once they return to Earth...other than that, they have no use, because there is no air in space!<br/><br/>Okay...mama always told me, if you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything.  So, on the plus side for Armageddon was Steve Buscemi's comic relief.  He actually looked like some schmuck who was pulled off the street and asked ""wanna go up into outer space?"" and had the time of his life doing it.  Liv Tyler was cute as the lone female voice in the Boys' Club.  I'm more impressed with her acting every time I see her in a new movie.  I hope she gets a shot at some truly dramatic roles someday soon, to see what she can do with them.  Bruce Willis played the same character he's played in every other successful movie he's ever done, and he does it well.  But, other than those, the other characters were derivative and predictable.<br/><br/>I just didn't see what all the fuss was about.  They could've done this as a remake of John Wayne's Hellfighters, saved about a gazillion dollars on useless special effects, and *really* turned a profit.  Or...maybe ""Hellfighters In Space"" was what they were going for in the first place.  If so, they tried a little too hard."

Spaceships which are basically immune to meteors and debris, survivors of a 22000 MPH crash, gravity and atmosphere that shouldn't exist -- all these things jump out at me as preposterous and destroy the illusion.  Just take something with which you are very familiar and imagine a movie where it is totally misrepresented and tell me that it wouldn't bother you.  For example, imagine a movie in which a car is stranded in the desert and the hero cannot figure out how to start it again. Then s/he solves the problem by squeezing sand to produce water which s/he puts in the tank and the car is drivable again.  If you could come out of that movie and say that you didn't feel cheated on the solution to the problem, then you amaze me.  I find this a frequent problem in many stories/screenplays.

","Crap. This film has been handed everything it needs to be a great film on a platter, cast (including Billy Bob Thornton, Will Patton, Peter Stormare, and the worlds greatest actor, Steve Buscemi), budget (it, however doesn't make a movie good, it only helps), even a talented crew, yet they couldn't figure out how to make a good film. The love story subplot seems to be tacked on in the wake of the success of Titanic, because of the fact that whiny Liv Tyler's character only cares about her father when they're going to blow up the asteroid. I end by saying this film is, you guessed it, crap."

","This movie was made up of a million or so 2 second edits.  It becomes apparent that the story is just too goofy and they need the confusing machine gun style delivery to make up for charging full admission! Bruce Willis is the owner/operator of an offshore drilling rig.  He is called upon by Uncle Sam to ride the space shuttle and land on a meteor headed for earth. It seems this meteor will destroy the planet unless somebody can drill a hole 800 feet deep and plant a nuke that should blow it up.  Will he do it? I'm not really sure, I walked out after 2 hours... it musta been almost over though, the music was cresending and everybody was high fivin'!"
