"imaginarytruths","5","289","438","10 August 2006"," Good intentions and some powerful moments but overall a disappointment
","I honestly didn't think it was very good at all, though I respect the intentions of the filmmakers. Whatever one wants to say about Oliver Stone, he showed a commitment to faithfully telling the story of these two Port Authority cops trapped in the wreckage of the World Trade Center and their worried wives.<br/><br/>I liked a lot of the scenes in the beginning, the little mundane details like when Michael Pena's character is going about his everyday street beat. But the scenes at the WTC itself are really awkward, especially the cross-cutting between real footage and the actors. They just don't match, neither the film stocks nor the actors' reactions. A couple of moments with Pena standing there on the concourse were effective in creating a sense of horrific surrealism, and the moments right before the collapse were sudden and chilling...but overall it was not as powerful as I was expecting. For a film called World Trade Center, I guess I was expecting a little more context and not something focused so narrowly on these two Port Authority cops and an ex-Marine from Connecticut (as the only person outside these two cops' families whose story is told in the film, the focus on him reeks of jingoism in a GI Joe/Rambo vein). <br/><br/>I know it's a little unfair to compare this to United 93, but I need to in order to illustrate the point. U93 told a specific story (the experience of the passengers on the plane) and placed it within a context (what was happening with air traffic control and the military). The lessons that are demonstrated in the actions of the passengers are enhanced by contrasting them with the helplessness of the ""professionals"" responsible for their safety. It's telling a dramatically powerful story, conveying a theme , AND providing a larger historical context of what happened that day. Oliver Stone, by comparison, has failed to effectively tie the experiences of these two trapped cops with the larger events of the day, and his film suffers as a result. And in the end the film largely shortchanges the stories of the 2749 families who didn't get good news that day. <br/><br/>OK, so the film focuses on a narrow story of these two trapped cops and their families (and the gung ho marine, but he has limited screen time). Was their story well told? The scenes amidst the wreckage were compelling, but the back-and-forth with their wives became annoyingly schmaltzy. Yes, Maggie Gyllenhaal gave a strong performance as the pregnant wife and a lot of the moments with her family (esp the brief scene with the Colombian mother-in-law praying) were emotionally poignant, but so much of the family stuff was lame melodrama. And to be honest, even Maggie's performance was a little generic. I understand that these characters are all closely based on real life, but it still felt very Lifetime movie of the week. As for Maria Bello in the role of the other wife, I loved her in A History of Violence, but she was bland in this. The kid actors playing her children were mostly awful, and the film dragged whenever their story was on the screen. The resolution is mostly handled well, I really like what Oliver Stone is trying to convey about these small gestures of heroic goodness in the face of such desolation. But the power of these scenes is undermined by his tendency to pour on the sappiness while largely ignoring the greater horror of the day. It feels like a soap opera set against the greatest tragedy of our age, and that just doesn't work for me.<br/><br/>In short...not intense enough, not enough context, too much melodrama, not enough of a sense of reverence for what happened, highly impressive job of recreating the debris field, a charismatic performance from Maggie, overall a mediocre film."
"hugodinwitty","1","470","824","12 August 2006"," A classless play on emotions
","I know that many people who don't like this movie say so just because they thought it was made at an inappropriate time. Personally, I hated this movie on its own merit as poor film-making. It seems that Oliver Stone just decided he wanted to make a movie, any movie, about 9/11, and didn't care about the content of the movie. The end result was a movie of such pitiful quality that one could go though the script and replace the term ""police officer"" with ""miner"" and ""World Trade Center"" with ""a coal mine"" and the entire script would work perfectly as a cave-in disaster movie. It's that generic. Stone tries to carry the movie just by showing how sad the families were and how scared the policemen were, meanwhile allowing the audience no interesting plot points to hold on to, nor any significance to the tragedy. In the end, I have to conclude that Oliver Stone just wanted to get some cheap emotional reactions from the crowd, because at one point the movie says that it is about the potential for good in humanity and how strong we can be in the face of adversity. Stone quickly forgets this, because only about 15% of the movie even shows people coming together to help one another. The other 85% of the movie is spent watching the families argue or seeing flashbacks to their happy memories, which is a good way to get audience reaction but hardly lends any significance or depth to the plot. I don't in any way want to belittle the pain that these families had to endure, which is why I am disappointed that that pain was exploited to make a bad movie. September 11 was the most important and tragic event in my lifetime, and I think it deserves more respect than to be made into a generic, poorly-written disaster movie less than five years after it happened."
"jmoney-2","9","270","466","26 July 2006"," A life-affirming movie about courage
","It's a little known story from a day we know all too well. ""World Trade Center"" tells the gripping true story of two of the last men pulled out of the rubble of Ground Zero alive.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena play Port Authority Police officers. In the film's heart- pounding opening minutes, we watch the attack unfold through the eyes of these first responders. As the routine morning becomes anything but routine, the officers glimpse news reports (we are thankfully spared any images of the plane striking the towers) and get bits of information from cellphone calls to family members as they race downtown. But what's most striking is how little the men know about what's really happening. As the officers prepare to the climb the North Tower, they are unaware the South Tower has even been hit. Communications gear is failing, and there is confusion all around.<br/><br/>Through impeccably detailed sets and flawless special effects, director Oliver Stone and his film-making team recreate these hectic moments in all-too-realistic detail. You're right there, on the street, looking up and watching the chaos unfold in 35mm and THX surround sound. If you didn't know any better, you'd think Stone had a crew shooting in Lower Manhattan that day. You have to struggle to remind yourself everything you're seeing was recreated on a sound stage on inside a computer.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Andrea Berloff further enhances the realism with believable dialog. She not only effectively captures the ""cop talk"" (half the time, there's so much lingo being bantered back and forth, you don't understand what the heck the characters are saying -- as it should be), she also delivers a truth and honesty to the conversations and interactions. The words never feel contrived.<br/><br/>The quality cast does the script justice. It's remarkable how well Cage, a major movie star, disappears behind the mustache and hunched shoulders of Sgt. John McLoughlin. Pena (last seen as the locksmith in ""Crash"") is instantly likable as Ofc. Jimeno. Their performances are even more noteworthy considering they spend the majority of the movie flat on their backs. They are also well supported by Maria Bello and Magie Gyllenhaal as their respective wives, who spend much of the film enduring an agonizing wait to learn the fate of their husbands.<br/><br/>Stone's storytelling is also more methodical and straightforward than it's been in recent years. He mercifully ditches the frenetic editing style he's employed in films like Natural Born Killers and Any Given Sunday.<br/><br/>***Not Political***<br/><br/>When one hears that Oliver Stone, director of such politically charged films as JFK and Born on the Fourth Of July, is making a movie about 9/11, your first tendency is to say, ""uh oh."" But this may be the least political movie Stone has ever made, one both red states and blue states can agree on. It's not about the roots of terror, or who's to blame for what. It's not about villains. It's about heroes. Though set during one of America's darkest hours, it tells a life-affirming story of courage, love and the strength people can summon inside. The movie reminds us how we all felt that day, how we all came together. Some say it is too soon for a movie like this. But as our nation sits so sharply divided, it's not a minute too soon to remember the unity of purpose we all had on 9/11 and ponder whether we can ever get it back."
"anhedonia","5","131","220","2 September 2006"," National tragedy as formula storytelling
","Something surprising happened while watching Oliver Stone's ""World Trade Center"" - I realized how much more I appreciated Paul Greengrass' ""United 93."" Greengrass' film was lean, stripped of any backstory for any of the characters. Very simply, it told what happened that horrible day on the plane - though he used some license - and didn't wallow in needless sentimentality.<br/><br/>Stone, on the other hand and rather surprisingly, seems to have gone out of his way to make something that would be so palatable and inoffensive that it would turn out rather bland, above anything else.<br/><br/>The 45 minutes of ""World Trade Center"" are terrific. After offering us quick glimpses into the lives of Port Authority cops John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena), Andrea Berloff's script gets us right into the attacks on the Twin Towers.<br/><br/>The crumbling of the towers, which still is incredibly difficult to watch, let alone fathom, is handled with taste, but also is awfully gripping. We get a real sense of the terror and panic and then Stone gets the claustrophobic atmosphere right. With close-ups of Pena and Cage amidst the ruins, he gets us so close, we can almost taste the rubble and concrete dust.<br/><br/>But that's the last time we really see or feel any sense of genuine, gripping storytelling in this film. I realize criticizing a film about 9/11, especially one that displays its American stars and stripes so blatantly, is tantamount to treason these days. After all, as this administration and its minions love to point out, if you disagree with them, you're not only unpatriotic, but also an appeaser of the villains. It's poppycock, of course. Dissent is undoubtedly American, but these chaps so love draping themselves in the flag that jingoism overwhelms all reason. Why bother with rational thought when you can scare people?<br/><br/>What struck me while watching the film is realizing how much goodwill was channeled toward the United States after the attacks and what's ultimately sad is how this president took all that goodwill and squandered it by launching an utterly pointless war in Iraq. We could have done so much good in the world, instead of now being one of the most hated nations in the world. And Bush has now turned 9/11 into a political slogan for political (and personal) gain.<br/><br/>The problem with Stone's film isn't so much the story, but how Berloff chose to tell it. According to Berloff, cops, rescue workers, even family members tend to enjoy speaking in exposition. There are moments that surely someone of Stone's calibre should have realized needed to be rewritten because the dialogue seems mediocre at best.<br/><br/>Where the film suffers is when the story cuts between the two trapped men and their families, especially their wives. Maria Bello as Donna McLoughlin and the always wonderful Maggie Gyllenhaal as Allison Jimeno never get much to do with their sorely underwritten roles. It's a true testament to Gyllenhaal's talent that she turns a rather sour role into a passionate, moving performance. Poor Bello, on the other hand, isn't that fortunate. She's relegated to spending more time than she should weeping.<br/><br/>The trouble with these scenes is not that Berloff tries to wring some emotion out of them, but that they come off as unabashedly sentimental. And the emotions are entirely unearned.<br/><br/>Pena proves, just as he did in ""Crash"" (2005), that he's able to be something special on screen. His character is far more engaging than Cage's; Pena's emotions come off without any artifice.<br/><br/>I can't help but feel that ""World Trade Center"" could have been the gut-wrenching experience Stone intended it to be had he and Berloff approached the story much in the way Greengrass did ""United 93."" Stone's movie is far from lean. It's padded with needless sentimentality and moments that just try so hard to earn some emotion, any emotion, that they come off as utterly false. And that's unfair to the people whose story is being chronicled here.<br/><br/>Watching Cage and Pena trapped should be gripping stuff. But even their dialogue is reduced to exposition. And when Berloff finally leaves the two men and their families, we get Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon), a man so moved by what he saw that he came down to the Twin Towers and proved to be McLoughlin and Jimeno's miracle. We all know Karnes is a real person, but I very much doubt that he speaks in bumper stickers. But that's exactly what Berloff has him do.<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes of the movie showed what Stone truly is capable of doing. The rest is rather tepid. And unbelievably forced. Who knew that Oliver Stone, of all people, would resort to formulaic storytelling. Perhaps he's been so stung by conspiracy accusations and was so keen on appeasing his critics and forgetting the execrable ""Alexander"" (2004) that he opted to make the kind of movie Ron Howard would make. That's not a compliment."
"ccrivelli2005","8","54","87","10 September 2006"," Stone Salutes
","Oliver Stone salutes the ordinary heroes of this extraordinary circumstances. He puts himself way behind their stories, so far behind in fact that he is almost imperceptible. In Italy, the academics, snobs and other fauna dismissed it as rhetoric and banal. I have the words of the laid back ""opinionist"" Barbara Pallombelli accusing Stone of ""inventing"" How silly really. The ignorance between the cultures seems insurmountable sometimes. The story was told by the two men under the rubble and their families. They were working people, not professional ""opinionists"". They will hum the theme from Startsky and Hutch to keep themselves alive. I wonder what pseudo intellectual would have done.The film is a gripping depiction centered mostly on two men and their families. The event caused a catastrophe that is still growing, based mostly in personal interest and massive inter cultural ignorance. The film is not about that. The film is about the tiniest enormity of the domestic drama. I wept and longed for a private happy ending. The rest, well the rest is still part of our daily existence. Most of the detractors accuse World Trade Center of not being an Oliver Stone film, if he had done a classic Oliver Stone film he would have been accused of that. Stone will be controversial even for standing still. My hat to you Mr Stone, please keep going your own way."

","I knew this was going to be utter hail America bull even before watching it. We have a club of 10 people, who regularly attend the theaters and watch random movies. Believe me, if I had a choice, I would have never had any interest in watching this. But anyway, as I predicted, well as we all predicted, actually, we were bored through the whole film. Except for those moments where we along with the rest of the theater were laughing at especially the marine and the other cheesy moments in this disaster of a film. When it was finally over, people just stood outside laughing at how bad the film was and talking about this marine, who wanted to dig through tons of rubble with his super fantastic American marine knife!! ""Don't worry, I won't leave you! I'm a marine!"" Yes! He actually says that! And then we are told, that he goes to Iraq for 2 years to get revenge. I ask then, was he one of those enraged psychos who raped Iraqi women and murdered their families down there then ? And what has Iraq to do with WTC ? What a joke.<br/><br/>What an insult to the people who died or had friends or family members who died at this terrible tragedy. I will never see a Nicholas Cage film again nor an Olive Stone one. What maniac thought up the lines of that marine ? I'm baffled.<br/><br/>1/10."

","Im just after pulling myself away from the TV and that awful movie, World Trade Center, to write this review.<br/><br/>Now. This is like watching a snuff movie. It depicts the events that happened on September 11th,2001 and we all remember so vividly because it was only a few years ago.<br/><br/>Most of the time you're watching Nicholas Cage screaming in pain. and when you're not watching that you're watching another guy scream in pain.<br/><br/>Shall I go on? It's badly edited, although well made, but who cares. It's not entertaining or thought-provoking or funny. It doesn't spark any debate. World Trade Center is just a very bland, uninspiring piece of film making."
"JamesD249","1","113","202","13 August 2006"," This was awful
","This is the first movie I've ever got up during the showing at a theatre and walked out. Yeah I know some people are going to panic and whine that I'm a horrible person for not liking the World Trade Center movie, but this was just annoying. The previews show a bright, outdoors thing with lots of police and firefighters and such, when in reality most of the film is just two guys trapped in the dark, in the rubble, talking in strained voices about their family, while their family acts upset at home. Don't get me wrong, I respect the event, but the importance of a historical event doesn't mean everyone should go see a poorly done movie about it. So in conclusion, the film is very repetitive, constant poor lighting and typically unchanging scenery make it unpleasant to watch for a long time, and it was very hard to connect with the characters."

"ShowMeTheCredits","1","25","39","5 November 2007"," Amazingly uninspired
","With a tragedy as large as this, and a bucket-of-possible-plots as filled as this, it's quite disturbing to see Oliver Stone hit his low-point of his entire career on this exact project.<br/><br/>With a mere fifth of the runtime away, we have our heroes in distress, with little to no character buildup been done to carry us through the last four-fifths of cinematic pain with any kind of relation to the characters put on the screen.<br/><br/>It's as if the story is so well-known that the script writer sees no point in drawing out the basics, which is perfectly understandable as you'd have to be literally dead to not know a heck of a lot about 9/11, and that counts for Americans and Eskimos alike. What is disturbing is that it sees no point in drawing out a story for us in which we get to know the characters on screen, either. The entire runtime seems to be wasted on emotional porn of such low quality that you start to wish for the people on screen to die soon so that the end credits will come and rescue you. You don't know who they are, what they're like, who they know, not even what their names are, and yet you've been staring at them for hours. The only thing letting you know that they're ""the good guys"" is the ever-present string ensemble playing fiddle for them all along.<br/><br/>This movie presents no story, no character buildup, no suspense, no action sequences (expecting to see the towers fall in state-of-the-art CGI wonder? Forget it, what you get are the shadow of a plane on the ground, and the sound of tower 2 falling, plus some rubble, that's it), no nothing, really.<br/><br/>This movie is so superficial it's impossible to say what it really wants to say, if anything. The problem is, it says nothing, and it takes more than two hours of it to accomplish that."
"kyle-florence","7","129","236","13 August 2006"," A surprisingly good film
","I went into this film without expectations. I saw Flight 93 and enjoyed it and I am very interested in all events surrounding September 11th, so this film appealed to me. Now, I must say that I am not an Oliver Stone fan, however, upon hearing this movie was nothing like an Oliver Stone film I decided to check it out.<br/><br/>The storyline for the film, as stated, was based on the stories of a few Port Authority police who survived the collapse of the building while being trapped for hours in the rubble. At the beginning we are introduced to each of the characters and their families. It's enough to get us involved with each of them but leaves enough room to elaborate as the film unfolds. The film moves rather nicely without going too fast or slow. The vast amount of the film takes place after the towers collapse while the men are trapped in the rubble. The story is told through the trapped police officers current situation as well as what their families are going through at the same time.<br/><br/>I felt this story to be very natural and not Hollywood-ized, something I had been worried would happen. All the events seemed plausible, they didn't throw anything in for added drama. All of the characters were completely believable and you ended up loving all of them by the end. I will caution you though, there are some intense scenes in this movie so if you are unable to deal with some of the events from that day you may not want to see the film.<br/><br/>The cinematography and sound really aided this film. All of the filming was crisp and clean, the special effects were great and you could hardly tell this had been filmed after the towers were gone (the shots containing the towers that is). There were some great scenes from life in new york; shots of the skyline and the subway as well as some breathtaking aerials. The sound was spot on, you could feel the building collapse as the scenes unfolded on the screen. It was a great job all around.<br/><br/>Overall I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was, it lived up to Flight 93, although it has an entirely different feel to it. This film is not ground-breaking work, but it wasn't meant to be. It was meant to tell the story of a few brave men and their families and their experiences during September 11th, and it accomplished this very well."
"jhf3488","2","282","541","15 August 2006"," Shadows the truth of the day.
","Before you brush this review off as someone that is just looking to cause problems or badmouth a movie let me give you my background. I live in NJ less than 5 minutes from the city. My family is heavily in twined in the Port Authority of NY/NJ. My grandfather is a retired Lieutenant and my uncle has been a PAPD officer for 12 years and I have both friends and family that worked in the world trade center in the PA executive offices.<br/><br/>The movie itself concentrates on two PAPD officers, Will and John. It follows their ordeal up to the point of rescue. OK. Seems good. But what about the 2700+ people that were lost on that terrible day. The writers spent too much time basing the movie on two men and their ""story of triumph"" that the true events of the day were left in the shadows.<br/><br/>There were times during the movie that I almost forgot what I was watching because it seemed like these were the only two men (along with their families) affected by the tragedy. The ordeal seemed no different than that experienced by the miners that were rescued in pennsylvania several years back. There was no rescue of other people even mentioned until the ending credits, at which time they finally acknowledged that people were actually lost.<br/><br/>The movie gives the impression that September 11th and the days following was an uplifting experience because two men were found alive. It fails to document all that was lost and never recovered. If a movie must be made about such a tragedy then the movie should show it like it is. There should be no dramatic rescue with uplifting music. The day was terrible, the events were terrible, and the story was terrible. Lets not make the worst day in our country's history into an uplifting ""happy ending"" version of titanic.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie there were 3 mentions of lost people other than the main characters. The first of an unnamed elevator operator, the second was a quick clip of ""missing person"" posters, and the final was the ending credits that gave the true numbers. Those three scenes are what September 11th was. It was not a love story. It was not a triumph. And more than anything it was not material for a Hollywood movie."

","This movie brings nothing new. The only reason why people are going to watch disaster-movie nr 911 is because it stars the twin towers.<br/><br/>It's a sad way of making some dough out of this (film-wise) uninteresting event.<br/><br/>A couple of thousand people dieing is (how sad as it may be on a personal level) no unique happening; how many people die in Dafur, Ethiopia every month? Yet, I see no movie about that! There is probably more money to make with Americans dieing than with Africans starving.<br/><br/>More interesting would have been a movie that deals with the ""why?"" question... Why does the US draw so-much aggression? If you are looking for answers to that question you will have to look elsewhere; not to be found in this movie.<br/><br/>Mr. Stone misses a golden opportunity here. He has taken a milestone in geo-politics and could come up with nothing more than a combination of a ""run of the mill"" disaster movie and a tearjerker."

I remember watching the TV, glued to it, for answers to the questions that I never will have answered as to how something so horrible could happen. This film doesn't attempt to try to answer that question, instead it looks at the spirit of people and how we can come together to help others.<br/><br/>I am so glad I went to see this! It is a powerful work of film that tells the story without sensationalizing the event and the anger and hatred for the attackers following the attacks.

"LAKERS34","9","100","187","11 August 2006"," Straightforward Approach Works for Stone
","There will of course inevitably be films made about 9-11 and they will no doubt take many different approaches in telling their stories. This film, the second major effort at depicting the 9-11 attacks, approaches the story head-on, literally from Ground Zero, from the viewpoint of some of those most directly involved in the incident: Rescue Workers. The fact that this film was directed by Oliver Stone was/is a surprise. The film is benign in the sense that it does not postulate about what happened that day and why, which is not your typical Stone movie. Instead, it takes its time telling an intimate story about a group of Rescue Workers caught up in the collapse of the World Trade Center towers and their battle to survive/escape an unimaginable hell.<br/><br/>The film works because Stone takes the time to flush out his characters; we genuinely care about these people and feel their emotions as things turned from bad to worse that day. Cage, Bello, Pena, et.al. play their roles effectively, making us aware that 9-11 affected ""ordinary people"" and caused them to perform in an extraordinary way.<br/><br/>All in all, an excellent film. While it is big-budgeted and full of big names, it simply tells one of MANY stories to be told on that day effectively and faithfully. As with United 93, I would recommend bringing Kleenex."

This film represents the low point of an otherwise interesting and often laudable career as a film maker.<br/><br/>And apart from all the above, even if you take issue with the politics I refer to, I defy you say that this is not the most boring two hours you've ever endured in a cinema."

","I'm absolutely disappointed with this film. When you are about to see a film of this magnitude, you expect to see something that can touch your heart, and make you feel. The only thing that I fell with this movie was boredom. OK, yes... I'm from Argentina and I don't lived with my own flesh and blood the S-11, so I can't know how it feels for the Americans. I totally agree. And there's where the film fails! Oliver Stone directed the film for Americans, not for outsiders. There's no great FXs, and the script and the history it's completely boring for those who not live on the US. (Honestly, I don't know where'd go all those millions that cost this movie.)<br/><br/>The characters -and specially the marine- are crude imitations: They don't make you feel the pain, the despair, the fury, the hopeless and the grief that America lived in S-11 (unless, obviously, that you lived it).<br/><br/>And in my humble opinion, all the fault falls down on Oliver Stone. He failed on every key matter of the film."

","If you liked this movie, you might be a redneck. Leave it up to the citizens of an oblivious, myopic, imperialist country like ours to love a movie that ""redeems"" the events of September 11. Leave it up to such citizens to like a movie because it does NOT make a political comment, or any other kind of comment, and is, instead, a story of courage and the ""triumph"" of the ""human spirit."" How very refreshing. It all reminds me of the sarcastic musings of a Beckett character, who says that before he dies, he hopes to become more able to find ""the good in the bad, the bad in the worse."" People, if we're always finding the mote of hope in the sea of tragedy, then why should we consider ANYTHING a tragedy? The reactions most people have to this movie are a symptom of a disease--and they are a hint that September 11 has basically changed nothing about the way we think about the world. They are a sign that ""it"" will probably happen AGAIN. So--go watch this flick, crunch your popcorn, shed a few sappy tears, then get back into your Hummer, fill up with 70 bucks of gas, run over a few homeless people (why can't they just get a job?!), and continue about your day."

","Awful ""docudrama"" concerning 2 cops who get buried under tons of rubble on 9-11. How dare Oliver Stone- who was quoted as saying America had it coming- make a movie to exploit this tragedy. Has America become so desensitized to the violence of the real world that we make films to exploit tragedies for the sake of entertainment? This and the earlier Flight 93 were the first- and hopefully the last films to capitalize on this tragedy. They died early deaths at the box office and it is easy to see why. As far as WTC is concerned, it does feature an average performance from Cage, and the rest of the no-name cast simply functions as a prop to support the paper thin screenplay. Needless to say, it is chock full of errors and anachronisms, but it is an Oliver Stone film, right? Beyond bad, this film is a slap in the face and an insult to anyone who either survived or died on 9-11. Exploitative garbage, pure and simple.Zero stars."

","Normally, I am not a fan of Oliver Stone, having only slightly liked a few of his films. I also know about his penchant for conspiracy-spouting in his films, and I took that with me into the film. What I saw, however, was a truly inspirational, realistic, and gritty film that left me in awe of the two brave men depicted in the film, and how the extraordinary events of a day that will forever be in our memories affected even the most normal of people. I have also seen United 93, which was an incredibly realistic and powerful film. Thankfully for myself and every other viewer of World Trade Center, Mr. Stone left his conspiracy soapbox at home, and presented another film about 9/11 in the same vein as that earlier film. It doesn't present anyone as a hero--just a bunch of ordinary people caught up in one of the worst losses of life in our nation's history. However, by the end of the film, you learn that there is a hero in all people, and that when called upon by circumstances, everyday people can become truer superheroes than any comic book character ever was. I highly recommend this film to everyone, though its more graphic sequences may be unsuitable for younger viewers (under 13). In fact, I think both this and United 93 should be required viewing for anyone who wants to understand why this--like Pearl Harbor for my grandparents and JFK's assassination for my parents--is the day my generation will remember exactly where each one of them was when it happened. For those who died, we can not--should not--ever forget."

","The horrifying destiny of thousands of ordinary people and hundreds of servicemen and rescue workers on 911 is certainly worth making a disaster movie, but this film is dull and boring in its essence. First of all, for 60 minutes we watch two guys being trapped under the rubble of WTC tower fighting to stay alive. Not much of a plot. We hear people talking in abbreviations, we see flashbacks from their everyday lives, we see their families shattered by uncertainty and suspense, we hear them rant about cheesy stuff that would make any other movie, not this delicate, pathetic and a complete washout. What we don't see is an insight on these dramatic events themselves. I can't criticize this film from an artistic point of view, but rather from a political one. As we hear a number of explosions inside the WTC, the tagline should read: The world saw evil that day. Millions of people saw an inside job.<br/><br/>There's this dull character, Marines staff sergeant Karnes, a big bully-like hunk, with the IQ of a mongoose and a mindset of a thoughtless pawn, who is determined on finding the survivors and pulling them out. He even takes a haircut for this occasion. As he sets an example of what good, heroic and obeying citizen should look like. In the end he says US will need lot of good men to avenge this. The end credits show that he served two tours of duty in Iraq, which means ""let's avenge this on the first country that comes along"". Or the one Mr. Bushy points at. When we hear media anchors in the movie rant about the attacks from all over, one can't help but to compare these descriptions to what US is doing to other countries on a regular basis. They also have no respect for human lives, they also bomb civilians, they also use terror as the mean to an end, and then they stage a false-flag attack so they could bomb even more countries under the excuse of war on terror. Here we have a subtle message that US should avenge their dead, but when the others do that, it's called terrorism. Why hundreds of thousands of people had to die in Iraq? Just because Uncle Sam yearned to avenge the events so suspicious that even their own brainwashed fellow citizens find them hard to believe? Why did they bomb Serbia, which also fought Muslim terrorists within its own borders, under the excuse of humanitarian disaster, when alleged 100.000 refugees in Kosovo were nothing compared to the millions right now in Iraq? Not to mention the body count. Double standards for the privileged world power we all should feel sorry for. Poor little Americans.

Why not just take a risk as a filmmaker and human being to bring forth the truth about 9/11 rather than subscribe to the flag-waving? Loving your country means accepting that it's not always going to be on the side of right and having the courage to help change it anyway you can. To some people, the extent of their cultural influence is their measly vote. In Oliver Stone's case, he reaches millions of eyes with his movies, yet he chooses to make pandering pieces of feces like this.<br/><br/>Go back to making movies about dead rock stars if this is the best you can do, Oliver."

Technically the views, shots and also sound did not appear to be of the quality I expected such a movie to be. It appeared to me that this movie was made fast, with a tight budget.

","When I first heard of this movie being made, I had so many debates about this film, I almost hated Oliver Stone, after all, we just had only the 5 year anniversary of 9/11. I thought he was going to make some action movie of a horrifying and nightmarish event that is still fresh in most of our memories. So, I refused to see this film, but a girl at my work told me that it wasn't like what we both expected at all and that it was a great film. So, my friend and I decided to see it, I have to say that it was beautifully done and showed great respect for that horrible day.<br/><br/>Gratefully and I must thank Oliver Stone, he didn't reenact or computerize the planes crashing into the towers, this movie just focused mainly on the policemen and firemen who gave their lives that day and to two strong and brave policemen who ended up in the most brutal and hellish nightmare, being trapped and buried alive under tons and tons of what was a 110 story building. Their struggle was so brutal to watch, but it kept your hopes and strength alive. 95% of the world only witnessed what happened on the outside, finally, this movie showed us what it was like to be in New York and what the firemen and policemen went through, along with their families.<br/><br/>I have to say that it was so mentally disturbing though to see the towers in the beginning of the film, I actually started sobbing, because it's still to this day unbelievable that they're just not there. But still, it was pictured perfectly and beautifully done, I loved that they showed how much of a normal day it was for all of us before the plane hit the first tower.<br/><br/>It's a beautifully acted and hopeful film that will make you remember that that day not only showed the worst evil in people, but it brought out some of the best and heroic acts anyone has ever witnessed. RIP to those 2800 people who lost their lives that day, you will never be forgotten. And on a special note, thank you to the firemen and policemen who fought, survived, and died on that tragic day, you may have done your job, but it was the most heroic thing anyone could have done, they saved more lives than we realized.

"mstomaso","7","22","39","23 August 2006"," Surprising in many respects *MILD SPOILER*
","There seems to be a great deal of confusion in the varied interpretations presented here on IMDb about what this movie attempts to depict. This is not about 9/11, nor is it about heroism, nor is it about terrorism, nor politics. This is, remarkably, a very simple story about survival, the will to live, and the responsibility that goes along with being human. There are a number of nuanced sub-themes (all of those listed above) as well, and the most important of these, from my unique perspective (and I welcome contrary opinions as opposed to labeling them WRONG), is the power of love.<br/><br/>What we are given by a refreshingly invisible Oliver Stone in WTC is a story based on objective facts in the lives of two men who remained trapped in the World Trade Center debris for longer than anybody else. The story remains faithful to most of this story, though the Marine who refused to give up on finding survivors was ethnically miscast. Concerns about poetic license aside, the film takes a subject which could have easily fallen into the abyss of exploitation or the minefield of political commentary Stone sometimes flirts with, but instead, WTC tells the story from an appropriate perspective - that of the men themselves, their families, and those attempting to cope with their apparent loss. This is a film which, if mishandled, could have been boring, offensive and pathetic. It is none of those things, though it is also likely to annoy a lot of people who enter the theater with misbegotten expectations.<br/><br/>I believe Stone accomplished what he set out to do. I believe Michael Pena was wonderful, and Nicholas Cage, Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal were all very good. And, though his skin color was not historically accurate (and I wonder about the racialism that makes this seem to matter a great deal to some people), I enjoyed Michael Shannon's brief but crucial performance. Moreover, I applaud Stone for doing something many people didn't think he could pull off - making a film without leaving his own ideological signature everywhere in it.<br/><br/>Now - back to love. WTC is not a love story. But love permeates its substratum. The love between the two victims whose predicament becomes ours throughout the course of the film; the love within their families; the love of Americans for each other; and the love of a hero for the deity which inspires him. If there is any particular message I took away from WTC, it is that love is often fleeting, always strong, and always in need of maintenance, but that more than any force in the world - religion, politics, or even war and hate - it can help save us all.<br/><br/>Set against the backdrop of an American cataclysm which has, at least in some people's historical imagination, outweighed the Great Depression, the bombing of Hiroshima and Pearl Harbor, the hope this movie promotes - and the reminder of that feeling of desperate hope so many of us felt after the day this all really happened - is well worth the price of admission. In this way - while the film really does not treat 9/11 as its major subject - it does capture the spirit and feeling of that fateful day quite wonderfully."

","Some people have commented that this movie didn't accurately depict 9/11 and have complained that Oliver Stone didn't portray the events or that he milked us for emotion.<br/><br/>I disagree. I watched Michael Pena and Nicolas Cage depict two PAPD officers - Ofc. Jimeno and Sgt. McClauglin but I couldn't help but picture every officer or person involved directly in the horror of that day. There are plenty of documentaries on the subject...and every year on 9/11, they give you a blow-by-blow of the events. This was a movie, that showed what two men - and what their friends/family/departments went through and I thought of and felt for everyone through their story.<br/><br/>From what I've read...and from the commentaries in the film, it is factual for their story and I think it's just a coincidence that it just HAPPENED to be good enough for a Hollywood story.

","Sentimental, self righteous and dull. It failed to address any of the myriad issues that could have been explored. Instead, we get cheesy apparitions of Christ and macho chest bangers who dissolve quickly to tears, all driven by an overload of emotion. It was clichéd beyond belief and a sadly missed opportunity. Ultimately, it did a disservice to the heroes of that horrendous event. Some of the early morning city-scape scenes were interesting. The special effects were unnoticeable, the way it should be. This presentation of reality gave the film the authenticity it was looking for. Nick Cage was underwhelming in World Trade Center. Among his many excellent works: Weatherman, Lord of War, Matchstick Men, Adaptation, this must be low point for him as it was for this Cage fan. The supporting actors were a partial salvation to the generally awful film-making. I think Oliver Stone is gradually revealing himself to be overrated. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, particularly if you're an American; For a start, it insults your intelligence and your sensitivity but, more significantly, it makes a mockery of your identity and your history.

What life lesson was I supposed to gain from this?"" 3) Are you under the age of eight? 4) Do people often repeat things to you, without you prompting them to do so, because of the vacant look in your soulless eyes? 5) Do people often repeat things to you, without you prompting them to do so, because of the vacant look in your soulless eyes? If you have answered yes to any of the above questions, then, by all means, run, don't walk to see this ""important"" film. Then, punch yourself in the genitals for the next two hours.<br/><br/>The first twenty minutes of the flick is build up to when (spoiler alert) the towers come down, trapping our heroes in the rubble. It is chocked full of impending disaster; A quiet city-scape where all you hear is a plane in the sky, people telling each other to be careful, TONS of long, hard stares. And, I was unaware of this, but apparently, Police officers, Port Authority and Firemen only speak in exposition. They don't have conversations like normal humans. They deal only in information that is unseen by the camera. There is a scene with the Port Authority workers on a bus, and it sounds like an office water cooler conversation. ""I heard that this happened!"" ""Well, I heard this!"" ""Hey Guys! My wife just said that she heard on the radio, blah, blah, blah."" I've heard that, in cinema, it is better to show than to tell. But that's just what I've heard.<br/><br/>So after the towers fall and our heroes are trapped, there are a few very intense scenes (including a cameo by Jesus, looking like an Ipod advertisement), but unfortunately, most of their story is a series of conversations that David Mammet would call ""I once had a kitten"" stories. These are tales that give you a little background and build sympathy for the character. Because who would be sympathetic towards two guys buried under twenty feet of rubble, unless you knew about their problematic family life? Now I know that this is a true story, and that these conversations probably took place, but does it make for a good film? Not to me.<br/><br/>In the end, when (spoiler alert) Nick Cage is finally pulled out to the surface, we hear him saying ""thank you"" over and over again to all the people helping him. And this is Oliver Stones way of saluting those that were there. Come on Oliver. If you want to honor the fallen, then lets kick that conspiracy-loving brain of yours into high gear and look at what our government has done in response to and/or leading up to 9/11. Leave the after-school specials to the amateurs and do what you do best.<br/><br/>Did this flick really need to be made while the wound is still so fresh? I can see how, in years to come, this could be an interesting story that attempts to capture the confusion/panic/heartbreak of 9/11 for those who have no memory of the events. But for most people, I think this is a story we are still very familiar with. Who wasn't glued to the TV during that time? Who didn't watch and hope that they would find more people alive in the rubble? The people who were there, that's who. And if I was there, why the *&#@%! would I want to sit down in a dark room, surrounded by strangers, and relive that horrible period of my life so soon? I should probably mention that, right next to me were two guys who couldn't stop sniffling through the whole flick, so maybe I'm just an insensitive jerk."

Those 2 men were brave in the sense that they got hurt doing their jobs, but they didn't even know what was happening when they got trapped in the debris. The heroes are the people that KNOWINGLY went in to save them and others trapped in the debris. Also the script supervisor should have been fired. They must have driven from the port authority to the trade center 5 times that morning, if one pays even the slightest bit of attention to the bus windows on the ride down to ground zero. The story was not compelling in the slightest and technically the movie was AWFUL. What is up with Maria Bello's eyes? Granted she (I assume) was playing a character with blue eyes, but you'd think that with Stone's budget they could have some how gotten better contacts or fixed it in post. She doesn't shed one tear in the film probably b/c her contacts would have come flying out. The whole movie was republican/ right wing propaganda.

"Solipsisticblog","8","34","68","11 August 2006"," Moving, but uneven, experience
","I was surprised by the intimacy of this film about the September 11th terrorist attacks. It takes a tragedy that shook the world and chooses to focus on just a few characters. There are a few scenes that place the event in the larger global context, but most of the disaster is viewed from limited, first person viewpoints. This heightens the viewer's fear and anxiety and makes for an effective experience.<br/><br/>The movie follows two port authority cops as they try to evacuate the World Trade Center. John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) is the veteran cop who has became an authority on the WTC after the '93 attack and helped create evacuation strategies. (This situation, however, catches him off guard. No one anticipated a disaster originating on the upper levels of the towers.) William Jimeno (Michael Pena) is the rookie cop who volunteers to jump into the fray when many of his fellow cops hesitate.<br/><br/>The movie also tells the story of the cops' wives who anxiously wait for word on their husbands. The consistently excellent Maggie Gyllenhaal does an excellent job as the pregnant wife of rookie Jimeno. If the Fall doesn't produce many best actress contenders, Gyllenhaal could net a nomination. Mario Bello also turns in a fine performance as Mrs. McLoughlin struggling to keep her family calm and trying not to believe the worst.<br/><br/>The movie, though, is not a triumph as I was hoping. Our two main characters spend much of the movie inert and these scenes, unfortunately, become a little tedious. Maybe it's because I knew of the ultimate outcome of the story--it's based on actual accounts--that these moments became tiresome for me. After the harrowing arrival at the disaster site and the horrifying, but amazingly filmed destruction of the towers, the cops' experience slowly becomes less compelling.<br/><br/>Much has been made about the fact that Oliver Stone has made a largely apolitical film. But pay attention to the character of Marine Dave Karnes. This guy's a wild card and seems, at points, to be clashing with the film's ultimately uplifting message."
"danielletbd","6","33","66","30 July 2006"," See the documentaries instead
","Note: If you did not watch the news around the time of 9/11 you might not know how this movie turns out. Therefore, this review contains spoilers for you. ""World Trade Center"" is a movie I went into not expecting to like but wanting to see anyway (just not willing to pay for it), and once again my instincts did not fail me.<br/><br/>Now before you tune me out and call me insensitive, let me preface this rant: most of the filmmaker's nitpicky reasons I did not like the film will be the same ones that make others love it. For one, it is a typical Oliver Stone movie, which basically means he gets the performances and works with great actors, but he lingers on shots too long and treats the audience like they are not paying attention, therefore drilling every last little bit home. <br/><br/>""World Trade Center"" can best be described as a docu-drama. Unlike ""Titanic,"" or even ""Pearl Harbor"" (which I acknowledge is a bad example because it is a bad film), the relationship between John and Will cannot stand alone: if you took away the historical tragedy that serves as the backdrop, you would not have a story. There is no exposition to John and Will before September 11 (and I actually think the movie should be called ""September 11"" because of that): you meet them separately on the morning of the events. You never see them before: two men of different generations and ranks performing the same job, working in the same precinct, but not really knowing each other. Instead, you are thrust into hell with them.<br/><br/>I don't know what was actually said under the rubble, nor do I think either John or Will can recall exactly, as lack of oxygen and mind-numbing, bone-crushing pain must have made them pretty delirious, but I do not believe it was as written in ""World Trade Center."" If you watched the news after September 11, you knew the story of John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno: therefore, the ending of ""World Trade Center"" is no surprise. You go into the movie knowing exactly how it will turn out, and what keeps you in the seats are the performances. However, Oliver Stone still felt the need to create drama and suspense: will they die? Will one live? Which one? It felt fake and forced, which is the worst way to bastardize such an emotional story.<br/><br/>When Dave Karnes, the rogue ex-Marine who ultimately found Will alive, streams past the police officers and firefighters packing up for the night at Ground Zero, he actually looks around and says: Its like God created a sheet to shield us from what we shouldn't see. There's Hollywood writing, if I ever heard it. Fake and forced clichés. Like I said: unrealistic dialogue.<br/><br/>""World Trade Center"" is rated PG. The studio wants kids to see it; they want them to remember and to understand just what could have been lost that day. No one curses in the movie: even when they should have, even when they did in reality, they don't in the film. But just like in ""JFK,"" Oliver Stone utilizes real news footage to tie the narrative together, and one of those clips is of an extreme close up on the burning hole in Tower One, as someone jumps to their death. Children need to remember; we all do, but that was uncalled for, especially considering the whole first act leading up to that point was from John and Will's perspective. As members of the Port Authority PD, they were uptown when the first plane hit: neither of them saw it. As they bussed down to the site, no one knew what was going on. There were conflicting reports, and it wasn't even confirmed that the second plane hit. So thankfully the audience was spared certain visuals. But not everything.<br/><br/>The most interesting element to the film was one line within the first ten minutes-- one that was fleeting and unremarkable and even unnoticed by most: ""Look out for this girl, she's eleven years old and a runaway out of Rhode Island expected to be on a bus to Grand Central this morning."" The police chief holds up a picture at the morning's briefing, before everything goes awry. In the midst of the chaos, I wondered about her: did she actually come into NYC that day? Did her bus get in Grand Central or did she take a train to the World Trade Center? Was she found? Did she live? Is she home safely with her family now? Thats a new story amiss something I lived and then saw time and time again. And I want to know more about THAT. But it was dropped because they weren't out to create a fictional storyline, and they don't know what really happened there.<br/><br/>I think overall I was disappointed because it was not extraordinary. I wanted to see the sets recreated: I wanted to see how real they looked, and unfortunately so much was done with green screen, that fell short for me. In this case, the truth was the best narrative this story could possibly have: the real footage of people emerging from the burning buildings is ten times more powerful than anything staged could ever be. The personal memories and images are enough to feel, to be pained, to cry: this movie isn't necessary. In twenty or thirty years, maybe it will be. Maybe when everyone has started to forget, to move on, Ill break out World Trade Center and see it in a new light. But with all of the countless documentaries (including but not limited to the two I already mentioned), I doubt that Ill even need it then.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I believe every story is worth being told, and every film is worth being made, but I reserve the right to criticize them all, too."

But this year, Hollywood has shown a willingness to tackle 9/11 from a deeply human perspective, first through the TV film FLIGHT 93, then Paul Greengrass' excellent feature film UNITED 93, and now through director Oliver Stone's WORLD TRADE CENTER.<br/><br/>Stone, a native New Yorker, but also a polarizing figure of the cinema via his dark and controversial explorations of recent U.S. history and politics (PLATOON; JFK, etc.), has sought to focus on the true meaning of heroism by focusing in on Port Authority officers John McLoughlin and William Jimeno, who, along with their fellow Port Authority and NYC fire and police personnel, went into the World Trade Center towers to evacuate as many people as possible from there after the two jets were rammed into the buildings. The two men, however, nearly became a part of history right then and there when the towers crumbled. For twenty hours, both men were trapped under twenty thousand tons of steel and concrete, some twenty feet deep. They were the only Port Authority personnel who survived the destruction of the towers, and among only twenty people in all who got out in the end. Nearly 2,700 others weren't as lucky in the WTC puzzle of 9/11.<br/><br/>McLoughlin and Jimeno are portrayed superbly in WORLD TRADE CENTER by Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena, who accurately depict the professional blue-collar ethic of the Big Apple's finest and bravest. Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello, respectively, portray Donna McLoughlin and Allison Jimeno, their wives who were on edge during the entire time of this apocalyptic crisis, wondering whether their husbands were going to make it out of there. Their stories, though individual, serve as a microcosm for the thousands of others there that day, both the dead and the survivors. This last point is something that Stone makes very clear: the kind of humanity in the face of so much inhumanity that day. It is something that has gotten lost in the intervening five years, in which opportunistic politicians have used 9/11 as a weapon to whip up false patriotism, scare tactics, and a bloody war in Iraq that had absolutely nothing to do with the attacks on America. Stone, however, stays away from the kind of political critique that was a hallmark of JFK and several of his other films, and shows us the kind of true heroism that the far-right has often accused Hollywood of deliberately avoiding, but which they themselves couldn't possibly manufacture even on their best day.<br/><br/>Along with FLIGHT 93 and UNITED 93, WORLD TRADE CENTER proves that Hollywood is ready to respond with a clear, realistic, and human look at one of this nation's darkest days. So too is the American public, and the world at large. The question now is: Are our politicians willing to do so without resorting to name-calling, pointless propaganda, and macho warmongering? That in and of itself will tell us a lot, and WORLD TRADE CENTER should add to the pressure to force that issue."

","I was looking forward to this movie early in the summer, then I stared watching most of the movies that were expected to be good and I was let down so I stopped looking forward to this believing it was to be a let down, I was right. I really disliked this movie for many reasons.<br/><br/>First of all, the casting was bad. I dislike who they chose to be police men, wives, firefighters; everyone. And the people who they chose were bad actors. Throughout the movie I couldn't feel any emotion from them, any pain, any happiness; nothing. Even Nicholas Cage was disappointing.<br/><br/>But there is a lot more. There is no character development. No stories really to the people that are trapped or dieing. I didn't feel sorry for them or felt any emotion. You see a little bit of their family but you don't see how much they love them before hand then you see them suffering because they might not see them again. I felt like they didn't care that they wouldn't see their family again.<br/><br/>I'm not a cop, or firefighter or anything like that but wouldn't they be more cautious walking around all that rubble. Or even in the building, why would they keep so many people inside the burning trade center; wouldn't they move them out of there? Maybe not; if you disagree with this point maybe I could this part wrong.<br/><br/>It was overall boring as well. All it was is people talking; more people talking; more; more; more, nothing else besides talking. I was really bored after they got trapped because nothing happened; at all. Even when they were looking for them it wasn't interesting.<br/><br/>The only reason I give this a 2 is because it looked cool at times, yes call me evil or what ever but it looked cool at times. But I would not recommend you seeing this. Instead go rent ""Ladder 49"" it's a way better movie of someone trapped in rubble and it has a lot more affection, emotion, story and everything to it."

","I went and seen this movie without expectations i didn't expect the best movie ever i just expected a movie.<br/><br/>I've got to say i was very, very disappointed it was one of the worst movies i've ever seen and i have seen a lot and i mean a lot of movies. For what they actually do in this movie it didn't have to go that as long as it did i could have summed the whole thing up in 30 minutes, instead of dragging on and on, i've got to say while watching the movie me and my friends wanted to walk out of the cinemas it was that bad.<br/><br/>So to sum it up.<br/><br/>World Trade Center The movie was Boring and a complete disappointment"
"imajestr","7","29","59","28 July 2006"," A Great Drama
","I saw an advanced screening of World Trade Center last night, and I was very impressed. I went into it unbiased, deciding that I would indeed like to hear the story of what happened to the two officers this movie is about, and I would take it for what it is, regardless of whether or not people think it's still too soon.<br/><br/>This is a very moving and intense look at the story of the officers' ordeal as well as what their families had to go through. Of course, the viewer is reminded of a lot that happened on that day, and it is disturbing, sad, and angering just as the real events were. However, the movie makes no attempt at all to explain what happened or give some great message to the world about terrorism, government, or war. It's more of a character study and simply a look at a terrible event from several perspectives.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, and I have more respect for Nicholas Cage after this movie than I did going into it. There are some very intense moments, and moments that, as I've said, are angering and disturbing, but not to make the viewer want to walk away, but simply to be angry that these events had to occur in the first place.<br/><br/>Thankfully, there are several moments of humor throughout the movie, to give the viewer a break perhaps, but they work well.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 because the writing at times was not all that it could have been, especially some of the dialogue. Overall, the acting is great and the characters feel real, but in some scenes you may feel like the sentimentality is being forced and doesn't feel genuine.<br/><br/>I will recommend this movie to people who are not dead set against it, or someone who is just looking for exactly what it is: a movie made for entertainment and as a tribute to those that died."
"edchupak","1","12","21","13 March 2007"," Oliver must be on the Globalist payroll now, too...
","Bottom line to anyone with two working eyes and common sense - 9/11 was an INSIDE JOB. So, how does the master of conspiracy theory cinema put out a boring, listless, conspiracy-free piece of garbage like this?????? Yes, we all - regardless of our view on the events of that day - sympathize with the firefighters and policemen and every other victim of that day, but do we really need another hit-piece filled with red-herring style melodrama? <br/><br/>You would expect the man who minced the JFK dog and pony show to at least touch upon how rogue elements of the US, UK and Israel were responsible for the attacks in a movie entitled WORLD TRADE CENTER. <br/><br/>Every ounce of respect I've had for Stone throughout his career has been pulverized as completely as the thermite used to bring down WTC 1 and 2 vaporized the towers."
"the_purple_reign","1","23","46","15 August 2006"," Win- win situation
","...because most people are afraid to criticize this film, because the subject matter is still so sensitive. Disliking this movie puts one's patriotism into question.<br/><br/>However, reviewing it for what it is - I felt it was a low blow for Oliver Stone to capitalize on nationalistic sentiment, and churn out a manipulative special-effects blockbluster, ironically cheapening the events of 9/11.<br/><br/>Nothing thought-provoking here.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage proves once again that he hasn't bothered seeking decent scripts for a decade. Stone has lost his originality.<br/><br/>Avoid this film. or catch it on Lifetime, History Channel, and every 9/11 anniversary for years to come."
"witster18","8","10","17","31 January 2016"," Truly offended. The Negative Reviews De-Bunked very quickly
","First, this isn't a political film, this is a character-driven film. I hate I have to even touch on the politics. The trade centers went down. Fact. Because of terrorists, fact. THey killed 3,000 people in 3 hours. Fact.<br/><br/>The film doesn't show the towers falling down. The film doesn't mention anything about why, who, or what motivated anyone. It focuses on a small group of men, risking their lives to save others in the light of tragedy, and in the process, creates onE of the best dramatic duo performances of the decade.<br/><br/>Cage and Pena are truly incredible here! Undoubtedly the best performance from Pena and Probably the second best performance or even equal to Leaving Las Vegas for Cage. Tour-De-Force acting. Surprised Michael didn't get an Oscar nom here. <br/><br/>I can see why anti-American's would hate this film. It shows everything that is great about Americans and New Yorkers in 2 Hours.<br/><br/>It's quite simply the best 6.0 film on IMDb, and more deserving of 8/10 imo. 81/100 is where I'm scoring it. It's not the best film I've ever seen but it's a very strong film, and easily top 10 for the year it was released. The film is about the moment, not any motivation or reaction. Period. Get a life people.<br/><br/>Watch this movie if you haven't. Strike every 1-2 star rating as American-hate - No movie with these types of performances should even sniff those low-scores... the movie doesn't have an agenda but anyone who would score it a 1-2, with this quality, most assuredly does(you can take that to the bank). 1 or 2? I mean seriously? Did you even watch the movie? No. THey didn't. And if they did, I couldn't trust any other review they'd ever given/written. Moronic.<br/><br/>Very. Good. Movie. At the bottom of Stone's Top-5 imo.Here is how good the movie is... the worst thing about it... is Maria Bello's contact lenses."
"tybrands-1","1","5","7","5 July 2017"," Reality over Hollywood
","Many good critical points have already been made about this film, but I'll just add that some historical events are better portrayed through documentaries and viewing real time news footage other than a Hollywood script. <br/><br/>This movie is an example of that."
"paynterr0","2","13","24","6 May 2007"," Pitiful film
","I have loved a lot of Oliver Stones other films, but this one was just awful. I don't care about the arguments regarding the appropriateness of making films around Sept 11th... it happened, it is history, let people tell that story. What I do mind is spending two hours of my life bored senseless by this daytime TV rubbish. Pour on the schmaltz!!!! The acting was generally poor, the music was trite and some of the film was unintentionally laughable. As for the script; cor dear. The film also contained moments of unintentional comedy. Most amusing was the character of the Marine. I felt like I was watching Team America at some points in the film; the script was that bad. All the film needed was some comedy snare-drum and piccolo military music over his scenes to complete the comedy. In the end, I didn't much care for the characters and couldn't care less if they survived or not. Actually, they annoyed me so much that I rather hoped they wouldn't. Awful!"
"tabuno","8","2","2","22 January 2019"," Flawed, Very Good, But Gets Better and Better
","10 August 2006. World Trade Center ultimately redeems itself almost in full by the end of the movie. It is respectful and insightful in its powerful way the last third of the movie is directed and acted. The problem with this movie is the way it gets there. Immediately even with the beginning shot, the focus from Nicholas Cage to general shots of the City is somewhat off balance. The editing especially in the beginning is choppy as several times one scene suddenly stops and another begins without much transition or explanation like the scene of going into the World Trade Center and then the Port Authority cops becoming suddenly suited up. There is also too much explanatory narrative, having to explain to the audience what is happening. Finally the backstory, there isn't any and the primary characters and their relationships to their families are only discovered as the movie unfolds. And the rescue is also somewhat cut short with the first efforts of getting to the trapped cops. But these flaws eventually become secondary by one of the strongest finishes of the movie in recent years.<br/><br/>Maggie Gyllenhaal performance stands out as one of the best supporting acting awards of the year. The concept and the opportunity to put on screen this actual event surrounding the trapping of these men and their ordeal was well presented and ultimately compelling on screen as well. Eight out of Ten Stars."
"gbpackerbacker04","1","18","37","15 August 2006"," Not that great for the subject matter...
","9/11 is a very easy subject to make a great film out of. This movie was alright but not great, and it should have been a whole lot better based on the subject. It does not seem that hard to make a really good movie about the terrorists attacks in NYC. This movie is also plagued with bad acting and poor directing. In fact, Cage seems to be the only person keeping the movie in the box office. In my opinion it certainly does not deserve a 7.2. If you are looking for a 7.2 then i suggest you stay home. I went into the theater expecting to leave a different person, but that was not the case. Go see something else, because this certainly was not worth the $2.00 I paid to see it."
"theone2088","3","22","47","9 August 2006"," Try not to watch this movie
","A quick summary: 2 brave men are trapped and through courage and faith, they make it out. At the end of the movie, Nick Cage finishes off the film with a few words about the courage seen on 9/11. To say this film is badly shot and terribly written would not be accurate. I do think it is well shot film; Albeit, a very unoriginal story put into the molds of the 9/11 scenario. However, about half-way into the movie, I stopped and thought, what is the point of this flick? I waited until the end to see if it would provide me with an answer. It did not.<br/><br/>Walking out, I have to admit, I felt very patriotic. That's quaint, isn't it? But I've always felt patriotic whenever I see the pictures in the NYTimes of that faithful day, when everyone who was anybody helped each other. Why do we need to make a movie? Is it because people are afraid we will forget 9/11? That cant be. Although the act of terrorism happened 5 years ago, it feels, at least for me, like it was just yesterday. I know many people still have the New York Times of September 11, 2001 in their homes. We will never forget that day.<br/><br/>Now, I deeply respect the families of those who past and the authorities who helped thousands of lives, but why milk their lives for profit? That is why I am, ultimately, outraged by this movie. It is a flick that acts like its purpose is to remind us of the courage on 9/11 when, in fact, we do not need reminding. It bases an old film idea (""courage gets someone out of deep trouble"") around a catastrophic event to draw crowds and gives 10 percent of the money earned (only during the first weekend, mind you) in order to feel like it is some sort of tribute to those who were forced to give their lives. Of course, it's logical: movies are made to make money. But don't use the September 11 attacks just to draw crowds.<br/><br/>If you feel like it's your duty as an American to watch this movie, you're wrong. The ten dollars for the ticket can be sent to a charity, instead of just a dollar of it. Rent the movie later, if curiosity gets the most of you.<br/><br/>I give this film a three out of ten because the art direction was pretty good. That's it. I don't like to praise people who so blatantly take advantage of tragedies."
"bvanslooten","2","27","60","7 August 2006"," Made for Money and Nothing Else
","I can't say that I am an Oliver Stone fan (he's way to political for my tastes)...but, I am fair minded and I gave this film an objective look at an advanced screening. I liked some of his movies in the past that had some bite and were a bit cutting edge, but here, in this disappointment, Stone morphs into a $ellout. <br/><br/>This movie was made to tug at our heart strings and appeal to our sorrowful sides of what each one of us experienced watching this horrific event unfold in 2001. The bottom line is that they wanted to cash in on America's most devastating tragedy. <br/><br/>Don't think for a minute that the producers and Stone were not thinking of anything else, but to exploit and ""money grab"" on an opportunity to benefit and capitalize. To me, that's just plain wrong. <br/><br/>Does the film succeed? I say no. It's too much manipulation and after a while you will not be able to stand all the nagging melodramatic music which is way over the top. The movie tries too hard to be a crowd pleaser. Period. <br/><br/>$tone used to be a good story teller...even when he was working as a paranoid rabble rousing conspiracy freak, but here he goes for the exploitive sentiment of bravery. <br/><br/>September 11, 2001 was a seminal moment in American history. On that day the world saw horror and evil. Oliver $tone and his producers saw dollar $ign$ and ""possibilities"". <br/><br/>The filmmakers didn't see evil that day... they saw the ""opportunity"" to make a lot of money and they should be ashamed of themselves for exploiting one of the greatest tragedies in American history."
"Lando_Hass","4","14","28","21 August 2006"," ....wow.....what a piece of crap......
","I'd like to talk to you all about a movie. A movie that I saw recently called World Trade Center. What's it about, you might ask if you're an idiot. But, if you don't know, it's about the September 11th attack on the Twin Towers, and about two Port Authority officers that went inside one of the crumbling buildings and got trapped under the rubble. Now, a movie with this kind of story and the fact that it's based on a sad story will tell you one thing: You might have to bring along a few boxes of Kleenex into the theater. I thought that I was gonna need a little of the tissue when I saw this. But bruh, let me tell youthe only tissue I needed was the tissue for my ass after I s*** myself because of how crappy this movie was. Not kidding.<br/><br/>Now, of course, the movie's story is pretty damn good. The attacks were pretty harsh and sad, and you'd expect that if a movie was made about those horrible events, you'd feel like you got roundhouse kicked in the face so hard that you just have to cry. NOPE. How can a movie with such a powerful story not be sad and touching? With my bad-ass wisdom, I'll tell you how: The movie is so damn pretentious and it tries so damn hard to make you cry that it fails. Even though I'm so ridiculously manly, I like watching a movie that brings on a few tears from time to time, and I expected my eyes to have horrible, water-diarrhea. The exact opposite, bruh, the exact opposite happened. First off, the trailer was more touching than the movie. It was more powerful. The movie itself was close to two and a half hours of nothing. When a character died, even though it's upsetting because it actually happened, you don't feel anything when you're watching it. The movie makes almost no effort to add subtlety to any moments that would normally make you cry. Instead, it's so damn pretentious that it almost forces you to disregard the crappy movie-making and crappy script and just accept what's going on and shed a few tears. Oliver Stone might as well have just walked on-camera, and asked us to cry. Sorry, bruh, but I like my tears to come out naturally, not to be forced out. <br/><br/>It's almost like people feel obligated to act like they're moved by this movie. They watch it, and when they walk out they praise it just for the sake of praising it. They say to themselves, ""Wow. What a tour de force, guys."" They like it before they even see it. The story of these two officers is pretty moving, but this movie just doesn't make you feel anything other than complete ri-godd**n-diculous boredom. I mean, when you're watching a movie about such a horrible tragedy, and you're not moved or crying, you know they did something wrong.<br/><br/>Of course, people are gonna make comparisons to United 93. I haven't seen that, but I do know that it's an insanely sad movie, and that it isn't full of itself. It might be on a tiny budget, but that's what separates it from this pile. Another thing about this movie was that the cast was too recognizable, whereas in United 93, everyone was an unknown. Now, these actors were cool and everything, but when you're watching this and saying to yourself, ""Damn, isn't that cop the bad guy from Blade?"", you know something's a little amiss. It takes you completely out of the movie. Any other movie is fine, but with such a true story it's not cool to have big name stars that are easily recognizable. <br/><br/>Now, I know I'm one of the few people that hated this movie. Of course, morons are gonna read this and say, ""Ha, well, I guess you have no respect for America or for all those people that died on that day! Why don't you just praise the terrorists?!"" Nope. Not true, bruh. I have the most respect for the people that died. What I don't like is crappy movies made off of those stories that fail to be moving, touching, or tear-inducing, which they very well should be. That's what I hate, bruh, that's what I hate.<br/><br/>Score: 4.<br/><br/>Let me summarize how I felt about this movie: This movie is like when you're about to go to sleep at night after a hard day's work. You think, ""Damn, bruh, this is gonna be a good ass sleep."" Let me remind you, sleep is the movie right now. You go to sleep, and then you wake up in the middle of the night with a gut-wrenching stomach ache because you have to take a massive, colossal crap. Boom. The great sleep you thought you were gonna have is now crap. That's how I felt about this movie. I thought I was gonna experience something great and moving, but instead, it got derailed by, yes, you guessed it, bruh, CRAP. You all know what I'm talking about."

Half the movie is news footage and the other half is corny corny corny and slow and boring and lame. I used to have a lot of respect for Maggie GyllenhalL before I saw her in this terrible film. It's way toO early for a movie about 9/11. It's basically a profit off of a tragedy and not even entertaining at that.

","I have always admired Oliver Stone. Platoon is still one of my all time favorite movies - EVER! Though i generally dislike Conpiracy theories, i did like Stone's ""JFK"". Bu because of ""JFK"", i did fear that Stone would put in conspiracy theories about 9-11 in this film, theories that some Jewish-neo-con-conspiracy that was masterminded to destroy the World Trade Center (WTC), and blame it on the Arabs, so that the weapon-industry could make money. But i was relieved when i finally watched this amazing picture. It is so true a story - with no reel patriotism or conspiracy theories. Just about brave men, knowing what to do in the face of the unthinkable.<br/><br/>This is a VERY important movie to finally bury all these dumb conspiracy theories once and for all. Because Oliver Stone is more or less the king of Conspiracy theories (JFK anyone??). He is a liberal, a Bush-hater and a pacifist. When a man like that, a man VERY open to conspiracy theories, tells you that there weren't no conspiracies 9-11, don't you think, little conspiracy theorist, that it is time to give up??? IT IS!! Conspiracy theorists: face it - you have lost the battle of 9-11. Some conspiracy theories will still not give up after this movie, they claim that Illuminati has paid off Stone to make this movie, whitewashing 9-11 as some uneducated conspiracy theorist-blogger claimed. But haven't it occurred to these conspiracy theorists that Oliver Stone is a multi millionaire already?? He is, after all the films, and DVD-sales of his movies. Once again, the conspiracy theorists have lost. Also that the most excellent movie ""United 93"" really is a good thing, so that all the conspiracy theorists will have problems posting their lies."

Anyone who likes this film and is not a hardcore/patriotic American jimbo should at least try to shoothemselves in the head with a high powered rifle! Sure, it was a tragedy, many people lost, i respect that. The thing is that finally when we are all starting to forget and get over those attacks the American government rubs it all back into our faces, and guess what they even make money out of it! This film makes it seem like American tragedies are the only real tragedies in the world, and that only the Americans truly suffer. This film also points out that America has the right to seek revenge over whomever did this, and they point out that ""we're gonna need a lot of good people to revenge this"", as if good people seek revenge.<br/><br/>The film is absolutely biased, and I have a feeling that there were far too many government officials present at the shoot making sure that this was a pathetic propaganda.<br/><br/>Did I also mention that this film is actually racist! None of the main characters are black, the only real black character we see is the woman in the police station that picks up the phones! Oooh where is the political correctness Stone? I actually heard that the marine guy was black in real life, but in the film he was changed to a white Jesus-lovin' son of a gun!<br/><br/>The film is also extremely boring, and full of clichés and totally fake emotions that are meant to really ""touch"" us. Well those moments make me say: ""I urinate on Oliver Stone, I urinate on everyone who had anything to do with this film.""

","How could they misrepresent an African American Marine and hero, by having a White actor play his role? It's just another insult to non-white Americans. They didn't even bother to put black-face make-up on him. At least in the bad old days of American movies, white men attempted to at least look like the minorities whose heritage they were misrepresenting.<br/><br/>I hate that I participated in this fraud. Too many African Americans have been denied their rightful place in American history. Oliver Stone should have never allowed this insult to happen. He is known for his supposed sensitivity to historical truth. It is ironic that at the most crucial time were the truth should have been told, he contributed to perpetuating the one of the biggest lies of all time. <br/><br/>The greatest crime against African America is not slavery. It is the theft of their positive identity and cultural contributions. This movie is a tragic representation of that crime. What a disappointment!"
"Vamp-6","10","15","31","4 August 2006"," If this doesn't win best picture, they should stop giving the award
","Let me start by saying that while I often enjoy Oliver Stone movies, I could not disagree with him more when it comes to politics. When I first heard about this movie, I feared Stone would concentrate on conspiracy theories as he did in JFK or take the film as an opportunity to show that terrorists are people too as Spielberg did in Munich. Now I am glad to report that this movie was as apolitical as can be. The whole movie is shown from the perspective of the victims as they experienced it, with Stone embracing none of the benefits of hindsight. The movie simply follows the characters through that day as the horror and wonder unfold before them. As a result, this film, particularly in its first 20 minutes, is a true deja vu experience, and is sure to make every viewer relive that day in his own mind. The film primarily follows a few first responders as they move through that day, and all one can think of while watching it is how heroic these men are, how difficult it must have been to stare that horror in the face and choose to walk right into it when everyone else was running away. This movie should be considered required viewing of the caliber of Schindler's List."
"kcatanese","2","12","24","18 August 2006"," reinforces the Biggest Lie of the last five years, - that in Iraq, we are fighting those who attacked our country.
","Ruth Rosen said it best:<br/><br/>When World Trade Center ended, I left the theater tense, my muscles aching. The superb directing and acting, coupled with still hardly imaginable scenes of death and destruction, had sent painful muscle spasms up my back, evoked tears, and left me, yet again, with searing and indelible images of that hellish morning.<br/><br/>I felt disoriented in the bright sunlight of a Northern Californian afternoon. As my mind regained its critical faculties, however, another kind of shock set in. I suddenly realized that Oliver Stone's movie reinforces the Big Lie - endlessly repeated by Dick Cheney, echoed and amplified by the right-wing media - that 9/11 was somehow linked to Iraq or supported by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.<br/><br/>It might surprise you that this Oliver Stone film is neither ideological, nor conspiratorial, which in my view is just as it should be. Instead, it is a portrayal of what the men who braved hell and the families who anguished over their survival experienced.<br/><br/>World Trade Center gives 9/11 a distinctly human face by following two Port Authority policemen and their families. We watch the men muster their courage to help evacuate people in one of the towers; we gasp as they are buried alive; we wince as heavy slabs of cement crush their bodies; and we hold our breath as they struggle to keep each other going in the face of imminent death.<br/><br/>Expert editing brings us the anguish suffered by their wives, children, and relatives. Some are in denial, others in shock. Some have faith; others are resigned to the men's deaths. They live in their own hell and we empathize with their wrenching agony.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Stone introduces us to one ex-Marine who feels called by God to help rescue those buried alive. He gets his hair cut short, puts on his old uniform, and with all the authority of a former staff sergeant, does what he knows best - uses his military skills to save people's lives. Determined and angry, he insists that we must avenge this horrendous attack.<br/><br/>And yet, in none of these profoundly moving scenes is there even a mention of who might have committed this atrocity. Neither the name AL-Qaeda, nor Osama Bin Laden, is so much as whispered.<br/><br/>Despite the near flood of documentaries on the terrorist attacks heading toward the small screen this September, Stone's film, for many Americans, may end up being the definitive cinematic record of what it felt like to be inside the hellish cyclone known simply by the numbers 9/11.<br/><br/>To offer a faithful recreation of that historical catastrophe, however, Stone owed viewers the whole truth, not merely a brilliant, graphic portrayal of what happened and how it affected the lives of some of those involved.<br/><br/>As it ends, a written postscript appears that describes what happened to the buried Port Authority policemen, their families, and the ex-Marine who helped rescue them (whose last line is: ""We're going to need some good men out there to revenge this""). We learn that the two men survived an unbearable number of surgeries and are living with their families. Next we read that the ex-Marine re-upped and later did two tours of duty in Iraq. At that moment, I wanted to shout out, ""Don't you mean Afghanistan?"" <br/><br/>That evening, I wrote the words that should have appeared in the postscript: ""Government officials later confirmed that the organization which plotted the destruction of the World Trade Center was AL-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden, a Saudi Arabian, and Ayman AL-Zawahiri, an Egyptian. Nineteen men executed the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Fifteen of them came from Saudi Arabia; the remaining four from Egypt, The United Arab Emirates, and Lebanon. None of them came from Iraq.""<br/><br/>This is the tragic failure of Stone's World Trade Center. It undercuts the historical value of the film and reinforces the Biggest Lie of the last five years, still believed by far too many Americans - that in Iraq, we are fighting those who attacked our country.<br/><br/>--------"

Stone, too shell-shocked by Alexander's fantastic failure to dare add any style, comment or individuality to this work, instead ops to handle the embarrassingly flawed narrative with cozy woolen kid gloves. What's left is a perfunctory pastiche with an exposed ultimate sin - an unapologetic screenplay that sweetens daunting insincerity with the pungence of forced sentimentality. From its mache art direction to its plucky-at-best cast, the story is the only thing it could not dare to have been  content. It is content to be eccentric instead of intriguing and the ensemble is content to be respectful instead of enthusiastic.

","I'm surprised by the excellent reviews this movie is getting. It's not a bad movie, but it certainly doesn't merit the steller acclaim. It's not all that well written, directed, shot, or edited. The performances are good, I suppose.<br/><br/>I think people are just afraid to criticize a movie about Septemeber 11th. Bottom line is that this movie is cheesy and pandors to the audience. If Stone still had some balls he would have set the entire movie in the rubble. The movie would have been much better if the first half hour had shown the normal routine of the cops. Show us what life was like on September 10th and then build to the moment. Establish the characters. Don't make us care for them just because they're September 11th cops. That's just annoying because it doesn't show any real writing ability. It's like saying, okay, people will like them even if they don't know who they are.<br/><br/>This movie is far too tame and it's a shame it came out because there can definitely be a better movie that handles the exact same subject matter, but it can't come out without being deemed a copy. It should have been R and there should have been more cursing and more violence to adequately reflect reality. Ultimately, Sept. 11th just isn't great movie material. Like Pearl Harbor, historically tragic events just don't usually work on screen because there is no way to adequately recreate what happened...and the question needs to be asked...why should we recreate it in such a way. The documentary on Sept. 11th is far more powerful and well-executed and captures the day and the feeling of the day much better."

","Oliver Stone and Paramount have gone under cover of the 'based on real events' shield in order to create one of the most shockingly propagandist blockbusters of the last twenty years.<br/><br/>The film offends on a number of levels, not least because of its exploitative and unnecessary depiction of the suffering of those who were trapped in the World Trade Center on September 11 2001. Stone must be congratulated for suddenly becoming one of the most important men in American politics; this film is his calling to become, after a rocky road, best buds with his fellow Yale attendees the President and Vice President of the United States. <br/><br/>For consistency in a seemingly chaotic world, we can hope the Bush Administration as well as the box office rewards Mr. Stone for this very special (in the way one might refer to a child who's a little slow and worryingly destructive) contribution to the Patriot Act and War on Terror. Of course, stability of this sort would be small comfort, as 'Patriotism' has been for people residing in the States. World Trade Center is an ultra conservative movie which has as its central recommendation the unsettling amusement that $60 million was spent on creating this kitsch, facile house of cards. Those who were directly affected by the events which destroyed the World Trade Center and those who are currently experiencing the devastating human and political consequences of 'post- 9/11', deserve far better than this dire and noxious formula."

","Looking through the comments on here it looks like a bunch of people went into this movie expecting it to be some sort of documentary exposing George Bush or something lol. Just because Oliver Stone is red-pilled af doesn't mean he can't deliver a powerful and suspenseful drama. Oliver stone even went out of his way to show tower 7 falling, which is more than the entire MSM can manage to do.<br/><br/> I went into this movie not expecting much and walked away with one of the most moving films I've ever seen about 9/11. Not only was this movie absolutely beautiful, it was respectful. The movie is about two port authority police officers that get stuck under the rubble of the WTC on 9/11, and what their families go through. This is one of the most powerful performances from two already amazing actors, Nicolas Cage and Michael Peña. Both actors deliver one of the best acting duets I've ever seen on film, really immersing themselves into the characters and bleeding their hearts out onto the film. Yes, this movie is extremely patriotic, it gives huge respect to the people that put their lives on the line for us, and illustrates the soul of American freedom.<br/><br/>Sorry you guys didn't get Oliver Stone's take on the controlled demolition, but this isn't that movie. Isn't his other films like Snowden and JFK enough for you? Does he need to make a film about every fkng conspiracy in American history? Are we gonna start crying about Platoon because he doesn't talk about the Gulf of Tonkin incident? Oliver Stone does characters, and he does them better than anyone in the business. The man is a filmmaker, how about let's look at this film and review it for what it is. This movie is brilliantly shot, with a perfect and talented cast. It's a drama, and it's suspenseful! I didn't know how it was going to end, and it hit me right in the feels. The whole last 1/4 of the movie I'm teared up!<br/><br/>You didn't like the Marine? Go back to China, commie!

"jdesando","Null","16","35","4 August 2006"," Stone Cold
","Stone cold, that's what I call the new Oliver Stone film, World Trade Center. Taking the story of two Port Authority Police who survived, Stone manages to make the singular event of the last decade a boring made-for-TV story of two cops buried and waiting rescue, by the Marines no less. There are marks of an auteur to be sure such as the set design, just as authentic looking as when I visited ground zero after the attack. But the mark of the real Stone, one that carries the heft of his personal opinion about an event (Platoon) or his off-center look at history (JFK), is absent.<br/><br/>Let's face it: Two cops, John McLoughlin (Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena), buried beneath rubble with small talk to keep themselves alive is neither great drama nor riveting suspense when you know ahead of time they are 2 of the 20 to be saved and their dialog doesn't come close to the bite of WWII film foxhole repartee. Cutting as often as he can to the dull families in New Jersey waiting for word about their lost loved ones, Stone still fails to make even this horrific event interesting. <br/><br/>As a matter of fact, he fails to put the event into its larger context of a world crisis that changes the way we live forever. It's a challenge to do so if you choose only a small part of the event, but a great director should be able to as Stone did, for instance, with Wall Street, where the shenanigans of one broker clearly represented a corrupt generation of self-centered consumers.<br/><br/>It's as if Oliver Stone promised Hollywood after his disastrous Alexander (which I liked) that he'd be a good boy and not editorialize about 9/11. Heck, point of view is Stone: Remember the conspiracy theory of JFK? Google ""Loose Change"" to get an introduction to 9/11 conspiracy theory and wonder why Oliver Stone couldn't have gone there rather than the straight way. Or at least part of the way.<br/><br/>""While you here do snoring lie, Open-eyed conspiracy His time doth take. If of life you keep a care, Shake off slumber, and beware: Awake, awake!""

"rmax304823","2","3","4","11 September 2007"," Nothing special, alas.
","The director, Oliver Stone, labored under multiple handicaps in bringing this story of two trapped Port Authority policemen to the screen. First of all, the narrative is hindered by the constraints of reality. Nothing of much cinematic impact really happened during the attacks on the twin towers. Two airplanes crash into the towers, then a few hours later, kaboom, and the rest is rescue and recovery. It's inherently undramatic.<br/><br/>And there were probably a myriad heroes but no single individual strapped to the mast, singing out, ""Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead!"" So there can be no hero. And there can't be any villains either. Nobody knew who was behind the attacks at the time. And if you exclude the jihadists, what's left? Kirk Douglas' egomaniacal reporter in ""Ace in the Hole""? In other words, you have a film about two PAPD officers immobilized in the rubble, able only to speak to one another, and there follow the kind of clichés you expect from a war movie. The pregnant wife at home, vomiting at the news, and declaring that she will give her unborn child the name her husband wanted. Flashbacks to happy home lives, when the trapped husbands gave their sons instructions on the use of a saw, beaming at their wives. A Marine inspired by a visit to his church who plunges into the rescue effort. And it gets worse. When an officer dies, he sees the tunnel of light with Christ at the end. (What if he'd been a Jew?) A shame, really. The weakness of the drama is not compensated for by spectacular scenes of buildings collapsing -- which is probably a good thing, because that way lies just another disaster movie. More telling is the absence of any exploration of the systemic response to the catastrophe. One of the problems plaguing the rescue efforts was that the NYPD and the NY Fire Department had radios tuned to different frequencies and so were unable to communicate with one another. By the end, first responders were communicating through 911, the emergency phone number. By the way, is that fixed now? It ought to be gripping and it's not really. Two men trapped in the dark rubble, one PR and one WASP, and we pretty much know what they think and feel. Ditto for their families. What many would like to know is what's going on upstairs.<br/><br/>To Stone's credit, his narrative is straightforward, with no editorial razzle dazzle. Not a sign of self indulgence. And it seems like a genuine attempt at drama, not greedy cashing in on public interest in the events.<br/><br/>The two men are rescued and of course any viewer is glad. It was a catastrophe. And the catastrophe has deepened. It's sadder now than it was on 9/11. We've spent half again as many lives as were lost on 9/11 in the fruitless pursuit of some ill-defined vengeance. And a dozen times more Americans have been maimed. On 9/12, most of the newspapers across Europe and the rest of the world ran headlines like, ""Today We Are All Americans."" I doubt that sentiment still prevails. We've lost more than anyone could have predicted."

","i cannot understand how this movie received 4 stars in the newspapers. we all know what happened to many, many police and fire officers on 911, when the towers went down. of course their wives and families were terrified! but the perpetual nagging (to one another) of the two trapped together to not fall asleep and hold on went on for way too long. this movie would have been far better if it were about a number of characters trapped instead of just two. it would have been great if it showed people that were dying after coming out of the towers, and those watching, running in the streets. this movie is glib and utterly boring. really, it would have been best if it were about all the people that were inside of the offices when the planes tore through the towers, as well as the confusion of the authorities over the event. it would be great to see how firemen and police officers and port authorities had no plan to work together. i just wish i had not spent money on seeing it!"
"secondtake","6","4","6","22 September 2010"," The events are unbeatable, but after an hour the movie falls into boring clichés
","World Trade Center (2006)<br/><br/>You can't argue with the story line--it's based on the facts--and you can't help but shiver and even cry over some of the imagery, burning buildings and rescued policemen.<br/><br/>So how well put together is it? As a movie, as a two hour plus story?<br/><br/>Very well, with some slow spots, and eventually a feeling that the story lines are in place early on and don't waver or turn as the movie goes. (In fact, if you haven't seen the movie but know the history, you might guess what happens even now, before you start.) It's obviously a movie about survival, about ordinary people doing what they can to help each other, and individuals rediscovering what really matters in their lives.<br/><br/>For me, all of these elements are a given, and were maybe unavoidable in an Oliver Stone film (he's a director who embraces Hollywood's emotional ability to sway and move a viewer with sights and sounds). What was most chilling and worthwhile were the recreations of the falling buildings, both from the inside and the outside. This also is one of Hollywood's strengths, creating illusions. And I'm going to guess they had to make it far less dramatic and horrifying than it really was. <br/><br/>Nicolas Cage is good, and his fellow cops, including the other lead, Conner Paolo, are fine, but I'm not sure anyone really raises the movie up by their performances. The events are the point, and the retelling of what actually happened from one small, poignant point of view. It's frankly slow and repetitive by the end, but the first half hour or so has some moments that are worth seeing if you are willing to relive that day."
"GreySphinx","2","10","20","13 August 2006"," ""World Trade Center""? Yeah, right.
","I don't think this movie comes too soon. I don't really think this movie is an insult to victims. I don't think this movie is a cheap exploitation of emotion...<br/><br/>I simply think this movie sucks... because it's typical bad film-making. Where's the story? For a movie titled ""World Trade Center"", you'd expect it to chronicle the existence of the WTC, its destruction, and the stories of the people involved (You know, kind of like what that little film ""Titanic"" did for the ship of the same name). Instead, this movie should've been called ""Two Guys Trapped on 9/11"" because that's all it's really about. We learn nothing about the World Trade Center, nor do we discover anything new about the 9/11 attacks. All we see are two guys with extremely typical families that go to the Twin Towers after either one or two planes hit them (the movie is vague about this for some reason), they put on some gear and then don't really do anything. They hang around the lobby, then one tower comes down and they get buried in rubble. For the rest of the movie, they're lying around in dirt swapping the most cliché dialogue about how they need to hold on and who has how many kids back home. They also warn each other about the dangers of falling asleep (which is good, because sadly that's what the audience is about to do at this point).<br/><br/>As for the rest of the events of that day, we see nothing of them. The people trapped on the top floors, what was going through their minds as they made the decision to jump 100 stories, the firefighters traveling up the stairwells as the building collapsed, the people aboard the planes as they crashed, the folks trapped in the elevators... (for god's sake, I heard about a janitor stuck in an elevator shaft who escaped by chipping a hole through a wall with his squeegee! That alone could've made for a more interesting movie...) I mean seriously, no offense to McLoughlin and Jimeno, but theirs was far from the most interesting or emotional story of that day. They experienced suffering and terror, but so did thousands of others on a greater scale and it's kinda cheap to take just that one story and slap on the title ""World Trade Center"" as if we've been shown even a fraction of a percent of the stories of the WTC and 9/11.<br/><br/>And the sadder part is that the movie didn't even do Jimeno and McLoughlin's story justice. With the way this film told the story, I ended up not caring much for the men and even less for their families. The acting was fine, but the manner in which the story was told (for which I hold writer, editor & director responsible) made me feel nothing. There was some humor at the most inappropriate times and Cage's end voice-over came out of left field and attempted to tack on some kind of theme that was supposed to exist throughout the film (as the score was trying to suggest) but it felt forced and irrelevant.<br/><br/>The cinematography is mediocre at best. I've seen the Naudet brothers' 9/11 documentary; they captured the REAL THING as it happened LIVE, like Tower 2 collapsing as they filmed from inside the lobby of Tower 1 and it's absolutely ridiculous that their footage was more coherent than Stone's. Most of the movie looked like it was shot on a sound stage since we basically never see the World Trade Center in its entirety. All we see are closeups and random rubble.<br/><br/>Stone had millions of dollars and over 2 hours of finished film time to tell just one of the countless stories of 9/11... he totally blew it and to add insult to injury, titled this half-assed work ""World Trade Center"". Give me a camera and 2 hours to talk to just one survivor of the attacks and I will give you a better movie than this major disappointment."

","Before seeing a preview in my movie class this past week, I went to the official Web site, clicked on ""In Their Own Words"" and viewed interviews with the real people who are depicted in the film. I strongly suggest that you do that before seeing this movie. They give insight about the making of the film and their part in it as well as some fascinating behind-the-scenes anecdotes.<br/><br/>Three of us who went to the preview had very different opinions. I was the only one who had gone to the Web site and I liked it the best. One other thought it was okay, the third thought it was ""too Hollywood,"" which the other two of us disagreed with. Our class as a whole seemed to give it a big thumbs up.<br/><br/>New Yorkers will probably have a different take on this movie from everyone else because we were there and we have lived with it every day since. I think it would be tough for anyone to watch, knowing what really happened that day, but I think everyone should see it if they want to get more of a personal view of what happened that day from the point of view of the people who risked their lives to enter the buildings. ""World Trade Center"" deliberately doesn't show the most sensational footage of the towers going down or the second plane hitting the building; it is about and from the perspective of the two Port Authority policemen who went in to evacuate people and got trapped, not knowing that the buildings had collapsed. And what was going on with their families as they awaited word of their fate. <br/><br/>The two producers of the film, Michael Shamberg and Stacey Sher, spoke to us after the film. One memorable thing they said was that when they were creating the replica of the pancakes buildings through which they had to crawl and weave, the rescuers (the real ones) commented that it was not tight enough, that it was too open. The director and production people were astonished. When they made the openings much narrower, defying human capability to penetrate, the rescuers demonstrated how they got to the two trapped men, wriggling and curving their way down almost like snakes. That led to the real rescuers being asked to play themselves rather than actors. Knowing that made watching the film a richer experience. I credit Oliver Stone with trying to make every detail as true to life as possible.<br/><br/>The four main characters who played the trapped men and their wives -- Nicolas Cage, Michael Pena, Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal -- did their real-live counterparts proud. I don't want to get into the controversy of whether this movie is too early, too late, or whether it should have been made at all. The one thing I know from living in New York and hearing on virtually a daily basis since 9/11 about the diverse and contentious opinions of the 9/11 families is that people will weigh in passionately. The whole post-9/11 experience in New York brought out the best in people -- we bonded like never before and helped each other in every way for months afterward. This film gives a glimpse of the heart that New Yorkers really do have. <br/><br/>There will be more movies about that day -- I think this is a responsible, substantive, insightful first one."

Thanks for trying to cram more PC BS in there, but it's just not socially responsible or realistic...they speak like a particularly white person and a particularly Hispanic person in such a way as to preclude their compatibility. This movie crams in absolutely every predictable cliché...Both with relationships and with the action genre. The Jesus with the water thing was the most ridiculous, tasteless thing I've ever seen. I'm surprised he didn't turn the bottle to reveal a Poland Spring label. This movie is completely structured to be a digestible, box office hit, formulaic turd. If I predicted almost every element, that means plenty of other people did too, and that makes it predictable, predictable is bad. As for those of you who are offended that people would walk out during the memorial credits, guess what, I was one of those people...and I walked out because I was appalled that such a simplistic, technically flawed movie would further try and attach itself to the tragedy. Deference to the victims has nothing to do with the movie. If I urinate on the floor in the shape of a mushroom cloud, am I helping to preserve the memory of nuclear bomb victims? If I want to stop someone from walking away from me (for whatever reason), should I just pull out my laptop and roll the WTC credits? They couldn't walk away then, why that would be so disrespectful to the victims! When they cut back and forth from the families to the trapped cops I kept saying ""oh here come the characters that are worthless..."" and then I realized that cutting back and forth didn't make ANY of the characters be interesting, have any dimension or development. The patriotism and religion are used ad nauseum, boringly and perhaps even republicanly. I have nothing against Republicans per se, but this movie almost unwillingly made a pastiche of Republican film cliché's. For shame, Oliver Stone. People need to extricate their balls from under the sand and not be afraid to point out BS, even if it deals with heroes, a big tragedy or interracial relations."

Thankfully, there was no one sitting very close as the theater was 3/4 empty and this was Friday (8/11) night. I would recommend waiting for the video, but only if you get to see it for free. This movie paid tribute to 9/11 the same way ""Crash"" explored racism...very superficially. If you want to see an inspiring movie about September 11th watch 911 by the Naudet Brothers. Much more stirring and you feel all the same feelings you felt that day...rage, anger, sadness and fear.

","I had the honor of seeing advance screening of World Trade Center in NYC on Auguest 2nd.<br/><br/>There are no running subplots, no distracting romances and few ""Hollywood inventions"" in the film. There are no complicated plot twists, subliminal messages, or indictments. The film never shows the planes impacting the twin towers, nor does it focus on those behind the attacks. Footage of political figures is kept to a brief minimum - President Bush and Rudy Giuliani make only brief appearances.<br/><br/>I must say that Oliver Stone did a very good job of staying clear of his left wing thoughts as far as bringing personal thoughts into the movie. I have not cried since 9/11... but this movie sure did turn on the tears. It's powerful. Being that I saw this in NYC, I felt it was OK to cry, I was sitting in a room with people who lost those close and dear.<br/><br/>Stone presents a deeply personal narrative of two real-life Port Authority police officers trapped in the rubble of the North Tower, simple and sweet.<br/><br/>When you ask yourself do I want to see this movie or not, bring your heart into the movie and know that it was not made to anger you, it was made to honor those who died on that day."

","Arguably the best movie of the year. Yes I said it, this film will win Best Picture of the year, not just because it's a recurring event in our life, but because it brings something more to the screen. Nicholas Cage was excellent in this role, as he struggles to find out who he really is. Michael Pena is definitely my pick for Best Supporting Actor, at least a nomination. His role was quite definitive in this whole movie, I was always wondering what he was going to bring next. In a time where they were dealing with death, these two officers kept each other alive with lifted spirits. They believed in one another when fate was just around the corner. I tip my hat off for this movie because they avoid the politics that most of us are tired of, and focuses on the lives of the real heroes in this movie. What these two men went through must've been the most traumatic experiences in one's life. I do think that this one movie is one that no person has a reason to criticize because we weren't the ones under that rubble. How a person can judge how a movie like this as mediocre is wrong. This is a moment that defines our whole generation and definitely changed the world as we know it. I also hope that people can look away from the fact that it was produced in Hollywood because then they are just contradicting themselves (What about Pearl Harbour, Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, etc. These were terrible events and yet they proved to be something more). So to those out there who can look past that you will definitely enjoy this movie. It was kind, warm-hearted, and courageous of Mr. Stone to bring it to the table."

The characters were lean - not very meaty or developed. The actors did a great job, but unfortunately the script was just lacking UMPH! Some of the lines were clichéd and obvious. Too obvious.

There are no scene showing the crash of the planes to the towers! If I'm not wrong, those scenes (at least from inside the buildings) were contained in the trailers. I was cheated! Besides, I believe that the movie doesn't make any great effect on the people. Maybe some says that it's the director's choice to make a movie which underlines the emotional dimension of the event.

They were gathering equipment, and they were in the concourse between the two buildings, not even in the towers.

It is not about the attacks in any sense other than that the planes in NY serve as the movie's premise. The movie itself is simply a (long) longing for heroic spirit: every single character is as pure and un-nuanced as the most unimaginative American mind could possibly make them. It is a hymn to the ever-yearned-for triumph of the human spirit, marriage and, apparently, to Christianity, as only Jesus, a wife, and at least two children appear to be worth living for in this world.

Many of the heroes that escaped from the first collapse chose to enter the second one knowing full well that it was likely to happen again. Oliver Stone is just living up to what I have come to expect from him but Nicolas Cage and everyone else on this project have proved themselves to be nothing more than low class prostitutes. No supposedly altruistic motive to tell the stories of these heroic men can justify anyone profiting from the tragedy. Unless every single person and every company involved with this film makes the decision to donate 100% of all profits to all the families that lost loved ones on that day I will never again see any project that they are connected with.

It hit me even harder after the film ended because that's when, no doubt, everyone will sit around and reminisce about where they were when the got the news, which I did.<br/><br/>One thing the film does exceptionally well is it doesn't over dramatize the events. The film is very captivating and gut-wrenching, but at no point does it seem like the drama was exaggerated. It seems REAL.<br/><br/>The performances were all great.

"kallebrugergummi66","10","9","20","9 September 2006"," Important movie - for finally bashing the Conspiracy Theorists
","As the headline says, this movie is very important.<br/><br/>At first when i heard that Oliver Stone was making a movie about 9/11, i was afraid that he would make it into a conspiracy-picture about the weapon-industry planning 9/11, blaming it on the Arabs, so that they could have a war on terror. As Stone had made with his movie ""JFK"", about a conspiracy to kill US President John F. Kennedy. Planned by the weapon-industry, so that they could have a war in Vietnam.<br/><br/>But i was relieved when i finally saw this picture to see that there was no conspiracy theory in it. That was good because basically most conspiracy theories about 9/11 are lies - pure lies. <br/><br/>A conspiracy theory is not scientific or logic of nature, it is political of nature. That is why they are so dangerous. Especially when people WANT their leaders to be guilty for everything that has gone wrong. So a conspiracy theory basically is the will of the village idiot. So that the village-idiot can feel important. To take the despair of ones own poor life, and projecting on ones leaders - that is the essence of the conspiracy theory. When a conspiracy theorists makes a theory, he starts with the conclusion, then works his/her way from their. Making the evidence fit, or ignoring it, if it contradicts.<br/><br/>It is the same with the 9/11-theories. Because their is a large element of political demography in the western countries that are not that well represented in the elections. And that is the conspiracy theorists, which are far-left-winged village-idiots. <br/><br/>1) A claim from the Conspiracy Theorists (CT's) is that the Two towers could not have collapsed the way they did. So they have to be brought down by demolition. Fact: these theories are based on 1 guy working in demolition, who said that the collapse of WTC looked like controlled demolition. the CT's have talked about this ever since. Even though that countless of independent demolition experts have stated that it doesn't look exactly like controlled demolition. Because it could have been so many other reasons. The impact of the Boeing 767 damaged the support columns and steel floor trusses, causing an inwards collapse of perimeter columns, which pulled floors straight down. The CT's then claimed that all these many demolition experts, along with 3 levels of American government, Oliver Stone, Paul Greengras and all the Islamic world is part of this massive conspiracy only to fool the American public.<br/><br/>2) The CT's claim that WTC7 was also destroyed by demolition. Fact: the backside, facing WTC was heavily damaged by the collapse of WTC, so much of the front was destroyed. Also the the WTC-collapse made the diesel-generators in the basement of WTC7 spill out much diesel, which burned the WTC7 up from the ground. Their are a couple of pictures which show this, but in their self-selected-ignorance the CT's choose to claim that all of these pictures are faked.... Also it would take weeks for people to set charges with that much explosives, also their would be wires everywhere. But it is easy to claim this when you are a CT's. While sitting in their mothers basement making, during the shifts as sales-clerk at the local mall, the make conspiracy theories - based on much science and engineering-skills which they have no idea of what means, but claim that they do. Most CT's are poor excuses of men of Science. They should not be listened to, but it is very dangerous to let them be ignored - their ignorance can spread, if the CT's is allowed to breed. Therefore the CT's should be taught science, math-skills and so on, on every single occasion we can.<br/><br/>3) Some CT's claim that the Bush-administration made the F-15 stand down. Because else the planes would be shot down. Fact: the defense of USA is more aimed at defending USA against Russian Fighters. And if there was a hijacking they could be used to shot down these airplanes as well. But the whole air-liner-defense is based on the internal transponders in EVERY SINGLE jet-airliner. The air-jets have these transponders, so that the air-traffic-crews can see where all the hundreds and hundreds planes are around USA, and can see what the airplanes are. What the terrorists did was simple, they simply turned the transponders off. Then the F-15 couldn't identify the exact airliners. The CT's didn't know this, or rather they choose to ignore it. Because CT's WANTS to believe in these theories, even if they have to lie or ignore the reel facts.<br/><br/>Conspiracy theories are becoming a religion for these people - it is scary. CT's will never seize to believe i Conspiracy theories, it is their religion. The attack everyone who doesn't believe in them - saying that they are part of this massive conspiracy. CT's wants to keep their prejudges that all Arabs and Muslims are too poor, dumb and joyful to attack USA 9/11.<br/><br/>So prove the CT's wrong, watch this movie."
"Moser88","5","9","20","9 August 2006"," Unnecessary
","September 11th, 2001, whether you believe it to be the largest conspiracy or largest tragedy, was a day that Americans will never forget. It hit without warning, (to the common people, anyway) completely shocking and absorbing everyone into it that had heard the horrible news. It was a dark time; a time you just wanted to be with everyone you loved because you didn't know what was going on. You didn't know if this was the first of many things to come, or what. You didn't feel safe or secure; you were scared. Just about every channel had halted their regular broadcasting in order to cover the story themselves. You couldn't escape it, no matter how hard you tried. America was just hoping to be able to come together, hoping to find these terrorist murderers and give them the payback they deserve.<br/><br/>Now, as I sit here and voice my opinion, trying to give the best, most truthful review I can, I still believe that justice has not been served. The Afghanistan invasion was so brief and small, to a country that had supposedly been responsible. Our country, supposedly the most powerful, efficient machine, wasn't able to take down a dirt digging terrorist, Osama Bin Laden? We then attack a country that we have no proof of wanting to cause our country harm? Where is the justice in this? How are we reassuring the family members of those lost, that we are doing the best we can to make sure that they did not die in vain? Well, is this movie the comforting hand of our government, trying to prove that they care? If they did care, they would have backed their words. If they did care, they wouldn't have turned our great ""tragedy"" into a money making tool. Instead of letting us try to go on with our lives, this movie shoves us right back into this horrible day, trying to make us never forget. Truth is, we wouldn't have forgotten if they didn't make ""Flight 93,"" and ""World Trade Center."" With this movie, it almost seems like their focus was to turn the tide, making this event a successful rescue story, as we witness the heroic rescue of two great men. Whatever your views, whether you support the movie or not, the rescue is inspiring. We see the previous lives of the two policemen, trapped from the two falling towers, and their efforts to survive. The wives await the fate of their husbands as they go through a roller coaster of emotions, and the final outcome of these two men is an enjoyable one. We are told in the beginning of the film that this is true, and God bless them if they come across this.<br/><br/>While the story is decent, the acting is well done, but it doesn't give you any surprises. In other words, you won't really learn anything new that we didn't already know of. The movie is completely supporting of the story given to us by our President and government. Even though there was some good that came out of September 11th, (rescue workers working together to save a few lives of good people) many, MANY good people lost their lives. Their families will never be able to hold them close again, laugh with them, spend their days with them, ever again. Instead of our country moving on, rebuilding our spirit, we're constantly being reminded of maybe the worst day of our lives. Hollywood is making a decent buck from a horrible event. Where is the justice in that? To me, this movie is just completely unnecessary."

The second, more personal 9/11, is the one that New Yorkers witnessed with their own eyes.<br/><br/>I stood on the roof of my Brooklyn apartment building and watched the towers fall. I remember saying ""oh no oh no oh no"" about a thousand times. I was in shock, pure and simple. I thought the death toll would be in the tens of thousands, as I was very aware of how many people could have been in/around the towers. I cried.<br/><br/>I don't want to ramble on here, and I'm not claiming that my reaction to the tragedy is any more valid than anyone else's, even if they were in California during the attacks and only saw them on television.<br/><br/>What I AM saying, however, is that I think New Yorkers in particular could have used a little more time before movies of this nature started coming-out. It's just still too fresh in our collective memory... too raw.<br/><br/>I understand that others, who were not there, may want to feel a little closer to this national tragedy... to remind themselves of just how scared we all were that day. As a New Yorker and an eye witness, however, I need no reminders.

They had no information to suggest our government was evil. They also had nothing that said this was al-Qaeda or Saddam. All they knew was that people were trapped and needed to get out. And their lives depended on their willingness to help.<br/><br/>It's a story of heroes. There are no politics in this film. So drop the politics and let's talk about what it means to be a hero. Cause that's what makes September 11th so great. Sept 11th showed us what people can do in a time of struggle. And if I had to name one reason why I am proud to be an American, I would point to the unity that sprang forth on Sept 11th."

","I must admit, at first I thought, like the majority of people that it was too soon for a movie like this. The pain and loss of this tragic day is all too familiar in the minds of most of the world. It was this day that made me join the U.S. Marines and brought us to where we are in the world today. But after seeing this movie, I cannot emphasize that this movie is coming out at the right time. People need to be reminded that this day changed our lives forever, but also of the heroism that is in each of us.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone could not have done better. There is no Hollywood elements in this movie. The only CGI I noticed, were the scenes of Ground Zero and superimposing the towers back into the cityscape. There was no elements of controversy or conspiracy theories, just the story. It is a very rough watch, though. The sounds alone are enough to give you goosebumps. And while you never see the towers hit by the planes, the looks in the actors' eyes are enough to let you know what is going on. The entire cast and crew did superbly in recreating the chaos that followed the first plane hitting. Nothing was overdone or underdone. This is as close to a perfect movie that I've seen in a long time. See it if you are ready to and can handle the raw emotion involved."

It is about Two Survivors. There side of the story. Please enjoy this movie with an open mind. It's a beautiful and heartwarming story of survival. The movie is about truth and unconditional love. Please understand that the movie does not provide the violence that we experienced that unforgettable day. The movie shows respect for the nation and of the deceased.

","Directed by Oliver Stone and starring Nic Cage? How could it go wrong - but it did, in many ways.<br/><br/>First, it didn't really show much heroism. It's not particularly heroic to be caught up in events outside your control. There was some bravery shown by the rescuers at the end but they were really just doing the job they had been trained to do and are paid to do.<br/><br/>The main group of rescuers had given up. They had called off the search for the night. It was the two marines who found the cops and called the rescuers back in.<br/><br/>It followed the effect on the families of the survivors. But what about the effect on the families of those who went in with Sgt McLoughlin but didn't come out? They must have gone through the same period of uncertainty - but with a less happy outcome.<br/><br/>Generally, a disappointment"
"Derek237","5","6","12","24 September 2006"," Oliver Stone: Hollywood Conformist
","I would definitely say that I am a fan of Oliver Stone's work, but the sad truth is that he hasn't really made anything particularly exceptional in the last decade. Alexander was considered a huge failure (though I thought it was good), and ever since its negative response and poor box office performance, Stone seems desperately eager to please. First, he makes a ""director's cut"" of Alexander, cutting out anything too ""gay,"" and now he has made World Trade Center. His clear intention is to go against every expectation an audience would have when they hear Oliver Stone has directed a film about 9/11. There is no political agenda, it is more about emotion and character, but it just plainly and simply is not good, and drags on way too long.<br/><br/>It isn't completely bad, the first act was actually very good. I had a feeling that it would get even better after the tower collapse scene, and I was more than ready to commit myself emotionally to these characters. However, it did not get better; it gradually became pretty bad, resorting to shameless emotional manipulation complete with an over-abundance of flashbacks to back when the two men were happy in their lives with their families, and the ""for your consideration"" speeches from the wives.<br/><br/>What really just pisses me off about this movie is that even though it's a true story (and a great, happy, positive one!), it barely takes into account the fact that thousands of people lost their lives that day. It's a sappy, sugar-coated tale that treats the audience like infants, assuming that a movie about a family of the officers that didn't survive and how they have to deal with it just wouldn't sell enough tickets. The message we're left with at the end of the film is unbelievably moronic: apparently, in times of need, people will do what's right, and help other people, and shucks, you know what- that's good in my book. Give me a break. This movie is insulting to peoples' intelligence, their emotions, and it's also insulting to anyone who lost someone they loved on that terrible day.<br/><br/>World Trade Center really is everything you could hope that a 9/11 movie wouldn't be. This is something you'd expect from Michael Bay. What's worse is that it's even getting Oscar buzz, which I feel it is unworthy of. The profoundly superior 9/11 film is United 93, which is blunt, frank, and treats the audience and the 9/11 victims with a courageous respect that we just don't see enough of in films based on true tragedies. I left World Trade Center feeling angry and frustrated for many, many reasons. It is one of the year's most disappointing and unnecessary films.<br/><br/>My rating: 5/10"
"jlyn4eternity","3","6","12","12 August 2006"," Waste of time. Save your money!!!
","This movie is not your typical Oliver Stone movie. Its actually a little better than his average movie. However its boring and misses so many aspects of what we all think of when we recapture 9/11 events. We didn't even see a plane crash or the building come down. The anticipation of those types of events make us emotional and is always good for film. Most of the scenes were boring and I actually fell asleep. The name of the movie doesn't deserve to be called World trade center. Instead it should have been called ""Nicolas Cage trapped under the rubble."" Those events were inspiring and I feel for the trapped people - however there are so many things that were missed. It seemed as if they tried to twist the events around and make it so there was some positive outcomes on 9/11. Well if you had no clue what had happened on 9/11 and saw this movie, you wouldve said ""Thats not so bad, and there was somewhat of a happy ending."" But thats not the case. There was absolutely nothing good about 9/11. There was tons of tragic moments and frightened people worldwide. This film failed to let viewers understand the impact and the severeness of how significant 9/11 events were. Oliver Stone is an amateur. He has not made one good movie ever. Totally overrated. Platoon was OK but nothing worthy of an Oscar. I was extremely disappointed with this Trade center movie because the perspective was too narrow. I think of the trapped officers as heroes - but guess what, they survived. What about the fallen ones? I think they deserve more recognition."

","The tragedy of 9/11 was the targeting of civilians on a beautiful September morning. Those who boarded a plane to visit family or return to family, who took a flight for business had no expectation that their transportation would become a terrible weapon. And those who went to work in New York and Washington, D.C. --- just another day of work, had no expectation that their mass murder would be a statement made by fanatics.<br/><br/>""World Trade Center"" makes a travesty of the tragedy. By taking the view that the most important and pertinent story to tell is of two Port Authority policemen (who survive the ordeal) is a satisfactory summation of the tragedy is: 1) terrible storytelling and, 2) shows tremendous disrespect to those who were the focus of the terrorists...everyday Americans doing everyday things.<br/><br/>The film is technically brilliant, as one would expect from Oliver Stone. But it is also heart-breaking, not for the story it tells, but for what it does not."

I find it sad that Oliver Stone, (A well respected director) would put fourth such little effort as I have seen in this film.

","Anyone who lives in the US is aware that Americans are extremely good at ripping off their own; from the White House to the local gas station, they're all out to screw you with deception, misleading commercials, inflated prices, etc. Why? Because the American way of life revolves around one thing and one thing only: MONEY. If you have it, you're OK, if not, you're nothing and no-one. This is often called the ""American Dream"". Americans don't care who they harm or hurt in pursuit of the ""mighty dollar"". Watch any US cable TV for examples. US movies are not exempt from this practice and this movie, WORLD TRADE CENTER, in particular, is a prime example of yet another great rip-off, i.e. dwelling on the public's still-raw emotions of 9/11 and cobbling together a generic disaster movie, knowing full well that it WILL make it at the box office simply because of the title! Every American will probably see this movie eventually. Had this movie been entitled anything else such as ""Buried Alive!"" or ""Three Days in Hell"", it would flop en route to the box office. WTC, directed by Oliver Stone (who really should know better and rise above cheap box office money tricks) is actually NOT about the 9/11 attacks and events at all, but merely about a few select individuals who happened to be involved in the attacks, as were TENS OF THOUSANDS of other people. This should have been a gripping, riveting movie that kept us glued to our seats for two hours and which wracked us with a gamut emotions. Instead, it's another generic mish-mosh of some 9/11 scenes and a ""Day-In-The-Life of..."" humdrum disaster flick script. Remember the 'Airport' movies and 'Earthquake'? Same thing, different color. Remove Nicholas Cage from the movie and you've got . . . squat. For such a powerful theme, i.e. 9/11, this flick sure does disappoint and I found myself bored to tears through most it as it was so predictable with all the schmaltzy script and cheesy acting. I guess Oliver Stone too has fallen prey to the 'buck', forsaking content, information and entertainment value; the entire POINT of a movie. Any movie. I sincerely hope that one day a good movie IS made about the events of 9/11, even if it is 4 hours long. This one sure ain't it. I suspect that anyone who DID lose someone in the attacks will not be impressed that their loved ones are given the briefest mention in this two-hour 'infomentary'. This flick could have taken place anywhere in the world, in any building at any time. Picking the 'Twin Towers' as the 'theme' was simply deceptive. My condolences to the victims of 9/11, I wish this movie had offered an explanation or perhaps closure for some. I have a 14-month old daughter. I wonder if one day I will be able to let her watch a movie that accurately portrays the events of 9/11. So far, it seems not. Overall rating? Simply pooh and an embarrassment to the film industry at large."

","well; maybe Mr stone feels somewhat humbled by his big budget mess, Alexander, but here we have a toned down (for Mr stone) made for TV film about the WORLD TRADE CENTRE on that fateful day on sept 11. this film appears to be receiving very good reviews, and i admit that it's hard to criticize this film, because of it's fine production values and technical work.the cinematography, the sounds and sound editing were very good. for me, the performances by the women, two of my favorite actors, Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal, is what made this film bearable. it was great seeing Patty d'Arbanville again too, although she had precious little to do in the show. we have seen this before; the women, waiting, hoping, anguished, to hear anything about their loved ones and their men....it is done superbly here, and very much what it must have been like for everyone; not really sure about what was happening; what to do or what to think. this aspect of the film was crafted and performed very well. Nicolas Cage was amazingly believable and subdued. but then, when you are trapped below a ton of rubble and can barely speak, this seems logical. it was great seeing Michael Pena, from CRASH again too. but ultimately, i found this film claustrophobic (albeit much less so than the officers caught below!)dull, and one-toned. except for the vision Pena sees of a Christ figure with a bottle of water, this film seemed like a well-done Sunday made for television effort. i wouldn't pay to see this again, although perhaps it will translate better on the small screen. i give oliver credit for doing his homework and bringing this film down to a microcosm and story of two courageous survivors and their families. it was also tasteful that he didn't graphically show us what the world saw again and again on that day. the film did a fair job of recreating what it must have been like for the police and the fire-fighters, and the hawk marine, at ground zero, through their eyes, which were full of horror, sorrow,and disbelief. having said that, i wouldn't recommend that anyone rush to this film. it seemed by the numbers, regardless of how well it was done. i would rather have seen an oliver stone film about such a controversial and pivotal event in global politics with the flair that is oliver stone. i would say, put Alexander away and sock it to us. was this film ""controversial""? no way.

","There is no doubt some great technical work in the film, but that is where the genius stops, and the Hollywood begins. This film doesn't try and tell an original story, but rather tries to recreate the horrible insecure feeling of doubt and horror we all felt during 9/11 and then the unity we all felt thereafter...and fails horribly. Not only does it fail to focus on the main events during the characters real story, but it creates the most annoying and offensive character to ever grace a screen in the generic Christian Marine who comes and saves the day. Stone looses his ability to tell a controversial story effectively and thus creates a film that seems inspired by the writers at hallmark, and not the pride and courage created out of everyday men like the two in this film."
"TheQuietStorm","4","6","13","29 August 2006"," I don't know about awful, but....
","I'm drawing a long breath before I gather my thoughts to comment on this film. I am a native New Yorker that grew up with the Twin Towers standing in my bedroom window, something you can count on even from the distance of my humble apartment in Brooklyn to Manhattan. In fact, the only time one couldn't see the buildings from my place was during a snow storm and a bad thunder storm. On September 11, 2001, I was rushing through the crowds flowing from the bridges, armed with my 35-mm still camera. I was running into all sorts of people, from co-workers to people I haven't seen in eons. On my way to Manhattan, when a co-worker informs me that the Twin Towers had collapsed, my heart sank. Not only was the inspiration of my life destroyed and gone forever, I remember thinking about all of the people who perished as well.<br/><br/>So, when I heard that Hollywood was making a film about 9/11 and the World Trade Center, I recall hoping that ""they better get it right."" Getting it right means capturing the life altering changes in the lives of everyone due to this tragic event, mainly the untold stories. This film missed the mark.<br/><br/>Granted, the moments Stone was able to photograph in lower Manhattan was stupendous. One didn't have to be in New York City at the time to see that his vision was carried out in full respect to the moments in lower Manhattan. When the buildings collapsed upon our heroes Cage and Pena, it felt real enough for me personally as if I was experiencing it with them. Also, the depiction of Ground Zero was right on the money. I worked a few blocks from the WTC and when I went back, after we were allowed to, I would linger in the area, absorbing the sight of the mountains of twisted steel in quiet shock.<br/><br/>I also can't deny Maria Bello's performance as the grievous wife of Cage, dealing with her anxious sometimes rude children and family members as they struggle to remain optimistic of Cage's chances of survival. And that crisis towards the end with Pena making a request, sacrificing himself in some way for Cage wasn't due to the great screenplay writing but more to one of the actual stories revolved around the event, a script that only God Himself can pen using Pena's character as this symbol of courage and faith. So, to say that the film was awful is unfairly disregarding all of the many complimentary aspects about the film that I had just mentioned.<br/><br/>However, the film also suffered in major departments that keeps it from being considered a great piece of cinema in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>Stone and the screenwriter failed to show how the event changed the characters. That would've taken it to the next level. Instead, they tried to show us uneventful moments of their lives through flashbacks. For every flashback, there could've been moments that started with fears that were keeping them from obtaining their life's wishes, along with failures at stubbornly doing things their own way, glimpses into the lives they aspire to live, models of people actually living the life they're aspiring for, obstacles, etc.<br/><br/>There was no moment of truth that solidified the character's arcs, but then again, there wasn't much character in any of them to arc.<br/><br/>Also, there's not much of a story you can tell cinematically through the eyes of characters lying still for two hours of film while being buried under two million tons of debris. It worked in the ""English Patient,"" as we journeyed with him on his past as he lies in bed with third degree burns. At least in the flashbacks of the ""English Patient"" there was a beginning, middle and end, which is the best way to use a flashback. In this story, the flashbacks were mostly portraits of tender moments, little smiles and characters silently saying ""I love you"" with adoring eyes -- none of which had anything dramatic going on.<br/><br/>I also agree with most people in here that at times, if felt as if the filmmakers were capitalizing off of sentimental moments with melancholy music to underscore. They felt like cheap shots I couldn't help but roll my eyes at from time to time.<br/><br/>And if it is true that the Marine guy that first discovered them was someone of color, that would automatically take a star away from the film for me. If we're telling an honest depiction of what had happened then why will the filmmakers leave that vital information out? Bad enough the media plays the events some times as if people of color weren't really affected. Until I know the truth, my rating remains a four for now.<br/><br/>Overall, I see that the story of 9/11 can be compared to horrific moments in world history like the Holocaust and the African-American slavery period in relation to Hollywood's portrayals of these dark times. It's going to take a while before a great film will be released dramatizing the events of 9/11 accurately and powerfully. ""United 93"" was very good, almost vastly superior to ""World Trade Canter."" However, it's just that one story of the thousands. It took a while for ""Schindler's List"" to come out since the end of World War II. And African-Americans are still waiting for the great story that can take the world's understanding of American slavery to a higher, more enlightening level. This is the same for 9/11. There are thousands of stories revolved around the event. All these producers have to do is find the best one, keeping in mind that they need to be honest and considerate of the victims, their families and the nation."

It created a theme that stated, ""yes a great evil was commit that day but there was also tremendous courage and goodness that prevailed that day"". In that sense, it was a beautiful day. The movie told everything as it happened and did not exaggerate anything.

","For some, it may still be too soon to go to the movies to watch a tale of 9/11. For those who are ready, World Trade Center is worth watching. The film is tastefully made, casts minimal attention to the more sensational aspects of the fateful day, and devotes the lion's share of the picture telling a gripping, true-life, story of two port authority police officers who were trapped in the rubble. There is no discussion of how or why this tragedy occurred. The film is simply a tribute to the chaos on the ground as the day unfolded, and the heroism of the police, firefighter, and others, who literally risked their lives to rescue others. Although the story is set in and around the World Trade Center complex on September 11, 2001, it could just as easily have been set in the Sago Coal Mine, or some other place where people are trapped below ground in a dangerous setting. The real story here is about the camaraderie of the two stars as they struggle to survive, and the emotional difficulties endured by their families and friends and events unfold. As the attack on the World Trade Center becomes more of a part of history, and less a part of the current news, more sensational movies about the events of that day are likely to be made. It will be interesting to see how this movie holds up."

All in all though, it reminded me way too much of Ladder 49. The dialogue itself was sub-par on most cases; incredibly predictable and cheesy. Maybe I'm a heartless shaft for saying this, but they seemed to rely almost entirely on people's memory of the event to provide any kind of emotional value.<br/><br/>I'm probably just a jerk, but this movie bored me, and I really expected a movie based on this event to have more value than this did.

","Greetings again from the darkness. There is a bit of NASCAR appeal to Oliver Stone movies. With the car races, there is always a certain segment of viewers who kind of hope for a massive pile-up featuring fire balls. With Stone's movies, many can't wait to see his political agenda or twisting of facts to ""prove"" the newest conspiracy theory. It is with both relief and dismay that I report ""WTC"" is a right down the fairway presentation of one sub-plot of the tragic 9/11 events.<br/><br/>Port Authority Police officers John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno were two of the twenty people rescued from the tower rubble after the collapses. Knowing that much going in prevents any real dramatic suspense from being generated. That said, watching human pain and suffering is never easy and with excellent directing and acting, it can still be fascinating to behold. Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena are effective as McLoughlin and Jimeno. The dynamic of their near hopeless state is staged very well. However, the real story here is the families endurance and dealings with the not knowing the status of their loved ones. Playing the buried officer's wives are the wonderful Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello. Both bring as much heart and emotion to these women's actions as possible. Yes, it borders on heavy-handed melodrama at times, but don't forget these are tragically real events.<br/><br/>As with most Stone films, the supporting cast is very good. Included are Nicky Katt, Stephen Dorff, Frank Whaley, Jay Hernandez, Patti D'Arbanville and Harmonica Sunshine (playing a hooker, but I just love that name!). Don't miss the cameos by the real life McLoughlin and Jimeno and brace yourself for the entire sequence of the disaster and shock of those in the middle of it. This is no Michael Bay schlock action movie, this is a combination of amazing sets that we are all too familiar with.<br/><br/>The little human story of this horrible time in our history can provide hope to all in regards to the strength of the soul and spirit of so many."
"ironhorse_iv","6","3","5","11 September 2017"," I can clearly say, 'United We Stand'- that 2006's 'United 93' was indeed the better movie about 9/11 than this movie. Yet, this film isn't half bad. It was just alright.
","Oliver Stone's 2006 film, 'World Trade Center' follows the close biographical survival story of two Port Authority policemen, John McLouglin (Nicholas Cage) & William Jimeno (Michael Pena), whom became trapped under the rumble of the once-World Trade Center, after the skyscraper collapse, during the events of the 9/11 Terrorist Attack on New York City. Without spoiling the movie, too much, although, it's been 5 years since the tragic event, when this movie was made. I still think, films like this, were greenlight, a little too soon. After all, there was still an empty lot in Ground Zero, where WTC once stood; haven't yet, been replace by One World Trade Center that open in 2014. Another thing, although, producers of the film met with all relevant September 11 victims groups before production began to inform them of the intention of the film. New York City absolutely prohibited any filmmaking of any kind about Sept. 11 in the Big Apple besides the New York Port Authority Building, not wanting any recreation of destruction or chaos to be display for the public. The filmmakers were not even allowed to film actors looking upward toward where the towers would be. Instead, those shots were created in sound stages in Los Angeles, using limited CGI or badly intercut, archive stock footage. Hints, why some of the buildings that they use as a city background look a little too small in height, and far apart for an ideal depiction of NYC. Sadly, even some real-life characters had to be fictional, due to family members, not wanting their demise love-ones names, to be portray in a bad light. It really hurts, historic accuracy and somewhat confused others, such was the circumstance of supporting characters, like Marine Sgt. Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon) whom some viewers saw as fiction. In this case, he was really real, much like the other Marine Sgt. Jason Thomas (William Mapother), whom happens to be African-American, in real-life. Meanwhile, there were also plenty of examples of characters deaths, being omitted due to demands of love-ones, not wanting it; which in return, make the portrayal of some characters, unfinished. It even made some characters seem like they took their own life. Its warning sides like this that shows, that the wounds of that day, have not yet healed in NYC. Already, the idea of Hollywood profiting off, a tragic event for studio gain, was a little inky & not cool. It didn't help that the money earn from this film, was not given to, many charities of the victims, involves in this recreated storytelling. Sadly, I don't think, that was the case, with this movie. Still, regardless of that, I found Oliver Stone to be respectful enough to the real-life story, not to delve too much into misguided conspiracy theories like he did with 1991's 'JFK'. Although, it does depict a few events that blatantly contradict official explanations of what happen in real-life, such as the film's showing of TV footage of the precipitous collapse of WTC 7 and the attack on Israel. However, I'm willing to let that past, due to the fact that confusion was very rampant, that day. Glad, there was little-to-no political themes. At least, not until his later film, 2008's 'W.'. Another thing that I found alright about this movie, is the acting. While, I wouldn't say, this is Cage's best role, but it's far from his worst. Cage is fine, here. He honestly tries his best, by focusing on accurately speaking with a New York accent. And to also capture the fear and claustrophobia of McLoughlin's ordeal, Cage spent hours in a sensory-deprivation tank. So mad props to him for that, even if Michael Pena still out-acted him, in this film. Pena really look like he was in the brick of death, with his pale face of fear and pain, even with his face, cover in mostly darkness, during the second & third act. That's how amazing, he was. Given that, I have to say, the supporting cast was equally as good, but if I have to nitpick, I felt that the filmmakers didn't give female actress, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello as the two-police officers' wives, Allison Jimeno & Donna McLoughlin, much to work with. Overall: While, not as good as other buried alive trapped films like director, Danny Boyle's 2010's film '127 Hours', which had better pacing, editing, and music. Given the epic intense violence of the Towers' falls and the thoroughness of destruction evident at Ground Zero, it was still interesting enough to watch a movie about people trying to survive during its aftermath, even if it's super pitch dark & hard to see. Much like director Paul Greengrass movie, 'United 93' about United Airlines Flight 93 — which crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers apparently tried to overpower the terrorist hijackers, also released in 2007, the movie will also be very subjective and hard to watch for some, emotionally. Nevertheless, at least, 2006's 'World Trade Center' is more accuracy, watchable & respectful, than more recent films about 9/11, like director, Martin Guigui's film '9/11'. Check 'World Trade Center' in its place of that crap. That's for sure, but if you have a choice. See 'United 93'. Now, that's a powerful movie."
"jrarichards","8","3","5","27 June 2015"," Actually a profoundly moving vignette helping with focus on a story too big to ever tell
","I watched this for the first time nine years on from its year of production and nearly 14 on from the actual event. Happily, I turned to the IMDb reviews only after seeing the film, and find it surprising how much negativity there is around. The destruction of the World Trade Centre is obviously too big a story to tell in any single film, and it is also a story that should not be told in that way - in a non-documentary film - ever. But that does not mean that the event should not be dealt with at all, and here the focus is primarily on a rescue - one of the very few, and the rescuers - of which there were very, very many, including the rather incongruous bunch presented in this (true-story) film. The fact that the act of terror took most of its victims outright in a variety of more or less horrible ways does not mean that we ""crow"" or paint a ludicrously optimistic picture if we focus in one film on people who were actually rescued. Nor does it mean that we paint an unsubtle, gung-ho picture if we view recreations of the work of the hundreds (thousands?) who risked their lives (and very definitely their health, given the severe pollution on site) in the desperate hope that more might be extracted from the rubble. Indeed, to me this was not a particularly jingoistic presentation (and one would not particularly expect one from Oliver Stone). But it is moving and does inspire patriotism for humanity, as opposed to merely the United States. This is inevitable, natural and right, given that these are recreations of real events, and happily full of the weird, chancy, ad hoc, eclectic features that real-life events almost always present. Ultimately, then, a true story is told in a moving way (how could it be otherwise, given the circumstances?), and there is no reason I can see to dismiss this film (as so many have seemed to) as exploitative, over-emotional, over-patriotic or too inclined to focus on the few survivors, or anything else. This is a story worth telling, needing telling, and I did still feel enlightened further as regards the catastrophic and barbarous September 11 events. These cannot be bad things..."
"takeahikeimbusy","1","9","23","14 August 2006"," Terrible Movie
","This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was so boring, I left half way through the movie. It was like Ladder 49, except with no funny parts, no suspense, no likable characters, and extremely boring. The families of the missing officers were so annoying, that it was hard to feel bad for them. The documentaries I've seen about the world trade center were 100 times more interesting than the movie was. I would have thought that the trade center going down would have been a huge scene in the middle of the movie, but the biggest suspense was a water cooler inside an office shaking. There was not even a visual of the plane hitting, just a shadow of it coming. I understand that some people think its too painful to watch the attack in such detail, but you know what, if you don't want to watch it, DON'T. Overall, for an event with so much emotion and sadness, I don't understand how someone could have made a movie out of it that I had absolutely no feeling for. The event was terrible, and very sad, the movie was just uneventful and boring, and extremely poorly made. What a disappointment from Oliver Stone. Don't waste your money on it."

","Having had an entire American Express office of co-workers and local ""town"" friends killed during 9/11, I was hesitant to see this movie (did NOT see United 93); However, I bucked up and went to an early afternoon show where there was approximately 50-60 people in the theater(unusual for this time of day); At various points throughout the movie, several people ""left"", only to be heard sobbing at the side by the entrance to the screening area...they all came back eventually and instead of going back to their original seats, sat in the front row instead(where I was sitting as well); I was very surprised to see that Oliver Stone actually handled the making of the movie with uncustomary restraint and respect! It basically follows the day of 2 MTA officers who were on the scene by the time the 2nd plane had crashed; I won't go into anymore detail other then to say that the 2 primary characters were numbers 18 and 19 pulled alive out of 20 total and how their individual families/friends dealt with the goings on throughout the day; I wouldn't be surprised if some Academy Awards are contemplated for what I felt was an unusually ""reverent"" handling of a very touchy subject...I give it 9 out of 10 stars and will see it again!"

","I just came back from the movie and found myself being very angry. While it was a very good movie, I don't understand it's purpose. If the reason Oliver Stone made this movie is so that proceeds can go to the victims of 9/11, that I can stand behind. If they are going in his pocket that is not right. Normally I don't think like that. I don't see the benefit of it other than to open old and in some cases still raw wounds for people. Does anyone know if money is going to the victims family, or if this movie helped victims and there families in some way? If I knew there response it would help me understand the reason for this movie to have been made."

Instead of one man jumping to his death, show dozens raining down. Tell it!!! The air was PINK!!! All we see are a few reaction shots. We see minor injuries instead of a ""Gone with the Wind"" devastation of acres of screaming men, one of the highest impact shots in movie history. If you're going to tell the story of World Trade or Rwanda, you don't pull punches just so kids can see it.<br/><br/>There should also be dozens of heroes saying ""I'm going in!"" as a hundred others rush forward behind them. There should more than one or two comments about getting ""them."" When Kennedy was killed we were instantly ready to quit college and jobs to fix bayonets and get ""them."" There is merit in intermittently bringing the story very personally down to two lives and families, but this is way too narrow and calm. Micro instead of macro. Both can be done alternately, personal then broadly. Way too much down time, at least 30 minutes of conversation between two trapped men.<br/><br/>However, once again we're going to see ""king's new clothes"" reviews, people afraid not to like something noble.<br/><br/>In spite of it all I WAS in tears a number of times."

","I have to say, Oliver Stone surprised me. Politics were left aside. Grand standing was left aside. This is an incredible delicate and inspiring movie.<br/><br/>Stone aptly recaptures many of the moments burned into our minds. The paper filled air and streets. Soot and ash covered survivors and rescue workers. Exhausted rescuers. They are all here and handled with class and dignity.<br/><br/>I was worried that Stone would use this movie, this event, for his own political ideals. But instead he has respectfully paid homage to but one of the heroic and inspirational stories that came out of the 9/11 tragedy. All actors, across the board, are to be applauded for their performance. This could have easily become a soap opera.<br/><br/>When the movie quietly ended, as the final update to the story flashed on the screen and the names of the port authority's finest that didn't make it home that day scrolled, the theater was deathly silent. Just the sound of feet slowly walking and the sound of people choking back tears. It was an experience of terror and of hope.

"gregsrants","7","6","14","10 August 2006"," Gripping and Powerful, but no masterpiece
","Gripping. Powerful. Masterpiece.<br/><br/>These are just three of the words that have appeared in various print reviews for the new September 11th themed movie World Trade Centre.<br/><br/>Directed by Oliver Stone (Platoon, Nixon) and starring Nicholas Cage (Matchstick Men), the movie chronicles the hours of two Port Authority Police Officers that were trapped in the rubble of the fallen World Trade Centre after the terrorist attacks on that fateful morning in 2001.<br/><br/>The film's opening is quiet. It starts quietly at 3:59AM on September 11th, 2001. There is no rousing or exasperated musical score as Stone discretely takes us through Manhattan as we see people on their way to work as the two towers stand tall in the backdrop. In just five minutes we are reminded of the beauty of the buildings. The majestic presence they had over the New York skyline, and the horrors that were just hours away.<br/><br/>As we meet the families of John McLoughlin (Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) we can anticipate the hardship and emotional tear jerking that will ensue. John is a father of four young children while Will has a wife (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who is five month pregnant with their baby daughter.<br/><br/>These two unknowing heroes gear up for work as if it were another day and are called soon after to the Towers to help with the evacuations. As they prepare emergency supplies and head for the elevator, we hear the crackling and buckling of concrete and metal that snaps in Dolby around the theatre. We know what is going to happen, but the audience was still on the edge of its seat until the inevitable occurs.<br/><br/>To Stone's credit, he does not show the two towers crumbling down except for on the televisions in many background shots. Instead, he gives us a first hand impression as to what it must have been like for these two police officers who were in the lobby and running towards the elevator shaft for safety.<br/><br/>The next hour and forty five minutes are split between listening to the two trapped men try and struggle to stay awake and alive while their families cope with not knowing their ultimate fate.<br/><br/>World Trade Centre comes on the cusp of the five year anniversary of the event. Some media types claim that America may not yet be ready to relive the experiences of the day that will live in infamy. But World Trade Centre is a movie of hope. Of American's working together to save the lives of those trapped in the rubble. It is the American spirit lived through the world's eyes on that fateful summers day.<br/><br/>It is Stone that should get the most credit here. He has constructed a movie that on paper doesn't seem that deep. Two men are trapped nearly the whole movie and cannot move while other rescue workers go about their jobs to find survivors. Without the backdrop of the event, the movie would never have been made as having Nicholas Cage's face being the only thing that can be seen on screen for ¾ of the film would be considered a waste of talent otherwise.<br/><br/>But Stone casually brings the actual and/or inspired events of the two men gracefully to the screen while still projecting a sense of urgency and fear for those sitting at home awaiting word about their loved ones.<br/><br/>Call me insensitive, but World Trade Centre and United 93 would make a great double bill. Both are based on real accounts of the day and both show the chaos of the situation and how normal men rose to the occasion to become heroes.<br/><br/>Gripping? Yes. Powerful? Certainly. But a Masterpiece? No. World Trade Centre does have its flaws and in the Stone filmography, it ranks behind both Platoon and JFK. But the movie is above average. It will have you relive moments that are still as clear as the day they occurred. And you will watch again one more time in fear for the lives of those lost that day.<br/><br/>www.robertsreviews.com"
"zetes","8","5","11","18 December 2006"," Not as good as United 93... but still pretty good
","The second major American film depicting events of 9/11/01. It's greatest crime is that it's not as good as Paul Greengrass' United 93, which was the first. Otherwise, it's a rather good movie that would have been seen as restrained, had it not been for the utterly restrained, documentary-esquire United 93. Yes, in comparison, it does seem overly melodramatic, but it really isn't. The first 35 minutes or so are about as good as United 93. Nicholas Cage and Michael PeÃ±a star as two Port Authority police officers who are sent to the World Trade Center after the first tower has been hit by a plane. By the time they arrive, the second plane has hit, but the cops are completely unaware of what is happening. While attempting to transport equipment from WTC 5 to WTC 1 via an underground tunnel, the second tower collapses, killing many of the officers and trapping the survivors under rubble. After WTC 1 collapses, only Cage and PeÃ±a are left alive, but pinned down and unable to move. The film's major problem comes in here. Where it's easy to appreciate the horrors of these guys' situation, the film becomes inert. At this point, the focus shifts over to their suffering wives, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello. The role of a cop's wife is always a pretty dull one, so you have to give credit to the two actresses for giving the characters at least some personality. And there are a couple of great parts here, too, like when Gyllenhaal has to run to the pharmacy. On the way back, her brother, who is driving, stops at a red light, and she just jumps out of the car and starts walking home. The movie still does lag during this period. One of the officers (PeÃ±a) has a vision of Christ, which I'm sure will bother some. It might have been better of Stone not to depict this literally, but I certainly don't begrudge this real person a religious vision, especially in these circumstances. The film picks up again when the two men are discovered by a couple of Marines. My only problem thereafter was a couple of references to revenge, which seems off the focus of the other themes of the picture, and a possible, though probably not purposeful, connection made between 9/11 and Iraq. The musical score, by Craig Armstrong, is surprisingly subtle for the most part (and excellent). I'm not really sure where the acidic criticism comes from. I saw more than one person claim that Oliver Stone had lost his spine on this one. What did you want him to do? Give time to the multitude of moronic conspiracy theories that exist around 9/11? Some of the conspiracy theories concerning JFK are at least somewhat believable. None of the ones surrounding 9/11 are. If Scorsese had directed this picture, the only difference would have been a lot more cutting. And he would be an even more sure thing for the Oscars. Honestly, while not at the level of United 93, World Trade Center is a worthwhile and quite a powerful movie in its own right."

","I had the privilege of watching the World Trade Center at an advanced screening in Montreal. Without analyzing the movie much, let me get into a brief overview: The movie is about the police, the fire fighters and all those who went in to rescue and help evacuate people from the burning WTC. After the WTC collapsed, there were many people trapped (but still alive) under the rubble. This story revolves around the lives of 2 Port Authority Police Department cops who volunteered in the rescue efforts and got trapped in the rubble.<br/><br/>The leads are played by Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena. Solid delivery from a talented cast backed by good direction. Excellent sound and visual effects recreating the entire experience of the WTC. Based on true events and real life stories, you will re-live the heroic struggles of those who made it happen. Bottomline - A decent watch."

The films have different styles and they present diverse perspectives of a day that has limitless faces. Both are thoughtful, intelligent, and emotionally potent. They provoke and challenge, asking us not only to face our memories but to question our future. By being less political than he has ever been, Stone offers a movie that can be embraced by movie-goers who sit on the left side of the theater, in the center, or on the right.

","There were many who worried that Oliver Stone was going to weave a twisted tale about 9/11 with this movie, given their view of some of his past work. I can assure you it is anything but that. It is a fitting tribute to the rescue workers who did their job, and risked everything to save innocent lives. It will remind you of how you felt when 9/11 happened. Personally I think this is a valuable service to all of us, but there will be those who do not wish to be reminded, and they should not watch this movie. I do not recommend it for children, as it viscerally portrays death and destruction, and horrific moments. It is not gratuitous though.<br/><br/>The movie is mainly about two Port Authority officers who go in attempting to rescue people in the first World Trade tower that was hit, and the families of these officers. A group of Port Authority officers join them to go into the building, but they are killed when the tower they have entered collapses. The movie mainly focuses on what the two officers who survive the collapse, and their families, go through emotionally. The two officers are trapped under a mountain of steel and concrete. They re-evaluate their lives in small and large ways. The way that the movie truly captures how most of us felt that day is it shows the miracle of 9/11. The experience brought us closer together than we ever would have thought. Where our hearts were usually closed off, due to the hubbub of daily life, they were opened to each other.<br/><br/>The movie also portrays the good spirit of public servants and citizens who came from across the country to help. It shows police officers from other states, a marine, and a paramedic, who answer their own inner call to duty, coming to the World Trade Center site to help with the clean-up and rescue. It also shows their devotion to family and their willingness to risk it all to save lives. The marine is portrayed as a Christian, and surprisingly Stone does not disparage this, but honors it.<br/><br/>I say bravo to Oliver Stone, Nicholas Cage, and the other actors in this movie. You have done a public service. You have honored and respected the work and the memory of those who risked and in many cases paid the ultimate sacrifice to try to save lives."

This is a movie that everyone should see and should be shown every year on the anniversary to high school students. It is almost five years and I feel it was the perfect time to release the movie because many of us have forgotten or at least put the day behind us. And the day should always be in the front of our minds. Just go to NY (if you ever were there and saw the towers)and look at the skyline and you feel it deep down inside.

But I think that the comic relief was overkill...and many members of my audience laughed a bit too much. This wasn't a comedy! The lighthearted dialogue was intentional, but a bit overkill. Overall I think my biggest gripe was the script...it wasn't the best screenplay, but the story was fine, the dialogue was not. I'd rent it...unless you are really anxious.

First things first, this movie is not mostly focused on everything we have seen in the media, and everything that is already stuck in our heads, but instead, this movie brings out a whole new perspective to us, of what two port authority officers went through while being stuck in the debris. You learn new things about the disaster in this movie about things that they really never broadcasted in the media. Overall, I think this movie was absolutely phenomenal, but being from New York, it was a bit difficult for me to watch this movie, the entire theater was in tears, and at times I just couldn't control my emotions.......and I'm a 6'2, 240 lbs guy who never cries during movies. So to straighten up all the commotion with the media, I feel this movie is necessary for the public to see exactly what went on in the eyes of our heroes, however, this movie came out just a little too fast, especially for those who may still have the pain in their hearts, this movie is just a constant reminder."

"editor-299","8","6","15","27 July 2006"," Stone's 'Trade center' a powerful, gut-wrenching film
","Being the cynic that I am, and having to watch two or three films per week, has left me a bit jaded at times. Try as I might to enjoy a movie for nothing more than entertainment value, and not as a project to critique, I still fall into the constant reviewer trap. honestly, it can be a bit disconcerting.<br/><br/>That's how I felt recently when the new Oliver Stone film ""World Trade Center"" appeared on my ""must see"" list. Having barely lived through his last two colossal duds, ""Any Given Sunday"" and ""Alexander,"" and realizing the director's penchant for tweaking historical facts (see ""Born on the Fourth of July"" and ""JFK""), I girded myself up for another long, boring ego trip.<br/><br/>Fortunately (or UNfortunately, in light of the subject matter), Stone's often overbearing hand has developed a sudden deft touch here. Perhaps the topic is still too raw in the minds of Americans to mess with. Perhaps the wounds have yet to heal, and little tolerance would be given in this matter. After all, he had 30 years to think about the Kennedy assassination, but only five to put this story on film.<br/><br/>It's the harrowing tale of two New York Port Authority officers, Sgt. John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and rookie patrolman Will Jimeno (Micahel Pena, ""Million Dollar Baby,"" but best known for his TV work in ""The Shield"" and ""CSI"") who respond to the terrorist attacks on the Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, only to become trapped themselves when the towers collapse.<br/><br/>Caught in a dark, choking, dust-filled grave, and with one of their fellow officers, Dominick Pezzulo (Jay Hernadez) already dead, the two hold out little realistic hope for survival (even worse, neither of them knows WHY all of this happened). Each has a wife and family, however, so amidst this pocket of suffocation, they try to keep each other's spirits up. It isn't easy, though, since Jimeno is trapped under a huge concrete slab and his boss' legs are crushed.<br/><br/>Interspersed with these claustrophobic sequences are scenes of McLoughlin's wife, Donna (Maria Bello, Oscar-nominated for ""A History of Violence"" and will probably get another for this role), and Jimeno's spouse, Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal, fresh off her voice-over role in ""Monster House""). These tug at the heart even more, since the wives are as helpless as the husbands and no one seems to know if they are living or dead.<br/><br/>On a day when close to 3,000 individuals perished and scores more were injured, the fate of two PA officers was pretty inconsequential in the big picture. But, thankfully, Stone wasn't interested in the big picture. Sure, he throws in contemporary news reports of the incident as everyone gathered around their televisions to find out what was going on, but despite the enormity of the situation, there were thousands of little stories to tell.<br/><br/>A subplot has a former Marine Staff Sergeant, Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon, ""Bad Boys II,"" ""The Woodsman""), now an accountant in Wilton, Conn., seeing the tragedy, declaring that ""we are now at war,"" and leaving his place of employment. Saying that God had something for him to do, he went to church, then put on his old uniform (kept starched and pressed for some reason) and drove as fast as he could to Ground Zero. He was admitted through the barricades and proceeded to search by himself (and later with another Marine) in the dark for survivors.<br/><br/>In the pit, John is slowly bleeding to death, but Will tries to keep him awake by talking about ""Starsky & Hutch"" and asking him about his family. Will's banging of a nearby pipe is heard by the two soldiers, who alert rescue workers to their presence. But with both men getting weaker by the minute and losing more and more blood, time is now running against them.<br/><br/>Stone boils down the cataclysm enough so that we today - with five years of hindsight - can look back at the personal horrors many people went through. Like ""United 93"" from earlier this year, there's no political posturing or axes to grind. The shot of Pres. Bush speaking to the public, promising to avenge the act was greeted by a few audience member hoots, but overall ideology was pushed to the back burner so the story of two families struggling amidst the worldwide disaster could be told.<br/><br/>A powerful, heart wrenching, emotional piece of work, one of the year's best, so far."
"filmfan92","10","5","12","3 September 2006"," The Year's Best Film, HANDS DOWN.
","Sure, Oscar season hasn't hit just yet, but I am confident when I say that ""World Trade Center"" is the year's best movie. I say this as a critic with utter disdain for both Nicolas Cage, and a growing disappointment in Oiver Stone's work ever since ""Natural Born Killers"". Cage shines here, and Stone redeems himself. From that wrenching shot of a giant airplane silhouette snaking down a city street, Stone grabs you and never lets you go. He cuts no corners, showing, graphically and wrenchingly, the 9/11 terrorist attacks effect on the community. Burning papers fly everywhere. Subways, once full of activity, are now empty. Police officers return to the station, drenched in blood and shaken to the core. Although the film examines the world's reaction to the attacks, it's main focus is on Officers Mcgloughin and Jimeno, who were trapped under the rubble of the World Trade Center buildings after the attack. Stone wisely chooses to darken the surroundings, train the camera on the men's soot-caked faces, and just let them emote. It's an approach that would have bombed with many actors, but Cage and Michael Pena are up to the challenge, letting their eyes tell the story, trading monosyllabic encouragements as they try to escape the metal and rock pinning them to the floor. A subplot focuses on the wives of the ""First Responders"", and manages to be both wrenching and uplifting at the same time. Magge Gylenhall in particular deserves Oscar attention for her turn as Mrs. Jimeno. This movie is a superb piece of work, and you owe it to yourself to see it."

","World Trade Center is not just the best film of the year so far, but its the best film to hit cinemas in about five years. It is pretty much cinematic perfection, but it is not how it is made that makes it so great. Sure that helps but its the shear power behind the film that makes it truly great. Oliver Stone is a fantastic filmmaker, one of the best in the business and this is one of his best works, if not his best. The performances are totally convincing and nothing less than extraordinary. Michael Pena and Maggie Gyllenhaal in particular. Cage, Bello, and many others are also amazing and deserving of Oscar attention. The music and cinematography as well as the technical aspects are all genius as is the rest of the movie."

","I went to the movies with my friends thinking that this would be another documentary on 9/11 but when the movie started I saw it was so much more, it takes you into the horrors that laid under the rubble then what was on top, it show the brotherhood and sisterhood that formed over the hours that the event took place, it shows you what the family members were doing while they waited for the news of their loved ones and it showed you that people all over the country came to help and people all over the world became connected to each other in the horrid events of September 11th. By the time the movie was over not one eye was left dry or one heart untouched. The casting was good and the actors seemed to fit right into their characters with ease. The effects held to the real truth of the day and the music was pure, I couldn't ask for a better movie to portray that day."

","When I was in 3rd grade, the world trade centers were attacked, and being so young, i didn't understand what was going on. So today, five years later, I went to see this movie. The movie stars three police officers who go into the tower. When the tower is attacked, they try to run for their lives, but end up being trap under the building. Only one officer can move, because the other two are under large metal pieces. He tries to free the other two officers, but he cant. He sits down to take a rest but more pieces of the building falls. When you see him again he is covered in blood, and dies minutes later. The rest of the story is about the remaining two officers trying to survive until someone comes to help them. This movies is very dramatic and a little depressing. I actually felt like I was there. I usually don't cry at movie's, but I teared up in this one for a while. This movie made me realize what really happened that day and what the people in the tower went through. I would highly recommend going to see this movie. It was very good."
"cschultz-2","9","5","12","12 August 2006"," A Kinder, Gentler Oliver Stone
","In 'World Trade Center,' a surprisingly even-handed and well-modulated Oliver Stone steps on the brakes and turns down the volume, and puts away his customary histrionics and hysteria long enough to allow a true story about quiet, ordinary, everyday heroes caught in extraordinary circumstances to stand on its own and speak for itself.<br/><br/>John McLaughlin--Nicolas Cage--is a sergeant in the NYC Port Authority PD who's called upon to recruit volunteers to travel across town to the title location to help evacuate the towers following the impact of the first plane; Will Jimeno--Michael Pena--is a Port Authority cop, the first to volunteer, albeit somewhat reluctantly. They and their friends and fellow cops don't know the exact nature of the emergency and they're rusty with the breathing equipment and heavy fireman's gear they're given to wear and take with them, but they're aware the situation is grave and that their colleagues from other, nearer city PDs are overwhelmed. They're also aware that the chances that they might die are superb, and more formidable by the inch. With all this information, they're still standing in the WTC lobby trying to figure out what to do when their world crashes in on them. Literally.<br/><br/>'World Trade Center' takes a story we thought we knew and uses it to discover new territory; by turning inward and keeping the special effects to an absolute minimum, Stone and screenwriter Andrea Berloff focus their attention to the formidable heroism displayed that day by depicting what amounts to an extended conversation between McLaughlin and Jimeno. In a way, the movie is as intimate as Malle's 'My Dinner with Andre,' except for the fact that the participants are buried alive in rubble, and quite possibly dying before our eyes.<br/><br/>And in listening to the nature of the two mens' conversation--the two discuss the most trivial and banal subjects: Demi Moore, 'GI Jane,' their kids--we realize that the mens' words are secondary to the fact that they are literally talking to keep each other conscious, staving off shock, saving each others' lives. They're decent, ordinary men in circumstances more desperate than most of us can imagine, and through their attitudes and the tones of their voices, they need to rescue each other, prop up each others' spirits, and live.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage disappears to far into the character of McLaughlin that he nearly ceases to exist. A trailer for another upcoming Cage film, 'The Wicker Man,' plays before 'WTC,' and you wouldn't recognize the actor from one performance to another if you didn't already know him. Cage takes the less-flashy of the two primary roles--Pena as Jimeno has the use of his arms and is therefore more animated--but each time Cage delivers a line he refocuses, and rivets, our attention back to his tortured face and vocal tones. By underplaying his role he steals the show.<br/><br/>And the competition is keen: Pena is superb as Jimeno; Maggie Gyllenhaal is sweetly perfect as Jimeno's pregnant wife, Allison; Maria Bello is strong and authoritative as McLaughlin's wife; Michael Shannon, as a USMC sergeant from the Midwest who travels to NYC to do what he can to help, seems to be working for a director higher than Stone. Shannon has the bearing and the laser attention of Elijah walking out of the wilderness and into the land of the Baal gods. Frank Whaley, a terrific supporting actor who's never quite been handed a breakthrough role, contributes a quiet, dignified performance as a former paramedic pressed back into service. And check out Julie Adams, as the pregnant Allison's grandmother.<br/><br/>Craig Armstrongs's cerebral score sounds enough like Adagio for Strings to contribute an adequate gravitas to the film and remind us we're watching important stuff. And the cinematography, by Seamus McGarvey and augmented by archival news footage and NASA satellite photography, is seamless and stunning: When the first tower collapses, hell is unleashed; when the second tower goes, it happens through our ears and inside our heads. Theatre auditoriums equipped with digital sound might need to boost the film's rating from PG13 to R. So let's hear it for the sound department...no pun intended.<br/><br/>By sticking to the facts and allowing the drama to unfold at its own pace, Oliver Stone displays a maturity he's hinted at but mostly kept to himself up until now. For too long, Stone's seemed uncomfortably like the lone adult sitting at the kiddie's table at Thanksgiving. The maturity displayed here, and his choice of an ultimately upbeat and life-affirming story, feels somehow like Picasso caught red-handed in Norman Rockwell territory. 'World Trade Center' is like a Ron Howard film, directed by Oliver Stone."
"kvsmm","10","5","12","12 August 2006"," Don't miss the point.
","This movie was about 9/11, but much more, it was about people. It never mentioned the deep causes, but it focused on two families. If you saw Shindlers List, one little girl was painted frame by frame to humanize something that can't be totally understand. We don't have any conception of 6 million, but we can relate to one little girl. In this story, almost 3000 never came home. We can't imagine that, but we can understand two men, two families, and the four or five people who represented so many others. How many former military men re-upped that day? How many very competent 911 operators just got it wrong that day? How many Americans just knew they had to go to New York that day? (My son did. He got on a bus and went to do anything.)Did an addict, a former paramedic really help, and change his life? I don't know, but I do know that individuals were impacted in positive, life changing ways. I think Oliver Stone did a wonderful job of not sensationalizing, and bringing the reality down to understandable terms."

It was very clear where the movie was going and I was not dissatisfied in any way. <br/><br/>I for one am glad that they chose to use the point of view that was used and I don't think it was too soon, nor was it in any way incorrect, disrespectful, or boring. I was emotionally affected through most of the movie which doesn't happen often being a young man of 23.<br/><br/>For those who were directly touched on 9/11 this may be more than can be handled on the first viewing but I think any viewing after it will be seen as a tribute and a testament to how well we all came together no matter what race, religion, profession, or overall viewpoint on life.<br/><br/>I think that for most of the US, people have moved on like nothing happened, and this will help to remember how it actually unfolded.<br/><br/>All casts were flawless in my eyes. The movie itself was flawless, and I can't see how it could be done any better. This is a ""must see"" before it is no longer on the big screen."

","September 11th, 2001 was a day that none of us would ever forget. Many were offended by Oliver Stone recreating the events of that infamous day because it was considered too early. Personally whether it's 5 years or 50 years the pain of September 11th will always be there. People are still missing, families are still torn apart, what we can do is to honor these people by remembering them and what happened. The movie doesn't focus on the brutality of what happened but rather the unwaivering bravery of those who chose to put themselves in harms way. Though not overly graphic the story is rather heart wrenching, it follows 2 Port Authority Police Officers whom were one of the first authorities on scene. One is a rookie cop by the name of Will Jimeno and long timer Seargent John Mcloughlin. What these two witnessed is truly unexplainable, being trapped 20+feet below ground zero. The movie constantly cuts back in forth between them and their familes, some may find it rather irritating at times but what I believe Oliver Stone was trying to show us was the damage done that day wasn't merely physical. The emotional damage was just as twisted and crushed as ground zero was. What I found inspirational was some of the emergency rescuers were posed a question about their own safety of being down there and that the structure could come down on them at anytime, without hesitation they answered they were ready to give their life to save anothers. Depsite the first immediate reaction when people hear ""World Trade Center"" it really wasn't about death, but rather life. Overall the movie is amazing, not once did I ever doubt any of these actors. To me Maggie Gyllenhal shines in her role as Mrs. Jimeno. She embodies all the wifes, mothers, sisters, aunts that lost their relatives that day. This a great tribute to those who were lost, but more importantly to celebrate the power of life, love and hope. Watch this movie.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>and that's the final word."

I did tear up at three or four spots - maybe even more.<br/><br/>Here is a spoiler - Thank God for the Marines!! If they sat back and listened to the ""people in charge"" I think this movie would not have been from these two policemen's view because they would have joined the more than 3,000 others that died that day.

","I've seen a lot of bad talk about this movie but I really liked it. Although you could see Mic's at the top of screen sometime it was well made and historically accurate. The movie had lots of tones and by telling the story of these two brave men and their families, tells the story of thousands of men and their families. Did they call? Were they in the building? Is my child going to see his/her parent again? Even though this may seem crazy to some people that haven't watched it yet, it's a movie where you will cry tears of sorrow AND joy.

"aharmas","10","5","12","9 August 2006"," A Masterpiece from a Passionate Director
","Stone has directed some of the best films of the last 100 years. He, along with Spielberg, understands the power of a good script, a good story, good cinematography, good editing, and most importantly, the ability to connect and make his audience react. ""Word Trade Center"" offers him another opportunity to handle material that cannot be ignored. What is special about this project is how Stone manages to make a flawless and superb film that does exactly what is supposed to do without compromising or disrespecting its audience, as many contemporary films are doing lately. This film doesn't have a bloated running time because it is compact, direct, without an ounce of fat. It also contains a very tight screenplay that does not waste anytime with pontification or over-sentimentality. What we see is enough to breakdown any emotional resistance we could have about the material (as if it that was possible). In addition, we are able to see a story told in a very interesting way, though not in real time, in a series of scenes that are slow, deliberate, and direct.<br/><br/>Stone's assured direction keeps the details intimate and personal, yet it provides a connection to the universal emotions that bring out the best in all of us, without ignoring the fact that there are also some negative counterparts. With the help of a very talented production team, the film boasts a perfect blend of technical, old fashioned film making, and smoothly integrated computer effects. It is an impressive piece of work, and it surely deserves to receive as many accolades as possible at the end of the year. It is an important film because of its themes and its execution. This is definitely one of his best works as a director, showing many in Hollywood that it is possible to captivate and relate to an audience, going beyond a concept, an idea, a production meeting by carefully integrating every element of cinema and always respecting the audience and the material.<br/><br/>Earlier on, we were witnesses to the talented Streep in two very good films. ""WTC"" has four marvelous performances from actors who have done good work in the past, but now stand out in a year that might not have great films but some very performances. ""WTC"" is an excellent film because the very talented Maria Bello once again shows that she can bring life to a character from very deep inside. She is a tower of strength, besieged by her own crisis, and she conveys her distress with an economy of gestures and words in a lovely and expert performance. Cage does very well in his restricted physical setting by carefully transmitting his emotions with his voice and his eyes. He is excellent, and Pena equally matches Cage's superb work. There is the most conventional work, not less effective acting by Gyllenthal who surpasses anything she and her brother have done in the past, as she portrays the distressed wife, who is unsure of what will be expected of her as the events unfold.<br/><br/>""WTC"" is an amazing film and hopefully will be recognized by many for what it is, an example of how powerful good cinema truly is. For those who view Stone as a political headache, watch the film without any preconceptions and just witness what real talent can do."

","I attended the NYC premiere of 'World Trade Center' last night and would just like to say how wonderfully written, directed, produced and acted this movie was. I understand that some people are totally against it and will not go and see it, but for those of you who are thinking about it and wondering whether or not you should see it, please do. Of course the movie is sad and yes there were tears but the ending is uplifting and the entire movie reminds us of the courage and strength of the firefighters, police officers, Port Authority workers, paramedics, military and all others involved in the rescue efforts of that day. The real-life rescue of John & Will and the ordeal that their families go through while waiting for word of their condition is the focus of the movie. As I mentioned, there were tears. But there was also laughter, at just the right moments in the movie. I am in no way a movie critic and I must admit that I have close family ties with John and/or Will, but this is in no way affecting my opinion of the movie. The script was ""written"" (as much as a script for a movie based on a real-life event can be written) extremely well and the acting was superb. Nicolas Cage & Michael Pena delivered incredible performances, conveying the terror that John & Will faced being trapped underneath the rubble. I hope that people will give this movie a chance. If you do, I think you will come away from it with a new perspective of that day. A sense of hope and gratefulness that out of the thousands of people that untimely perished that day and the multitude of heartbreaking stories and memories, there are men & women courageous enough to head in the opposite direction that most of us take when a tragedy occurs, and because of these men & women, John & Will are here today."

Well-crafted film is acted with strength and conviction, but the dramatic aspect of the story fails to convince or generate any real, genuine emotion, and the conclusion is gratuitously patriotic. You'd expect a lot more substance from director Stone, but what wants to be a triumphant, heartfelt tale of heroism and survival instead comes off as a hollow and ponderous movie trying to cash in on a sad chapter in American history. **"

You only hear some kind of a ""voice over"", about the people who died - and see a blackboard, or something, showing the death casualties.

She really wanted to see WTC, so we went. I don't know if I would have gone with out her urging, I had mixed feelings about it. And you may have noticed I'm not into political debates. Some of the reason is that we can't really know what is going on. Everyone is lying to us, IMO. But about the movie...<br/><br/>I'm glad I went.<br/><br/>I'll start with what bothered me about it first. There was a bit of it at the beginning and end that just smacked of propaganda. My daughter noticed the flags and other American symbols in every shot till the first tower was hit. And at the end SPOILERS one of the characters told his work he wasn't going back in, he was reenlisting in the marines. ""This need avenging.""<br/><br/>How ever I did like the movie. The start, as you are meeting the characters, there is no background music. It feels like a documentary or reality TV, bringing home that this is a true story, it happened. The music doesn't really start till the main characters get trapped. It was a fabulous story of incredible people. It was heartfelt and wonderful. Focusing on a few characters really brought in the emotions, and then allowed your mind to magnify it for all the souls lost.<br/><br/>As is stated at the end, this wasn't a story of what evil can do, but of the wonderful, bravery, courage and love that exists in people. It was surprisingly life affirming and positive, yet still tragically sad.<br/><br/>At the end, the music is again gone. No a single sound could be heard in the theater I was in.

"phillipstephenso","9","4","9","3 September 2006"," Bravery and Courage
","Oliver Stone reconstructs another epic, this time the tragedy of the World Trade Center on 9/11/01. Stone focuses on two New York policemen who were trapped beneath the debris from the falling buildings. Nicolas Cage does a nice job depicting one of the policemen. The bravery of those who have a family and who choose to survive until rescue is realistically depicted. Certainly, it would be easy to just give up and shoot yourself as one of the other policemen chooses to do. But, winners never quit, and Nicolas Cage shows himself to be a winner. And, it could be easy for America to just give up in the face of the overwhelming malice of Islamic terrorists. But, perhaps it would be better to never quit. Bravery and persistence in the face of evil is the predominant tone of this movie. Stone does a good job also of depicting the charming families of the policemen trapped under the rubble, as they are driven to fear and hysteria and then hope and triumph as they desperately seek information concerning the fates of their loved ones.<br/><br/>In regard to the tragedy itself, it would seem that skyscrapers are inherently vulnerable to terrorist attacks because of inadequate fire protection services. A single source water based sprinkler system is clearly inadequate for such multi-story buildings. Much better would be redundant fire protection systems available for these dangerous buildings. For example, an automatic halon fire protection system for each computer system should be required. And, numerous dry fire extinguishers should be available in readily accessible panels on each floor to allow occupants to fight the fires themselves. It was obvious by the numerous fires in this film that destroyed the iron superstructures on each building that not enough fire protection services were available inside the buildings. And, where were the fire fighting helicopters frequently used in fighting huge fires in California this past summer, for example? In other words, the fire fighting effort was clearly inadequate, both in design and execution."

","As a New Yorker who remembers that day all too vividly, I am reminded of Spielberg's approach to ""Schindler's List"", using the little girl in the red coat to humanize the incomprehensible masses in the tragedy of the holocaust; we can really only absorb one story at a time to even begin to understand large scale loss of life. In this film, Stone accomplishes the impossible by concentrating on two men and their families--instead of trying to portray the full scale of 2,800 lives lost and a city/country changed forever. By avoiding the obvious (only briefly alluding to a shadow of a plane, never showing the complete collapse from the outside) and concentrating on the points of view of the men inside the tower, Stone enables viewers to fully understand the confusion and fear of those on the front lines.The politics of 9/11 can be left for another film and Stone, rightfully, does not explore the causes or subsequent results of that moment in time. Some critics have unfairly emphasized that there is no sustained tension or suspense because we know the outcome. Well, we knew the outcome of ""All the President's Men""--and virtually every Shakespeare play/film--and the impact on the viewer does not suffer when the direction, script, editing and acting are of such a stellar quality. There are many more stories to be told of 9/11, but few will match the humanity, detail, and spirit of this exemplary film."

He took a tragedy and made a welcoming happy ending out of it.<br/><br/>Some of the original live scenes from that Tuesday Morning showing on the screen, I said to myself that if they are showing this stuff I am going to walk out, I could not go through that again. Thank you Oliver and Paramount for not doing that.<br/><br/>Well as for the movie, it was compelling and good natured and showed how 2 people in that situation and pull together and keep each other alive. It shows that faith can help. Keeping up with the tradition of true story lines, you could have kept Jesus and the water bottle out of the picture, that was just plain stupid.<br/><br/>As for emotions, this movie should not bring tears to anyones eyes except for the joyous moment of life being pulled out of tragedy.<br/><br/>The only emotion part of this movie that affected me was the ending when they showed statistics at the end. That part I will not see again when the DVD comes out, it is only a sad reminder to me of my loss."

I can't forget the foreboding feeling that ran through me as I raced to get home to my family.

","While I thought the movie may have been true to the book I felt many of the things were a bit off. The Firefighters for example were no where to be seen and were told to ""go home"" From my memory I remember they worked round the clock after the disaster to search for survivors. The real news footage showed a beehive of activity yet the movie made it appear that the only people searching were two guys that at one time were or wanted to be Marines. The movie was SO slow I felt sorry for the cops trapped but how long does it take to develop that ? . I really thought from the trailer that it would be a tribute to ALL the heroes that gave their all yet it really only focused on three guys. Two survived and the third dying a certain death decides to commit suicide.... hmmmm. I was totally disappointed in the film."

","Initial skittishly about this movie because of the director (Oliver Stone) I was pleasantly surprised that is simply a story told from the perspective of the Heroic transit cops. I loved this movie, I cried & laughed. You owe it to yourself to see this movie. It's not political, simple story of two transit cop's, their family and the many people involved in there rescue. In the end it portraits both the worst and best humanity has to offer. Brilliant, By far Oliver Stones best work both for what it is and for what it is not. See this movie, You won't be disappointed.

What I witnessed instead was a deeply tragic, gut wrenching yet beautiful human story. I out-loud cried more than once, and the pin drop silence in the theater was only broken by sobs & sniffles throughout. Anyone who loves their country and was remotely saddened on Sept 11, 2001 will find this movie a must see. I hate to admit that I have not forgotten 9/11, but have forgotten the brutality and the horror but mostly the human story of that Tuesday five years ago. Let me tell you this movie brought it back loud and clear. The movie relentlessly depicted the uncommon valor of that special breed of men - the firefighters, police officers, rescue personnel & military who are willing to lay down their lives for their brothers. But it also showed the fear and hesitation of the same men - it was real - as real as it gets. Mixed in with the waiting and frustrated family - who suddenly realized & must have felt guilty that thousands of other families were suffering as they were all at the same time...this was depicted so starkly. It was a deeply personal and private experience to view the movie, even though I was surrounded by dozens & dozens of people.<br/><br/>Please see this movie - and thank you, Mr. Stone."

","""World Trade Center"", the latest film from acclaimed director Oliver Stone is a well made film that realistically shows the horrors that was 9-11.<br/><br/>To be honest, I really didn't know what to expect when I heard about this film and purposely avoided finding out exactly the storyline (though of course we all know of 9-11). When I finally saw it, I was humbled by what I saw. And though I saw the 9-11 tragedy on TV in 2001, by seeing this film through the eyes of Nicholas Cage (in another great performance) and Michael Pena, I felt as if I was there to witness the devastation and loss.

"Desertman84","9","3","6","8 October 2012"," A Reminder Of Humanity During 9/11/2001
","Nicolas Cage stars in the unforgettable true story of the courageous rescue and survival of two Port Authority policemen who were trapped in the rubble on September 11, 2001 after they volunteered to go in and help in this drama,World Trade Center.It also features Maria Bello, Michael Peña, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon.Director Oliver Stone once again is at helm in a film that offers a powerful and provocative story based on the real events that involves John McLoughlin and William J. Jimeno, both of whom cooperated with producers. <br/><br/>Sergeant John McLoughlin and William J. Jimeno were two officers assigned to New York City's Port Authority who were working their beats on a quiet day in early fall when they received an emergency call. The day was September 11, 2001, and they were among the policemen who attempted to evacuate the World Trade Center towers after they were struck by airliners piloted by terrorists. Both were inside the fifth building of the World Trade Center when the towers fell, and were two of the last people found alive amidst the wreckage. As they struggled to hold on to their lives as rescuers sifted through the rubble, their spouses -- Donna McLoughlin and Allison Jimeno clung to the desperate hope that their husbands would survive and be found. As the both their families waited for word on the fate of the two men, they watched as a city and a nation came together with strength and compassion in the face of a tragedy.<br/><br/>As a visually stunning tribute to lives lost in tragedy, World Trade Center succeeds unequivocally, and it is more politically muted than many of Stone's other works as the director concentrated on one of the catastrophe's stories and has fashioned it well with almost palpable physical detail, and with performances that never sink to exploitation. Granted, it's only the film's historical context that distinguishes it from any other dramatic rescue story, but in focusing on the goodness of humanity in response to the evil of terrorists who remain unnamed and off-screen, the film creates an emotional context as powerful as anything Stone has done since Platoon. Even as he resorts to some questionable tactics typically lacking in subtlety, Stone refrains from much of the blunt-force film-making that has made him a critical punching bag, rising to this challenging occasion with a heartfelt and deeply American portrait of unity whether personal, familial, and national. Flaws and all, World Trade Center serves an honorable purpose, reminding us all that for those fleeting days in September 2001, America showed its best face to a sympathetic world."

I was in awe of just how well they depicted these heroes. The supporting cast led by Maggie Gyllenhaal also give moving performances.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone directed a heck of a masterpiece. I can't believe this movie scored so low, but it is hardly surprising.

"dwpollar","9","3","6","18 March 2009"," Emotionally exhausting and extremely well done...
","1st watched 3/13/2009  9 out of 10(Dir-Oliver Stone): Emotionally exhausting and extremely well done accounting of the personal perspective of two New York cops during the 9-11 disaster. The story is a personal account directly from these individuals and is not intended to be an exhaustive account of the incident and why it happened etc.. This is a little different type of movie for Oliver Stone but he executes it flawlessly. We see how they got involved, John McLaughlin(played by Nicolas Cage in a wonderful downplayed performance), is a Sargeant in the group that goes to the towers to help evacuate the buildings. Will Jimenez, played by Michael Pena, is one of the crew who volunteers to go with John into the lobby between the towers and assist with the goal further putting himself into danger. They get trapped when one of the buildings go down as they jump into the elevator shaft(since it's supposed one of the strongest parts of the building). The rest of the movie revolves around their survival as they humor and get to know one another despite their horrible circumstances. We then jump to scenes with the rescuers and each of the families. This is a personal story despite the grand scale of the event and is done with integrity by all involved. Oliver Stone proves he doesn't have to create a controversy to make a good movie, and this is exactly what he's done here -- except, I dare say, it's a great movie in my opinion that should have gotten more accolades than it did."
"peter-ramshaw-1","4","3","6","7 March 2007"," Ho hum
","This isn't so much a (or is it an) 9/11 movie as a miner trapped underground movie.<br/><br/>The terrorism aspect is so downplayed except for a few comments at the end that it's hard to work out why Stone decided to do it this way. Two men trapped underground for a few days, their families worry, and they get rescued. It's hardly groundbreaking stuff (excuse the pun). The fact that the twin towers of the world trade centre are what's fallen on them is very downplayed. Maybe that's deliberate given it's only 6 years since it happened but - sheesh - what a disappointment.<br/><br/>Great visual effects, expect for the last few shots of the smoke etc where you can clearly see that the city skyline is superimposed over the TV stock footage foreground (boy is that amateur stuff) - what a real disappointment that is.<br/><br/>Stone seems to think you can chuck in an epic moment in history and toss in a couple of personal life vignettes (Apollo 13, not his, I know, but your get the idea, come to mind?) This could have been such a powerful movie but fell so short it was really disappointing. I realises the producers had the 'feelings' of the greater US population to consider but I would have preferred a drama wrapped around the elevator guy who's mum appears in the final few scenes. That would at least have been a real story.<br/><br/>To me that would have magnified the tragedy. Policemen, firemen, marines do a great job, but part of that job is the risk of being killed. When it happens (like here) we shouldn't be so surprised, so easily swayed into thinking they are any more heroic than the bankers, school teachers, tourists and other people who died that day.<br/><br/>I think this movie diss's all of the above. It's enjoyable on a simple level but disturbing on another. It makes you wonder if the USA has actually learned anything from what happened on September 11.<br/><br/>From Stone's effort, it would appear not. That's sad."
"Robert_Hearth","9","3","6","4 March 2007"," ""We Prepared For Everything. Not For This. Not Something This Size. There Is No Plan."" --- John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage)
","""World Trade Center"" (2006) <br/><br/>Directed By: Oliver Stone <br/><br/>Starring: Nicholas Cage, Michael Peña, Maria Bello, Maggie Gyllenhaal, & Jay Hernandez <br/><br/>MPAA Rating: ""PG-13"" (for intense and emotional content, some disturbing images and language) <br/><br/>Oliver Stone is famous for his movies with intense political messages. From ""Platoon"" to ""JFK"", Stone almost always has an underlying (or, sometimes, a little less subtle) meaning. Many people suspected that this would be the case with ""World Trade Center"". Stone could have easily lambasted audiences with anti-war and anti-Bush messages, exploiting the tragedy to no end. And yet, he did not. ""World Trade Center"" does not seek to point fingers or to use a tragedy as a medium through which Stone expresses his views. It, in fact, is the complete opposite. It only exists to tell a storya true and deeply emotional story. Told through the eyes of two Port Authority Police Officers trapped beneath the rubble of the fallen Twin Towers and their families waiting helplessly to see the final outcome, ""World Trade Center"" puts its audience through a heartbreaking and exhausting tour de force. As the credits rolled, I felt drained and ready for a few moments of uninterrupted peace and rest. ""World Trade Center"" is one of the very few movies of 2006 that has made me express such vivid emotions. ""World Trade Center"" is a wonderful example of how movies should be made. It is highly effective and delivers a heart-wrenching story with realistic characters and wonderful direction. My goodness, I think Oliver Stone has finally made an amazing movie with no political message supporting it.<br/><br/>As everyone knows, on September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked four commercial places. Passengers onboard one plane overtook the hijackers and crashed the plane into a field, killing everyone onboard, but saving only God knows how many people. The second crashed into the Pentagon. The third and the fourth are probably the most famous, as they are the planes that crashed into the North and South towers of the World Trade Center. The Twin Towers (as they were called) collapsed, killing thousands of people and injuring thousands more. Buried beneath rubble were two New York City Port Authority Police Officers: Will Jimeno (Peña) and John McLoughlin (Cage). Their wives, Donna McLoughlin (Bello) and Allison Jimeno (Gyllenhaal), could only wait helplessly at their homes with their children, hoping and praying for the safe return of their husbands. As Will and John lied their, pinned beneath the debris, they saw something that most others did not see that day. They saw the kindness and the true character presented by many people when faced with an extreme situation. As the tagline so profoundly states, ""The world saw evil that day. Two men saw something else"". Thank goodness ""World Trade Center"" stuck to this tag line.<br/><br/>The performances in ""World Trade Center"" are perfectly flawless, as is the casting. Nicholas Cage gives one of his best performances and hits all of the right notes. I found him to be extremely convincing. Michael Peña blew me away with his visceral performance in last year's ""Crash"". Peña knows how to carry himself in roles that require exhausting emotional peaks and, here, he continues to prove that. Peña is easily one of the best rising stars in Hollywood and I can only hope that we will be seeing much more of him. Maria Bello is on a roll and doing very well for herself, with roles in such films as ""A History of Violence"", ""Thank You for Smoking"", and ""World Trade Center"". After a relatively slow start, she is finally achieving the roles that she rightfully deserves. Bello is one of my favorite actresses and this is one of her best performances. Maggie Gyllenhaal's brother, Jake Gyllenhaal, starred in last year's phenomenon, ""Brokeback Mountain"". It was arguably the defining moment of his career. Maggie Gyllenhaal has that same success here. Her performance is raw, real, and beautiful. I love her and I respected her performance in ""World Trade Center"". Jay Hernandez has already had one massive success this year with the brutal and gruesome horror film, ""Hostel"". He did a great job there and I am glad to say that there is no deterioration in the quality of his performance here. He does a wonderful job.<br/><br/>In the beginning of ""World Trade Center"", New York City is portrayed in a series of brief, quiet scenes. The streets of the city are either empty or speckled with silent pedestrians. The entire city seems like a very pleasant place. This portrayal is not New York City. It is an idealized glance at New York pre-attack, made to emphasize the drastic change of the city after the attacks. This is a typical Hollywood clichémaking something seem far more pleasant than it truly is to make the negative side of it even worse. In the case of ""World Trade Center"", this was highly unnecessary. We all saw the news that day and we all know how truly horribly it was. We also know that New York City was not a perfect world prior to the attacks. There are two moments that attempt to throw off this cliché. They include one of the police officers spotting two possible crimes occurring, but this is hardly enough. Still, ""World Trade Center"" is a superb film and is easily one of Olive Stone's best films. Stone made this movie with no political agenda and no conspiracy theory as a propeller. Stone wanted to make a movie with a heart that tells a story of family, love, and the kindness we never knew people had. This is one of the year's very best films and a must for anyone who enjoys movies.<br/><br/>Final Thought: ""World Trade Center"" is an emotionally-powerful and highly-effective drama with a caring heart, not a political agenda, at its center.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 9/10 (A)"

Instead what we get is some generic melodrama, replete with slow-motion sequences, along with the usual strings accompaniment.<br/><br/>There's not much to comment here, the only barely nice scene was the one that showed the policemen buried, with the camera then moving slowly to the top of the ruins. This kind of stuff might be nice to arouse patriotic feeling, but a good film it doesn't make.

","Olivier Stone has outdone himself. I said that Nixon was the worst film he had ever made, but this dull, sloppy, boring mess of a fillm takes the cake as the worst dog of a film he has ever made. You learn nothing about the characters, and little else about what was really happening on that day in New York. What you do get instead is something that plays like a bad disaster telemovie about two men tapped in rubble. And the script is so bad it reduced the audience I watched this with to unintentional laughter on two occasions. The heroes and memory of the people who died on September 11 deseve a better film than this waste of time. United 93 was a very good analysis of that event, and this film is not in its league at all. Hopefully, a good movie about what happened at the World Trade Center will be made one day, but this is not it."
"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","8","3","6","29 August 2006"," Not made on scope, but on point of view
","Based on the experiences of two New York police officers who responded to the attack on the World Trade Center and were subsequently trapped in the rubble as the Twin Towers collapsed. Chance for survival seemed slim as they could barely move, but with the help of hope and will power they somehow made it out alive.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone's film's been known for their epic scope. From 'Platoon' to more recently 'Alexander' Stone approached his subjects from many sides. There was certain buzz going on before this film's release that it might be similar to Stone's 'JFK' in that it approached a story that many people cannot agree on for what is true and presented a theory about what happened. Here, Oliver Stone abandons all that and focuses on purely the human aspect. The exact how and why is left for whatever you believe and want to believe and that makes for a pleasant relief. Well maybe pleasant isn't the right word as this movie details some terrifying experiences, but it is all through individual people's eyes on what they saw that day. Sure, there are some blurbs that ""they did it"" and ""we gotta nuke 'em the bastards"" but Stone keeps conspiracy theory largely out and the only instances of it are from the distress that day.<br/><br/>Also on an interesting note, Stone largely downplays spectacle here. Everything is shown through human eyes, and not just any human eyes, but of our four principle lead characters - McLoughlin, Jimeno, and their wives. The planes hitting the towers is only heard, the tower collapse is shown just from inside the lobby through the frantic eyes and pumping adrenaline of McLoughlin and Jimeno, and it is that and also the omission of an overly patriotic tone that makes this a good survival story. 8/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for intense life/death situations"

","Thursday July 27, 7:00pm The Harvard Exit<br/><br/>""Pain is your friend. It means you're alive.""<br/><br/>Oliver Stone's name above the title guarantees certain things. His films are well conceived, well executed, and unashamedly possessing his own unique political bent. They are undeniably compelling to an audience, deeply thought provoking, morally disquieting, often unpleasant and always psychologically traumatic. Stone's latest film, World Trade Center, draws the viewer into the lives of two New York City Police Officers on what was an average, ordinary day, until the surreal events of September 11th, 2001 made it horrifically extraordinary. The audience comes to this story, as with any depiction of historical significance, knowing what the characters do not. Stone has only to offer his perspective on the tragic outcome. Wonderful performances from Maria Bello and Michael Pena notwithstanding, World Trade Center is an indulgent, clichÃ© attempt to romanticize the plight of the victims, offered up as the respectful remembrance of events many politically sane Americans would prefer to forget."
"mksmith13","7","7","20","29 July 2006"," A view from below.
","I had the privilege of viewing this film pre-release. Neither having seen any previews, nor even realizing this film was in the works, I can honestly say I had no preconceived ideas about the film. <br/><br/>This film basically takes the perspective of two port authority police officers who, during the course of their duty, become trapped in the World Trade Center collapse. The film is much less about the events themselves and much more about the perspective of the two trapped officers and their loved ones. That being said, there is not a whole lot of action. However, the flow of the movie is based on the suspense involving the officers and their families. Will they be discovered? Will they be rescued? Unfortunately this can make the two-hour movie seem to move a bit slow.<br/><br/>The only negative thing I can think of at this time is that there could have been more focus on the efforts of rescue workers trying to free those trapped and find those who did not make it. However, this was evidently not Stone's intention. <br/><br/>The camera work is great, the script writing regarding the main characters and the plot was good. <br/><br/>There are some who think that Stone is simply trying to exploit the incident for a profit. I do not think this is the case. Five years post incident, Stone is trying to tell the stories of the two officers who were trapped as a tribute to all who gave their lives."
"Quinoa1984","5","5","13","11 August 2006"," good if you're looking for a memorial of heroism and courage, though short of really affecting
","Maybe part of my reaction to Oliver Stone's latest directorial effort, World Trade Center, is not totally the film's fault, or maybe it is, I still can't decide. Months ago I saw what I thought was the ultimate take on the pain, horror and bottomless grief that came from 9/11 with United 93, which took a full-on documentary approach with one particular story from that day and without a known cast or really well-known director made an incredibly emotional film. With World Trade Center, this time we get one of the chief directors working today with melodrama and heightened emotions, who more often than not does make it work for his goals. It also has a cast of known Hollywood actors, such as Nicholas Cage (as the star), Maria Bello, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Stephen Dorff, and Jay Hernandez among others. That matched with a story that has no real villains aside from the elements around them (i.e. a mountain of rubble), and given a more old-fashioned approach to the devastation, puts the film at more of a distance for the viewer. This is a respectable, well-made dramatization of the events of these two un-questionably brave policemen. If it isn't better than it could've been, it's because of its ambitions as a simply respecting, and sentimental detailing.<br/><br/>This is not to say that Stone and first-time writer Andrea Berloff don't put up some very effective scenes. It's just that they often have to share time with material that, while probably not far from the truth, are too typical or diverting from what is compelling. For example, the early scenes as the chaos first comes up with the first plane hitting the tower, and the officers going in, is just the right pacing for this set-up material. When officers John McLoughlin (Cage) and Will Jemeno (Michael Pena) are under the rubble, which is very well constructed by Stone's designers for full authenticity, their scenes together are close to touching. Even a moment when Jesus comes into the picture via Stone's use of symbolism isn't lost on me. But it's in the cutting back to the families of the men where I started to feel the disconnect. I understand the purpose of showing the worrying, sorrowful wives and kids in this situation, but it becomes almost like filling up the running time, especially in the most unnecessary scenes of the film in the flashbacks showing both men before the incidents.<br/><br/>This added with Stone's hit or miss tactic of visual melodrama makes the film lesser than it could be. But this is all personal gripes, and what I did expect from the film I did get. There are more than enough scenes that hit the buttons that should be met about the bravery and heroism of those who responded to the towers collapse. And Stone is tactful enough not to go all Michael Bay on us with his style (and, at the least, keep a kind of restraint that seems to be a good rebound after Alexander). He keeps his actors in a state of mind that fits the subject matter, and even in the moments that do border on being in a TV-movie (though in the end a stroke above a TV-movie), they're never un-true to what their characters need to be for the material. World Trade Center is meant to hit the mainstream movie-going audience, unlike the more independent-minded and un-restricted United 93, and for a mass audience it's just the right touch of pathos that's not too soon five years later."

","World Trade Center: The movie is boring. We spend much of the time with the two buried policeman all in dark close-up. At least an equal amount of time is spent with the two wives and families of these policeman. This was somewhat more interesting but not much more. At least, it gave the two actresses and their families opportunities to express more varied emotions. Also, the photography was grainy in the parts with the family, like a TV show where the image had deteriorated. I saw it at the Academy theater in Los Angeles. The characters were flat, totally without complexity or even shading. The energy that Oliver Stone's movies usually have was absent. If the studio was nervous about Oliver Stone making a movie on this subject, why did they choose him? Was their influence responsible for the colorless, undramatic treatment of the subject? United 93 was a far better movie that was careful to maintain an evenhanded presentation of the events. Some have faulted United 93 for being too evenhanded. Agree or disagree, it was not boring. All in all, as spectacle, commentary, insight, entertainment... WTC = DOA."

","The second ""9/11"" film for 2006. This one tells the (dramafied but real) story of two port authority officers that find themselves trapped under the debris of the collapsed twin towers and in need of rescue.<br/><br/>It starts as the day started: perfectly normal. The commanding officer deals out the orders for the day and the briefing is done. Then the news comes that a plane has crashed into one of the two towers and the action starts rolling.<br/><br/>The bulk of the film plays as two separate stories: the two officers laying in the debris, and their family and rescuers trying to get to them and finding out what happened. It plays on emotion, becomes overly sentimental and tries to put up some ""real"" heroes.<br/><br/>And just that is the point where it fails miserably. At least for me.

Instead it is just a simple screenplay devised to play on the public's emotions and sell bottled water. Oliver Stone and Nichols Cage should donate at least half of the mega money they will make from this thoughtless picture back to the efforts to clean up the site. The bulk of this simple ""cave in"" movie was all shot on one set and filled in with newsreel footage.

","September 11, 2001 is a moment that will forever live in the infamy of American History. Nearly everyone that was old enough to remember the attacks remembers what they were doing when it happened and how it has affected them all these years later. So, as the news for this movie began circling I was immediately and anxiously awaiting the release. In fact, it was the most anticipated movie of my summer.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone rarely disappoints when it comes to epic movies. In the past, movies like Alexander and Natural Born Killers have struck a chord in many people and left their mark on society. World Trade Center is set to do the same thing.<br/><br/>While there have been complaints that this movie was made too soon it was backed by the families and the men who were affected by this event the most. It was handled beautifully with plenty of emotion and a powerhouse cast of actors that knew just how to make you feel that you were in the middle of it all and that your life was as affected as theirs was.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage heads up the cast playing John McLoughlin, the Sergeant that led a small group of Port Authority police officers into the towers to help rescue people trapped. Cage offers a glimpse of an emotional side showing strength and fear with only his voice as we watch the events unfold with baited breath.<br/><br/>Michael Pena, while slightly unknown compared to Cage, is simply a scene-stealer. Pena beautifully portrays William Jimeno, one of the Port Authority officers, who is stuck with Cage's McLoughlin beneath a pile of rubble. Pena moved into the Jimeno house to prepare for the role and the studying definitely helped. His performance was filled with emotion, force, and desperation. It was everything necessary to bring the movie together perfectly.<br/><br/>The lead women roles of Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal showed us how the wives of these men held on to memories when the lives of their husbands hung in the balance. We watched the turn of events in their minds and on their faces as life went from normal to unimaginable in a moment's time.<br/><br/>A small bit part by Stephen Dorff also added to the strength of the movie. The horror of the events are as evident on his face as the tears in his eyes as he plays Scott Strauss, the man that came in and saved the lives of Jimeno and McLoughlin.<br/><br/>People might liken this to be an attempt on Stone's part to make a stir, but they could not be more wrong. McLoughlin and Jimeno both have writing credits on the movie and their input heavily influenced the production. If you are looking for a touching, heart-wrenching story that could have been an action-flick but was unfortunately true, then this movie is for you.<br/><br/>If you see one movie this summer see World Trade Center. It is well worth the time and tears you will spend watching it.<br/><br/>Originally Published on Thursday, August 24, 2006 Copyright 2006: Ashtyn Evans and Literary Illusions"

","Director Oliver Stone is not one to shy away from controversy. His Stone Age film career has scrutinized methods that the U.S. Government has invoked in dealing with issues such as: the Vietnam War, JFK Assassination, Watergate, Music Censorship, and the Stock Market to name a few. In his real life, Stone also has been a headliner himself by being arrested for drug possession. I guess Oliver was trying to live up to his last name. However, he brings a disparate directorial approach to the 9/11 film ""World Trade Center"". Stone focuses the narrative on valor and survival. Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena star as Port Authority officers John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno. They were one the last survivors rescued from the World Trade Center catastrophe. They were stuck in the rubble of the Twin Towers for numerous hours using their perseverance, humor, and encouragement as survival tools under extreme excruciating circumstances. Cage's Sgt. McLoughiln is an emotionless leader who is silently dumbfounded by the unexpected tragedy. Pena's Officer Jimeno is the simpleton humanitarian who has a way of bringing the unadorned aspects of life to life by using as it as a motivating force. Even though McLoughlin and Jimeno are as dissimilar as they come, they both share a common force in being loving family men and devoted law enforcement reps. Their manhole conversations focused on such assorted topics as: the Starsky & Hutch theme song, Jesus with a water bottle, procrastination of a kitchen cabinet project and paternal responsibilities. Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal play the suffering, despondent wives who are out-of-the-loop on their husbands' fate. Cage and Pena were heroic and powerful with their acting contributions. They were the Twin Thespian Towers of ""World Trade Center"". However, my opinion was not proportionate in symmetry fashion with the overacted efforts of Bello and Gyllenhaal. These stellar actresses were not at their prime here and their overplayed grief was the slight terror of the film. Screenwriter Andrea Berlof does stay united and committed to the actual verbal interactions which took place on that dismal day. Auteur Stone also constructs the scenes with mesmerizing realities and acute depictions which will stay in your mind & hearts for days. To some ""World Trade Center"" might be ""too much, too large, and too soon"". However. I do salute Stone for pledging allegiance by providing us this honorary tale. **** Good"

","When I went to go see World Trade Center, I was expecting to see a general layout of the events of 9/11. Instead you have these two port authority officers who are trapped under rubbel talking about their wives the whole time. The beginning started off very good in how they showed that it was a normal day in the lives of all the port authority officers. I believe that If He had made this movie a little bit more graphic it would have been nice because I was expecting to see a tear Jerker and I almost fell asleep. Of course, it was nice to see that the two men came out and survived but I think Oliver stone, the director could have upped this film a notch and it would have been perfect.

"Johnny10","4","4","10","21 August 2006"," Greengrass V.S Stone
","(The winner is Greengrass).This film to me just didn't work overall it didn't really give to much emotion through the movie and to much of the movie was about the family worrying and the people trying to find the two men. But when it came to the men below the rubble it seemed like no more then 10 minutes was used there.And when the men were under the rubble their was no character development amongst them, but rather flashbacks of their family and the two men talking about their family. And i have the utmost respect to all of the firemen,police and paramedics that were there that day and to all the victims that died that day but when the men were under the rubble and being rescued i just did not have to much emotion going on. And i think what the problem could have been was the PG 13 rating so much was toned down and i think that was a major flaw because what happened on September the 11th was rated R many people died and the things the rescuers saw was not PG 13 things and the dialog between the rescuers would not of been ""fricken"" but the other word and it just sounded un natural, if you think you should see a film about 9/11 i think Flight 93 was much better (which was rated R). Also i don't think this is an Oliver Stone film this just isn't his line of work he is a brilliant filmmaker and one of the best but this is more Spielberg or Ridley Scott. In Greengrass's film he portrayed so much more emotion i knew the outcome at the end of Flight 93 as i did in World Trade Center one i was biting my nails and shed a tear or two and the other i watched as a regular movie,Greengrass gave it a true tone World Trade Center just seemed like a movie. But i do give it a 4 for the performances from everyone from underrated actor Michael Shannon to Cage and everyone in between."
"Pasafist","10","4","10","14 August 2006"," WORLD TRADE CENTER is a deeply moving example of people who wanted only one thing: to get home from work that day.
","There is a key scene missing from Oliver Stone's WORLD TRADE CENTER. It's the scene that is forever burned in my brain. We saw it hundreds of times, over and over, the local news couldn't help but show us it with a frequency that could only be called sadistic. Since the scene is not present here the film works. Because it's not there the film has a resonance much higher and more powerful. WORLD TRADE CENTER is a film that has all the cards stacked against it and succeed because it remembers that 9/11 was not a day about politics, it was not a day about heroes or villains. No, 9/11 was a day about people doing their jobs and stepping up in the face of tragedy.<br/><br/>When John McLoughin (Nicholas Cage)and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) showed up for work on this morning they never expected to find themselves buried under the rubble of the Twin Towers. They assumed the day would be pretty uneventful. They kissed their wives, hugged their kids and went to work. But, when duty called these men answered it, and found themselves trapped. Leaving their families wondering, their friends comforting, and a country mourning. In a matter of hours these two Port Authority Police Officers fought for survival, and made themselves and many other men heroes. A lot can happen in the midst of evil, and sometimes it can inspire the greatest good.<br/><br/>What WORLD TRADE CENTER does best is transport us back to that day. When we woke up that morning all was well, by the time we went to bed the whole world felt the repercussions. On September 11th politics was put on the back burner, our petty differences fell away, and we became united. Some gave blood, others cleaned up, for one grand moment America seemed like one. American flags flew, police and rescue workers streamed into the city to help, the once loathed Mayor became a hero, and the President's rally cries were heard and accepted. Oliver Stone's film captures those moments with such reckless ease, its amazing he got away with it.<br/><br/>The film is the embodiment of people who are holding onto the mundane problems in the world. Holding onto the mundane because the gravity of the world around them is too much to bare. My favorite moment involves Jimeno talking about the theme song to Starsky and Hutch. On the surface it's a man trying to use comedy to quell his fear, but the scene goes deeper, this man is holding onto a stupid television show because it proves he's still alive. Hollywood has given us hero's whose lives are so exciting and are always exciting. But real people have down time, they laugh, they go see stupid movies, and watch stupid television shows. The only way to hold on is to revert to the mundane, it's the only cure for a world gone insane.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena embody McLoughlin and Jimeno with real humanity. The film traps them under rubble for most of the films running time, so all they have is their voices, their emotions, and their humanity to get them through.<br/><br/>On the surface, Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal play these men's wives with a vulnerability and fierceness. We see their pain, none so clear, as when Gyllenhaal as Jimeno's wife wanders aimlessly around a pharmacy trying to clear her head, or getting out of the car because the red light is too long. That light never seems so long as when you need to get somewhere fast.<br/><br/>I've heard many say ""how dare they make this movie?"" ""How dare Hollywood profit from this tragedy?"" I say ""how dare we leave our history to be written by people with an agenda., by people who didn't live through it?"" Ten years from now I would be proud to show this film to the next generation, to show them that amidst all the upheaval, amidst all the tragedy, America was united for one brief moment. WORLD TRADE CENTER has no agenda except to harken back to a time we've since lost.<br/><br/>WORLD TRADE CENTER is missing one key scene. It's missing the planes flying into the building. This is not a film about terrorists, or evil. This isn't even a film about the Twin Towers. This is not a film about planes, presidents, or what has happened since. WORLD TRADE CENTER is a deeply moving example of people who wanted only one thing: to get home from work that day."
"rich-464","5","4","10","12 August 2006"," Not a great movie - brings nothing to the table
","Living just outside of NYC in NJ, I saw the movie at a theater directly across the Hudson River from Manhattan. Here we're close (too close?) to the topic physically and emotionally.<br/><br/>As a result of the emotional proximity audiences have to the subject, this is a strange movie. I think Oliver Stone, being a great filmmaker, understood that the audience would be bringing a tremendous amount of emotion to the movie, so the movie he made is actually very emotionally flat compared with most films. WE are supplying the emotion to the movie, instead of the other way around.<br/><br/>Sure, there are points where you tear up, but almost any vivid description of 9/11 will do that; that's not the movie, that's the material. The recreations of the ground zero rubble are remarkable, and the opening scenes where the towers have been CGI'd back into the Manhattan skyline are touching. For locals, we remember the weirdness of the first time we drove back to work and didn't see the towers.<br/><br/>Because our wound is still raw, the movie treads very lightly. So lightly that as the wound heals, this won't be the definitive movie on the WTC. I think the definitive movie won't be made for at least another 5-10 years, from a historical, not contemporary, perspective.<br/><br/>Technically, it is very well-done. As the men are trapped, the film does an incredible job of conveying their terror. This is excellent work, but within this narrow plot line the film becomes divorced from the context. Ultimately, this could have been about firefighters in a collapsed building or earthquake survivors.<br/><br/>Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal are more talented than their roles required. There isn't a lot you can do or need to do with the ""is my husband dead?"" role.<br/><br/>(Spoilers here) If you stand back from the subject and analyze the plot, the story is about brave people who did their job by going into the towers. They are alive because the Sgt. was luckily prudent (they went downstairs to get spare oxygen before heading up) and quick-thinking (diving toward the elevator shaft as the building collapsed). They never even had a chance to actually save anyone before being trapped.<br/><br/>The rescuers were brave and prudent, taking out the one before going back for the other.<br/><br/>In no way would I, in real-life, want to diminish their heroism in any way, as these are braver men than me. But they were, in the realm of movie-making, ""ordinary heroes"" (if there is such a thing). In other words, they aren't cops like ""John McClane"" in Die Hard. In real-life, I am grateful for the people who serve and protect; as a movie, John McClane is more interesting to watch.<br/><br/>And we're like water balloons of emotion when it comes to 9/11; the tiniest prick and we're ready to burst, so Stone played it safe and flat. Stone was in a hard place. If the film had been more emotional it would have felt manipulative. Unfortunately, instead we have a film that simply isn't particularly compelling.<br/><br/>Ultimately, when the debate is about whether a movie should have been made rather than about what the movie says, that's not a ringing endorsement."
"mfsor","10","4","10","12 August 2006"," Heroic
","This movie could have been so many other things, about terror, about construction, about a city. But it was about people who offered up their lives because they loved other human beings. It was a perfect movie for Nicholas Cage, who can be so serious in his dedication. It showed what we have expected about New York public servants, who went in to try and save others no matter what the cost to themselves. the most moving part of the film was just before the collapse, when they met all the firemen going into the towers to their deaths. Equally impressive was the way the rescuers were portrayed. It was great that they didn't show anything the terrorists did, all you got was what New Yorkers saw after the fact."

"mrhockey123-1","10","4","10","12 August 2006"," Very touching
","I realized at the start of this movie that it seems a bit tacky that we are seeing a director attempt to put together a convincing ""reality"" of something that really happen and that we all collectively lived through (even if it was vicariously by watching CNN.) That feeling quickly went away as I got drawn into what really is a human drama.<br/><br/>This movie really picks up steam as it goes on, but it starts off being very confusing because we keep being introduced to new characters and families and we have no idea whose families they are. As the movie goes on and we figure out who the families are, it becomes easier for the audience to identify with the families and with the main characters (the 2 trapped firemen.) I really liked the fact that the director chose to completely ignore politics and ""the greater issues"" because in reality, the GREATEST ""issue"" is the human one. This movie did a great job of boiling life down and showing what is absolutely the most important thing, which is family. Race, religion, political affiliation were all 'checked at the door' when the movie started, and it added greatly to this movie.<br/><br/>The best quality of this movie is that it showed that human beings can be caring and compassionate, and that they can risk their own lives to try and help strangers. And you know, when I think back to that fateful day and the events that happen thereafter, that is the one memory that is most etched in my mind, that people from all over the country and even from Canada did everything they could to help whether it was by coming to NYC or by simply opening up their homes to passengers who were grounded all over North America.<br/><br/>The director of this movie wanted to show that we are humans- humane beings- before we are black, white, Christian, jew or Muslim. In my opinion, he succeeded."

Directed with surprising restraint from the usually histrionic Oliver Stone, the filmmaker depicts the chain-of-events thanks to a straight forward screenplay from novice scribe Andrea Bailiff from the cops perspective, flashbacks in memories and in the nightmarish limbo their wives (Bello and Gyllenhaal, respectively, and both terrific) waited with the rest of the world for an uncertain future.

","World Trade Center is based on a true story about two port authority police officers trapped under the rubble of the World Trade Center and the families that try everything to rescue them. This film is extremely powerful and can traumatize a lot of people who are still affected by the tragic incident or the loved ones they lost. Oliver Stone, director of political films such as JFK, Nixon, and Born on the Fourth of July, uses very little politics in the film and as your watching it, it's hard to tell that its made by him. He's been in kind of a funk lately and I think that in this film, he has broken out of it. The two main leads played by Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena as the police officers trapped in chaos did very well and it should of made the two real life police officers very proud. Overall, this was a good film that will get more and more appreciated as time goes by. I recommend it.<br/><br/>Hedeen's Outlook: 8/10 *** B"

","NOTE: I'd like to thank my sister Cynthia for her complementary comments.<br/><br/>When very young kids go to school someday, one of the questions that their teachers will ask is : ""Ask to your parents where they were on September 11, 2001?"" A similar question which was asked in the past was: ""Where were you on November 22, 1963 when President Kennedy was murdered?"" <br/><br/>For those who lived through this day (including me), we will always remember where we were when we learned the news. In my case, I was in a biology class in my high school when my teacher came up in the class with these news on this Tuesday in September.<br/><br/>The day (and the entire week, should I precise it) has been a day where television took an almost-unprecedented importance, in my small city as well as in any other place on the planet. Because the terrifying scenes of the planes hitting the World Trade Center and the Pentagon instantly entered into the collective memory and the horror of these scenes was even greater than the first time that moviegoers saw Anthony Perkins stabbing Janet Leigh in ""Psycho"".<br/><br/>There will never be a movie which will surpass and the emotion and the feelings experienced live on 9/11. I don't mean that there won't be any good movie about 9/11 but it won't be worth the images broadcast millions of times by CNN, ABC, CBS, FOX...<br/><br/>So why would anyone produce a film like ""World Trade Center""? With a director like Oliver Stone (who likes to draw the attention), we could have doubted that it was another publicity shot from the famous filmmaker, as were ""Platoon"", ""JFK"" and ""Natural Born Killers"".<br/><br/>The film's story is very simple and could be summarized in one sentence or two. The movie is about two NYPD policemen who found themselves under the WTC rubble on 9/11 and their families who pray for a miracle.<br/><br/>This script is rather unusual for a politicized director like Oliver Stone. The last time that Stone examined so much the human side of a drama in one of his movies, it's probably in ""Platoon"" in 1986. By the way, this movie won the Academy Award for Best Picture on that year.<br/><br/>Stone can thank his principal actors. Nicolas Cage and Michael Peña are the two officers trapped under the ruins and Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhall are their respective spouses. The four of them offer a touching and emotionful interpretation.<br/><br/>The movie alternates for almost 90 minutes on three plans: the two policemen, Cage's family and Peña's family. Stone succeeds in giving a fair dose of suspense even when we know since the beginning that at the end, they're gonna come through alive.<br/><br/>The movie begins very slowly but the approach is ingenious. Stone takes his time before showing the main characters, only to show the city and its citizens getting up on that morning. At that moment, nobody suspects anything. People are busy getting to the job, opening their shops or chatting about Derek Jeter's performance during the weekend game. This approach only wants to show that every extraordinary day always begins like a very ordinary day.<br/><br/>The picture that always come to my mind in the movie is the one where the man on the boat watches the twin towers. Was he suspecting that they would disappear completely before the end of the morning? We must admit that the entire film is slow and could annoy many viewers. But it remains nevertheless a very personal and very touching vision from Stone's part and even if it's not his best picture, it's way better than the ""Alexander"" flop two years earlier.<br/><br/>""World Trade Center"" is one of a few stories which shows pictures that TV stations didn't show. The collapse of one of the towers on the rescuers is terribly catchy and the pictures shot from under the rubble are amazingly realistic. The pseudo-patriotic mood at the end is not really appreciated and the police officers' reaction when the first images are shown on TV is disappointing, but these mistakes are easily forgivable.<br/><br/>For a movie so hard to make, this is a very acceptable result. For sure, nothing is comparable to the actual pictures, but those from Stone's film work where they have to work. That's a very good 9/11 flick."

","I saw this at a screening held at USC for the students 3 weeks before its release date. After the film the producer, Stacey Sher, who is a USC alumni, answered questions about the movie. She said many things about the film which made it make more sense. Firstly, its a movie about September 12th more than what happened on Sept. 11th. The story at no time mentions what happened that day except from the perspective of the two characters, John and Will. No recreation of the events were shown (except of course the events that happened to the two characters, and anything seen of the attacks were news footage taken that day). It is purely the story of the two characters. The marine character who found the two trapped men really was like that (at the time of the screening he had served 2 tours of duty and hadn't yet seen the film). I think though that the most interesting part of the film is that the actual PAPD who helped rescue the real men were playing parts in the movie (Will and John are actually the two men at the end with Nic and Michael). A lot of people commented that they were pleasantly surprised by the film. I really liked the film just from the fact that it is a universal rescue story set amongst the Sept 11th event and that it is a story about true human emotions and kindness, regardless of what happened that day. I'd actually give it 7.5 but can't give half marks in the vote."

I knew she knew I want to go so, I went with her. So I went in the movie, looking around me , feeling so lame being at the movies with my mom. I sat down, still kinda hiding from anyone that might see me, G-d forbid I get caught with my mom at the movies, right? Well the movie started, and I forgot about that. I got lost in the movie, It was definitely dramatic and suspenseful...and above all...real. You see everything. What everyone went through...and how they went through it...it was terrible yet very inspiring. When the ending credits were starting, 2and a half hours later, and they were saying how many people dies and all that, I didn't even care that I was OH NO! at the movies with my mom. You know, the movie shows how much I take for granted, we all do really. I was sitting there thinking, ""Thank G-d I'm sitting here with my mom watching this movie, truly thank G-d"" Its definitely a truly great film and I want everybody to see it. The acting is brilliant, the special effects scarily real, and the message between the lines, and the story it boldly tells, priceless. Definitely the movie of the year. Now, if and when you go see this movie, I want you to do something. I'm challenging you to go see this with your family, or at least a parent, rather you go with them often the movies or not.

","i was really looking forward to this movie.<br/><br/>the way i see it there are two main reasons to make this movie. first is to draw some grand conclusions about the experience. what did it all mean. the other is to show us what we couldn't see on TV. what cinema only can show. i wanted to see the planes crash in the buildings. what was it like to be on the floor where the plane pushed in. what did it look like close up. and more over ..one of the true dramas of the tragedy ....what happened up there. what did kind of hell and internal debate did the people up there go through: should i jump or would i burn alive if i didn't. this movie didn't do either. the big revelation was that one should try to stay alive and that people are capable of good deeds. but that's something i already knew after watching program after program on TV. as to what happened in those towers ... cnn showed more .... in this movie we only see a shadow of the plane. we never see them hit the buildings. i'm not sure if it was a budgetary issue<br/><br/>...but hey ...i saw the planes hit the towers on the today show. how come not in the movie ?<br/><br/>the movie did show me what it might have been like when that building came down on you. that 30 second sequence showed me something i hadn't seen a million times on the TV news. the movie did show what it would have been under that rubble. i had no idea there were those weird spacey sounds. like a sinking ship almost. thank you for that. i had no idea.<br/><br/>the biggest single problem i had with this film was that it was a too sentimental for my taste and it felt a little like a made for TV film. it would have played better without the violins underscoring every emotion. the subject is so powerful, the emotions so strong and raw, i don't need to be manipulated to feel them. less would have been more.<br/><br/>but the truth is i did get misty eyed a couple of times. i did want the couples to reunite. i did want the guys to live. i maybe would have rooted even more for them if they'd been less cartoony though. after two hours i have no idea what party any of the people would have voted for. i have no idea what would have made them laugh. i have no idea what they thought of any of the many issues that get the country riled up. i have no idea who these people were.<br/><br/>i'm one of those people who likes oliver stone. there are many places in this film where you know you're watching a great film maker ...but honestly this is not one of his best and maybe have waited a couple of more years before tackling this subject ...."
"Anonymous_Maxine","4","3","7","11 March 2008"," The worst terrorist attack in Hollywood history.
","It seems that Oliver Stone's patriotism is too much for him to objectively helm a story like World Trade Center, which focuses on two firefighters trapped in the rubble of the twin towers after the September 11th attacks. The problem with the movie is that it is simultaneously trying to be a memorial to those killed in the attacks (and particularly honor the bravery of the firefighters) and still retain some realism. As a memorial it is successful, although pretty cloying at times, but the realism fails completely. If, in fact, there was any intention towards realism at all.<br/><br/>In the latter point, it may very well be that Stone was not going for realism. I am no expert on the logistics of collapsing buildings, but I have read extensively on the subject of the attacks, as I imagine most Americans have, and I've seen a lot of pictures as Ground Zero was being cleared of the bottom floors of the towers. In one picture, I remember seeing a messy wall of material that looked as solid as a rock which was about 10-12 feet high, which was described as 15-20 floors compressed together. The idea that two firefighters are caught underneath the 100+ floors of collapsing towers is laughable, and this, my friends, is not a comedy. <br/><br/>Then again, I think the focus of the film is on the breed of suffering and heroism involved in the rescue efforts just after the attacks, and the plight of the firefighters' families and their loved husbands and fathers and brothers and sons rushed off into what looked so much like certain death. This is the most heroic thing that many Americans have ever seen, certainly for me. And while the film succeeds at telling these stories and at moving the audience (really, the 9-11 attacks are so engrained in the American mind that it's impossible not to be moved), although it is definitely guilty of trumping up the Hollywood bravado to an almost unbearable degree at times. <br/><br/>Because of this, a lot of the movie comes across as contrived, which is too bad, because when you watch something as important to America as this, you don't want to ever feel like you're looking at a sound stage, you don't ever want to feel like you can sense the crew standing just a few feet away from the action on screen, sipping nonfat caramel macchiattoes and flipping through the latest shooting script, wondering if they can squeeze in any more heroic one liners. But you can here. A lot. <br/><br/>There has been some talk about the irony of Oliver Stone, not exactly popular with the conservative crowd, making a film that is described by many right-wingers as the most ""pro- American, pro-family, pro-faith, pro-male, flag-waving, God Bless America films you will ever see."" It also mentions a connection between the attacks to the war in Iraq. I had been under the impression that such a connection had long since been discredited, but no matter.<br/><br/>It is a difficult situation that the two main characters are trapped and almost completely unable to move for about half the movie, and it's unfortunate that, to keep the action moving, we see some of those deadpan emotional flashbacks of the guys with their wives and kids, which just strikes me as something that should never be in a film like this, if only because it is such weak screen writing. Remember that slow motion scene in Top Gun showing Goose with his wife and kid? They may as well add a subtitle saying he's gonna die soon.<br/><br/>There is another film about the 9-11 attacks, United 93, which is vastly superior to this one. It has been criticized for having too little emotion which, interestingly, is exactly what this movie needed. The emotions involved with the September 11th attacks are strong and universal, we don't need a movie to hold our hand and lead us through them. United 93 succeeded because it presented the facts in an almost documentary style, allowing the audience to feel their own emotions. Not this movie, and it's too bad.<br/><br/>There is one rather bizarre looking character, Dave Karnes (based on a real man), who saw the attacks on TV and immediately knew that the country was at war. He rushed to Ground Zero and managed to help the two heroes escape from the rubble, and then the film closes with a title card that mentions that he went on to serve two tours of duty in Iraq. Nothing is mentioned about the fact that Iraq was not involved in the attacks, but the focus is on the patriotism, not fighting the right battle. <br/><br/>Stone has been justifiably criticized for this connection, similar to the conspiracy theories that he presented in JFK. I'm normally a big fan, but this goes down as one of the great many movies that SHOULD have been a great, important American film, and just isn't."
"normagenewarren","9","3","7","1 September 2006"," Great Movie...
","I didn't think this movie played on the pain of the family as hugodinwitty has stated. This movie is NOT about 9/11 as a whole...and Oliver Stone never wanted it to be a movie about 9/11 as a whole. With everything that happened that day and the amount of tragedy that occurred that day, it would impossible to make a movie about 9/11. This was a movie about two Port Authority guys and their families. If you are looking to get more out of the story...that isn't what the movie is about. It depicts the story of what two survivors experienced when the WTC got hit and when the towers fell. It doesn't even show the actual plane hitting the buildings because once again this is what the two Port Authority guys experienced...not the entire story of 9/11. I think the movie was well done and it made the tragedy even more real for me when you see these guys and their families go through what they do. I actually went to the Port Authority memorial website and saw the rest of the guys who were part of this tragedy who did not survive and you realize that this is more than a just a movie. I truly appreciated how delicately Oliver Stone handled this movie. We will never forget."
"bgood26","10","3","7","31 August 2006"," A must see... for those who can
","This is not an easy movie to watch. Much of the movie shows PAPD Officer Will Jimeno (Michael Peña) and Sgt. John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) under the rubble of World Trade Center Two. It is dark and claustrophobic, and you will feel their pain, their anger, and their fear. They literally kept each other alive by talking to each other, knowing that if they fell asleep, odds are they wouldn't wake up, and if one died, the other would, too.<br/><br/>But ""World Trade Center"" is not told solely from the point of view of the officers. It also looks at Allison Jimeno and Donna McLaughlin (Maggie Gyllenhall and Maria Bello are perfectly cast), the wives of the hero officers, as well as their families, and the toll the day's events took on their lives.<br/><br/>I'm the first to admit that when I heard Oliver Stone was directing ""World Trade Center,"" I worried that it would be a political commentary laden with conspiracy theories. Far from it. Stone and writer Andrea Berloff took great care in leaving politics out of the movie. The dialogue was not only believable, but it was all New York. You can tell that the four stars spent a lot of time with the people they portray.<br/><br/>The only thing I would have changed in this movie is to have the time of day in which the scenes took place, just for continuity.<br/><br/>If you can watch a movie based on the single worst day in American history, I urge you to see ""World Trade Center."""

","It's dramatic when anyone is trapped somewhere, injured and thirsty, and then rescued from slow death in the nick of time by a determined emergency team.<br/><br/>And man, does this film know that.<br/><br/>'World Trade Center' is not about 9/11 per se. The terrible events of that fateful day provide merely the backdrop for a buried-alive tale of looming death and serendipitous rescue. But it does so almost half-heartedly, like someone telling you a joke with a punch-line he knows will disappoint.<br/><br/>We follow the fortunes in this film of two Port Authority beat cops as they get called to the towers that terrible morning, get confused, and then get buried alive in the twisted wreckage of the collapsed skyscrapers.<br/><br/>Bless the two real-life heroes whose true story inspired this film. These dudes put their lives on the line to save others. I just wish their story had found its way into a better movie.<br/><br/>Michael Pena and Nicholas Cage authentically play the two buried cops and some of their interplay works. But most of the dialogue throughout the film bores us so utterly it seems to curdle as it leaves the actors' very lips. The plot unfolds like a made-for-TV movie replete with dippy scenes of angst and hand-wringing amongst family-members. We meet them AS they come unglued instead of BEFORE they come unglued and then watch dumbly as the holes are filled in with clunky flashback scenes sopping wet with sentiment.<br/><br/>Zzz.<br/><br/>In an odd little sub-plot that seems like something right out of a recruitment film, the true story of USMC David Karnes is portrayed. Inspired back to active duty by the terror of that day, Karnes suits up, heads to New York, and finds the buried cops almost single-handedly. And if true, bravo indeed. But in the obligatory epilogue, we learn Karnes proceeds to serve two tours of duty in Iraq. Bless all our fighting men, of course, but whatever your politics, watching an Oliver Stone film in which the connection between 9/11 and Iraq goes completely unexamined was unusual to say the least.<br/><br/>In 'World Trade Center,' a director who's had a lot to say about recent history and what his generation called ""the establishment,"" we seem to get a film that smacks of a highly public apology to the American mainstream for dumping so much doubt at its doorstep for so long.<br/><br/>As amusing as it is to watch my parents' Boomer generation tacitly apologize to their parents' Greatest generation for being so naughty, this disaffected Gen-Xer would have preferred blowing his 9 bucks on a decent movie.<br/><br/>This movie review by Erik Gloor"
"Doylenf","7","3","7","16 August 2006"," A narrow focus vs. a wider horizon...
","Some will call it the strength of the film--the fact that it deals almost exclusively with two of the trapped police officers beneath the 9/11 rubble rather than giving us a broader view of the tragic event. Others will lament the fact that it never widens its horizons to show us a more complete picture.<br/><br/>Whatever, Oliver Stone has done a commendable job with what he has chosen to show--but leaving me with the feeling that I, personally, would have preferred a wider horizon of events. Instead he has chosen to tell the story while the men are trapped by going back and forth from the rescue scene to their worried families. It must be said that all of the dialog for these family scenes is completely natural and never seems forced or over sentimentalized.<br/><br/>He has chosen not to show the actual footage of planes hitting the building at the start of the film--except for a background shot of TV footage--and the only time we are even reminded that planes did this damage is when we see a shadow of a plane against a skyscraper shortly before the first tower is hit. I think it's a mistake not to have shown this important footage as a prelude to his story.<br/><br/>Of course, the dialog (which shows how much better communication should have been between police officers), does mention planes from time to time, so it's hard to understand just why Stone chose to blunt the visual impact this would have had at the opening of his film.<br/><br/>Instead, he confines all of his coverage to the rescue efforts of two very heroic survivors who manage to keep each other alert under perilous circumstances. Since the two men are played in a totally real and sympathetic manner by NICOLAS CAGE and MICHAEL PENA, it is especially hard to witness their struggle to stay alive as even more dangerous rubble falls around them, making them even more vulnerable and helplessly trapped amid new explosions.<br/><br/>All of the technical factors are excellent with regard to the realism of the war zone damage (before it was called a war), but strangely missing from the ground damage is the white ash that covered so many who ran from the huge clouds of smoke and debris. Only huge amounts of paper are strewn about, as though the ash never existed. This is the one technical blunder I found almost unforgivable.<br/><br/>The women are competent, nothing more, as played by MARIA BELLO (as Cage's wife) and MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL as Pena's pregnant spouse. The emotional investment in the story depends entirely on the performances of Cage and Pena and they don't disappoint. Both are extremely real and affecting in difficult roles that limit their physicality due to being caught beneath the tower's rubble.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's time for this to be seen for what it really is--a good reminder of the enemy we faced that day and still do--without politicizing the event the way we might expect Stone to do. And since most Americans seem to have short memories, it's a good thing Stone made this film when he did, memorializing the start of a new kind of war that began five years ago on 9/11."
"Vash2001","8","3","7","12 August 2006"," A little disappointing
","I went in there with very high expectations because the review in the local newspaper was very positive. I came out a bit disappointed.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead.....<br/><br/>The movie started great- we all remember that morning, what were we doing when we saw the news. It was nice to see what the people involved were doing that morning- for example McCoghlin getting up at 3:25am to go to work, driving to his office, it being just another day, etc. The men knew nothing about the second tower since they were rushing to the first one. The images were astounding, even though we have seen them hundreds of times by now. The reactions of the people in NYC were shown well. The whole scene was recreated as it happened that morning. The movie really built up to the point where McCoughlin and Jimeno and others in their group got trapped.<br/><br/>It was good to see initially what the families were doing, how did they find out, their worries, etc. However, at some point the movie lost the intensity and got in a rhythm of WTC rubble-Family worries- WTC rubble - Family worries.....and so on. Even though this was the focal point of the movie, I think it would have been better to show what was happening to their other team members whose names McCoughlin called out when they first got trapped. We only saw one of them. They could have shown a subplot around the marine that came to the rescue of these two. While they were trapped, I think it would have helped to divert the attention to other areas of the WTC just to exemplify the horror that had just taken place. Afterall this was a story of many heroes, and not just the two officers and their families. The movie just did not reach the heights I had expected it to reach, although I did shed some tears along the way. I think including some other people in the story would have made the story more interesting from a movie perspective. Otherwise one might as well see a documentary, and there are some very good ones about 9/11/01.<br/><br/>The acting by Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena was good as the two officers. It is challenging for any actor to express with only the face, without moving and without using hands and legs. They did a very believable job of showing what these two officers were going through. I read that the real life characters and their wives were very involved in the making of this movie, so I have to assume all the scenes were based on real life events. In the roles of the wives Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello were OK. Maggie was more believable than Maria, whom I liked very much in A history of violence but she seemed to be constrained by the role itself in this movie (just one or two emotions). However, the real star of this movie is the art direction. The visuals are great and they create the main impact. The weakness is the story, and I don't mean any disrespect to the heroes of 9/11/01.<br/><br/>I cannot help comparing this experience with United 93. That one had me riveted. At some point in WTC I just wanted it to end. The back and forth between the families and the two men trapped under the rubble somehow got old. IMO the director needed to find a more creative way of showing it to really hit it home.<br/><br/>I still gave it 8 out of 10 because it still is a very powerful experience. It just did not meet my very high expectations."

","This movie tells the story of 9-11 from the perspectives of two NYC port authority police officers trapped beneath the rubble and their wives waiting at home for news of their fate. It's an interesting way to tell the story. It adds both a touching human element and captures the sheer lack of information available to all involved. But a boom microphone appears at the top of the screen some dozen times during the film. The budget for this film was reported to be around $60 million, yet the repeated appearance of the boom microphone makes it look like a film-school short. The audience chuckled every time it appeared. At one point, I was ready to walk out. It ruins an otherwise nice film."

The families of the two officers are shown as they were upon hearing about the event and the painful wait they had to suffer through to hear any news of their loved ones.<br/><br/>The movie contains a lot of graphic scenes including people jumping, dying, and blood. Not recommended for children, but a must see for adults.<br/><br/>To imagine what it was like for the people there, the noise and the pain... it's all very overwhelming. The two men that were trapped had no idea what was going on around them, or the fact that they were actually trapped under the building and not some random debris. It was interesting to see it from their perspective, they were on the inside without any idea of what was going on.<br/><br/>I had my doubts about the movie before it was out because i felt it was too soon for a theatrical re-telling. I went to see it anyway because my mom's cousin was one of the Port Authority officers that died that day. I'm glad i did.<br/><br/>What I ask people to do as they see this movie is not to look at it as another action packed flick or a film made purely for entertainment's sake, but as the true event that it was. This DID happen to these two men, and maybe more. To say ""the dialog was dull"" or ""the story could have been better"" or ""why couldn't they put more action in it"" would be a criticism. You can't tweak real life so it sells better. The point is that this happened. I'm happy with the way they made it because there was no extra tweaking just to make it a good movie.

","I managed to see an advanced screening of this. I remember seeing the trailer for it and wondering if I was prepared for it and if I could bear it. When I read some information on UNITED 93 and how they were being very careful not to ""offend"" anyone, I had already decided I wouldn't see it. Oliver ""history my way"" Stone has surprised me before and I thought the idea of doing it from a personal perspective of two survivors might be a good thing. I'm glad I wasn't let down. The movie WILL stir some emotions. I'm sure people will complain that they didn't need to show the jumpers or the blood or the ""pepsi commercial"" style cut away to the people around the world watching the news, but personally speaking I'm glad it still stirs emotion to see. We can't sterilize the content of what happened that day and still try to feel for what happened. It just doesn't work. The PC crowd will just have to deal with it. It will remind, anger, incite, inspire and move people...as a good story should. I identified most with the marine who just picked up and left everything to go help. That part of the story was for those of us who wished we had done the same. My main issues were the cliché's and the rather plastic portraits of the families waiting to hear news about their loved ones. Cage's character was, well...Cage. He's rather ""paper bag"" in his alleged serious roles, but the casting of his wife was odd. She was emotionless, even when she was supposed to be crying over the whole thing. All in all I enjoyed this movie, but don't know if I could endure watching it again too soon. Having lived and played in NYC for so long, it was tough enough to watch the first time. Having wanted to rush home and help, I was thankful for the marine's character. Having watched it all transpire, I was thankful it was made. It will anger some and that may be a good thing. Some seem to have forgotten and projected their own issues on the whole event. Some may even be incited to do ""stupid"" things when reminded, but that we're reminded is what's important."

I knew the actual guys survived the disaster but she did not so it gave us two different perspectives to the movie. This movie made me cry earlier in a movie than any other movie I've seen. The music and the emotional parts were very key and in the right places. World Trade Center did not keep one sad the entire movie, but was done well enough to be emotional when it needed to be. I was wondering how they were going to be found and when. My girlfriend was just hoping they would be found so it made it much more taxing on her emotions than it did mine. World Trade Center is a good movie to learn about some survivors of the tragedy. Also, it was good that it wasn't too political. I was happy about that. Overall, I would recommend seeing this movie and the special features on the DVD will be excellent."

","I just want to say that this is a very powerful movie. all of the people that played in the movie did a great job. ThaT DAY WAS A tragic day in American history. IT is hard to believe that it has been five years since that tragic day. I think it was great to see everyone in America standing together during this time of crisis. All police, firefighters, and paramedics, even ordinary people that risked their lives to save others are heroes. The movie is great I highly recommend to go see it. I don't think it is to early to see. This will always be a tragic day in history for us. But thank god we live in the best country in world. We will never forget the people who gave the ultimate sacrifice to save others. Our hopes and prayers go out to everyone that was affected by this tragic event."

","This film marks the end, the absolute end of Oliver Stone's work.<br/><br/>Alexander wasn't great, but you still had that Oliver Stone vibe when you watched it. You still knew who was making it.<br/><br/>World Trade Center is Stone directing a Lifetime movie with an enormous budget. It's competently made...but it's doesn't feel like it's Oliver Stone signed sealed, and delivered.<br/><br/>Once upon a time you could sit down and watch a movie and knew he directed it without even knowing the title. Now, well, after Alexander, you can tell he had a hand in the script and that's really it.<br/><br/>WTC doesn't have the mark of Oliver Stone on it and, honestly it sucks because of it."

","As we celebrate today the 14th anniversary of this horrible tragedy, I decided to watch World Trade Center which recall the real stories of John McLaughlin and William Jimeno, two Port Authority police officers caught in the middle of the disaster and survived it after several hours stuck in the rumbles.<br/><br/>This movie is really moving and make us proud to be American. Just like this US Marine who decided to fly from Connecticut to help for the search of survivors or this ex paramedic who came to rescue Will and finally save his life.<br/><br/>This was an awful day but we saw the best of us coming through getting together as a Nation to rise up from the chaos.<br/><br/>Because this is what this movie is about. It's about not giving up, fight for the people we cherish the most despite the horrific situation we have to face. It's simply about life. There are other movies about 9/11 including Flight 93 to make us remember about the awesome bravery of all those people who sacrificed their life to save others. World Trade Center is for all the Heroes from law enforcement and NYFD who went there to rescue people and for some of them lost their life in the process.<br/><br/>So to all, thank you for all you did for your sacrifice. This movie is for you. God bless you."

","Highly underrated movie that follows the will to survive of two Port Authority Policemen after that attacks on the World Trade Center on 9/11. Special affects are amazing. I know the former WTC complex very well and from every angle of this film, it looks just like it did. Its almost laughable about how many idiots pan this movie for various things like one comment about the Jesus figure showing up. Ever consider thats what that policeman saw while going in and out of consciousness? The acting is fine. Like any of the totally stupid action movies that came out this summer are Oscar material. I know I'm getting old when great movies like this get panned, yet crowds head to the theaters for the stupidest movies nowadays. Don't listen to the bad reviews. Give this a look over and judge for yourself. Along with United 93, this movie does a great job of putting the viewer in the shows of the people who were directly impacted that day. It almost didn't feel like a Oliver Stone movie. So if thats a reason your not giving it a chance, you should see it anyway.."

","I usually watch movies after reading the reviews on this portal and most of the times I find majority of reviews helpful. There have been occasions when some movie reviewed here was not what I found in it, but this time its outrageous! I haven't seen or read more nonsense by so many reviewers, all pushing down with all their weight on this masterpiece.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the best I have seen in my life. The film is not about 9/11 as a terrorist attack, its about humans. It shows the good and the bad face of humanity at the same time. I am surprised that so many reviewers missed this simple point! Yes, its true that two cops were not the only sufferers but then we must swallow the fact that its not a documentary.<br/><br/>The story starts with a momentum and keeps the pace and thrill maintained till the very last scene. The drama is not exaggerated and there are no artificial looking special effects and still it manages to make me glued to the screen, just by the intensity of emotions flowing around for the entire length. Technically the cinematography is outstanding and for those who like to watch every frame in detail there is enough substance. The screenplay couldn't be better. It could be more dramatic or with more action, but not better.<br/><br/>Once again, I am surprised at the nonsense by those reviewers who could not grasp this movie. A masterpiece for me though. After reading all these reviews I had almost abandoned the idea of watching it, but thanks to my curiosity, I watched it and was compelled to write this review.<br/><br/>My advice, watch this, as a movie and not as a documentary, which you would anticipate because of its title."
"bob the moo","Null","2","4","6 June 2007"," Pretty good despite being flawed in some ways and also getting a head start emotionally as a drama due to the subject matter
","The morning of 11th September 2001 started just like any other for the police officers on duty in the Port Authority. However when a plane flies into one of the World Trade Centre towers, the majority of units are mobilised to respond. Sergeant McLoughlin and a small group of men go into the tower to try and rescue survivors from the floor above. Still at the foot of the towers when the first building collapses, McLoughlin's men are swamped and soon it is only him and rookie Jimeno left alive trapped in a small cavern below the rubble.<br/><br/>Hard film to really review and judge this one. On one hand I was clearly moved and engaged by parts of it to the point where I did have to wipe away tears, but on the other hand, witnessing the death of thousands on live television and reliving those thoughts and feelings will hopefully always draw that reaction from me  not just for the deaths on the day but for the world we have lived in and the countless deaths that arguably happened as a result of this day. And that is pretty much how it was with this because I did find it hard to disconnect the wider topic from the story of the two men trapped. Perhaps this was the intension of Stone, to avoid replaying the footage we have all seen but instead make it a human story. If so then he succeeded but in doing so he didn't achieve the (perhaps impossible) task of making me treat this as just the story I was being told.<br/><br/>This I found some of the flashbacks to be dull and quite unnecessary, filling in the lives of characters who really I already cared about  not as individuals perhaps but as receptacles holding a lot of other souls within them, while some of the family sequences were perhaps a bit too heavy and long for their own good. The film is at its best when it is depicting the scale of the losses while also highlighting the humanity of the response (well, initial response) from people from everywhere. It is unavoidably sentimental at times but mostly I was impressive by how it generally avoided mawkishness and really pushing buttons. I was worried for other reasons when I learned Stone was making the film  because of his track record of how he approaches subjects  but in the end the film is directly really well, handling the subject sensitively without reducing its impact and working well with the darkness and close-ups of the trapped men.<br/><br/>The cast are mostly good and I do think that the same material delivered by lesser actors could easily have seen it plummeting to the level of daytime TV melodrama but you can see the effort the majority put into making this as genuine as they can. Cage gives a good performance and, these days, that should be sufficient praise. OK he is pinned and limited but he does what is asked of him. Peña I liked more as he had more expression and screen to work with. Shannon was effective and tough as Dave Karnes  and the film is kind enough to not explore his instant thoughts of war and revenge for fear it would leave a sour taste now that we are neck deep in Iraq; equally Dorff and Whaley give good ""heroic ordinary guy"" late in the film. Being in the families was a tougher job for the cast as this is the side that could have been soapy. Casting Gyllenhaal and Bello seems like the best way of countering that and indeed that is just what they do, making real their characters.<br/><br/>Not a perfect film by any means then, because it does drift into soap opera and it does rather feel that we never get into the focused story within the bigger one, no matter how tightly it pulls the narrative around it. Still good and better than it easily could have been, but the real events do help by providing the emotion and shock already built in to the audience."

","Firstly I understand this is a very sensitive subject to make a movie about and it's extremely hard to please everyone and I don't think it's even possible. Everyone had a different story that day but the producers in this case chose to focus on 2 officers and how they survived the impossible and how it affected their families.<br/><br/>Overall I think it kinda shows the pain and the suffering for everyone with these people, but personally, I think the producers should have gone in a different direction and tell the story differently. It feels weird to say this but I kinda enjoyed the movie. To me, it felt like they should have told the story in a bigger way and not focus so much on a few characters, but the movie is made and you can't do anything about. This is what we got.<br/><br/>Overall I think some people will enjoy watching it and quite a lot not. Personally, after watching it, this feels like not the best movie and not the worst one, it's somewhere in the middle around 7 out of 10.

"JMichaelAtchue","7","0","0","12 September 2019"," A Solid Tribute to the Heroes of September 11
","Oliver Stone's ""World Trade Center"" is a well-acted and emotionally satisfying tribute to those who gave their all when the Twin Towers fell on September 11, 2001. Unlike many of Stone's previous films, he mostly ignores the politics of the era and instead focuses on developing a touching, human story about ordinary people in an impossible situation. ""World Trade Center"" lacks the same dramatic punch that defined ""Platoon,"" ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" and ""JFK,"" and the pacing is too slow - especially in the second act. I also wish that Stone had done more to establish the main characters in the first act, which would've hightened my interest in the overall story. But by the end of the movie I was hooked into the lives of the real-life first responders and their families, all of whom are portrayed beautifully by the film's cast. In particular I was impressed by Michael Shannon and Michael Peña, who carry every scene they're in. Maggie Gyllenhaal also shines as a woman agonized with worry over her husband, and even Nicholas Cage gives a restrained and sympathetic performance. Stone, a native New Yorker, uses his strong cast and compelling visuals to recreate the horror of 9/11 and salute those who sacrificed so much on that darkest of days. I watched this movie on September 11, 2019 to commemorate the tragedy that happened 18 years ago. Needless to say I wasn't disappointed. 7/10."

"nEoFILM","Null","0","0","31 October 2011"," NOT Flight 93
","Oliver Stone tackling 9/11 seemed to be a dream come true. The anti- establishmentarian looking at one of America's and indeed the worlds darkest, rawest and most politically charged events would on the surface appear to be one of the most anticipated movies of the decade. Was it? No.<br/><br/>The very English and down to earth Paul Greengrass tackled the same subject with his film released earlier that same year, United 93 with a very clinical take, and one that I believe will stand the test of time, in ways that this very certainly will not. World Trade Center follows the experiences of two Port Authority Police Officers who went into the towers and were caught in the collapse.<br/><br/>The film covers these events in detail and only touches on the rest of the story as experienced by the two leads, so my first major gripe with this film is its title. This is NOT about the World Trade Center, it is simply set within its death throes. What's there is fine, though nothing more than a well-directed ""Lifetime Movie Of The Week"", but it doesn't feel like a major motion picture dealing with one of histories darkest days.<br/><br/>United 93 covers the ground promised by this title, and though that film follows American Airlines Flight 93, it places the flight in the overriding context of the day as a whole. This film simply has two cops arrive at what would become known as Ground Zero, flatten them under the rubble, play out all the cliché's of trapped people under the rubble and places the passé story into the grander context of the day.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed with this one, as I chose this over United 93, which was my film of the year for 2006, but World Trade Center implied something so much but clearly, we're still along way from being ready to tell this story theatrically, as it needs to be. The wounds are still too raw and it's not yet time for the three-hour epic melodrama that this film could have been.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass's approach of a clinical documentary style was as far a we were prepared to go for a chilly film, but Oliver Stone, the angry genius behind JFK, Nixon and Platoon, has clearly gone soft and made as safe a film as was humanly possible, maybe in an attempt to regain some creditably after the undue failure that was Alexander.<br/><br/>For the time being we will have to watch the endless docudrama on the horror of New York that day, but as for theatrical features, you will not go wrong with United 93."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","0","0","22 July 2007"," The Hollywood take on 9/11
","World Trade Center is a film that hopes to gain importance simply by virtue of its subject matter. It thinks that because it's about 9/11 people will immediately respond to it. And while it's impossible not to be affected by certain aspects of the film, it really doesn't deserve some of the emotion it generates. It's a pretty cheap film  cheap in that while the magnificent United 93 presented a totally objective view of what happened on that plane, World Trade Center is always trying to pull strings.<br/><br/>The most objectionable element of World Trade Center is the portrayal of Marine Kames. We first see him sitting before a huge crucifix, where he tells someone that god has given him special gifts. Then we see him getting a haircut. In this scene he's wild-eyed, like he's enjoying the chaos that is unfolding. But later, after turning up at Ground Zero to help out, and after talking to a rescue working about all the dust, he says, ""It's as though God put up a screen of smoke to prevent us from seeing something we are not yet ready to see."" What now? If someone spoke to me like that, I'd think they were insane. And then later on, when he finds the two trapped men, he allays their fears by telling them, in his best psycho GI Joe voice, that he won't leave them: ""We're Marines; you are our mission"". Even when he's helping people he can't help but sound like a massive tool.<br/><br/>But most heinously of all, there's a moment near the end when he phones his workplace and tells them he won't be coming in. ""We're going to need some good men out there to avenge this."" And we then find out that the real person did two tours of Iraq. Erm, excuse me, but that's the wrong country. And anyway, for a film that is supposed to be so apolitical it doesn't send a particularly great message. Yeah, some nutters killed lots of people so let's go into this country that had nothing to do with it and, despite the fact that the country is completely boned because some nutjob is running it, bone it even more. Who cares if a few thousand civilians get caught in the crossfire? Oh, wait <br/><br/>Something else I wasn't particularly keen on were the flashbacks the two trapped men experienced. Bathed in ethereal light, they played like sentimental tripe. Yes I know we tend to take memories and make them better than they are, and I can well imagine that if you're dying you're going to sentimentalise them to an even greater extent, but it just doesn't work in a cinematic context. I'm sure I would have responded more to these scenes if they were played and filmed more naturally.<br/><br/>Indeed, the most powerful scene for me by far was the scene where Cage's wife talks to a black woman. The black lady says that her son operated the elevator in the Trade Center. She then says that the last time they spoke she'd shouted at her son for being late for dinner. She then breaks down. This scene is so much more powerful than all the rest because there's no bullshit about it. There are no tricks; it doesn't feel fake. Who cares about nutjob Marines praying to Jeebus for glorious vengeance? The real story that day was that a couple of thousand people got killed; people with friends and families. It's the pain of those friends and families that matters.<br/><br/>But that leads me to one of the reasons why United 93 is so much more powerful than World Trade Center. In United 93 you watch the whole film knowing that the people on the screen are going to die. In World Trade Center, though, you watch the film knowing that the two guys are going to live. So one film takes the tragedy and confronts it head on and the other kind of brushes everything under the carpet. Yes the story in World Trade Center is worth telling, and yes the work of the rescue workers should be celebrated, but they deserve a better film than this, one that doesn't pussyfoot around as much.<br/><br/>And I have to say, having seen a documentary about the men portrayed in this film, that their experiences were a lot more powerful there than they are here. There's quite a bit of bad acting going on in this film (in a couple of instances Cage's line delivery apes William Shatner's) and curiously enough, there's little drama (I have no idea how Stone did it, but he managed to drain all the life out of the situation). So the emotion that is generated when the two guys are found feels kind of undeserved. We're caught up because we feel empathy for the real people  the filmmakers, though, have earned nothing.<br/><br/>The only person who really comes out of the film with any credit is Maggie Gyllenhaal. Her performance is probably the only one that feels like it could bear some relation to a real person. Her character is both strong and vulnerable, and she has the energy and life that everyone else is so sorely lacking. Plus she's wonderful in the scene where she's re-united with her husband. She plays the pregnant wife of one of the Port Authority policemen and they argue over what name they're going to call their daughter  it has a spontaneity and warmth that isn't present in many other scenes.<br/><br/>But despite everyone's best intentions, I have to say that the film as a whole is a failure. It says nothing about good and evil, and it doesn't serve as a fitting tribute to the rescue workers or the people that died. It's a saccharine, Hollywoodised view of 9/11, and we need that like we need a hole in the head."

","I wouldn't say it was the best movie in the world, but I think that it would be interesting to people because Americans have strong feelings about that day anyway.

I believe that the drama and reality will hit home to a lot of people, whether it's a great movie or not.<br/><br/>It starts looking in on a group of police officers who go in the Trade Centers to help possible wounded people. While in (as we all know) the building collapses leaving them trapped inside. After, the main focus is directed towards two officers trying to stay alive under the wreckage waiting for rescue, and the impact it has on their families.<br/><br/>Yes, it does zero in on just the two families and just mild touches on the millions of other people that were affected as well. I see the point of that. It's the same concept as trying to see the light at the end of the tunnel, no matter how small it seems. People have spent so long mourning the loss of thousands that I believe that the writers wanted to focus on one good outcome of that tragedy, even though it is tiny in comparison to the loss.<br/><br/>Being a member of the military, it helped me keep focus on the purpose of what I do everyday and restored my pride getting a chance to go out of the country and do things not many people get to do.

What about the occupants of the tower? What about people in the area? What about the planes passengers? Not five minutes. We are asked to witness the heroic effort of two cops trying to survive for two hours and, understandably perhaps, they never wonder what is happening on that day to whoever was in those towers.

","I just returned from a sneak preview of World Trade Center and can't say it was good, but it wasn't bad either. It's a great story about courage with the focus, not so much on 9/11, but on the story of 2 policemen and their families.<br/><br/>The problem I had was that if you are going to make a film about 9/11, then tell the story of 9/11. What made that day special was how people joined together to help out in any way possible. Fire departments, police departments and volunteers came from all over the country to offer their services and support.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone's film doesn't touch on any of that for most of the movie. There are no firemen mentioned (don't know if that was a legal issue or not) and really not many characters. Then, for some reason, Stone decided to toss in all of these rescue workers, marines, EMT's, some firemen, etc... for the last 15 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>A lot of people gave their lives that day, and if, as a filmmaker, you are going to use a title like World Trade Center, then you should pay tribute to those people.<br/><br/>On the plus side, Stone did a good job of recreating that day and giving us insight as to how it must have been for families who had loved ones in the WTC.<br/><br/>Overall, I really wanted to like the film, and if you take the characters, put them in another collapsed building, change the title, and made it a stand-alone film, I would've liked it more. But instead, I felt like Stone was just using the World Trade Center name to attract attention and boost the box office numbers."
"Robert_duder","10","4","12","12 August 2006"," Did anyone expect anything less than true greatness??
","There are two sides to this tale. Either People are gonna hate it...I think those people go to this film expecting to see a sensationalized picture about a tragedy complete with explosions, action, and nail biting scenes but all done with a 300 million dollar budget and Nicholas Cage with guns strapped around him. Of course you're going to be disappointed. And then there is likely the other half of the people who would be scared to say otherwise because it deals with such an intense and open wounded topic of an event that happened only five short years ago and completely changed the world and the United States as we knew it. I can only promise that I am reviewing this film completely unbiased and honest to goodness sincerity for what I thought of this film...and I thought it was the most moving and important film in history...PERIOD!! September 11th, 2001 did change everyone's life because something so incredibly tragic has never happened that close to home for North Americans. It wasn't the most tragic event or horrifying event by any means (although it ranks up there) but for us...things like that don't happen close to home. Sitting there and watching Oliver Stone's absolutely breath taking labor of sincere love for his country was truly what brought tears to my eyes. He didn't for ONE SECOND sensationalize the event. Although some say he tip toed and walked on egg shells to avoid certain content...is that his fault?? Or is it another example of him being patriotic, understanding and sincere. Oliver Stone didn't make 9/11 a taboo subject...society did. Society is the one who nurses the open wound regarding this incident and Oliver Stone makes a beautiful and downright thought provoking and depthy epic about this horrible event.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage gives hands down the performance of his career as John McLoughlin, the Port Authority Sergeant in charge of other officers going into Tower one of the World Trade Center following the first plane striking. Cage's performance tops out anything I've ever seen performing 95% of this film buried underneath rubble and with facial expressions and tone of voice and he moves you every time he speaks. Oscar!! Michael Pena plays Will Jimeno, soon to be new Father buried beside McLoughlin. Pena is more vocal than Cage and carries the story and really draws you into his character. He is quite simply put BRILLIANT!! Oscar!! Maria Bello, who is a favorite character actress of mine plays strong in spirit wife of McLoughlin Donna. She has all these kids to protect and stay strong for while she desperately realizes she may never see her husband again whom she feels she hasn't loved to her capacity. Controversial Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Pena's pregnant wife Allison Jimeno and does a terrific job. She appears to be less strong than Bello's character but in fact is holding her whole life together with thoughts of her husband. Both couples separated and with husbands buried beneath the rubble are opposite ends of the same story. The presence of Gyllenhaal is testament to Stone's effort to NOT create a political story but one of survival and love because there is no political statement made whatsoever in this story. (Gyllenhaal made comments following 9/11 regarding the U.S. knowing about the attacks beforehand.) On a smaller scale Michael Shannon plays rescuer and former marine Dave Karnes. Although without a doubt a complete hero Karnes comes across as a little creepy and almost like a rebellious vigilante at first which kind of sticks out of place.<br/><br/>I don't mean to leave out or discount anyone other performances in this film because they are all so well done but these are the main characters that hold this film together. Stone's epic feel to the film and the meticulous recreation of New York before and during the World Trade Center attacks is nothing short of brilliant. His establishing shots of these workers going about their average day with no idea what lies ahead. The fact that he never once shows the towers getting hit or actually collapsing at first bothered me. I mean how can you make the definitive World Trade Center film and not show that but this film is truly from the perspective of the rescue workers and it shows what they saw or heard or felt as the towers were hit and that makes it brilliant!! This is hands down the absolute and ultimate tribute to everyone involved in 9/11 and bravo to Stone who is back on top following the non-success of Alexander. This is one film that you will NEVER forget and you CANNOT leave the theater without feeling something completely different for the entire situation. I say again...the most moving film of all time PERIOD!! Everyone MUST see this film. It's not about politics in ANY way, it's not about sensationalized movie making, it is an epic picture, brilliantly shot, entertaining, breath taking, captivating, non stop story that will draw you in and leave you completely broad sided with it's sheer epic quality. Is it entertainment?? Sure I suppose in some way but it wasn't made with that in mind. I truly believe Stone saw the capacity for a story about human nature and spirit and strength and it will make you cry for so many reasons. First of all the horror that was endured is touched upon but then you're fed this story about these men who survive with each other and with the thoughts of their families that keep them alive. It is the most disturbing and yet uplifting film you could possibly see. I don't review this film based on the fact that I believe it should automatically be a ten out of ten but rather how I felt about it afterwords. It is truly the essential tribute. 10/10!! Please see this film!!<br/><br/>http://www.whig.wowchron.com/<br/><br/>Video Game and Movie forums, Podcast, and Cast Blogs...ALL FOR FREE!!"
"stensson","5","3","8","10 October 2006"," Why this sentimentality?
","Oliver Stone's got resources and he has fulfilled all promises in making a movie which will bring in money to the production company. And this is well done due to the premises. Many, many extras and an impressing build-up of the catastrophe area.<br/><br/>But what annoys viewers from outside the US anyway, is this eternal handkerchief damaging scenes with the families, always described as the total angels. That's ""Hollywood tradition"" at its worst.<br/><br/>This movie would have been stronger if it hadn't concentrated on the fate of these two heroic policemen. Instead there should have been many episodes, including more people. This becomes more of a common action movie than an honest interpretation of what really happened 11th September. Stone can do much better."
"Nanobot","4","3","8","2 October 2006"," it doesn't cover the even,t
","this movie doesn't cover the hole even,t at all. it,s a wast of a good title that was spilled over the story of only two cops and there Famelie. while there was far more to tell then only there story. I don,t understand why hire good actors while there is hardly any story used. this movie can be written down on one page. if you want to know what happen,t that day , I've seen better docudramas the acting is OK but then again there not much to act upon. the problem seems to be that it was filmed in the point of view of only a view. while there was so much happening at once with hundreds of others. it seem the makers have chosen to forget that. which is a shame."

","World Trade Center was the most powerful, emotional movie I have seen in ages...while I do not care for the main star of the film, I got past that in this wonderful movie that brought a human perspective to an animalistic deed and day...I cried for most of the movie...remembering what it was like when I heard the news, the disbelief, the horror...what I felt was nothing what these brave men who without thought for themselves went to not only do their jobs but went in knowing that they may not come back to their families and loved ones. The film was tasteful, non political and very, very powerful. It did however reinforce in me the new found hatred for the extreme Muslim movement that wants to gain control of the world. It strengthened my resolve that the battle with terrorism should never end, we should never let our guards down again, we must prevail as john and will did."
"dunmore_ego","6","3","8","26 August 2006"," A Date With Density
","Oliver Stone's *World Trade Center* is not about the World Trade Center. Nor does it pose questions on conspiracies, religionism, racism, political ideologies, oil collusion or White House incompetence. Which raises the obvious question: why then make a movie about the World Trade Center?<br/><br/>To invoke a known audience. ""World Trade Center"" has become synonymous with ""9-11"" (itself a contraction of a culture-shocking event) and both have become shorthand for proselytizing on courage and heroism and misplaced patriotism. Attaching that moniker to any media - however tangentially  sells tickets. <br/><br/>*WTC* is about two beat cops, John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) who are trapped in the rubble of Tower 1's collapse before they even get the chance to rescue one civilian. (Guess we've added yet another criterion to the term ""heroism"": anyone who INTENDS to rescue people but needs to be rescued himself after doing nothing.) <br/><br/>The first act is restrained film-making at its best, as Stone shows us Tuesday, September 11, 2001, dawning like any other mundane workday, New York populace going through the motions of city life. Comparisons with the unobtrusive camera of Paul Greengrass' superior *United 93* are unavoidable, and  like that movie  a vicarious thrill builds in our bones, for we know something that the New Yorkers don't: that today is going to be so far removed from mundane it will gouge out its own vernacular in history.<br/><br/>The first intimation that there is something horribly awry with this particular September 11th is an ominous plane-shaped shadow whooshing over the cityscape<br/><br/>Stone does not explicitly show airplanes impacting Towers (it would remove focus from his characters), but his scenes of destruction and mayhem are as good as cinema gets. And though there are still whiners puling ""too soon,"" the audience yet extracts a rubbernecker's glee from watching this unimaginable tragedy unfold with astoundingly seamless special effects from a Ground Zero ringside seat.<br/><br/>Stone has also captured excellent performances with the shock, surprise, horror and incredulity of the officers arriving at Ground Zero. Those of us who were not there could never hope to imagine what uncontainable emotions overwhelmed each rescuer's breast as he gazed up at a tableau which the wildest imagination could never conjure. <br/><br/>And after injecting us into the heart of the action, with a breath-stopping sequence trapping our stars under mountains of rubble, the film  like the World Trade Center - collapses. For there is nowhere to go and it becomes obvious that inexperienced screenwriter Andrea Berloff has formulaically set up a tearjerker just waiting to happen. <br/><br/>There's a fine line between restrained and boring. And Stone's hand seems so stultified by the gutless executives who funded this project that he resignedly points his camera over the wrong side of that line. Though he tries to retain relevance to the 9-11 *Götterdämmerung* (by inserting actual newsreel footage of super-Mayor Giuliani, faux-President Bush, reports on United Flight 93, the Pentagon crash, *et al*), even the earth-shuddering impact of the WTC Towers collapsing is soon forgotten when the story turns its focus on the wives of the trappees (Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello) and their maudlin, Academy-tilted performances. It turns into just ""two guys trapped in a mine shaft.""<br/><br/>The movie also loses what little objectivity it strived for when Jimeno launches into an extended ""heroism"" speech (which veritably bends over and spreads its cheeks for the hero mongers). Meanwhile, Cage's initial heartfelt performance of McLoughlin diminishes over time, as he uses up the film's one allocated swear word (as decreed by the MPAA for PG-13 films) early in his desperation and then becomes non-believable, as no one in this mind-breaking situation ever swears after that one transgression, making it all as painfully PG-13 as any Freddie Prinze Junior debacle.<br/><br/>And while Jimeno has dumb Jesus dreams, McLoughlin inertly flashes back to his four kids with the hands-down hottest MILF in the neighborhood (Bello). (If any of our lives were HALF as idyllic as the ""real life"" characters portrayed in any 9-11 movie, the Muslims who razed the Towers would have defected over to white-bread Christianity millennia ago. Or maybe that's why they razed them.)<br/><br/>Nothing continues to happen, proving conclusively that not every true story is worth telling. <br/><br/>The rescue of the two men contains its fair share of nail-biting and was apparently instigated by an ex-Marine, Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon), who abandoned his job in Connecticut and traveled to Ground Zero because ""God called him."" (While talking to Karnes, God must have neglected to head on over to Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Florida and talk to Bush about the attacks. Without a direct word from God, how could *anyone* be expected to abandon the compelling *Pet Goat* to lead a country. Evidently, only *after* the attacks does God deign to start talking with The W.) As we grow to learn of Karnes' delusional nature (obsessing over Marine ethos to the point of asking to be addressed as ""Staff Sergeant""), we realize that this is the exact type of bulldog fundamentalist bred by the American Armed Forces, and that it wasn't God calling him after all  it was his red neck. <br/><br/>To its credit, the story does not make it seem like rescuing its two stars puts an end to the horror, and the unfinished nature of the rescues and aftermath are noted; Jimeno's family walk past a wall full of missing persons, Karnes emerges from the rescue rubble talking of retribution, Dorff's policeman laments the multitude not accounted for, and McLoughlin himself had to undergo 2 years of medically-induced comas and 27 surgeries  well, that'll happen when a World Trade Center falls on you. <br/><br/>Only 20 people were pulled out of the WTC rubble alive. Only eighteen more True Stories with movie deals to go"

","I finally saw the film after reading a myriad of reviews. Although, the actual events surrounding the attack on and collapse of the towers only consume at most 10% of the entire movie, the movie is by no means slow. I found myself checking my watch near the end thinking ""is this over already"" as I was totally absorbed by the thought stream involving the two Port Authority police officers and their families.<br/><br/>Stone has portrayed intense human drama here with the actual historical event as a backdrop and not much else. I could relate to the two men and their families in a way any compassionate person would -- the attacks just magnified their frail state and the short time we all really have.<br/><br/>A very good film not for the history or any national/political statements but for the telling of a survival story worth celebrating."
"FilmFan777","8","3","8","16 August 2006"," Powerful... Very well done!
","You know what I haven't got from most films these past couple of years that I 'did' get from this one? Real emotional involvement. Brought 'into' the story more than from just an observers perspective.<br/><br/>That sense of real danger, anticipation, pain, urgency. The feeling of Closter phobia when in a tight space. I 'felt' the soot and gravel in my mouth. Oliver Stone did just that throughout this film and no, not due the subject matter.<br/><br/>First off, Oliver and writer Andrea Berloff made an interesting, entertaining and well paced film that was also heartfelt. And adding, some things we just take for granted like... being moved.<br/><br/>For instance, the sound was incorporated 'so well' in the film. Not giving away, when the team is in the trade center before it comes down, the sound effects 'really' brought you in to where they were. When the second tower was hit and you hear the boom from the inside... you 'feel' it in your chest 'and' senses. When trapped under rubble after the first tower falls, the second one comes down. You FEEL like your right there.<br/><br/>I was impressed also by 'most' of the actors. Not a big Nick Cage fan however once again, he portrayed the character very well. Well enough for me to forget he was Nick.<br/><br/>Michael Pena (of 'Crash' fame) did a wonderful job portraying officer Will Jimeno. He'll see his actor stock increase by measure for sure. And his job while trapped, not over done, not contrived, very believable and solid.<br/><br/>Maria Bello again solidifies her spot as one 'go to' actor when you need a good performance even from a mild character. She really brought something to this role that helped bring strength yet emotion.<br/><br/>However, Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance for reasons stuck out negatively for me. I've enjoyed past performances from her however this one seemed more contrived and overplayed from my perspective. The performance seemed to take away from the film far more than it contributed.<br/><br/>Overall, with all the hype of it being a film about 9-11, Oliver Stone as director and all else thats been said and mentioned about this film, I'm 'very' glad I went to experience it.<br/><br/>They were not gratuitous by trying to play solely on your emotions about 9-11. No, it's about the true story and events surrounding mostly, two men of courage and they're experience on that horrific day, sprinkled just enough with the event that did take place.<br/><br/>This film ran us through the emotional coaster on most every facet while entertaining us, educating us and letting us share in other peoples experience while reminding us again of our own.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone... no matter what anyone says, you did a justice to this story and very well told in my opinion. Very good job.<br/><br/>GO SEE THIS FILM. You'll be moved, entertained and affected for sure."

The not knowing and the waiting to hear weather or not their loved ones were coming home...Excellent job by the producer and actors. I was in fire school during the events of 9/11 learning how to become a firefighter. We all sat in class watching what was going on with the feeling of shock with tears in our eyes, a few of my classmates quit the next day and joined the army. Seeing a film like this gives me mixed emotions. On one hand I feel that it is kind of to soon to put this out, but on the other hand, I feel it is a great way to memorialize 343 of my brothers that gave there lives that day."

I found none of those things in this movie. It was filled with tasteful images of the events, inspiring messages of hope, and even a sense of introspection.<br/><br/>Once the movie was over, the audience just sat, almost stunned, for several minutes(a true testament to a great film). This film delivers exactly what is says- about the world seeing evil, and two men seeing more- I would like to hope that, as society goes and watches this movie, maybe society in general will see more. This is a type of movie that makes you shake your head- a true social commentary on what is wrong in the world today. My thanks to everyone involved in its creation and production.

","I went in the theater expecting something totally different than what Oliver Stone and his remarkable cast did. Taking a very emotional event and making it into an excellent story about courage, and making every person who was involved seem like a hero in their own way. It also helps the viewer appreciate a different side of the powerful event. Most of us were watching 9/11 from a television in our homes or offices, but this film puts you in the shoes of the people who were actually involved and risked their lives saving complete strangers. I never cry when I watch movies, but I think everyone did at least once while watching this film. If you only see one movie this summer, make it this one, it will blow you away and remind you of how amazing our country and its people really are..."

At last, a tribute to a heretofore unknown police agency and those who serve in it. I wish there would have been better character development.<br/><br/>The film could have shown, in epic fashion, the evacuation, all of the rescuers and their contributions, etc. Instead, we have a very slow paced movie in the semi-darkness with a predictable ending.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Nick Turturro in a cameo role. Too bad he didn't play Jimeno. Nicholas Cage was excellent in his role and I enjoyed his performance. I just wished that the story had been developed better. The dialog was stilted. Cage kept yelling into his radio 8-13 which is PAPD jargon for ""officer needs assistance"", signal 8-1 which is the radio call for sergeant, signal 8-2 refers to a police officer."

","I saw the movie tonight and was so impressed with its sensitivity and realism. It was very emotional to watch but it also brought out some important points. The man who initially found the two officers was prompted by the Spirit to go to New York and help. The two officers had spiritual experiences as they lay buried. It was a gentle reminder to us all that Heavenly Father was there even though many had thought he had deserted them. This was not a usual ""Hollywood"" movie but rather a sharing of a very traumatic experience of real people. We need to appreciate these two men and their families for being willing to share this experience with us. It was touching to see the effect this experience had on some of the rescuers. Although this movie would be very difficult for some to watch, especially those who had lost someone in this terrible tragedy it helped those of us who were not directly involved to better understand the feelings of many who were involved.<br/><br/>This was an excellent movie to honor those survivors,rescuers and those who passed away."
"Boyo-2","8","3","8","14 August 2006"," Meat and potatoes from Ollie
","Its a no-frills, pretty much cut-and-dried re-enactment of a really horrible day in everyone's life. Considering that it came from Oliver Stone..well, you'd never know it if it didn't say so in the end credits.<br/><br/>I saw it Friday night in a theater that can be measured in yards from the WTC site. That might be like going to Philadelphia to see ""Rocky"" or going to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean to see ""Titanic"", but it just ended up that way.<br/><br/>Two Port Authority police officers go to work that day, and end up in hell. That's pretty much it. So do their families and their co-workers, but of course its a different kind of hell.<br/><br/>Cage and Pena do most of their acting with their faces and, more specifically, their eyes, since they are pinned down for a majority of the movie. The wives get the bigger emotional scenes, since they have no idea what's going on, if they were even down there when it all happened, etc. Maggie is very good at conveying the frustration she's feeling, and she's pregnant, too. She has a good scene in a CVS pharmacy - she doesn't even know why she's there. Bello's at her best when she meets the mother of an elevator operator at the hospital near the end. Its a very powerful scene between two very good actresses. I wouldn't have mind knowing what happened to the woman's son.<br/><br/>The most emotional part of the movie was the footage of the day, most of which I hadn't scene since it all happened almost five years ago. It kind of overwhelms everything else, but reality has a tendency to do that. For the first time since smoking was banned in movie theaters, I was dying to light one up.<br/><br/>It was good to see Patti D'Arbanville, a favorite of mine, and Michael Shannon..the guy who hid under a desk in ""Pearl Harbor"" as the **** hit the fan; here his character takes the exact opposite response to a tragedy, as a military man who goes to Ground Zero and finds the guys when no one else is even looking. Shannon gives the movies best performance. Also aboard are Frank Whaley, who worked w/Stone in ""Born on the Fourth of July"", Danny Nucci from ""Titanic"", Stephen Dorff and Jesus Christ. <br/><br/>To get political for a moment, and the movie does it for about that long, too..Shannons character says something about 'this being avenged'..and he's a military man..when will that happen? When do the victims families get some answers, or better still, some closure? These questions are not answered here, but at least they are posed. 8/10."

","When I read reviews I sometimes wonder if we were seeing the same movie. I thought this film was fantastic from beginning to end - 2 hours went by so fast I couldn't believe it was over. I was on the edge of my seat and holding on to my husband's arm without even realizing it and he got choked up several times. It has been a long time since I felt like jumping out of my seat and cheering but this movie made me feel that way. Props to Oliver Stone for a very well done film - and to Nic Cage and Michael Pena as well. I liked the way the film focused on the first few hours after the event - when it seemed we were all united by shock, fear and grief. That feeling of unity was all too brief, and while the film also brought back terrible feelings of that awful day it was a story of the triumph of the human spirit as well. Highly recommended - loved it!"

","World Trade Center does an excellent job of allowing us to see and feel the harrowing details over 24 hours of a Port Authority Police First Response team and the subsequent efforts to extricate its survivors. The effects on families and co-workers are also absorbingly realized. The pacing is excellent and music and camera angles keep us focused and are never intrusive. Only backdrop events immediately pertinent to the team and the rescue efforts are shown. The acting is uniformly excellent, with Michael Pena a standout. I am not a huge Nicholas Cage fan, but he was so good that while watching the film, I continually thought of him as Sgt. John McLoughlin and not as Nicholas Cage. For me, that is a high compliment indeed. Gregory Jbarra and Maggie Gyllenhall also deliver memorable performances. The only performance that bothered me slightly was Donna Bello's affectations as Cage's wife, but she probably had one of the film's more difficult roles in trying to balance her persona's natural reserve against the cataclysmic events of the day.<br/><br/>Certainly, this is the tightest and least self-indulgent piece of film-making Oliver Stone has ever done. I defy anyone honest to find any indirect (certainly no direct) political statements being made here at all. This film is all about courage and valor in the most trying of circumstances. I recommend highly to all, most especially those who want to put the events of the day behind them as I believe they will find this movie to be a cathartic experience."
"dragongun13","9","3","8","13 August 2006"," There is no other movie like it
","that is the best way to describe this film from my point of view. it is so stand alone that there are few movies to compare it to. some people have worried that this movie was made to early (just under one month of five years after the incidents depicted) but that plays into why this movie is so unlike anything you've ever seen before. the effects are so well done that at first I thought they had to have actually destroyed a building during the shot to get it. the movie also paints a horrifying picture for those of us who got to have a normal day with an unbelievable event being shown to us on the news. I live in the middle of the U.S. and only remember listening to the news on the radio at school at certain times. other than that I had a normal day on September 11, 2001. over the years I've learned of new things about that day and how it affected people, but nothing has come closer to showing me what actually happened. Now what is truly amazing is that the story is not shown through the eye's of a made up character that is simply inserted into the situation (such as Pearl Harbor) but is told by many different actors and actresses who portray actual people who went through it. no names that I no of are made up or changed. each actor or actress portrays a real (living or dead) person. I honestly don't think Nicholas Cage or anyone else can be called the ""star"" of the movie. just about every character has as much importance as everyone else in the movie. sadly this leads to the only problem I think the movie has... under developed ""people"" (as there are no characters). you never get to learn enough about everyone as you would like so that you would care about them more, yet even that is understandable because many people portrayed in the movie are still alive and well. I don't think they want people invading their personal lives. so by all means, see this movie. it is undoubtedly an important film in the history of American cinema."
"Tyger_Typer","9","3","8","13 August 2006"," Oliver Stone ""WTC"" is respectful and very thoughtful
","We all remember that September morning, when all got up and turned on the TV only to see Tower 1 of the WTC on fire and the second plane flying into Tower 2, plus the horror of BOTH towers coming down knowing that there are still thousands of people still inside. ""WTC"" focuses on two men who were INSIDE.<br/><br/>""World Trade Center"" follows the story of Officer Sergeant, John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Port Authority cop, Will Jimeno (Michael Peña). The morning of September 11th, was no different from any other day on the job till the news of a plane crashing into the North WTC tower comes in and they are immediately dispatched to base of the tower. John and Will, plus two other cops prepare to enter the towers. The cops enter the walkway in between the 2 towers just as the tower 2 starts to collapse. They take shelter into an elevator shaft where both John and Will are pinned under 20 feet of rubble. Will they survive and see there families again or will die underneath the aftermath of one of the most infamous attacks on America in history.<br/><br/>This movie was a very emotional and gripping film. I found that Oliver Stone took the event serious and really thought on how he should bring this film to life. One thing that I highly respect is that he does NOT show either plane flying into the buildings. He uses real live news footage to show the towers collapsing. The tag line of this movie is: ""The World Saw Evil That Day. Two Men Saw Something Else"" is the best way to describe this movie in a way I could never imagine. Like when the towers collapse, you see it from the inside; you see the pain that these cops experienced. You also see the effect in has on all those who love them. There are some stupid bratty lines that come from one of the kids, as well as the use of the ""F"" word (once). But I really liked how this film also showed how America united during and after the crisis. Your skin color nor your racial background didn't mean a thing, we treated each other as equals. This movie is worth seeing, if you can stand to relive that dreadful day."

","I just came from seeing ""World Trade Center"". This was an extremely emotional film of which I thought was told very well through the eyes of these two men and their families. Having lost my beloved husband two months before 9/11, this event in history only caused me to feel for everyone who lost someone on that horrible day. Although I had no regrets in my situation, (spoiler) I understood how the woman who's son was the elevator operator of one of the Towers felt about being angry with him and that being the last thing she remembered saying to him. The two actors playing the actual men were very believable and I thought that the conversation back and forth between them while trying to stay alive was very real. Try picturing yourself in that situation(I can't). Kudos to Oliver Stone on making a very sensitive movie about something that many people have seemingly forgotten (with the exception of all the families and friends who lost loved ones on that day). It is my feeling that it is not too early for a movie like this (one of courage and bravery). If it had been a political statement, then I would not have gone to see it. I also saw United 93 and felt the same about it. Just the facts, not your own personal, political agenda. I'd highly recommend seeing this. If it makes you uncomfortable, then it has done it's job - we should all still be uncomfortable with what happened on 9/11."

There are no cheesy scenes in this movie, and it is straight forward. The plot is not overly complex (which I was afraid of). I came into this movie expecting a mediocre movie with poor performances, and came out a surprised man! WTC is not in the least bit entertaining, but will instead leave you shocked. I was expecting to see a horrible disaster flick, but WTC was nothing like that. During the first 10 minutes of the movie, you are instantly brought back to September 11, 2001. There is a great deal of stock footage that helps you relive the tragedy, and makes you feel as if it happened yesterday. The family scenes were not overdone or poorly acted, and were extremely emotional. The entire theater will either be completely quiet throughout the whole film, or will be in tears. This movie is unbelievably emotional and powerful. Do yourself a favor and go see it, because you will be glad that you did.

"gallopinggandalf","4","3","8","12 August 2006"," Nicholas Cage: Where's the NY Accent?!
","Typically, when actors are portraying a real person, they study mannerisms, get the vocal style down, find the individual ""shine"" in the person (as Philip Seymour Hoffmann did masterfully in ""Capote"")...did Nicholas Cage not work with a dialect coach? Did he meet the real John McLoughlin? He couldn't sustain a NY accent to save his life...it was extremely noticeable. When he did try to speak with an accent, it sounded like a bad New England accent....True, this is a Hollywood film, but since the premise of the movie is the real story of two men's lives, couldn't we get a bit closer to being real? Maybe they should have gotten James Gandolfini! In a film where the majority of personality is emitted via conversation (and flashbacks), perhaps authenticity on one level (vocal) is better than authenticity in another (appearance)...we don't know that John McLoughlin is tall and thin with a mustache--but we DO know he was a 21 year Port Authority vet with a NY accent...."
"marvinmatthew","9","3","8","10 August 2006"," Very Painful, But Incredible
","Despite the fact that this is an Oliver Stone movie, I was surprised to find that it didn't have any real political connotation (which wasn't a bad thing). Be very aware that this movie dose not try to explore the motivations of why 9/11 occurred, but it shows the experiences of two men and their families after the buildings collapsed.<br/><br/>With that being said, the movie finds its strength by focusing on the hope for the two men trapped in the wreckage of the World Trade Center, in lieu of focusing on the despair and hopelessness felt by all of the families who lost a loved one. I felt this was key in keeping the story from being over-dramatic, while still being dramatic on an acceptable and appropriate level.<br/><br/>The performances by Michael Pena and Nicholas Cage are quite memorable, as both of the men grippingly convey their incredible pain as they're trapped in the WTC. The audience can especially see the driving motivation of Cage's character, John McLoughlin, as the only thing that manages to keep him alive is the thought of his wife and children. I can see Cage getting a nod for best actor for his performance in World Trade Center.<br/><br/>The other aspect of this film was seeing the events of 9/11 through the family members, an aspect that I personally hadn't considered of importance before seeing the movie. I had mixed feelings here. Agreeing with the previous reviewer, Maria Bello (the wife of officer , John McLoughlin) gave a very bland performance, and most of her actions were a tad in-genuine. However, Maggie Gyllenhaal was amazing as the wife of Officer Michael Peña. The viewer felt genuinely terrified for her as she went through the emotions of fearing that her husband was dead.<br/><br/>One low point in the film, was the side-story of a Marine that looks for WTC victims. His story should have either been left out all together, or provided more attention. His role in the movie feels more like an after thought than anything else.<br/><br/>The production values were, as expected, quite high. The viewpoint from the inside of the towers collapsed was particularly incredible and notable, and realistic at the same moment. This was a technically flawless movie, and instead of using actual footage from the press coverage, most everything about the exterior of the towers was done with computer graphics.<br/><br/>This movie isn't for everyone (even though I think everyone should go see it). It's very difficult to watch during certain parts. And if you feel that you couldn't open your mind to the possibility that this movie is about more than just making another Hollywood blockbuster, then don't go and see it. But I do think that the fact that I'm writing this review is a testament to how much I think that others should see it.<br/><br/>So open up to something that may provoke some emotion out of you. Be it fear, anger, sadness. That's what good dramas are supposed to do. And if World Trade Center does this for you, then its done its job."

","I found myself transported emotionally back to 9-11-01 when the WTC was hit. I felt all the same feelings as well as the same intense fear...that our Nation was under attack. I thought that there was bit too much focus on the PAPD and not enough on all the first responders. What was happening while the men were trapped? Nothing was shown about how the Dispatch center was unable to handle the radio/telephone calls that were coming in. There was only the one death of the trapped PA policeman who died. Again, I felt the strong emotions, but did not feel as though the actual day was portrayed accurately. It was a horrific day in America, yet if one is to tell the story, then it needs to be told. Too much emphasis on the families and the wives having make-up on while the tragedy was unfolding. How difficult it would be to re-create that horrible day in just over 2 hours. It still conveyed powerful emotions and tears at times. God Bless America."
"red-dirt","8","3","8","4 August 2006"," Stone Surprises with a No-Frills Film
","Warning: This comment review discusses some details of the film that might be considered ""spoilers.""<br/><br/>Last night I had the chance to view an advance screening of World Trade Center, Oliver Stone's elegy to the brave souls who risked their lives on 9/11 to save innocents. <br/><br/>It's the first straightforward work of film-making we've seen from Stone in years. I had forgotten how much we missed this artist's power to bring us movies that leave theater audiences silent in shared catharthis. I was concerned when I first learned that Stone would be helming this project, and wondered if we'd be faced with some execrable ""JFK"" clone that used ""Loose Change"" conspiracy theories to build a paranoid case for the attacks on the Twin Towers as America's Reichstag fire.<br/><br/>Those concerns were unfounded, as it turns out, because Stone chose to honestly tell the story of two Port Authority officers trapped beneath the rubble. His auteur status is justified here: he crafted a restrained, no-frills portrait of two genuine heroes, their families' agony and a nation's shared grief.<br/><br/>Kudos, as well, to screenwriter Andrea Berloff for crafting dialogue and story pacing that keeps an audience rapt with attention for two hours, most of that time spent ping-ponging back and forth between the two talking heads of Officers John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno jammed beneath multiple floors of collapsed rubble.<br/><br/>By simply telling a true human story -- showing us, for example, the gut-level fear and trepidation of the first responders who were nonetheless courageous -- this is a film that shames the most radical elements in our society on both sides of the political spectrum. <br/><br/>It would be nice if Ann Coulter and Colorado professor Ward Churchill, and their respective minions, could be strapped into chairs to watch an endless loop of this film for weeks on end. Coulter and her ilk for flippancy toward 9/11 widows who are critics of the Bush administration. And Churchill for his vile radical chic notions that the innocents killed in the Twin Towers were ""little Eichmanns.""<br/><br/>If the film has any shortcomings, it would be that Stone chose to be almost too restrained in shielding us from seeing those planes slam into the towers, or from lingering too long on innocents plunging to their deaths. To my mind, our nation and the world need to see those things repeatedly so that we do not forget the genocidal urges of those death-loving fanatics who unleashed terror upon us. <br/><br/>There are many who would prefer to forget.<br/><br/>The film also takes an unfortunate short detour into political correctness, when, for a few moments, we see scenes of people around the world in shock and grief at what they are witnessing on live television. Indeed, much of the world did share our pain. But for whatever reason, Stone chose not to show us one particular group of people who were dancing in the streets in ululating jubilation at the sight of the towers' freefall.<br/><br/>Seeing that one more time might also have reminded some who would prefer to forget the murderous worldview of so many in one forbidding part of the world.<br/><br/>But these are only a few redacted visions from a terrible day. There's plenty of harrowing horror in this movie to remind us of the reasons for our nation's sadness and anger. <br/><br/>And the film makes up for its omissions by not shying away from other moments, such as when Stone portrays characters reaching out to God for guidance: A mother praying her rosary on the kitchen floor, a young man sitting in a chapel, Officer Jimeno seeing a vision of Jesus and finding joyous sustenance from it, Officer McLoughlin saying the Lord's Prayer over the racket of falling debris. <br/><br/>""World Trade Center"" also includes the true story of David Karnes, who felt called by God to put on his old Marine uniform and crawl through the rubble of the fallen towers, in the dark, alone, to look for buried victims. If it hadn't been for Karnes' self-imposed mission, McLoughlin and Jimeno would have perished. The film doesn't try to hide Karnes' coiled rage at what the attackers have done, nor does it shield us from his justified desire to avenge America. It merely shows us Karnes as he was.<br/><br/>We can thank Stone and his team of filmmakers for delivering on the promise of movies as art. World Trade Center is a tragic reminder of where we were before 9/11, where we are now, what we face and how far we have to go. And ultimately it's a story that gives us something we all need: a little hope."

Saying the same things over and over, repeating themes, no real action. It was all just corny dialogue. The movie just seemed to drag forever with nothing happening. The acting was decent, but the flaw is in the original script. This movie is very forgettable. It's only memorable trait is the fact that it's about 9/11. I like slow movies, but this was a flat out yawner. I had to tap my feet just to stay awake. It has about two emotional scenes, but the rest is just back and forth Hallmark card line.

"Michael-70","4","4","13","14 August 2006"," The Best Ron Howard Film That Ron Howard Never Made.
","I didn't dislike this film, but I sure didn't like it a whole lot. It has nothing to do with the ""it's too soon for 9/11 stories"" argument. It has more to do with the fact that all throughout the film, I kept thinking of the almost 2,900 other families that had bad news that day. <br/><br/>I am very happy Officers Jimeno and McLoughlin survived and I am sure they are equally happy as well. They had something very horrible happen to them that I truly would not wish on anyone. They were both extremely lucky when a massive building fell on their heads. But other than getting lucky, what did they do that was so inspiring? Having worked as a paramedic, I can tell you that most anyone else in that same situation would have done the same things they did to keep up their spirits and to live. Generally speaking, people fight for their lives; it is totally natural and ingrained in us to do so. However, just because we have a story that is exceptional in real life, it does not always become that amazing a movie story.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert is on to something in his review; would World Trade Center be anywhere near as compelling if it were about, say, two construction workers surviving for a day in the rubble after the collapse of a parking garage in Muncie, Indiana? I mean, have the trapped workers say all the same dialog and the use the same cut aways to the worried families. Would that film be anything more than a mediocre episode of Rescue 911? Although this film is well made and competently put together, it really resembles a TV movie of the week with a big budget more than anything else. <br/><br/>It is the forced sense of inspiration I felt throughout the film that bugged me. I want to be inspired because of something great and unique that happened that day. Certainly the stories in the excellent book 102 Minutes tell of numerous happenings far more hairy, scary, dangerous and inspirational than the story of these two Port Authority cops found alive in the rubble. I mean, with one exception, no professional rescuer ever reached anyone in the impact area of either building.<br/><br/>It was the regular, untrained and very scared ordinary men and women who helped their fellow citizens on the impact floors who were the real heroes in the World Trade Center. Many of them died when the building collapsed even though they had time to escape. They just kept going back for more trapped people. Once again, I'm not criticizing the trapped Port Authority men or their rescuers, but the filmmakers for taking the easy way out and making this story so blandly joyful that I actually felt nothing at the end.<br/><br/>In fact, the only moment where I felt emotion and tears welling up (and incidentally the only moment when I heard anyone else in the audience react) was when Jimeno's wife was talking to the black woman whose son was an elevator operator in the South Tower and she says that she yelled at him the last time she saw him. It was a beautiful moment played between the two actresses that was truly poignant. The film could have used more moments like that.<br/><br/>Maybe I expected something a little more provocative from Oliver Stone. He can usually be counted on to get the emotions boiling (for better or worse) but not in this film. This could have been a Ron Howard film in that it was completely safe, sane, bland and not objectionable in any way. Opie could even have given a supporting role to his brother Clint as one of the rescuers.<br/><br/>Also, who was that scary guy with Charles Manson eyes who put on his Marine uniform and went down to Ground Zero to help out? Is that a true story? He came across as a weird individual. Especially when he starts saying things about God's curtains and stuff. Well, every disaster brings out the wackos. Overall, I liked the film, but I did find it a bit dull, uninspiring and certainly when we see Jesus bringing the Evian water, I almost laughed.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that future films about September 11 will be held to a different standard and we may see something similar to the Holocaust Film Syndrome. That syndrome postulates that any film against the Holocaust must ipso facto be a good film because of its subject matter alone. To criticize a Holocaust film (for being lousy or stupid) is like agreeing with the Nazi's. This syndrome is more prevalent among the members of the general public than among critics, which is why a morally reprehensible piece of junk like Life Is Beautiful can be so inexplicably popular.<br/><br/>Remember, just because a film is about a noble subject, it does not automatically mean that the film is any good."
"andersonny","5","4","13","9 August 2006"," Ungood
","Ungood.Rent United 93 instead. This film was so sugar coated and chalk full of syrup I felt like I needed a call girl and shot or Whisky when I got out. Oliver Stone was once a great director, but as of late has made nothing of value. Platoon remains one of my all time favorites for it's gritty realism, however, Disney could have made a more realistic film in this case. The flashbacks and clichés were so numerous and disturbing, I twice began to escape the theater only to sit down so as to have an honest opinion. My opinion is that this film does a disservice to anyone affected by September 11th. Go back to war films, Mr.Stone."
"derenrocks","1","3","9","30 September 2006"," A Feel Good 9/11? I Think Not.
","World Trade Center is the second 9/11 themed movie to be released in the wake of America's worst catastrophe and the first, Paul Greengrass's United 93, set the bar pretty high. Unfortunately, Oliver Stone's World Trade Center is everything that United 93 is not. A big, polished, Hollywood picture filled with Tinseltown superstars; an emotionally manipulative monster that drags its audience down into the pits of hell and never really brings them back out again. United 93 left viewers angry and resolute; hardened into terrorism fighting steel. Stone's movie abandons its audience to quiet, miserable despair.<br/><br/>The film is based on the real life stories of two Port Authority police officers pulled from the buildings' rubble after their collapse. Sergeant John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage) and rookie officer Will Jimeno (Michael Peña) are part of a team of first responders, and bravely they rush into Tower One to do their job. They're in the lobby of the building when millions of tons of steel and concrete comes crashing down on them. McLoughlin somehow has the presence of mind to use the two or three seconds they have left to lead his men through the tornado of falling death toward the building's elevator shaft, knowing it's the center of the building and their best chance to live. The world goes black, and when McLoughlin and Jimeno wake up they're buried under 20 feet of burning rubble. Somehow they've survived, but they're pinned under wreckage. Injured, suffering, and slowly bleeding to death they lay there together hoping for a chance at life.<br/><br/>Dave Karnes, this is the man the film should have been based on, that way it would have been a lot more, pleasing.<br/><br/>Stone's take on the World Trade Center attack is at first remarkably restrained. He never shows the planes hitting the buildings, only their shadows passing over confused New Yorkers. He doesn't indulge in the spectacle of the towers' collapse, instead he shows them from the inside as they heave onto the heads of doomed rescuers who themselves have no idea what's happened. The best parts of the film are an exercise in extreme claustrophobia, watching two men trapped and struggling to keep awake in the pits of a man made hell.<br/><br/>Is this a well made film? Yes. Perhaps more importantly, with a couple of exceptions, it's a respectful one. Yet unless you like feeling lost and hopeless, there's just no good reason to watch World Trade Center.<br/><br/>To Sum up, This film is 129 min of pain, it shows two men, under tons amount of rubble for....129 minutes.... Will they survie? I'm sure you know the answer to that. Don't watch this film."
"JohnAndCraig","3","3","9","29 August 2006"," Very Disappointing
","Not what I expected at all, basically the movie was about 2 guys trapped, their wives not knowing weather they were dead or alive, then they were found under the rubble, wives notified, lived happily ever after. Wont Buy It On DVD Or See It Again. They could have involved more with the time line leading up to the events. More footage of the plane crashes, and involved the Pentagon more. Unless I am mistaken about what the film was suppose to be focused on. I hated it. My partner thought it was good. But if your going to make a movie about the WTC, then it should involved all facts and events that took place on 9/11, Not just 2 police officers and their family's. I am sure there will be more movies released about the WTC in the future. But one needs to be done in a correct manner."

","I saw this movie with a free pass, and I'm glad I didn't pay to go watch it. The entire movie is filled with overwrought emotional scenes and, while I realize that September 11, 2001 was, of course, an extremely emotional time, especially at the time - the continual over-emoting of the American media starts to grate after awhile.<br/><br/>The police and firefighters who were there, did their jobs and were very brave in the face of having a tragedy no one understood. However, simply being there did not elevate them all to heroes or saints in my book - it proved them to be good men and women who did their jobs, did them well and faced great danger. But while it was a tragedy, and I may be an insensitive jerk for bringing this up - it needs to be let go just a little. Let the people who were there, and who lost loved ones move on. It was not the single worst moment in history. I found this movie about ten years premature."

","World Trade Center is an excellent representation of the human spirit during and after the terror attacks on September 11, 2001.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on the survival of the two PAPD Officers(Cage and Pena) and the rescuers that went above and beyond that day. The officers' struggle for survival and strength of their families are wonderfully and heart-wrenchingly depicted.<br/><br/>All around, I believe that Oliver Stone pulled off the movie with dignity and respect. Politics were left out in favor of the human story that plays out on the screen, both beneath the rubble and in the homes and hearts of the families. He presents a truly amazing story of these two men, their families, and the men and women who came to the aid of their brothers and sisters in New York. The detail is truly amazing, from the morning movements of the officers to the rescuers calling each other by their first names, the movie shows the tragedy of that day without forgetting the humanity that came from it.<br/><br/>The movie, in my opinion, was wonderful. I found myself empathizing with the characters and completely focused on the story. I see this as a movie for a mature audience that is ready to see a moving story come from a tragedy."

","I really don't understand why some people seem to hate this movie so much - and it's not because they think it is too soon; these people actually hate this movie because they think it isn't any good.<br/><br/>Well, I have to disagree.<br/><br/>It tells a simple story of a handful of people who were really involved in the events of 9/11.<br/><br/>It tells it without over-sentimentality for the horrific events.<br/><br/>It tells it without many special effects, and with some real TV footage to illustrate much of the horror felt by the people on the ground.<br/><br/>The story is mainly about 2 Port Authority police officers who got caught inside the chaos when the Towers fell. It tells how their families felt, and the viewer gets to experience a little of what the horror felt like, not on a national or international level, but on a human level.<br/><br/>***SMALL SPOILER HERE*** This is a very small spoiler, which is only relevant to anyone who didn't actually see the footage in 2001 as the 2 officers were brought out of the rubble (which I did).<br/><br/>When they bring out the 2 survivors, as we know they will since it is a true story, I did feel a certain sense of relief, but at the same time I had an overwhelming feeling of sadness for the 2700 or so people who didn't have the same lucky fate.<br/><br/>I think this movie could be an Oscar contender - these stories are real, unlike United 93, which was fictionalized because no one really knows what happened on that flight, they can only hypothesize and guess and piece together fragments.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage does a great job, and Oliver Stone really surprised me with this one - it was not at all like his other politically charged movies!

It is not about the attacks in any sense other than that the planes in NY serve as the movie's premise. The movie itself is simply a (long) longing for heroic spirit: every single character is as pure and un-nuanced as the most unimaginative American mind could possibly make them. It is a hymn to the ever-yearned-for triumph of the human spirit, marriage and, apparently, to Christianity, as only Jesus, a wife, and at least two children appear to be worth living for in this world. Oliver Stone is not half, not even a tenth of the man he used to be: this is a shameful, simple-minded work""<br/><br/>The person who wrote this in no way represents this movie. Did you realize that it was written based on the ACTUAL PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCES? With your disdain for marriage, children etc. I doubt that you would have survived five minutes in their situation. <br/><br/>Personally I found the film to be quite touching and a very respectful telling of these people's personal horror.

"mattdenes","10","3","9","9 August 2006"," That something else
","""The World Saw Evil That Day. Two Men Saw Something Else."" The memorable tagline for ""WTC"". At first one would think to himself initially that this ""something else"" is the hell and suffering that surrounds the darkest hours of the lives of two Port Authority Police officers, trapped deep beneath the now fallen twin towers. And until the final thirty minutes of this film, that's what i figured to be the meaning of it as well. But it wasn't until i remembered how i felt that fateful day that brought upon what i believe to be the truest, purest deciphering of this tagline. We can all recall the aura of feeling we held in our grasps as we watched with glued eyes on the television of that repetitious cycle of horrible footage that seemed to completely envelop the world of media, and perhaps the world itself. We, as the tagline states, ""saw evil that day."" which is the general gist of our mindset towards the rest of society to this very day: Evil Evil Evil. ""An act of war"", ""America shall rise to its feet once more"", and countless other all-too-familiar house-hold sayings that were catalysts to our now overly suspicious, militant points of view to our fellow man throughout the globe. That something else that these, and other men as well witnessed was the un-dying natural basic human instinct to help, care for, and assist your fellow human being in times of peril and woe. As these men are rescued from their prisons of twisted steel and concrete, they gaze upwards astonished at what they see: No world trade center towers. As if until that very moment, they never even considered ruling this string of events as a horrible act of evil. They excercised the very most basic instinct, to stay alive. While keeping each other awake while buried to have some chance of each other not bleeding to death and dying in their sleep. Every measure is excercised by complete strangers toward one another to console eachothers pain. Even an ex-marine, police officers, and volunteers from other states who are no where near this disaster feel this ""need"" to be at ground zero, to just do something, anything to help. That ""something else"" is the now somewhat forgotten, un-alienable need to help your fellow man in any way possible. The heroes who were of assistance throughout this ordeal weren't thinking of who had done this, why, or if it would happen again. Their primary focus was just to help. And this idea sheds light on a dimmed world filled with misery and depression fueled by warfare, politics, and a media driven by violence and suspicion. As Nicholas Cage surrealistically narrates at the film's conclusion, ""Sometimes we are faced with the opportunity to help each other along for the sole reason of beleiving that it is the right thing to do."""

I can also understand those who condemn the film business for making a movie about such a horrible tragedy. However, this movie doesn't turn 9/11 into a Hollywood story. It doesn't make it more than what it really was. I'm not going to say that it was completely realistic and everything about it was true to the story, but it certainly does a great job. Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena aren't McLoughlin or Jimeno, but they did portray those emotions those two went through in a way that can give us all a little taste of what those two experienced. And what makes the movie so great is that its only job is to tell the story of these two people. It doesn't try to cover all of the stories of that day.

Although the acting was extremely limited to the confinement of the collapse of the buildings, he did a fine job of showing what had to be a gut wrenching experience for the victim. For that matter the supporting roles played by the wives and rescuers kept me intently involved the full length of the movie.I don't think I've ever seen a movie that affected me like this one. I grieved all over again about 9/11. From the first sign of the walking wounded it tugged deeply at my emotions and just never let go. At the end of the movie as they say the silence was deafening. I literally had to pull myself together before I could walk away.I just kept thinking, this is ""happy ending"" part of this terrible event.

We witness from within, the collapse of the world trade center towers, although not seen, but felt, from the very center of the collapse. You get a taste of what it was like for these men trapped within the rubble, and get an idea of the living hell they went through.<br/><br/>When viewed, its amazing how they managed to survive not only the first collapse, but the 2th towers collapse, then later building number 7. As if that wasn't enough, they had to deal with shifting debris, which threaten to come down on the few inches of room they had, fire that fell right beside them, unbearable pain, exhaustion, and even a gun going off within the rubble due to the bullets overheating. Bad enough they are trapped under god knows how many feet of rubble in pain, but they were almost shot by a freak occurrence! Truly, they were in hell.<br/><br/>Overall the film is well done, respectful, and tasteful. I, being a new yorker myself, wasn't at all offended by anything that happened in the film.

After this he then goes into the character's past and how that affects their will to survive. He keeps the story very entertaining through out. He never shows the planes hit the buildings nor does he show the buildings collapse. You see the events of 9/11 throw the eyes of the two police men and their family members. I believe that this is a well acted film probably the best that Nick Cage has ever done. It is not a violent as this years earlier 9/11 film United 93 but it still conveys the message of heroism by regular Americans on this day of days. Both this film and United 93 have to be my favorite films this year so far and i believe both can be nominated for best picture. This is a very good film probably Stone's best work yet."

","In the 21 years since I've came to Florida, I Have saw a film that is the most emotional and possibly the best oliver stone film I Have ever seen since Platoon, it's called world trade center, the story as you already know is about the September 11th attacks that has really change the world and turn into darkness, as police officers risk as they can to save others from attacks, Nicolas Cage who was so good in leaving las vegas 11 years ago deserves another Oscar nomination for the role, and the rest is perfect as well, director oliver stone who recovered from such pieces of junk over the years after the film JFK, Succeeds here in this one, this is not only the best film of this year, this is one of the best films I've have ever seen in a long time, in a summer of silly movies, explosions and many other things, this is the best summer movie so far."

","I am not very impressed with this film. I walked in expecting something as dramatic and heart wrenching like ""Titanic"" but i found myself somewhat....bored. Don't get me wrong, this film was very very very sad, but still, i was expecting a little more from Oliver Stone. The acting, i have to say, was pretty fantastic, especially with Nick Cage. When i first heard about this movie and realized Cage was in it, i thought he would screw it up, but turns out...he did a pretty damn good job. I would just like to say, the scene with ""jesus"" in it, was kind of dumb. Why do that?? To me, that was just trying to make the movie seem more religious and dramatic when all it did was just stupefy the scene! Overall, and OK movie, not the best. I give it a 5/10"

","I liked this one. Sure much of it has Nick Cage and the other guy trapped in rubble, in agony, grimacing at one another in the dark while they wait to be saved--while outside their Concerned Wives do the filmdom cliché Concerned Wives things--but-it works.<br/><br/>Cage didn't have to do anything but keep a stiff upper lip here. He was fine. His partner in crime-same thing, just-a bit ethnic. Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal were both moving in their supporting roles, experiencing several roller coaster peaks and valleys of emotion as the tragic wait unfolds.<br/><br/>Stone does a fine job here-the shadow of the plane speeding across the building-sides, the rain of debris coming down, the total ruination all around, the confusion and fear and anger of 9-11, all presented very well. The snippets of people jumping/falling from the towers or of the buildings burning or Brokaw intoning on the TV--these were all parts of that day, along w/ the constant tide of hijackings, crashes, death and confusion. It's handled rather well here.<br/><br/>I liked it and it just rang true. It's not something you'll wanna revisit over and over, but it was done intelligently and honestly, and I thought Stone did a good job reining in his JFK-ish bents here.<br/><br/>The material deserved no less.<br/><br/>*** outta ****"
"loleralacartelort7890","7","2","5","4 February 2008"," A fine movie
","When i first heard that Oliver Stone was about to make a movie about 9/11, i was horrified. I was afraid that he would turn that into one big conspiracy theory film, like he did with ""JFK"".<br/><br/>But i was surprised. Oliver Stone did not make a 9/11-movie based on conspiracy theories - Oliver Stone made a 9/11-movie based on reality.<br/><br/>Then about the movie: it can at some point in the story line be a little boring. Especially when the two cops lie in the rubbles of WTC. But the scenes before and after are some of the most intense scenes Oliver Stone have made since the 80ties. You really feel compassion with the wives and families of John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno. Nicolas Cage and Michael Peña does a remarkable job by bringing these two characters to life. The whole rescue, the people just turning up at Ground Zero is really portrayed in a very compelling way. I like this movie. I had thought it would be terribly, but i was surprised that it turned out very well.<br/><br/>Its not the best movie ever made, it is not a masterpiece. But i do think it is movie most people would enjoy."

","Some months ago, I participated in some of the message board discussions of this film without having seen more than clips from it. Some of the boards had rather pointed political opinions, and I took part in some opinionated discussions. I believe that was wrong not because of my stated views, but because this movie has nothing whatsoever to do with the politics of the new millennium's world order.<br/><br/>Whatever one's opinions of Oliver Stone's political and militaristic views, or of the Bush administration or our current involvements in Iraq and Afganistan, in all fairness this movie has nothing to do with any of that. The plot of this film could have happened in any fictional setting, or in a million other situations in world history, but it happened to take place on Sept. 11, 2001 in New York City, to two particular individuals and to their families.<br/><br/>Yes, there are certain inaccuracies in the details of the events as they unfolded, and there are certain gratuitous sops thrown to Catholicism and to the USMC, but those are not things for which this movie should be derided.<br/><br/>""World Trade Center"" is masterful film making. The characters are well developed, completely identifiable, and the situations are true to life. The technical mechanics of the movie are unassailable.If you want to attack the film on it's political slant, you are making your attack on political predisposition, because the movie does not begin to address that. It is about the human drama of the men and women who where trapped and put in life's jeopardy on that terrible day.<br/><br/>This is a wonderfully moving film. It makes the audience look at their own relationships and priorities, and challenges them to better honor the best of us who are no longer here to share our lives."
"bigmikey-3","10","2","5","6 February 2007"," Best movie I have seen in a long time
","I didn't see this movie when it first came out. I just saw it for the first time on In-Demand last night. I was expecting something quite different from what it turned out to be. I expected an overly long, confusing, politically bent movie about 911. Instead, I was moved to tears by the end of this film. Oliver should be very proud of his work here, as should be the entire cast and crew. This movie was more like the great works of the past, when movies had a point, when they could keep your attention, and when they made you think.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch, the best thing I have seen Cage do in a long time. I was getting tired of the uber violent roles he had been playing. He is an excellent actor when given a great script such as this. The same is true of all the characters in this film. Nice work.<br/><br/>The special effects are held to a minimum, because this is a story about survival and heroes. What effects there are though, are mind boggling. The recreation of the towers falling is excellent. The editing is smart and tight.<br/><br/>I have read many comments here that say the film was over emotional. That's the whole point of this movie - to portray the wide range of emotions that were created by 911. How many of us cried that day? Or became extremely angry that day? Imagine the pain the families of those that were in the world trade center that day, had to endure, not knowing whether their love ones were alive or dead. At the same time, it felt like the whole world was going mad around them. Too emotional? you have to be kidding, right? To sum it all up, this is now my favorite Oliver Stone film, and one of my favorite movies of the past decade. There are not many keepers coming out of Hollywood these days, but this is proof that they can still make an excellent film when they want to."

","I really enjoyed this movie. I liked it a lot, but it was really sad. I think that it should be seen by all. I gave it an 8 rating because the filming is very dark, and sometimes you cannot see their faces. You can't see where they are located and it seems the they just barely lit the set. You can't tell if the are bleeding or crying. Sometimes you cannot tell what is going on. That is the only thing that I didn't like about the movie, other than that, I really liked it. It is a sad movie, so if you are sad, then don't watch it because you will get even more sad. The acting in the movie was very believable. You cannot even tell that it is staged until you actually think about it. Nicholas Cage was good and so were his co-stars. The graphics were terrific, and it didn't even seem as if it was fake. It seemed very realistic. I liked this movie also because it makes you think about what actually happened on September 11. It makes you think about the heroes who went into the towers and what happened to them. It makes you think about what happened to their families and what it felt like to be in their position. I recommend it"

I found the actors and characterization of the civil servants, family and volunteers to be completely in since with the ""best of what we as people have to offer one another"". <br/><br/>A tear jerker, yeah, but not because of over acting, over dramatizing or an excessively emotional screenplay, rather due to the reality of the event/experience of real people in an unreal reality. <br/><br/>I am glad to be allowed to feel my own experience/memories with the characters/people who were there first hand. <br/><br/>I found both the trapped and their family reactions to be sincere and based within the spectrum of real human experiences. <br/><br/>Oliveer Stone and everyone involved can be proud not only because of the film but also being the first substantial expression of the experience of so many of us who were both directly and indirectly affected by this great tragedy."

","As a movie I admit it wasn't very entertaining at all. To be a good film, a movie has to have substance. Something that keeps you watching and wanting to watch it again. World Trade Center failed to do that.<br/><br/>What it does do is allow you to re-live this horrific moment in history exactly as it happened. September 11 was not in anyway entertaining, just like this film. It also gives you a different view, that at least I didn't see on September 11th. I didn't lose anyone close to me on that day, but as a human, I was very angered and embittered by what had happened. This film brought me into the hearts and minds of the people that did lose someone important to them.<br/><br/>Watching Nicholas Cage (John McLoughlin) and Michael Pena (Will Jimeno) reminiscing about their families and who they would miss made me cry. When I watch any film I always wind up relating to the characters in someway. I thought of myself in the same predicament, I thought of my baby brother and I started to cry.<br/><br/>It allowed me to understand the pain and anguish these people suffered. Something I knew but was never able to feel. That's where this film succeeds, but I don't know if that makes it a good film. It seemed like a trip through someone's heart and mind.

","I Knew i would like this film as soon as it came out. I had read some reviews and it said it wasn't great. Since seeing the film i have realised it is one of my favourite films'. The opening minutes are heart pounding as you know what is going to happen to these characters. The VFX are great and the acting is great and the dialogue is superb. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is not afraid to tear up at a movie. Nicolas Cage is great in this, however i have not seen his previous work. Michael Pena is humorous and can also convey the Emotion. The subplot with Karnes is ingenious and i think he has a few funny lines but they are not intended by the character.

"candy_flesh","10","2","5","19 December 2006"," beautifully non-exploitative
","I was truly impressed by the film. It was exceptionally tasteful and done on a small scale, it's the story of these two men and their families, and the men who saved them. Not of 9/11 or the attack on America, or terrorism, just what happened to these individuals, told on an individual scale. I understand why some critics said it was slow in places, but I think it needed to be for the sake of being true to the story. You know it felt a lot slower to the two men trapped in that rubble. It was not over-dramatized, there was no tearjerking, no emotional manipulation. It's just a straightforward story of what happened to these individuals.<br/><br/>I appreciated the fact that there was no footage of the planes hitting the towers, and no political commentary. We all know what happened on 9/11 on the large scale. It's the individual stories that should be shared, and this movie does just that for two men.<br/><br/>And the fact that, unlike the conjecture of United 93, it's entirely true, and the people who survived signed off on everything in the film made it well worth my time.<br/><br/>The only problem with it is that as I get older, I get more claustrophobic, and at first I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to keep watching, imagining the sheer panic I would feel in their shoes. I was sick to my stomach for a bit. But I took deep breaths and told myself that these men really survived this, and they deserved to have me hear their story."

Probably you would to. No one has said to me, yet, that this film was super horrible, or a piece of trash. But no one has told me it was bad either.

","Quite honestly... one of the best movies I've seen in a long while. One should watch it with an open mind and not some artsy Hollywood perspective. The one thing that separates this film from all the others is that it is true. Even the movie industry can not make up a story such as what happened on September 11th. The cinematography really puts everything into perspective and allows all to remember exactly what they were doing that day when the tragic events took place. This movie, in my opinion, was not made for awards or good reviews. This film was made to renew the passion for America that we all had in those days that followed 9/11. The exact events that took place that day may one day become a distant memory, but the feelings we all felt shall always remain the same. Five years have passed since that horrific day and many American's have forgot how they felt after watching plane after plane lay a dent onto our country, not to mention the hundreds of passengers that boarded those planes. This movie was amazing and will remind me everyday of the events that took place that frightening day."

They are almost buried alive, but wind up in the most protected place in the area. The remainder of the film keeps a very high emotional level while the stranded policemen and their families relive key life moments of their lives and struggle to remain optimistic. Some closely associated people's lives are also briefly shown, like the Marine who found them, and the Sheboygan Wisconsin FD that came to help and serve brats. Aaaah, Sheboygan brats.

Nor am I surprised by Hollywood cashing in it wouldn't be the 1st time and it will not be the last. So in my opinion what should have been on the box was I don't know maybe information on where people can donate money or offer their to time or assistance anything other than shallow quotes from people who obviously do not give a damn about the actual events that took place or its aftermath. World Trade Center the movie is a farce with no redeeming merits at all. In the end all that really shocks me is how so many people can be fooled by it and not see it for what really is. A green eyed monster with broken cardboard angel wings and a rusty beat up hanger for a halo around its ugly disfigured head. Then again this the same country that re elected a dumb ass for a president so what I've learned is what I've actually known all along. Worst of all I have kids all under the age of 15 who are clearly frustrated by the society they live in and reject the notion of authority based on what they consider is wrong and I can not argue. All I can tell them is do the right thing and think with your head and fight with your heart no matter if it is a losing battle and no matter if you feel like your the minority or not. I agree 9/11 was a wake up call in a series of wake up calls and like every other one over the course of my 31 years in due time we go right back to sleep.

If it was anymore about the actual events, I would have felt like I was viewing a documentary.<br/><br/>Although Nicolas Cage is a more well-known actor and probably received more headlines and credit as the star of the movie, I truly believe that Michael Pena stood out in his best film yet, and truly put his heart and soul into this movie.<br/><br/>At the end, the feeling you may feel is indescribable, and if you listen to what Cage has to say at the end, you can really realize what's important in life."

All the bashers of this film fail to see what an amazing recreation of that day this really is. Those who say Stone used stock footage are wrong too. The CGI stuff here looks flawless. I worked at the Trade Center back in the 90s when the first attack took place. Stone and his team did an amazing job of making it all look so real. Details in the mall at the base of the towers, the concourse, and the street scenes all looked so real. Take politics out of your head when you see this and you'll be in awe. Maybe living and working in and around NYC gives you another perspective on this film. Don't forget that this is IMDb,where Scary Movie 3 nearly scores a 6.

"Chris_Docker","8","2","5","15 November 2006"," Shame about the title . . .
","Director Oliver Stone could have been a politician: his is the happy knack of saying one thing and doing another. He thinks of himself as a liberal yet seems to endorse right wing values by design or omission. Historical accuracy has never stood in his way of good drama. That, with a semi-documentary style and archival footage, has helped him become one of the great re-programmers of popular memory.<br/><br/>It was with some ill-ease that I sat down to watch World Trade Center, knowing that the feelings of millions of Americans could be touched like a raw nerve. Producing a near-definitive account or 9/11 that would satisfy the traumatised emotions of widely differing sections of the public seems a mammoth task - producing an Oliver Stone account could end up worse than pouring petrol on a car crash.<br/><br/>To Stone's, he has taken a novel approach - that of finding goodness in stories of courage and self-sacrifice. He avoids the blame-game, the politics fraught with potholes, and the unenviable task of giving an overall view of what happened. He also nearly - if not quite - manages to avoid political bias that could lower the tone of the film one way or the other. He focuses on the experiences and emotional journey of two Port Authority Policemen who are half-buried in the rubble and, most significantly, that of their families. Script is based largely on accounts from real-life counterparts. On that day, those people had no knowledge of who committed the atrocity leading to the collapse of the World Trade Center. They had no knowledge of the almost three thousand people that had been killed (although the statistics are mentioned in the closing credits). The women didn't even know which hospital their husbands would be taken to or if they had got out alive.<br/><br/>Scenes of panic, chaos and emotional desperation are skilfully re-enacted. Nicholas Cage, who so often is woefully miscast, here shines at what he is good at - portraying desolation and near-hopelessness. Barely having begun the evacuation attempt, Cage and a volunteer policeman are caught up in the collapse and trapped. Maggie Gyllenhaal, as his colleague's wife, responds with a controlled hysteria that had me reaching for a handkerchief. Then begins the long slog to find dig the two men out.<br/><br/>With such a slim story - people buried beneath a collapsed building who have to be burrowed out - Stone does an excellent job of maintaining tension and momentum throughout two hours plus. World Trade Center is a moving story told with an air of realism. So why has the film attracted considerable negative press? The first reason is the title. This film is not about the World Trade Center. It is not even about the terrorist attack that claimed so many lives that day. It is about the personal experience of two families whose husbands are trapped, and 9/11 is merely a backdrop against which the story is set. We see courage and dedication, and the bonds of love that, in different ways, are the most important things in life. Yet the title, coming as it does to herald the first major blockbuster set on that day, raises expectations of a definitive version of events, of the collapse of the World Trade Center, of the thousands killed. Such a title was a little short of lunacy. Stone makes us expect one thing and gives us another. In ten years time, it will be a better film: just now, very few people want to 'feel good' thinking about 9/11. The film goes beyond the horrors of that fateful day to the goodness at the core of individual hearts. But for a nation still in mourning, it hardly replaces a wake.<br/><br/>The second problem with it is that if Stone almost managed to remain unpolitical the emphasis is on 'almost'. One of the symptoms of grief is anger. In the midst of the chaos, Bello rails against the desk sergeant who has first told her that her husband has walked out of the wreckage alive - only to correct it later and say he is still buried. We can see it was not the desk sergeant's fault. It is easy to connect that up later to a marine who says, ""We're gonna need some good men out there to avenge this."" Put that with the (later) knowledge that Iraq, for instance, had no part in the terrorist act. The early morning shots of New York, as Cage gets up for work, include a fleeting glimpse the Statue of Liberty, beautiful in the early morning light, and the sound of a radio presenter saying, ""the polls are now open."" More observation than bias, but such musings would have been better left out.<br/><br/>As a non-American, I began to appreciate better the outpouring of emotion that has traumatised that nation. It was suddenly easier to see how America rallied around the President (even a bad one), because at times of stress you go with the leader you've got. Watching the wives have their guts ripped out with worry brought tears streaming down my face. I didn't think (as many Americans would) of all the people that 'weren't represented' in the film - I had already accepted that the film was only about these two individuals and their families - but I did imagine how every person in America would have been able to identify in a very traumatic way with the disaster. Telling the story from the women's point of view was a masterstroke.<br/><br/>""It is about America in many ways, but ultimately it is a larger story about the human heart and survival that everyone should be able to relate to,"" says Stone. In wanting to bring something good out of the tragedy, it is tragic that he only nearly succeeded."
"jemps918","7","2","5","4 November 2006"," For a Stone movie, this was politically lightweight.
","For a Stone movie, this was politically lightweight. It focused not on the forest but on the trees; specifically, a select sampling of the lives of those directly affected by the crash. It is an unabashed display of what it is to be human: how you can choose to give up or keep on fighting.<br/><br/>I have a confession to make: I didn't care about 9/11 the way the world did when it happened five years ago; I was too busy tending to my own personal 9/11 and was pretty much numb to everything else around me. World Trade Center isn't the sort of movie I would actively like to see; I'd rather see something lighter or more entertaining, but it has been a while since my own personal hell, so I decided it was time to care and start feeling again.<br/><br/>Seeing the grief, uncertainty and helplessness painfully unraveled on screen was therapeutic; some things happen beyond your control, no matter how well intentioned you may be. Some things you think would last forever, like the formidable looking Twin Towers, could crumble in an instant after all. When you think you have a big problem, the person next to you could be experiencing something much worse, and your pain pales in comparison.<br/><br/>Michael Peña's character Will quotes from, of all movies, G.I. Jane, ""Pain is good; it means that you are alive."" At the time, his Sgt. John (Nicolas Cage), who was crushed by debris worse than he was, could barely chuckle at this, but he had to be strong for his underling; their lives depended on it.<br/><br/>The movie works because it makes you FEEL. I'm glad that I finally got to soak it all in. After all, pain is something anyone can relate to; yes, even those that cause it will feel it some time, too."
"arabesuku","10","2","5","14 October 2006"," Do NOT miss this movie.
","This movie was absolutely amazing.<br/><br/>Acting by the two leads Cage and Peña was very believable and tear-jerking. The movie itself was very cleverly made, despite some of the goofs within the film (many have noticed cars and advertisements that were introduced AFTER 9/11) - for example, even at the start police cars have dents in them (looking more realistic) and hardly any special effects were used.<br/><br/>A gripping movie that will make you cry (it certainly made me cry and jump right out of my seat in some scenes!). I was 11 when the towers were hit so I didn't really take too much notice, being young. But now I realise what an impact this had upon America. My heart went out to everyone during that film.<br/><br/>This is definitely a must-see. But not for the faint-hearted - this movie is very, VERY emotional."
"randomelginguy","5","2","5","13 October 2006"," Poor
","I have to say this is one of the poorest movies I have ever seen. If it were not for being based on a tragic event and just an average disaster movie it would have been a major failure. The entire movie was obvious and uninspired. This movie seems to me to just be plain ripping off the disaster and trying to make a quick buck out of it. All the emotion I felt throughout the movie was on the back of the real disaster and thinking back to it, none was based on emotions created from the movie. The only thing I can say about the movie that was good is that it did not politicise this and connect this with the war on terror etc. I hope to never see another movie like this again."
"Chilebops","10","2","5","8 October 2006"," World Trade Centre
","For the first ten minutes of the film, I had goosebumps. That, in itself speaks volumes about this film. I know there have been debates over whether it was too soon to make this film, but is there ever a right time to make a motion picture about such a tragic event? In this day and age of suicide bombings and terror attacks on our world, this film represents a pinnacle of hope in the darkness of terror. I found the film made in a sensitive, thoughtful way that didn't ask for the sympathy of the world and didn't over dramatise the event either. Yes, it focused mainly on the two PAPD officers and their families, but that doesn't mean to say that the audience don't know that there were thousands of people killed and injured. It was their story, their true life telling of the events that happened to them that day. World Trade Centre is a beautiful film that will surely inspire every person who sees it. Anyone who has visited Manhattan, before or since the tragic events, will find something in the film that is personal to them, whether it be a landmark they have visited or a photo they have taken there. Also, the fact that Nicholas Cage gave the money he earnt to charity shows that this film was not made for money, but to show that, even in it's darkest hour, Americans failed to give up. It gives a whole new meaning to the national anthem and a deep poignancy to the line The land of the free and the home of the brave."

","The film was well done, stirred up emotions and the effects were excellent. I was impressed that the film focused on the personal effects and heroism from the WTC disaster. However one big propaganda lie was told that was carefully crafted to fool the average American who believes almost anything dished out to him or her. It was dangerous, stupid and deceitful for the producers to infer that Iraq was involved in the bombings. Iraq had nothing to do with the bombings. It was as if the lies were written by George Dubya himself. I walked out of the film as soon as realised what the script writers had done. Unfortunately, it ruined what would have been a decent and moving film."

","You'd expect an Oliver Stone film about the attacks on the Twin Towers to be a paranoid conspiracy film, but the director of JFK has confounded expectations by coming up with a drama about two cops trapped under the rubble of the World Trade Center after the towers collapsed.<br/><br/>The movie focuses so narrowly on the fate of the officers (Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena) and their waiting wives (Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal) that we miss the bigger picture, and it might as well be a tale of miners stranded underground.<br/><br/>Stone's film celebrates heroism; but by restraining his usual flamboyance in favour of following the Hollywood formbook he's succeeded in making a true story feel fictional."

"valadas","7","2","5","27 September 2006"," The massacre of the innocents
","Oliver Stone carefully avoided to make of this movie a political pamphlet. It's only a sample story of how a mad and criminal act (supposedly committed in the name of a good cause) may affect the lives of a lot of innocent people and their families in a terrible tragic and dramatic way. But it's also a story of solidarity and of how people can put themselves at the service of others in moments of danger even at the risk of their own lives. The attack to the WTC that was supposed to hit USA as a global political and military target ended by killing, maiming and wounding thousands of peaceful citizens of several countries and also American civilians of several origins (Afro, Spanish, Portuguese, Scottish and others). That's the main message the movie conveys to us. Besides that we also can see how sometimes the psychological strain felt by the families of the victims can make family ties to become stronger and even enhance love between man and wife. The way the story is told and shown has no flaws or unlikelihood scenes and the visual narration is sufficiently pathetic. The acting or the performers is also good enough."
"Dogwalker","9","2","5","17 September 2006"," Well done
","Obviously this is not a movie that one ""enjoys"". Like ""The Passion of the Christ"" it is a re-enactment of an event we were not there to witness. WTC puts the audience through the emotional wringer convincingly. By the end of the film I was glad to have watched it, not because I derive entertainment from the suffering of others but because it convinced me of the heroic aspect of the human condition. This film was made with the utmost respect for the real-life heroes involved with that tragedy. <br/><br/>A must see movie that ranks alongside ""The Passion"", ""Schindler's List"", and ""Saving Private Ryan"" as films that remind us of courage and hope in the face of evil."

","I don't cry at movies. Never have, and I doubt I ever will. This movie was no different, but you can bet I was on the verge of getting the sniffles. This film doesn't have an omniscient view of the tragedy we all know too well, but rather focuses on individual views, making it seem much more realistic and as if you're actually there. For example, the trapped officers don't even know the buildings have collapsed because, hello, they're been pinned by rubble for hours on end, terrified. The pain on the screen becomes your pain, both when Nicholas Cage is being crushed by several tons of cement but also when his wife bursts into tears while she waits in a nearby hospital. Every American should see this film."

It told about the human spirit.<br/><br/>As a person with a few law enforcement in my family and friends, it was very difficult to watch but good reminder that honoring everyday as important is essential because you never know what that day holds.<br/><br/>Good movie...emotionally taxing but good.<br/><br/>I would recommend that anyone who plans to watch this movie, that they make sure to have a few tissues handy, as the tears will probably flow through out various parts of the movie."

","I was not sure what to expect from a movie that was born from one of the biggest tragedies in American history; however, I was very pleasantly surprise to find that this movie was exceptionally tasteful and very moving. I thought Oliver Stone did an exquisite job of taking the human element of caring for one another and banding together as Americans in times of perilous crisis and making that the main focus of this movie. This was not what I had anticipated. After being 10 minutes into the film, I totally forgot that Nicolas Cage was Nicolas Cage playing a part and not one of PAPD's finest. At the end, I felt compelled to want to meet these two very brave men that nearly died. I found it very interesting how Oliver Stone was able to ""thumb his nose"" at the parties responsible for the devastation by not giving them one once of real credit or validation. I also came out of the movie with a renewed since of respect for him on how he weaved actual pieces of the news related to the attacks into the movie to help tell the story. I cannot find one bad thing to say about this movie and I feel that Oliver Stone definitely did that awful day justice in the making of the movie."

","I didn't take the time to see this movie because it was the right thing to do. Or because it was another 9/11 movie. Or because I'm patriotic. I took the time to see this movie simply because it was directed by Oliver Stone. Usually his movies are like two hour montages, something short of a music video; (Natural Born Killers, The Doors, Any Given Sunday....). I was curious to see how he intended on doing that with a movie of this nature. I was surprised but not disappointed when I saw that none of the Stone trademarks were in this movie, sort of how I felt when I saw Spike Lee's ""Inside Man"" earlier in the year. The filming the plot and the acting was great and on point. Compare this to ""United 93"" or ""Farrenheit 9/11"" this is nothing you're going to expect. I loved the movie so much, that I saw it two days later....Hats off. Oliver Stone is the man"
"EUyeshima","7","2","5","28 August 2006"," Stone Offers Both a Moving Personal Account and a Safe Perspective of 9/11
","Compared to the visceral power of the documentary-like ""United 93"", maverick filmmaker Oliver Stone atypically goes a more traditional route in focusing his 2006 film on the two police officers who were able to survive the collapse of the World Trade Center at Ground Zero. Instead of going for an emotional gut-punch on a broad canvas, the controversial filmmaker plays it safe by depoliticizing the film from possible conspiracy theories and emphasizing far more on the personal impact. The result still works powerfully, but the movie sometimes feels myopic in making the rest of the day's tragedies a mere backdrop for the central story. Moreover, screenwriter Andrea Berloff, working from the remembrances of the real people, brings a certain TV-movie-level predictability to the narrow focus of the plot despite the devastating power of key scenes.<br/><br/>The movie takes advantage of the audience's knowing anticipation of the events at the beginning, but Stone blessedly doesn't exploit the tragedies more than necessary. While he incorporates global reaction to the events, the story quickly hones in on John McLoughlin, who leads a volunteer brigade of four Port Authority officers to the site. In the midst of their evacuation efforts, they find themselves buried in the rubble with McLoughlin and Will Jimeno the only two who survive under several feet of debris. The film then alternates between the dark desperation of the two immobilized men and the agonizing waiting game experienced by their families. There is no getting around the harrowing personal drama unfolding, and Stone is careful not to step out of bounds when it comes to the heroism displayed that day by all the real-life characters shown.<br/><br/>The acting is quite sturdy and well-grounded. After a long drought since ""Adaptation"", Nicolas Cage plays the taciturn McLoughlin economically, while Michael Peña, who provided the most riveting moments in the otherwise manipulative ""Crash"" last year, brings an honest combination of ebullience and poignancy to Jimeno. Even though the wives are decidedly secondary roles here, Maria Bello continues to gain stature in her gritty portrayal of McLoughlin's wife Donna, while Maggie Gyllenhaal plays closer to the vest as Jimeno's pregnant wife Allison. As the rescuers, Michael Shannon plays former Marine Dave Karnes with steely, singular resolve, and Stephen Dorff and Frank Whaley make vivid impressions as fireman Scott Strauss and reactivated paramedic Chuck Serieka, respectively. Seamus McGarvey contributed the evocative cinematography, and Jan Roelfs' production design is piercingly accurate to our collective memories of how Ground Zero looked on that fateful day. It's a fine, moving drama in many ways but in certain respects, too safe in Stone's hands."

I could NOT agree with your review more. You pretty much took the words, right out of my mouth.<br/><br/>I've always liked Oliver Stone films. However, I don't know what he was thinking when he made this mess. What is Mr. Stone afraid of? Is he afraid of offending terrorists? Does he want to help people FORGET the worst tragedy on U.S. soil, since Pearl Harbor??? That's exactly what he's done. Why didn't he show the world what REALLY happened on that horrible day.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this film will only help people forget the events even more.

Just terrible.<br/><br/>You know what's coming: A film titled ""World Trade Center"" should be a sensitive, impartial and courageous portrayal of the horrid events of that day. What did we get? A formulaic disaster/rescue script with Hallmark dialog, cheesy acting and (yawn) total predictability. While I wouldn't really expect such maudlin drivel from Stone, I'm not really surprised. There is a big swatch of population all set to open their wallets for such opportunistic sentimentality. Mr. Stone couldn't resist. Maybe he even had orders.<br/><br/>So, a missed opportunity. Somebody else is going to have to make the *real* WTC film, but they'll have to call it some other name, else it will get confused with this uninspiring piece of dung. Personally, I think they should leave it alone; I can't think of who we have that might make said film without resorting to said maudlin plot devices. Might be best to just leave it be.

The actual events ... that day ... and the aftermath of how it has changed our world and my life have been suppressed and denied in my heart for a long time.<br/><br/>This is an excellent movie. It took me back to the streets of NYC, to that day, and let me see what I was unable to wrap my brain around as I watched those beautiful towers fall 5 years ago and knew in my heart the devastation and loss of lives. Some of the losses are very personal for some of us. The bigger scale losses touch us all.<br/><br/>It was wonderful to hear the name of the PAPD officer whose death that day has affected my family deeply. He was lost beneath the fallen tower in what has seemed impossible to comprehend. Now, on the big screen, he's a hero and we're there with him in his loneliest moment. He didn't have to be there. He was not active duty that day. When he heard the news he knew what he needed to do. Watching this movie helped me appreciate how his sacrifice was his gift. He followed a calling, and served a purpose.<br/><br/>There are so many stories behind this event. Oliver Stone's story is the one closest to home. The people immediately present on 9/11/2001 at the site of WTC and their families, co-workers, communities. It's the human element of life at ground zero that's honored here.

This is not only its strength but its supreme victory, along with its honesty. Just as the horrifying TITANIC - with whom WTC's sobering yet incredible special effects compares favorably - found its strength in its love story, so does WTC in its love stories. Except that WTC's people are actually real, and from what I've read, their stories are not only honest but are told exactly the way the events really unfolded. Nicolas Cage was a revelation, as was this incarnation of Oliver Stone, who's reached a David Lean-level of maturity. My prediction: (easily) the Best Picture of 2006."

Some of the scenes would seem corny, but then it hits you that this shi_t really went down- and you remember how people we know act in real life situations- and you move on. It would seem a slam-dunk that any fairly well-conceived, big-budget movie to come out on this subject would garner several Academy Award nominations- just for making it to the big screen; but this movie is handled exquisitely in so many ways that it overcomes any lines of thought in that direction. This is the film of the year so far, and right up there with the best of them.

A few questions the film never answered. Why did the gun fire by itself? Why was there a flame ball underground? Cage's character was right that the elevator shaft is the strongest part of the building to hide under. 8 out of 10. I wonder if there will be any spin off movies about the wars we presently face.

But this movie was merely meant to take advantage of peoples' emotions about a tragic event. It offered no insight and nothing but a lot of weeping and groaning. It was like watching CNN (for over 2 hours) asking someone whose baby has just been run over by a Mack truck, ""Do you think we should ban big trucks from the road?"" Americans have to stop wallowing in self pity and move on. Yes, it was tragic.

","I'm not going to go off in a rant about how it is insensitive to make a World Trade Center movie a mere 5 years after the atrocity but I will say that it's largely pointless. The images and stories have been covered on TV so many times from so many angles and people that there's really nothing left to learn. When Oliver Stone announced this movie I assume that many of his fans predicted the conspiracy theories and finger pointing he is famous for as well as the highly stylistic and surrealist editing.<br/><br/>Well...NONE of that is present here. All we get is pedestrian direction that might as well for a TV movie and a very lame, mawkish soap opera plot that is really dragged-out far too damn long.<br/><br/>Nic Cage and Michael Peña play real life 'heroes' who were buried under the WTC rubble for a few days and managed to stay alive by shouting at each other. Each of them have flashbacks to their sweethearts sitting at home pouting and whimpering as their family pat them on the back saying ""It's okay"". Wow, you could cut that tension with a chainsaw, it's electric (the tension, not the chainsaw)! The only impressive thing that WTC really boasts is a brilliant sound design, asides from that there's not much reason to watch the film. Nicolas Cage is hardly given much to do apart from lie on his back, Maggie Gyllenhaal as 'the wife' is given almost nothing to do apart from the quivering lip thing and Maria Bello (didn't she used to have BROWN eyes?) is alarmingly frozen-faced as 'the other wife'. Stone's usually flamboyant and trip-like cinematography has been replaced with framing so bland you'd be forgiven for thinking you're looking at a series of still photographs.<br/><br/>I know anyone wishing to defend this film can easily say that sort of film-making technique is not suitable for a story like this. If so, then why the hell would Oliver Stone, of all people choose to make it? A completely pointless film that pussyfoots around tougher issues and makes a triumph out of a loss. And don't give me any of that 'triumph of the human spirit' crap either.

He was a completely different director in this movie. He refrained from the conspiracies and dizzying film work and told a very emotional, heroic story of that horrible day. If you didn't know Stone directed this movie upon viewing you would never know. All of the actors are at their best, as in most Stone movies. Even Nic Cage shows more acting chops than usual. Stone may be a gonzo director but he can get the best acting out of almost anyone. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that can watch a movie about this day and not get too upset over personal reasons. Even those people, people that may have lost a loved one, might be riveted by this film. It is very well done all around and shows you the heroics of ordinary men enduring extraordinary circumstances.

"eckhouse24","10","2","6","10 October 2006"," A tale of good, and not about evil
","World Trade Center-**** out of ****<br/><br/>Some believe it is too early for a film about the events that occurred on September 11, 2001, saying that Hollywood is trying to profit from the tragedy of that day. I heard it before when United 93 appeared in theatres back in early spring. United 93 was released, and was a mild success, the latest talk was about World Trade Center, a film directed by Oliver Stone, a director who is known for his interest in political history. Many feared that Stone may try to use this story as a way to show people what he saw on the day of September 11, 2001. Instead, Stone shows us the good in humanity through the eyes of two new York Port Authority Policeman who became trapped in the rubble and pulled out to safety.It is an emotional story, but a story that should be told, because we always hear about the evil that happened on that day, but so few times do we hear all the good that happened, and this is one of those stories.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage plays John McLoughlin, who like many people who work in New York City, wake up at 3 in the morning for a long commute, either from Long Island, New Jersey, or upstate New York. Slowly, we meet his family though they are all asleep, we can see that he has a wife and 4 children. Next, we meet Will Jimeno, played by Michael Pena (Crash.) Jimeno is a rookie for the Port Authority. As the two begin their day, so do the events of 9/11. Soon, they and many other go off to the World Trade Center to help with the evacuations, and as they and a few others are inside, the towers come down.<br/><br/>The rest of the film we see these two struggle to stay alive as their families struggle to keep hope that they are alive. Maggie Gyllenhaal gives an extraordinary performance as Allison jimeno, Williams wife.<br/><br/>We are introduced to people who will play a key role in their rescue. Michael Shannon plays David Karnes (Staff Sgt. Karnes of the U.S. Marines) a man who after the news, leaves his job, suits up in his uniform and makes his way down to Ground Zero.<br/><br/>This film works for the opposite reasons why United 93 worked. With United 93, there were a lot of unknown actors who looked more like regular people. It helped the audience to relate to the victims on that flight a bit easier because we were able to see these people as anyone or better yet, someone like us. A grandma, a businessman, a wife, a child, a husband, a cousin, a teacher, etc-these descriptions are everyone one of us. In World Trade Center, the better actors were better trained not to overact and over dramatize the events. Instead, they are natural with their delivery and with that, put on a better performance.<br/><br/>As mentioned earlier, this is not a film about politics. In fact, there is no real mention of terrorism except for the news on the television sets. In fact, we never even actually see the planes crash into the World Trade Center. I like this aspect because many of us did not even see these planes crash until after they hit when the media got a hold of personal camcorders. Also, many of the rescuers who risked their lives did not even see the planes hit.<br/><br/>This film is about the good in humanity. For all the evil that occurred, there was a lot more good that went on. And what makes it better is that everything that happens in the film is all based on the accounts of the McLoughlin family and the Jimeno family and the others who participated in the rescue of the two gentleman. There were 20 people who were rescued from the rubble of the Trade Center, Jimeno was 18, and McLoughlin was 19. It makes it a much better watch to know that this story is not made up like the story in Pearl Harbor or the love story of Titanic. These are real people and they were rescued, and many helped in their rescue. And how do we know? Because many of us watched on one of the various news channels that brought us these rescues. Some may say that I am biased towards this film because I lived in New York at the time so I have to like it, but I lived on Long Island, miles away from Ground Zero. I watched as most Americans did, through the eyes of the men holding the news cameras.<br/><br/>This is a film that all should watch at least once. Not because you should feel like you have to because it is your patriotic duty, but because it is a real true feel good story with a happy ending that isn't made up. It does well in showing that no matter how evil some can be, there are a lot more good people out there, and most of them are just like you and me."
"raingraham","8","2","6","11 September 2006"," Not your typical OS film...
","I am not an Oliver Stone fan. With the exception of Platoon, I feel most of his films seem to be on steroids. World Trade Center is an exception and I would strongly recommend the movie. First, it is very apolitical, no finger pointing blame or contrived controversy. Also, it lacks the typical Oliver Stone hype and glitz, though I suspect some distortions of truth exist that are found in nearly every historical film. A small disappointment to me was there was not more footage inside the WTC before the towers collapsed. The graphic scenes of blood and gore you might imagine are minimal, that's not what this film is about. This film is about family and honor and the struggle to preserve life."
"fredyt3","7","2","6","10 September 2006"," Good but stalled at spots
","first of all - did Sgt. Thomas, the marine who was black ever get any credits or acknowledgment in the credits??? Not that it was a documentary, but whoever is doing the research could have done a better job. It may seem so petty or insignificant but it's a huge blunder to portray everyone else as accurately as possible, yet assume the marine was white. Anyway, a decent movie which could have been cut down as it stalled several times, as I guess the producers were trying to evoke some type of emotion. Nevertheless, I would recommend this film merely to showcase a different perspective of what happened during this time. The casting was pretty good and provided a more realistic perspective of what the families, as well as the men went through."
"jmj021963","3","2","6","28 August 2006"," Boring, Long and wants to be ""Ladder 49""
","The first thing to say about this movie is that it is long and boring. The theater was pretty much filled when I saw it yesterday and after the first 20 minutes everyone in the theater seemed to be starting sidebars. This movie is slow slow slow! Everyone was clearly bored and just waiting for this train wreck of a movie to end. Next off, the effects are nothing to brag about. Simple modeling. I have an idea, if you want to know what happened on September 11, 2001, download the newscasts and videos and watch them. You can see the real police and firefighters in truly heroic positions. There is really no defining the characters, they are simply two dimensional images of firefighters and police officers. This director couldn't even take the time to show something interesting in their lives, they clearly lived completely boring lives. The reason we know this is because this film wants so badly to be ""Ladder 49"" that the playoff is EXACTLY the same. First Responders (in this case a couple of port authority cops) trapped under the rubble, waiting for rescue with flashbacks of their apparently excessively boring lives. The children of these cops are also really boring, or rather the actors portraying them are. The kids cant act, but then again neither can the adult actors. Fact of the matter is that Nicolas Cage is no Tom Hanks. Cage needs dialogue and with the limited dialogue in this feature simply comes across as a mannequin. In fact they could have put one of those animatronic mannequins in a fire suit and probably had a better result. (Now that I think about it, they might HAVE done it). Cage and all the other actors are emotionless in what is supposed to be an very emotional movie. They are not. The movie is not. This movie is a big budget remake of Ladder 49, only without the acting, emotion, plot, story, effects, excitement, and anything else that makes a decent movie. I recommend watching the videos of the newscasts of what really happened, not this disaster of a movie. In lieu of this thing and along the same lines, for something better, rent ""Ladder 49""."
"kbradmon","4","2","6","23 August 2006"," this movie should really be called ""Stuck In A Hole""
","What a HUGE disappointment. I was REALLY looking forward to a true-to-life movie about the WTC attacks, to remind everyone of the horrendous assault on our country in 2001 by these evil terrorists. I know it sounds odd to say this, but I really think people need to be reminded why we are fighting a war on terror.<br/><br/>I expected a movie called ""World Trade Center"" to cover the heroic efforts of the emergency response personnel. I expected some scenes with ordinary citizens acting selfless or even heroic. I expected scenes with ordinary citizens acting selfishly, only concerned with saving themselves.<br/><br/>What I did NOT expect was 2 hours of 2 guys stuck in a hole, chatting about nothing in particular, because they were afraid if they fell asleep they would die.<br/><br/>Yeah there were some moving scenes with the families worried about these guys -- that was worth 20 minutes. Yeah watching the guys stuck in the hole and in terrible pain was sobering. That was worth another 15 minutes. So why didn't the movie contain scenes of people coming down the stairs before the towers fell? Why not show more rescues of people trapped in the rubble? I can only guess it's because this was the cheapest way to make the movie -- fewer actors, very little special effects, and a cheap set. <br/><br/>I'm thoroughly sick of paying $9 to see a movie on the big-screen (not to mention outrageous prices for snacks) when I can rent the same movie later for $3 at the video store."
"moviegeek310","10","2","6","22 August 2006"," 9/11 Film is Right On!
","""Wow!"" Was all I was thinking as I left the theater after viewing ""World Trade Center"". Many people were thinking it is still too early after the actual events of 9/11 to make a film about it. But I think it is something that needs to be remembered, and to remind many of us why we are at war in the first place. Director Oliver Stone-notorious for many anti-war films-shocked me with his portrayal of the events, not only did he deal with it with sensitivity, but he also didn't take any ""Hollywood liberties"" with the film. Neither did he lean to either political side, if anything he leaned more to a conservative view. What? Oliver Stone?! You left the theater with a feeling of hope and a renewed sense of why we are at war. I applaud you Mr. Stone.<br/><br/>""World Trade Center"" centers on real life police officer John McLoughlin and his fellow officers as they enter the buildings to get everyone out after they were hit. But they are caught in the rubble as the buildings collapse, and must await rescue they don't think will come. But an ex-marine feels drawn there by God, and starts a rescue search even when told he couldn't. He later enlists back into the marines as he says, ""Someone needs to avenge this."" He couldn't be more right.<br/><br/>The acting is extremely realistic especially by Nicolas Cage as the main character. And for those worried that this film will reopen old wounds, don't fret. Like I said, Mr. Stone treats every aspect of this movie with great respect and sensitivity. He even got consent from every one of the police officers and their families. The film ends with a voice-over that tells the audience that even though the events were horrible, it brought out the best in everyone as they put their lives on the line to rescue others. And that's what needs to be seen. ""World Trade Center"" is rated PG-13 for intense and emotional content, some disturbing images and language.<br/><br/>Brian Ledtke, 16, lives in Thomas Township."

Several people that I know who haven't seen the film express hesitancy in seeing it for concerns about reliving the horrors of that day, especially those that were in Manhattan at the time. I am quick to point out to them that this film, on the contrary, is a story of courage and determination. It is inspiring in that many of us are not personally acquainted with the story of these two Port Authority officers and the heroic Marine who was instrumental in rescuing them. I was riveted by this film.<br/><br/>The film was clearly produced with keen attention to sensitivity and reality. I was impressed by the film being shown without previews of other films and without credits in the beginning. Furthermore, it was very respectful of the filmmakers to first list the names of the Port Authority officers who perished on that day, at the end of the film, before the usual credits.<br/><br/>I feel fortunate to have seen this excellent film."

","This film is hard to watch. Going in I thought I would be able to sit through this without becoming squeamish, I was wrong. When Cage and his partner get caught in the falling debris and are left to sit there for the rest of the film's two hour run it is agonizing to watch. You can feel the pain that the characters are trying to convey they feel. Each time Nick Cage gave a yell I sat up from my slouched position in the theater chair. This proves to me for the first time that Nick Cage is a great actor. His only other good movies to me are 1983's Valley Girl, 1996's The Rock, and 2005's The Weather Man. All of those are terrific. Everything else he has done I find bland and non entertaining. Oliver Stone did a good job on this. Stop hating haters this a good movie even if he got some things wrong. Watch this."

","This movie was hard for me to go see. 9/11 was an awful, heartbreaking day to me not just as an American, but as someone who lost family in the World Trade Center. I debated with the question 'is it too soon?' and decided that I had to go anyway. The emotion that this film brings out is unlike any other I've ever seen, with the exception of Schindler's List, which I didn't see in theaters. The events of the day are tastefully re-created, and even though you know that the shadows and sounds are planes, you aren't forced to watch the impacts again. The story of the policeman and their families is gut-wrenching, and brings tears to the eyes, and the sheer joy of watching them rescued in indescribable. A lot of evil took place that day, but this movie reminds us that an awful lot of good did, too. Mankind witnessed both on 9/11 and everyone should go see this movie....because we should never forget what happened to us on that fateful day."
"merrywood","9","2","6","17 August 2006"," The Power of the Human Spirit
","The lofty title of this film is somewhat erroneous because it is really the true story about two Port Authority cops trapped in the rubble of the collapsed WTC towers. It follows them from amidst their lower middle class families living in New York City boroughs from early morning of 9/11 and into the insane terror to come.<br/><br/>This is probably the most well-balanced and objective film I have seen from Oliver Stone. It's thoroughly professional, well written and directed. The reconstruction of the atrocious terror and its severe impact is meticulous. Emotionally moving, it's flawed perhaps only by the excessive, anguished histrionics of the two officers' families which while easily understood does not play well in dramatic presentation. There is an old axiom, here: ""If the character cries the audience does not."" <br/><br/>However, as a vehicle for the power of the human spirit the film is otherwise worthy and competent. The real story here and the most heartfelt is that of the former real life ex-marine, Dave Barnes who while not even from New York City leaves his work and his home town, puts on his old uniform, wheedles his way into the mountain of violent WTC aftermath and eventually locates the two cops buried deeply in the mounds of twisted steel and concrete. His single-minded act of extraordinary courage and commitment to his country and fellow man is all too rare today in this holistic idea of a nation that gives so much to its citizens many of whom take it all for granted. The film is highly recommended."

However, bravery, duty,and most of all, humanity, is what we already knew and understood about 9/11, and quite bluntly...that's all this movie is, and not one tiny dimension more. It is about 4 people essentially; the 2 Port Authority cops who are trapped in the rubble of the disaster, keeping each other alive,and their wives who must deal with the agonizing uncertainty of what is happening, and what is going to happen to their families. All other characters are awarded non-distinct roles. Stephen Dorff; I was surprised to find out later that you were there. That is what is hugely missing here; a big picture look at at how this monumentally shocking and mind-numbing piece of history affected us all. It's as if this situation struck these four people directly, and the other characters felt sorry for them. Speculation was that Oliver (Stone)was going to make a bombastic statement here, but quite drastically opposite is the conspicuous void that leaves us wondering about how this offensive affected us beyond just poor John and Willy. OK, so maybe this was a meant to be a personal micro-look at how this horrific event shook a few individuals and their families, such that we can identify with, and relive the experience, as if we were personally and directly involved as they were. Bravo...mission accomplished here. But, a great movie is supposed to take our imaginations further and fill in gaps that we never imagined. This story should have plenty of that. Imagine the horror of being trapped in the stairwell of a doomed building...and having your last words with your loved ones on cell phone.... before the world caves in on your head.

I'm glad the two got out alive, but what a slap in the face to all of those whose loved ones didn't make it. Shouldn't their story have been told? Also the movie was choppy, and just plain awkward in some parts, especially the scene with the two women at the coffee machine, there was no chemistry, and all of sudden they break down crying, I wanted to feel something, but couldn't.

I have seen Maria Bello in other films, like ""The Cooler"" and still photos and thought she was always a stunning brown-eyed blonde. I am curious why Oliver Stone gave her those fake looking blue contacts for this film. In the initial scene with another cop's wife I didn't even recognize it was Maria. Her eyes appeared almost cat-like or reptilian. What purpose did this serve? I would have liked to know a little more about the US Marine who appeared to initiate the search for survivors.

","A somewhat ""worthy"" version of the September 11th attacks, told from the point of view of a group of policemen present in the foyer when the tower collapses on top of them. I didn't much like this film as much as I thought I would; in fact, it sent me to sleep, which really is a cardinal sin when the subject matter's as important as it is here. Oliver Stone was a great director back in the '80s, but his much-needed style is in short supply here, so that any old director could have done the job.<br/><br/>One problem I had was with the casting of Nicolas Cage, who I just didn't think was sympathetic enough to hold the viewer's attention. Cage isn't my favourite actor and he does nothing to dispel that image here, while other, better characters like the one Jay Hernandez plays fall by the wayside and way too much time is taken up with unnecessary sub-plots about the 'families back home' – please! I could have done without this mawkish stuff that drags the storyline down.<br/><br/>Another problem is that the film is very long winded. It starts off great, but halfway through the story's pretty much over and there's still another hour to go – it's as this point I fell asleep. It may have drastically improved after I did, but somehow I doubt it. For my money, the Paul Greengrass thriller UNITED 93 is everything that WORLD TRADE CENTER isn't: pacy, exciting, thrilling, urgent, and utterly, utterly heartbreaking and horrifying in equal measure."

Watching it today, however, it is clear that it is not a well made movie, the story tries too hard, too often to be uplifting and the actors don't try hard enough, it definitely would have been better if you had stronger actors than Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena, who deliver all their lines very poorly and show little emotion. 9/11 was a tragic event, one that will never be forgotten and will always be remembered as an very emotional event for both America and the rest of the world, people no longer felt safe and secure in their own towns, and the many deaths that happened that day are simply terrible, it's upsetting just to think about, which is why I find it very disrespectful that a film about it was even made so soon after the events. World Trade Center is a very poor film that I wouldn't recommend to anybody. <br/><br/>Two policemen crushed by rubble from the falling towers desperately cling to life and pray for rescue. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Maggie Gyllenhaal"

","Stone is known for political button pushing, but in WORLD TRADE CENTER, starring Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena as two NY port authority policemen who are literally buried alive beneath the wreckage of the WTC collapses, the director tells the story without any digressions. It's simply the true life story of John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno, as well as the story of a horrible day that assaulted America and then brought us together.<br/><br/>When the Twin Towers are hit by the hijacked planes, the brave men and women of the FDNY and the NYPD, along with the PA police, risk their lives to try to save thousands of innocent lives. When Trade Center 2 (the south tower) collapses, McLoughlin, Jimeno, and a fellow PA named Pezzulo (Jay Hernandez) survive, but soon they are buried by tons more debris when Tower One falls. While they struggle to stay conscious through the excruciating pain of their injuries, their loved ones back home anxiously await word from them.<br/><br/>Jimeno was buried about 15 hours, McLoughlin about 22. Most of the movie is centered on them as they talk to each other and keep each other alive. It is quite dark on screen for a lot of the film and that kind of affects how much I enjoyed it, even though it's probably realistically presented. They were practically entombed. <br/><br/>Luckily, you get to know the wives of these 2 men: Allison Jimeno (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is pregnant with their second child. Donna McLoughlin (Maria Bello) is wondering if she'll ever get a chance to try to be close to her husband the way they once were.<br/><br/>The film also showcases Michael Shannon as a dedicated Marine who decides to go to New York and help in the rescue operation that saved the lives of the 2 PA policemen.<br/><br/>I like this film because it has no political subtext.

","I watched ""World Trade Centre"",if not against my will then certainly against my better judgement and I'm afraid my better judgement was justified. Regardless of the argument that so cataclysmic an event should not have been made into a feature film within such a short time of its occurrence, if one was to be made it would necessarily have to be of very high quality to do its subject some semblance of justice,and,regrettably, ""World Trade Centre"" is extremely pedestrian. I accept that it is respectful - indeed it could hardly have been otherwise even with arch de-constructor Oliver Stone at the helm - but nowhere does it have a spark,a flicker or any sign that it was not made by a man on auto - pilot dealing with stock Hollywood characters (brave loyal wives,grim-faced comrades,stoic Wasps,emotional Hispanics...).

"ghassanzakarya","3","1","2","26 January 2007"," I don't know why Stone did it!
","This is my first comment here, but I think it's great to read and be read.<br/><br/>I'm a TV writer and an independent filmmaker (writer, director, editor and sometimes cinematographer), and I think of Mr. Stone as my mentor although I haven't met him of course. There is none of his movies that I don't adore, and I wait his movies like those two heroic cops were waiting to be rescued in the movie. The 9/11 events were a real devastating disaster. I'm not sorry or sad about the buildings or the expenses, but I am truly sorry about those three thousand people died in there. It was really hard and unbearable to kill people massively this way. I really don't believe how would somebody plan to this and then do it.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I don't think it was devastating for Americans only, but it was also to the whole world. In the name of the 9/11 events the American administration killed thousands of people and destroyed two countries and there are lots still to come. The film didn't mention anything about who did it or who is responsible - that is a good thing about the film I believe since it didn't politicallize the events. But the film was actually boring, and it was nothing like what you expect from Oliver Stone. The film could be deeper, or at least more moving, if it (the film) spoke of more important things in the events. It's not enough, not enough at all to show those two brave guys in their situation. I think there is much to be said about the 9/11 and of course I'm not asking Mr. Stone to say it all in a film, but I don't think he should picture American establishments as angels and that they have the right to ""revenge"" because they can never revenge anything because of many reasons that we can maybe say in other places, they can only destroy and they can only put their anger on innocent people. Mr. Stone might have meant this film to be a message of love and forgiveness, but it wasn't and I guess all the people saw the film would know why and I also think that Mr. Stone would know why.<br/><br/>No doubt that the characters played by Cage and Pena deserve a movie about their braveness and heroism, but not to be done by Oliver Stone, maybe by another director, and if so, he should've done it better - forget the political issues and the questions that 9/11 raised, at least, do it more cleverly, make it a little bit more beautiful and more moving and less boring.<br/><br/>After all, I would like to say that Oliver Stone remains for me as the BEST DIRECTOR in the world, and I can say that with confidence although I know Fellini, Tornatore and Goddard and hundreds of names that worked in cinema and made it better. But I still believe that it is Mr. Stone who made cinema different, and that cinema after he started making films was never the same."

With bold cinematic candor and haunting artistic eloquence, Stone reminds us of the evil in our world, and what we can do about fighting it and replacing it with love. By remembering heroes and courage, Stone has crafted what just may be the finest film released this summer.

"PWNYCNY","5","2","7","22 August 2006"," Misses the Mark
","When Hollywood tries to dramatize important and famous historical events, usually the results are mush. This movie is another example of Hollywood mush. 9/11/01 was a day of tragedy. The attack on the United States stunned, shocked, and appalled the American people and indeed people throughout the world. 9/11/01 turned our world upside down and things have never been the same. To accurately capture the feelings of the people on that sad day is a daunting task for the cinematic artist and in trying to achieve this goal this movie misses the mark by a mile. The results simply are flat. The scope of the movie does not capture the overwhelming feeling of collective horror that engulfed the city, the country and the world. 9/11/01 brought the United States literally to a halt. Everything stopped as people, bewildered and stunned, were forced to deal with a tragedy that directly affected every person on this planet. The events of 9/11/01 speak for themselves and require no further dramatization."

","""911 showed us what human beings were capable of, certainly the evil, but also the good...."" paraphrase of Nicholas Cage toward the end of World Trade Center <br/><br/>Oliver Stone puts you into Manhattan on the day the towers fell and shows you the story of a couple of Port Authority Policemen who were trapped in the rubble and what happened to them and their families.<br/><br/>Some people love it some people hate it. I really like it.<br/><br/>Stone manages to convey what it was like in New York and what it was like for the cops and firemen down at ground zero. These are not macho men but regular guys simply doing what had to be done.Every act of heroism is tinged with ""I don't want to be here"" which makes it even more touching.<br/><br/>The film is essentially split in two, the people at ground zero and the people back home waiting for word. Its an odd split and its the films biggest weakness. I understand that by showing the families Stone makes the story bigger than just some guys trapped, but at the same time the split makes the film remain a Hollywood film instead of something greater. Its not bad, its just that the story down in the rubble does not come across as cliché tinged.<br/><br/>Technically this film is amazing. It looks and sounds good. The shots of Manhattan and around ground zero are frighteningly perfect. Yes I know a portion of the film was shot in NYC but much was shot elsewhere. Having wandered around the streets down there I can guess which shot is which street and the sense of it all being real comes not from having seen photos but rather from seeing the real places.<br/><br/>The best part of this film is that its about hope and the goodness of people. The world is shaken and people attempt to fix it. As Cage says at the end its showed us what people are capable of...this film is a celebration of the good."

"michaelplewa","7","2","7","14 August 2006"," Terrifying and moving account of the day we'll never forget
","I didn't want to see this movie. It seemed too self-serious and ""important"" in its marketing. It made it look like a movie where the men go off and do brave things, and get put in mortal peril, and then they cut away to the wives at home grieving. I had forgotten that this was based on a true story, and when the film had finished, I remembered the news story about it.<br/><br/>So, since it is a true story and reminds you of such before the film starts, you'll find yourself giving leeway to it's sometimes melodramatic moments. There's something in knowing this was based on completely true events that lends the capital ""A"" acting more license. And that's the triumph of this movie. The acting is, almost entirely, beyond most of its cast. There's moments where only knowing that this actually happened makes it believable. Nicolas Cage is probably at his worst, while this is something of a triumph for Michael Pena. However, you buy into their world so thoroughly, and that is mostly due to the remarkable and terrifying ""hell on earth"" that falls upon them. Cutting back to the grieving wives is surprisingly poignant, and the film does this often. Maria Bello is particularly compelling, though it may be she had a more interesting role to play than Maggie Gyllenhal.<br/><br/>You'll ask yourself if this movie trivializes the events of 9/11. You'll be tempted to, but you won't, because all of a sudden you'll remember how you felt on that day, and there's a reliving it all over again.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone is famous for his conspiracy theories (or at least he is in the common press.) World Trade Center presents a thoughtful and compelling conspiracy theory all it's own...Common human decency was the undercurrent of 9/11, not insurmountable evil. You remember after the dust settled and the shock wore off, you appreciated your public servant's a lot more. You'll remember why there were wreaths placed by strangers at the NYPD and FDNY. These men exceeded their training and their orders to do something they knew was right. These weren't superheroes, just the embodiment of what lies in each of us, even those of us who are many times selfish and cruel. Stone's theory is that despite all the misery, murder and mayhem of 9/11, common human decency won out. It's a tender reminder from a brutal scar on our common history that we can be as fierce and violent as we can be heroic and kind. Any film that makes you feel that good after you remember how bad you once felt is doing something right."
"minman3-1","9","2","7","13 August 2006"," A perfect remembrance for all
","This is an emotional movie will all the feeling of being in the building with those that lived and died that day. Oliver Stone did an excellent job of mixing the stock footage and live actors together. Some may claim the views look cloudy and misty. This is how NYC looks and it was spot on for showing the morning of 9/11. With the 5th anniversary of this nation/world changing event this was an out standing movie to show the lives of those that survived and those that died. This is a narrowly focused view of the day. But shows how it affected the people that lived it. Most of us only saw it on TV, many more were touched by loved ones / friends / neighbors that we lost and the chance to even meet them to have them touch out lives. How we as Americans came together to help one another that day is something we must not ever forget. As our parents before us 911 was our Pearl Harbor. We thought we were too big to ever be hit. This was the wakeup call to let us know that NO ONE is safe from terrorist. We have hear of many stories of the good people did that day. This depicts what good men can do when faced with the evil that other will do. We as a nation came together to show that we can stand as one and will not back down to any person or ideal to justify an evil leader. Thank you to the PAPD, NYPD, FDNY, emergency workers and anyone else whom is there for people when catastrophes strike. God bless you and your families."
"Knoxguy","10","2","7","13 August 2006"," Artistic realism captures emotion of 9-11
","True to his style, Oliver Stone captures reality and art to make you feel you are part of the movie. As I watched in a crowded theater I found myself longing to be there in the beginning of the film and stop the clock- to return to life before 9-11-01. So many things have changed about life in America as a result of the terrorist attacks.<br/><br/>True to life, the movie rolls on through the horrible day. It captures the raw emotions our country felt and displays so well the courage and heroism of firemen, police and other rescue volunteers.<br/><br/>This is a very well done movie that everyone should see. I took my two teenage sons who had childhood memories of the day. On the real September 11th I remember how quiet it was with no air traffic in the skies. It was almost as quiet departing the theater as 300 individuals thought about what it meant to them."

","World Trade Center is OK. I didn't find it particularly great. I thought the scenes inside the rubble were nicely done, but that was about it. In fact, the movie fell flat with me every time it cut away from the 2 main characters.<br/><br/>I thought the scenes with their families as they were trapped felt plastic. they were schlocky, truth be told. it felt really over the top Hollywood dramatic, and i kind of wish they had been cut. to me, the real story was in the rubble, and should have stayed there.<br/><br/>i liked the part of the marine, and i think that it is even more inspiring because its true. however, the way he was filmed, and the scenes they gave him translated into a very wooden, almost unreal/unbelievable feeling. i read in the trivia that people thought he was made up by the screenwriter. and with the way he was shown in the film, its not hard to believe why.<br/><br/>all and all, its just alright. there were a few sad parts, sure. however, these sad parts relied more on swelling music and screenplay clichés than anything else. rent it."
"kwll-2","5","2","7","11 August 2006"," A Respectful, Well Made Movie - But Why Was It Made?
","I feel I must start by saying that none of us are really qualified to determine how long one must wait before attempting to cover material such as this. It is entirely conceivable that if we were to wait until everyone 'got over' this event before dramatizing it, we'd be waiting for life.<br/><br/>With that said, I must question the making of this movie. Stone was obviously very concerned about scratching the open wounds of victim families, because he removed (tastefully I might add) quite a bit of material that could have been used to make the events of the day a lot more harrowing to the viewer. When I say more harrowing, I of course must add that it is nearly impossible to be more unsettling in the re-telling of this story than the news coverage of the day had already been real-time. I merely refer to the use of intense sound and imagery to place the audience under the planes when they hit and in and around the buildings when they came down. <br/><br/>The decision to acknowledge the actual airliner impact with nothing more than a passing shadow and a rumble was BRILLIANT. Brilliant because the scene was far more concerned with showing what was happening in regular lives at the time, and in doing so only amplified the impact of the terrible and abrupt interruption of sanity that occurred. I believe that the showing of the planes crashing would have been far too Airport '77 and amateur.<br/><br/>The actual sequence depicting the collapse of Tower 1 was extremely frightening, both in imagery and sound quality. The sound of millions of tons of building coming down on the heads of the characters was bone chilling, overwhelming, and positively deafening. The delivery of the sound was top notch, as was the stylistic way it contrasted so suddenly with the absolute silence in the very next scene, when the characters began their hellish ordeal trapped under ten stories of debris. Stone and his crew had an incredible understanding of the use of sound to create dread, as additionally experienced throughout the trapped sequences when every thundering rumble meant additional structure collapse whose finality could not be determined from the vantage point of the characters.<br/><br/>Both leads did incredible jobs of riding the ragged edge of insanity as one would expect to do when it appears there's little more left to do but die, and die trapped in a claustrophobic hell hole with unanswered questions galore. I thought that Maggie Gyllenhaal was excellent as a pregnant wife who appeared to have been a 'can do' type person through September 10th, and who was reduced to a helpless mess one day later. I was less impressed with Maria Bello until I realized that she had the difficult job of portraying a character who had checked out of her marriage and spent the entire ordeal requiring cues from her surrounding family to realize the real value of what she stood to lose.<br/><br/>The scene with Jesus toting an Envian bottle, although I understand where it was going, was a bit much. I mention this only because everything in this movie had the feeling of being very deliberate - as though the makers thought the movie's worth would be evaluated on a scene by scene basis. Similarly, the G.I. Joe - like blurb uttered proudly by one of the characters upon discovery of the two officers seemed more like a product placement for the Marines than anything else. I admit, these are petty concerns about small, arguably insignificant plot devices in the movie, but with their insignificance in mind, why not just leave them out if they're not as manipulative as they appear to be if for no other reason than to avoid interpretations like mine? <br/><br/>And thus, we return to the central question of this review. What was this for? No revelations are to be had as a result of the material; everyone knows what happened. One cannot claim that Stone was pulling out all stops to place viewers on scene; too much was sanitized. An easy cop-out would be to say the movie was made as a 'thank you for the sacrifice', or as yet another suck up attempt directed at New York emergency personnel. But are any of these conclusions correct? <br/><br/>Who knows, but for my two cents, I say the following. If a movie like this is to be done, do it all. Acts of terrorism are violent and people are killed as a result. If you pick violence as a subject of a movie, do not then attempt to shield the viewer from that violence because in doing so, you have shielded the viewer from the movie's raison d'etre, nullified its effectiveness and what d'ya know - it's refund time again. If you are more concerned about hurting people's feelings than making an unflinching movie, than don't make the movie, because people are GOING to be hurt by a rehashing of these events.<br/><br/>Overall, a nice, neat, incredibly P.C. film that would have been no less effective if they had merely displayed the title on screen for the entire two plus hours. Hence the 5 of 10 rating. You simply can't stand on two sides of a fence at one time. Unless you have really, REALLY long legs..."
"famw","1","2","8","26 August 2006"," A 9/11 truther review of World Trade Center
","I did not like it at all. It dragged on mercilessly. I may have gone in with a bad idea of the movie but I am a movie person so I try to keep my mind open when I go to movies even if they are hyped. I couldn't tell if Oliver Stone was being sarcastic with us, the 9/11 truth movement or not. The collapses were only shown on television broadcast both WTCs 1 & 2 as well as WTC7. The hype about the explosions versus the bodies hitting the ground was bunk. Explosions were never brought up in the movie at all but he did show one body falling from the towers which I believe was uncalled for in this movie. But there was the horrifying sounds of the bodies hitting the ground on many occasions in the movie and the officers reacting aback to the sounds as it did the lady sitting to my right on several occasions. And he had one shot of old Bushy boy in one of his scenes on television telling us that we were at war and America was under attack. What a jerk I said out loud. As for the molten steel in the basement, there was on several occasions fire surrounding the officers in the rubble and a few times what looked like fireballs that flew back and forth passed them while they were trapped. He used the vision of Jesus on several occasion in the movie as one of the officers uses it as a symbol to keep himself awake with Jesus holding a bottle of water saying that it means he wants them to stay alive. And then it appears that the person that found the 2 officers was a very religious Marine that went to church to profess his faith before he went to the pile. It then says the Marine went on to reenlist and fight two tours in Iraq. Then there is the one line that puzzled me into wondering what Oliver Stone was really trying to say with the movie. One of the wives was in the ER waiting for her husband when they are watching the TV when the mother of another possible entrapped person at the WTC says that when she saw the buildings ""pancake"" like that... Now was he being sarcastic or was he really believing the government's story? Also there are several times when people in the movie make intimations to getting, you know who and that we're at war. And at the end, to me it seems like he was making a movie backing the government's story and the war in Iraq, though he does list the names of the fallen PAPD officers and mentions that 343 FDNY firefighters, 37 PAPD, 23 NYPD and that nearly 3000 people died and that only 20 people were pulled out alive and that the 2 officers were number 18 and 19.<br/><br/>So after it was over, I had to sit there and recover a little as all I could remember was the month I sat like a zombie hoping that they would find more firefighters alive. I am an ex-FDNY dispatcher. I may have known some of the dead firefighters, not personally but I may have eaten dinner with them at their firehouses in the Wall Street district. Then I went out to my car and called my wife and she does not believe in our side of the issue at all, the 9/11 Truth Movement. So she just listened which is a miracle in itself as she usually tells me to stop talking about 9/11. I really didn't like it as a movie and I expected more from Oliver Stone."
"nived84","7","2","8","14 August 2006"," Not exactly a great film, but important none-the-less
","I think any film that is made about 9/11 is going to be met with high scrutiny and often with a lot of people who'll just turn their noses up at it; claiming that it's just a shameful attempt to cash in on a tragedy to make a profit. To those arrogant, self-indulgent and brainless people who like to judge films before having actually seen them I only have one thing to say; shut up. This film and Paul Greengrass' amazing United 93 serve a bigger, more important purpose than money or profit. These films are meant to inspire, encourage and act as an important reminder of the power and bond that all Americans have to one another in great times of grief and tragedy. Where United 93 was about a group of strangers banding together to fight a common enemy, World Trade Center is about the courage and strength of men who put their lives on the line to help save others. This isn't a film about death and evil and destruction, it's about life, hope, strength, love and the courage to act, and rise up in a time when you are most needed. Any tears that you cry during this film are more likely to be tears of joy.<br/><br/>World Trade Center is an Oliver Stone film, that's oddly enough not an Oliver Stone film; there's no political commentary or message, and no conspiracy theories. I don't think America is quite ready for those films, but I don't doubt that at some point they will get made, eventually, but as for now filmmakers seem to be sticking to the reality of what happened on that day and not making up wild stuff and passing it off as the truth. Oliver Stone's usual style of intense editing, use of black & white film and historical stock footage isn't present in World Trade Center. It doesn't look, sound or move like your typical Oliver Stone film; this is probably the most straightforward film in his career, and it works well because of it.<br/><br/>This film is based on the incredible true story of two Port Authority Police Officers, John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena), who were buried in between the twin towers, below twenty feet of rubble. This is just one story of many on the events of that unforgettable day, but this is their story. John and Will were only two of twenty people that were rescued out of the wreckage of the twin towers. Their story won't just grab your throat, but also touch your heart; it's not in the slightest way depressing, it's downright inspiring. I think this is a film that you don't WANT to see, but you HAVE to see. It's a reminder to live life to the fullest, and to not take it for granted, because you never know what tomorrow may bring.<br/><br/>The film balances back and forth from being stuck in the rubble; fighting to stay alive, and showing us what the families of the trapped men go through during the day. The wives want to remain hopefully, but the tension of not knowing what's going on and what's happening are shaking them to their core. And if you think these guys survived the collapse and are safe, and just waited to be rescued, you'd be dead wrong. The danger is very much present the whole time and at any minute they could have been killed. The performances are pretty good, especially Michael Pena as Will Jimeno. Mark my words; this guy's got an Oscar coming to him in his future. Heck, even Jay Hernandez and Stephen Dorff offer solid and respectable performances. Oliver Stone must have done something extraordinary, right? Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello also deliver durable performances. Although I must say that those bright blue contacts that Maria wore really distracted from her performance. They looked great in Underworld, but here they just look really bad. World Trade Center isn't a great film, and not quite at the same kind of masterful level as United 93 was, but this film is a respectable and important reminder of that tragic day, and it's done with class, emotion and most of all respect.<br/><br/>Some people have said that it's too soon for films to be made about the events of 9/11. I think that's bullshit. There have been plenty of books, documentaries (mostly with political agendas) and TV movies made on 9/11, but most of those things have focused on the darkness and death of that day. What's wrong with taking two hours out of your busy day to be reminded of what good that can come out of it? I think we owe at least that much to them. You have to take the good with the bad, and to remember that day as nothing but bad would be a real tragedy."

"guillermotorofan","6","2","8","12 August 2006"," Half of the film that was UNITED 93...
","Let me say this: this film is very important and quite moving. But as a film, if we could look at it and critique without the twinge of guilt when you whine about a film that deals with such serious matters, then it is obvious that WORLD TRADE CENTER is a bad film. It is all over the place, it goes here...there...everywhere. It is sloppy in highest form. As a film, it is unpleasantly out of formula. With the WAY too commercial advertisement of this film, I expected them to spend half of the film attempting to escape, like every other disaster epic. Not so. Nic Cage spends maybe a week of shooting in action, then the rest of the shoot on his face in the rubble, conversing with his also trapped partner, and saying (too many times): ""Just don't fall asleep"". If the film weren't so sad then I WOULD have fallen asleep half way through the film. But it is ten times as disturbing and moving as you know that these people were real, and most of us remember that day. So it is poorly structured, yet effective.<br/><br/>Acting: 8/10<br/><br/>I thought and still think it was an unforgivable mistake to cast such big actors in a movie like this. It takes away from the message. Any film on 9/11 is inevitably going to be a documentary of sorts, and I have yet to see Nic Cage and Maria Bello in a documentary. That said all of the actors DO do a good job. Cage gives a great performance. He seems a little TOO emotionless in a situation like that, but he does blend into the fabric well. Bello does quite well too. She fills the shoes of Nic Cage, and is a pleasant gem. Michael Pena is my favorite performance of the film. He seems like a guy you could run into on the street. When you forget that it is just an actor, then the actor has done their job. Props to Pena. Maggie Gyllenhaal is decent. She is a notch below the rest. She does fine, but there are small eccentricities to her performance that briefly through us out. Shes good for the eyes,but in this case, not the best performer.<br/><br/>Writing: No rating.<br/><br/>The writing is HORRIBLE. First off, it really isn't written. It takes events and portrays them. The film feels jerky as a result of filling in the gaps. A terrible script, but again, it is a semi-documentary. I don't feel right rating real events such as these. <br/><br/>Directing: 6/10<br/><br/>Stone gives some delicious shots, and moving moments. But as I said, the script is made up of pages just thrown in place, going from scene to scene like taking a funny turn in your car. JEEEEERRRRRRKKK. Poor pacing and placement, and Mr.Stone seemed to have done little to help in that area.<br/><br/>Visual Effects: 8/10<br/><br/>Very few effects. but what is there is great. Really not much there to critique. <br/><br/>Cinematography:9/10<br/><br/>Some bad lighting, but many many shots that are just gorgeous. It isn't the INCREDIBLE camera work of United 93, but it is impressive. <br/><br/>Score: 6/10<br/><br/>Fine score, but doesn't fit. The film is unusually without a prominent score, and not in a good way. Music to accentuate the drama was wanted and needed. Music (along with cinematography) IS one of the greatest tools of the filmmaker. It is a sin not to use it, or at least use it correctly. <br/><br/>In the end, a bad movie. If it were just a piece of adventure fiction flashing by at the multiplex, then I would have left ticked off at the filmmakers for a bad film. But it is a highly emotional experience,it digs deep inside, and for that I award it a...<br/><br/>Diagnosis: B-"
"etsm92","10","2","8","12 August 2006"," Excellent departure for Oliver Stone. A Masterpiece!
","World Trade Center/2006/****<br/><br/>Main Stars: Nicolas Cage Michael Pena Maria Bello Maggie Gyllenhaal<br/><br/>Director Oliver Stone (writer of Scarface and director of the recent film Alexander) is known to be a director of violence and profanity. Here he departs himself from that and directs this masterpiece filled with emotion and tragedy and also inspiration. Cops are assigned to where they need to go or guard for the day of September 11, 2001. It's just a typical day on the job until a few cops see a shadow of a plane reflected on a near building. That is the start of it all. You would think some of this film would be related to politics. And you would hear people's opinions on this tragedy and whose fault it is. People would most likely blame President Bush because he's the perfect person to blame right? Rumors are he's stupid. Plus, he is the Head of State and who better to blame than the person in charge. He's sitting behind his desk clueless. However, this film did not have any of that which most people are sick of hearing. And that is another reason why this film is so grand. It concentrates on two men- John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena)- who saw something other than evil. Something other than what the world saw. They saw that they had a chance to live and a chance to save and do their best to evacuate the people from the Twin Towers. What's inspiring about this film is that even though they are having an extremely hard time building up claustrophobia while under the rubble, they stay with it, they don't give up because they are tough and are built to take hardship. And that is exactly what the real Will and John did; they remained as calm as they could be and instead of panicking too much, they stayed strong. Back at home Will and John's wives obviously start to get nervous. Their husbands are out their breathing in dust and rubble and are stuck in one spot. John McLoughlin's wife Donna (Maria Bello) is the one always to be scared and rarely has any hope. However one of her four children wants to get out there and find dad and bring him back. Will Jimeno's wife Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal) also is stressed and is pregnant which makes it even worse. It was definitely emotional and also very well done. They flip back and forth between families who don't even recognize each other when crossing each other in the hospital. Then they flip back to the scenes with Will and John trying to occupy them with something while they wait for rescue teams. Some of their conversations were actually a bit humorous and also emotional Conversing about past things and even envisioning them again and again. When they envision these flashbacks, they feel like getting out of the rubble even more. They need to find something to attract a rescue team so they can be saved. We urgently wait for one to come while we feel exactly what Will and John feel. Misery. I hope what I'm saying isn't discouraging you from seeing the film. The film is excellent (inspiring and not politically charged) but, yes, very emotional. I usually don't cry out loud and need a hanky to store all the moist snot. But I do on the inside and I feel sad when leaving the theater. Because right before the end credits, it tells you all the true events in captions that really did happen on that day and later when two men saw something other than evil and the rest of the people saw hell. Movie directed by Oliver Stone."

"fatzmurda","10","2","8","11 August 2006"," World Trade Center is the BEST film of the year!
","World Trade Center is easily the best film of the year. This movie is extremely heart-felt and it perfectly displays the events of 9/11. I believe many people are disappointed with this picture because we do not actually see the Twin Towers get hit or actually crash down. I believe that direction is masterful. Oliver Stone showed only the two police officers point of view. This filmed was about them, so they were the focus and how they saw it, you saw it. When I exited the theater people were almost in full blown tears. I, myself teared at least 5 times throughout the film. If any film is a must-see this year, it is definitely World Trade Center."
"Daddo777","9","2","8","10 August 2006"," well worth the time to revisit
","Having a vague notion going in of what to expect from WTC, I must say that I was anything but disappointed by what this film offered, in spite of my reservations regarding the director who, although celebrated, occasionally spins off into the cosmos. As was evidenced by the sparse theater attendance, I doubt that this film will be highly critically acclaimed but, as for myself, I found the handling of the material poignant, honest and moving. Indeed, any recount of that day tends to wreck me, but I never imagined the nuances of the personal stories beyond the puff pieces handed to us by the networks and the newsstands. Oliver Stone gets kudos from me for telling a tough story very well visually and emotionally, slow moments and all. Just like our lives really are."
"aeheaton5","10","2","8","10 August 2006"," ""Lest we forget""
","I went in expecting an overdone film - completely dramatic and emotional. I was pleasantly surprised. I felt that the film didn't try too hard. It was basically saying ""this is the story - and it is what it is"". It appeared to me that it was the survivors telling their story, complete with details that probably seemed mundane at the time, but kept the film real to an audience. I left the theater feeling like the survivors had the most hand in making this film and hopefully they are satisfied that their story has been told. Also, I understand 9/11 is a touchy subject, but I think sometimes we need to remember things like this and really see it from a humanistic point of view. The only unpleasant part of my viewing experience was when during the end credits, they put up text of the death tolls and the names of the PAPD officers who lost their lives that day, and most of the audience got up and left which moved me to tears more than the movie. Sick and disrespectful. But an excellent movie, if you didn't expect too much."

","I saw this movie last night. After watching United 93 and about vomiting from the movie-induced vertigo, this movie was a relief. The story was well put together. The views of the WTC were accurate, including the lobby area views. I highly recommend this movie to every American! Warning: you might want to bring along some tissue. Even the grown men in the Theatre were sniffling! My favorite part of the movie was when the Marine said, ""I'm not leaving you, I'm a Marine!"" One great aspect about this movie is the fact I forgot Nicolas Cage was in the movie and totally got into the character he was portraying. It sounds strange but he appeared and spoke so differently than I've ever seen him in other movies. Kudos to Oliver Stone. This is a great movie. I can't wait to see it again and really absorb the views around the WTC."

For those who say it was done creepily and dis-respectfully, just remember that John and Will where there when the script was being written and when the film was being filmed, if they were happy with it all is right cause its their story! This film focused on the human spirit rather than the attacks.<br/><br/>Michael Pena and Nic Cage did a wounder full job, when I was in the theater watching it, it didn't seem like I was watching Nic cage in the rubble of the world trade center. As for Michael Pena's performance, I wouldn't be surprised if he earns him self an Oscar nod, just an amazing performance.<br/><br/>Over all this film was very moving and powerful, just be warned. If you go to see this movie for the soul purpose of giving it a bad rating, you will not get the message or the large pay off that the filmmakers intended. If you are that narrow sighted I suggest that you don't wast your time by seeing it. If you don't want to see it don't, but don't come here on IMDb giving it a bad rating if you haven't seen it.<br/><br/>Again, respectfully done and does justice to the events of the day."

","I walked into this movie knowing that it was based on a true story, as well as how this story ended, but I didn't expect to feel emotional as much as I did. This is not your typical Oliver Stone movie, where conspiracies and politics run amok. Rather it's a powerful film about the human spirit and it's quite simple. The acting was great with another great performance by Cage and a star turning performance by Pena, who with their acting, invite the audience into their claustrophobic pain. Most of the shots/visuals were quite beautiful and chilling, along with a great score. At times the movie does slow down and loses its pace, but the true drama it portrays is uplifting and brought a smile to my face. Some of the scenes are intense, especially those involving the demise of the WTC, so there maybe some breathless moments to deal with. Overall, I think this movie is definitely worth a watch. It shows that there is some good, even in the most tragic and unbelievable events."

","During World War II, there were many movies purporting to tell the story of what happened at Anzio or on Normandy beach. But what you ended up getting were a few fictional characters dropped in the middle of this or that battle.<br/><br/>And now we have Oliver Stone's ""World Trade Center"", which focuses on two real-life heroes of the 9/11 tragedy.<br/><br/>After the conspiracy-laden ""JFK"", I keep expecting Stone to have an agenda behind all his films. When I heard that he had done a film about 9/11, I wondered what kind of film it would be. How much conspiracy theory or jingoism would be injected in with the drama? What I saw on the screen was a very human drama. Two Port Authority cops go in to the WTC to help free the trapped victims only to be trapped themselves.<br/><br/>The action switches back and forth between the trapped cops and their families. I appreciated this because it would otherwise have left me hopelessly claustrophobic. The family scenes also helped to round out the characters of the two heroes. The tension is also eased by a few instances of humor (Not jokes) which broke the tension a little.<br/><br/>Any politics in the film are kept to a minimum. Despite it's subject matter, this is not a political movie. This is a story about survival and hope. I recommend it highly."
"steeped","7","2","9","13 August 2006"," The World Trade Center
","September the 11th is now a day of remembrance, to remember the thousands who died in the two building's.<br/><br/>Yes, an important time but how many movies do they have to make? It seems like this terrible incident turned into a Hollywood money-maker! I first saw Flight 93 on TV. It was a very good movie yet it left out very important parts. Then I saw United 93 and I thought I was watching Flight 93 again! They might as well have taken Flight 93 off TV, put it into the theaters and change the ""Flight"" to ""United"". But then the World Trade Center movie came out...<br/><br/>The day started as John McLoughlin (played by Nicolas Cage) went off to work as a police officer. He is a great veteran cop who was put in-charge to direct his unit through the runes of the tower. The second plane soon hit, leaving John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno (played by Michael Pe単a) trapped in the rubble. A big part of this movie is about survival, and it showed how these officers had the strength to continue. I think Oliver Stone (the director) also wanted to show the audience how September the 11th didn't only effect the victim's in the towers, but also all of America.<br/><br/>Half the movie the camera was on Nicolas Cage and Michael Pe単a's character, but the other half was on their family's and how they were effected. The whole family got together and sat by the TV listening for updates. Each family had their own unique story which touched the audience. Oliver Stone did a good job.<br/><br/>I didn't understand why the camera didn't show the airplanes running into the towers though... you see the house shake, or a shadow of the plane on a building... but you never see it hit the World Trade Center. Were they too lazy to add more CGI? Also this movie was supposed to show how hundreds of officers went into the buildings to save all those lives even though they knew they might perish in the wreck. But when John McLoughlin asked his unit who will be joining him for the rescue, only 3 people stepped forward. If you are making a movie about the courage of the police then you should show it! Good movie overall. See it!"
"edenhall","7","2","9","10 August 2006"," What'$ wrong with a film about American tragedy?
","Here is my basic review of the movie World Trade Center. The film itself was great. I can't deny that it was a good film (based on a true story supposedly). However, the merit for which it was written - that's another story. It's easy to say that this film was (1) ""too soon"" and (2) another American exploitation. It's good that the film avoided involving ""terrorists"" and all the mechanics of the situation. It rather involved people helping people, which really helped keep it from being diluted with ""American Proganda."" Overall, I gave the film 7 out of 10 stars. At times it seems like the dialog was over contrived, and the ""Jesus scene""...I won't ruin the movie for you, but let's just say that Jesus and a water bottle are a little too contrived even for my tastes. This film really touched upon a tragedy...a very profitable tragedy."

","I was lucky to view this film at a sneak preview, and was moved by it. I was happy that it didn't dwell on terrorism or politics, but instead dwelt on courage and faith and hanging on. Nice performances all around, especially by Pena and Cage, and a fine job by director Oliver Stone. Though the story of these real-life survivors was powerful, the true impact of the tragedy was brought home to me by the list of fallen Port Authority officers, shown at the end of the movie. The film helped me get a grasp on the enormity of our nation's loss. Interesting note: I've never been in a more quiet movie theater.<br/><br/>QUIBBLES: <br/><br/>I know the Marine character was based on a real person, but he seemed almost robotic or superhuman. Seemed unrealistic.<br/><br/>The montage of shocked reaction shots from people around the world was a bit much.<br/><br/>I found it hard to believe that ""missing"" signs, some very well made, and at least one of a pet, appeared in the hospital less than 24 hours after the tragedy.<br/><br/>Why were Maria Bello's eyes that weird shade of blue, instead of her normal brown? It took me awhile to recognize her.<br/><br/>The river of rescuers gathered to bear Nicolas Cage's stretcher along seemed a bit excessive. They were all gathered at that one scene? Even if it was true, it seemed too much. <br/><br/>How were those large chunks of cement lifted off Nicolas Cage so easily, basically by one guy? <br/><br/>Those Wisconsin firefighters were on-scene, handing out grilled brats, less than 24 hours after the event? Again, even if it was true, that seemed like a stretch. <br/><br/>I know - lots of quibbles. But despite that, it really is a good film."

As they try to evacuate people, the Towers collapse and McLoughlin and Jimeno are trapped in the debris whilst their fellow officers are killed instantly or die soon after.<br/><br/>I expected World Trade Center to be a rescue film as heroic policemen or more accurately Nicolas Cage goes and try to rescue people from the rubble. Not that they themselves are trapped in the rubble with most of the film taking place in the dark as the rest of the film deals in emotional turmoil of their families cross cutting with the trapped policemen in peril with salvation arriving in the form of a religious, zany and rather on the edge Marine who speaks in slogans. We are told at the end of the film that the marine later did two tours of duty in Iraq (a country which by the way had nothing to do with 9/11 but I am sure the way the character is presented in this film gleefully took vengeance on the Iraqi people!)<br/><br/>The films is based on a true story and not a tale I knew about as I came to this film with little knowledge of the plot. Oliver Stone is more restrained in his directing style (keep the camera moving is his motto!) and the film does present challenges for Stone.<br/><br/>This ranges from his left wing views that is tempered here, to being respectful to the 9/11 events and this true story of the rescue but also the technical challenge of re-enacting the disaster. Obviously they have created a CGI Twin Towers in the establishing shots of New York and then used archive footage of the aftermath of the incident and the Towers with the plot of the film although not successfully integrated.<br/><br/>The film conveys the confusion that occurred on that day but pacing is a problem especially when the police team are literally walking to the disaster area and of course when they are later trapped it is then just two guys talking to keep each other going which of course makes the story drag but its also devoid of tension."

For anyone criticizing this film, you really should listen to the words and commentary of these men--you will be better off for having done so. To criticize this film in the light of the message these men wish to have conveyed is nothing short of unconscionable.<br/><br/>This film is about the triumph of the human spirit in the face of absolute adversity.

For two hours the main characters are buried and all they say is ""don't die pal"" or lines like that. All the most obvious lines that you have heard in movies when some good guy is dying. Nicholas Cage's character lacks any kind of humanity, because he is just a perfect prototype... looks like a black and white American dad from a TV show from the cold war times.

"sddavis63","8","1","3","14 June 2008"," Its Power Is In Its Simplicity
","Bearing such a grandiose title, one almost expects a grandiose treatment of the events surrounding the attacks on and collapse of the World Trade Centre on September 11, 2001. Instead, one ends up watching a movie that in many ways is very simple and straightforward, and surprisingly human and personal; a story of survival in the midst of the impossible. On 9/11 Port Authority police officers John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno are among hundreds deployed to the Trade Centre. As they go about their job of trying to evacuate people, the Towers collapse and McLoughlin and Jimeno are trapped deep in the rubble, hurt and struggling to find some way to survive the insane situation they're in - described by Jimeno at one point as like being in hell. In the end, the movie isn't really even about the attempt to rescue them. There's really very little attention focused on the rescue effort. Instead, the movie goes back and forth from McLoughlin and Jimeno to their families, watching the drama unfolding on television, and having no idea whether they're alive or dead or will even ever be found.<br/><br/>This very simple, human focus was probably what this movie needed to make it a success. If you really want a movie dealing with the events of 9/11, you won't like this - or at least you'll be disappointed by it. I tend to be of the opinion, though, that even now - almost seven years after the attack - we're not ready for a completely Hollywood-ized dramatization of 9/11. Human stories are still the way to go. The other significant movie dealing with 9/11, of course, is ""United 93."" It's a very different movie than ""WTC,"" but with the same personal, human focus, and also based on a true story from 9/11. To compare the two, I'd say ""93"" was better, but ""WTC"" is also a worthy treatment of that tragic day. 8/10"

It is more than a documentary.<br/><br/>The story went into its plot quite realistically, without much dramatic presentations and playing. From the angle of those brave officers, we see shining souls, and gladly we can see it for what it is, not some Hollywood stereotype stuff. People may find out the truth by viewing the movie that, Nicolas Cage's team hardly saved a person from the towers before they were trapped under the ruins. So, you may ask, what's the point of all these sacrifice? The director was smart enough not to force any ideas about this problem into audiences' mind, he'd rather tell you the true experiences, not only the desire to survive but also fear, rage, love and memory. Their actions didn't save any one out of the WTC, but they deserve the search of people. They didn't win back the buildings, but they won giving their families, their friends and all the US people hope. It took maybe 1000 people to work on the ruins above them to save 2 people, were the 1000 people worth?

Because of some absolutely phenomenal camera shots this movie was a lot better than I expected. Acting was the same. Nicolas Cage and Maria Bello did not disappoint. He's a top-notch actor and she is the same. The fact that the first plane crash came less than 20 minutes into the movie is what did it. Where some directors decide to take forever to get into the details, this guy got right into it. Everything in this movie looked so real, it was almost easy to imagine being in NYC that Tuesday morning. Like I said before WTC was something that was going to be either a complete masterpiece, or a complete waste of time. The only part that was kind of hard to believe was that Michael Shannon's character was one of only 2 people who got the idea to go on a night search...where was everybody else who survived to live past the afternoon? The plane crashes in this were somewhat amazing too. How did the directors manage to pull off a similar effect??"

","On this, the sixth anniversary of the day the Twin Towers got attacked, I bought and watched World Trade Center in order to put me in tribute mode. This Oliver Stone film tells the story of Officer Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) and Sergeant John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage) and their survival under layers of rubble for hours after the bombing. Almost as compelling as Pena and Cage are Maggie Gyllenhaal and Mario Bello as their wives as they go through various emotions (though, surprisingly, very few confrontational ones) as they wait for news of their spouses' fate. While there's some flashbacks and dream sequences (like the Jesus one concerning Jimeno), this is mostly straightforward storytelling that's a bit unusual for Stone in that his point-of-view here is less obvious than you'd expect from him. While not a great film, World Trade Center certainly still has both touching and intense moments that make this essential viewing for anyone wanting to see an optimistic view of an event that could have made pessimists of both protagonists had things took a turn for the worst. Excellent jobs for everyone involved! Update 9/12/08: Having just survived a tree falling on the roof of my parents' house during Hurricane Gustav, I now think those men that survived being stuck under debris for hours during 9/11 deserve nothing but all the praise they've gotten and more.

Yes, we already figured out that the families of the lost would be worried, scared, and short tempered!

All the ingredients of a Stone movie are here.......reaction shots....CHECK........flashbacks to happier times....CHECK........factual errors.......CHECK and double CHECK! I suggest that you skip this movie, and keep an eye out for all the excellent documentaries that have been made about the tragedy, and will undoubtedly be shown every anniversary week. They contain real footage, excellent reporting of the facts of each hijacked plane, survivor, and non survivor stories, and detailed expert analysis of the damage to the towers, and Pentagon. Oliver Stone is a carrier of the dreaded ""conspiracy-itis"", which is apparently contagious, since a disproportionate number of actors, who have appeared in Stone films, hav become conspiracy nuts!"
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","7","1","3","29 August 2007"," Touching effort, respectful, but as much as it hurts to say it, WTC is melodramatic
","Let's be honest, Oliver Stone making a movie about 9/11/2001 was to be expected. He is, after all, one of the most outspoken celebrities in the world when it comes to politics and history. He rarely pulls his punches. This is one of those rare times. Stone puts his political commentary aside to make World Trade Center, a film that respectfully and powerfully tells the story of New York Port Authority Police Officers John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno and their struggle to stay alive after becoming trapped beneath the collapsing towers. The story is also seen through the eyes of each man's family.<br/><br/>Another point that should be realized, whether we admit it or not, prior to viewing this, United 93 (The Oscar nominated theatrical release), and Flight 93 (The TV version), we all had some sort of predisposition about the film, and in this case, its director. Screenwriter Andrea Berloff, Stone, and the actors take the story and tell it with the intention of overpowering the audience with emotion, which is absolutely unnecessary. This is the film's biggest flaw. You have to admire their dedication and approach, but she didn't realize something Paul Greengrass did, which is this. We, the audience, are already running with our emotions high, no matter how we feel, our feelings are already high. No matter what, the reminder of what happened will transport us back to how we felt that day. To put it simple, I felt like I was actually watching the event take place in United 93, while I never mistook WTC for reality (even though the events did happen). Another reason I say this is because of the cast.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Nicolas Cage was brilliant. In fact, it was probably his best since Adaptation. His portrayal of McLoughlin was very real and he shines specifically towards the end...However, no matter how hard I tried, I could not stop thinking ""this is Nicolas Cage, and his star power is sort of distracting me from the purpose of the movie"". Michael Pena delivers a similar performance to that of his own in Crash...very emotional, likable, and all around good. While our two leading men hold their own, it is two of our supporters who really shine. Jay Hernandez, of 'Hostel' fame, definitely surprised me in limited screen time as he gives us a great character that we get to know even though we see so little of him. His performance makes me wonder what the real Dominick Pezzulo was like. Another great performance is from the often forgotten, but unforgettable Michael Shannon. Shannon's character is a true hero, and I'm glad to know that this man actually exists and that there are people like him. Shannon gives us an impactful and important performance. Now, these are the actors involved with the building perspective of the film, while Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal play the wives of Cage and Pena respectively. I have to say, Bello added a little to the overdramatics, but after thinking of the position her character is in, I have to say that I was wrong and both she and Gyllenhaal deliver winning performances.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone's World Trade Center is a respectful film that does its job of telling us one particular story from 9/11. Stone could not have directed with more restrain than he did, but strangely, it works. There are a few factual errors, like the race of a secondary character being incorrect, but I didn't notice them during the film. Stone doesn't show us the horrifying images of the planes colliding with the buildings, which was a relief. The sets are incredibly real, especially the ruined towers Cage and Pena must deal with for most of the film.<br/><br/>7/10 --spy"

","I used to live in NYC. Not Manhattan, but Staten Island, one of the five boroughs of NYC. Being only 8 years old, the events of 9/11 left me trying to come up with a movie (thank God I was only 8) about my experience of 9/11. I'm sure many Hollywood directors immediately came up with the idea of putting together a 9/11 to make a large profit. Oliver Stone was obviously one of those people, and he did it. But unfortunately, he didn't do it right.<br/><br/>The first 15 minutes, I'll let you know, are fantastic. They beautifully detail the men arriving at the WTC. One of the officers even sees a man falling out of the building. So they head in. And once they do, the movie falls apart like leaves.<br/><br/>The guys walk through the Twin Towers (yes, walk), making jokes as if nothing has happened. Blood is all around them yet they walk through as if they have no clear mission. Only when the towers collapse do they realize a building getting hit by a massive plane with so many dead is actually serious, but it's too late for them. The officers are crushed beneath the rubble.<br/><br/>Their families watch in horror as the buildings fall atop their loved ones. Of course, both families are annoying and one of them has a bratty, spoiled child yelling at his mother. He claims she doesn't care about her husband because she refuses to drive up to the wasteland of Ground Zero, search through many stories of rubble and find her husband. The kid makes me want to assassinate Oliver Stone for making that child say such rubbish.<br/><br/>For the longest time, two of the surviving officers, Nicholas Cage and a Hispanic guy that I've never heard of talk, giving inevitable character development. Nicholas' Cage performance is kind of a bore but he still has his moments. The other officer is excellent; he is the lone highlight of the movie.<br/><br/>Eventually, the corniest cornball of military cornballs decides to help search through the rubble, finally shedding light on the two buried officers. It is really painful watching this guy, it's like watching a Power Ranger in 9/11.<br/><br/>The only positive note after those first 15 minutes and the Hispanic officer is the lines ""He's coughing up rocks"", which shows that the movie at least has sense of realism. But all in all, these things can't save this awful portrayal of the events of 9/11.<br/><br/>4.7/10= You'd be better off without it"

I felt the experience of seeing this movie brought me just a little bit closer to the horrors that took place that day, and the lives of the men and women who died that day.<br/><br/>Let me tell you, this is NOT AT ALL about spectacular effects, ohw, they are in the movie,naturally, but they don't form the base of this film, the base of this film is the story of hope, despair, pain, and giving your life to help others.<br/><br/>Its a powerful, heavy blanket of misery and pain, topped off by the feeling of having a new anchor to sail with, on your way to giving these horrors a place in your life.<br/><br/>Excellent film, not much more to say on that, brilliant acting, all very, very reserved and respectful.

"TrishGunner","5","1","3","4 July 2007"," What exactly made them heroes?
","With all due respect to McLoughlin and Jimeno, my questions begin with the portrayals of them in the movie that do not quite resemble that of a ""hero"". For nearly 2 hours, we see the two in the dark, buried, supported each other by telling his family stories. I can see McLoughlin a hero to Jimeno, and Jimeno a hero to McLoughlin, but what else have they done to attract the title of ""heroes"" to themselves and deserve a celebration at the end that tells me nothing? Okay, they are heroes by profession. PAPD, fine. Every cop is a hero, basically, as any 5-year-old can tell you about. But what exactly did McLoughlin and Jimeno do, at least in the movie, to deserve a 2-hour retelling of their stories while some 2,700 others are buried behind? They tried to save, right, they ""tried"", then boom, the lobby collapsed and the rest of the movie was about their melodramatic love stories that I could care less. The stories were over-dramatic, and at times I began to suspect the accuracies in them. A carpenter? A good father? Alexys and Olivia?? Look, we're talking about a tragedy that involved some 2,700 deaths and of which 37 PAPD officers, what impact do these long and boring ""love stories"" make to let us know the real stories about LOVE AND SURVIVAL? Oh my god, he's trapped! I have a baby in my womb and her father is missing! Oh no... *cry* I have to take a walk *come home* Any news? *shook heads* The idea of this movie is a mistake. It focuses too much on the 2 men and their families which I could've spent 2 hours watching something better, and the accuracies of their stories are in doubt as all those people I mentioned participated in the construction of the story of the movie. I saw way too much ""heroism"" in them which in reality doesn't make any sense - being buried for 12 hours and survived doesn't automatically make you a hero. Your loving family won't make you a hero, your stories involving your beautiful wife and son won't make you a hero. Who indeed are the heroes? Drastically reduced to minor characters - Karnes and Thomas, the two who walked into the ruins to save them, are. Yet, both of them were reported inaccurately portrayed in the movie, especially Thomas who was in fact a black man.<br/><br/>The term hero may apply to how great a man you are when you love your family, but in the context of WTC, serving and saving others are the principles of becoming a hero. (in the movie) McLoughlin and Jimeno saved nobody else, yet they received a whole 2-hour glorification of their 15-minute heroic act. The ending celebration of their survivals has nothing to do with the destruction of WTC and the deaths left behind. I can't help but think that this portrayal of the WTC attack was a wasted effort."
"thai1976","6","1","3","14 May 2007"," Good if a somewhat narrow minded tale
","I don't think it was really a good idea to make a movie on this topic when it's still so fresh in everyone's mind but it is very sensitively made as there are no shots of the plane hitting the towers and no carnage or bodies to speak of which is a good idea in the circumstances.<br/><br/>This is a good movie but does drag during the playing time which isn't particularly long. In a terrible disaster such as this where over 2,700 people died I found it strange that the tale was only about two Police officers trapped in the rubble which is basically the film from start to finish. The acting was on par and the set design gets a special mention as the re-creation of ground zero was spot on but I will find this hard to recommend due to slow pace and very narrow story telling. I did find in some (Although rare) instances my mind wandering during some of the scenes. One aspect of the film I can't fault was the way the film made you think of all the people who lost there life's and the grief the family members must of felt (and still feel) as I did feel genuinely moved in some instances.<br/><br/>I read another comment on this site that mention's the fact that this could of been a film about a couple of miners trapped in a coal mine and you wouldn't of noticed the difference which is a fair comment to be fair as no other avenue's are ever explored.<br/><br/>All together a good, well made film but very slow in places. Oliver Stone didn't make the movie the America public and family members deserve with the subject matter.<br/><br/>6 out of ten"

Who both are helpless (in more than one way) to the horrific thing that happened that day! It's nice that as with ""United 93"", Oliver Stone asked the families for permission, too. He got many details from those conversations and that shows on screen! This movie is character driven, but not in the sense that the main leading characters are actively involved in a journey, which is something a viewer might want to see (there's a character who takes that active role, but it merely seems enough) ...

","I knew what to expect. I read the reviews before buying this, but it's Cage, so it goes in the collection, regardless. I have to say that this was not what it should have been.<br/><br/>While this is a fantastic dramatization of what happens with four rescuers, it fails to tell anything about the actual event itself. Many movie goers were looking for an Oliver Stone's JFK-stylized World Trade Center type drama, and instead we got a look through the microscope rather than a look at the larger picture, as told by the evidence. I think that's what disappointed most audience members with this work.<br/><br/>But it's not bad for what it is. It's well written, tense, and triumphant. Cage is completely believable...I wouldn't expect any less from him.<br/><br/>It rates a 6.6/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"danny-donna-kim","3","1","3","2 March 2007"," A Tedious and Unforfilling Film!
","In my opinion it's not an awful movie, however it has to take first prize in the most disappointing movie i have seen!<br/><br/>To be frank i think the movie was to long, and to boring...no offence. I strongly believe that these Hollywood movies about 9/11 totally and completely defeat the object of what really happened, i am aware that in the true event of 9/11 there was more to the story than meets the eye. However how many movies about 9/11 have been made since it happened? Many movies. All of them will tell the story of the shadows, unlike showing the object that is creating the shadows if you know what i mean.<br/><br/>They will tell the story of something else that happened on 9/11 apart from the main event. On September 11th 2001, the world watched in horror as the WTC was struck by two aircrafts and after minutes the monumental buildings of modern America collapsed. Both towers peeled like a banana skin. <br/><br/>I think this is important and i think even Hollywood directors should consider this: NEVER make a movie about 9/11 for at least another 30 years and this is why: I understand that many people, especially Ameriacn's may be offended or will find it distressing to see graphic images of 9/11, and that's understandable. However the reality is that two planes were driven into the twin towers and they collapsed, and i know this is going to sound shallow and i don't want people to take this the wrong way but that's what captures the audiences attention.<br/><br/>Within 25 minutes of this 2 hour long film, both towers had been hit and both towers had collapsed, the rest of the film was flat and dull. The audience is left in the dark with these two guys taking and the families acting out their lives and i lost interest. What Hollywood could do is make a graphic movie ABOUT THE TWIN TOWERS, and that would get attention, and nobody is forcing people to watch it you can make that decision your-self."
"Dame_Mame","9","1","3","17 February 2007"," The Right Stuff!
","I just finished watching ""World Trade Center"" and report that I was completely engrossed in this movie. I did not know what to expect and was somewhat skeptical & anxious about watching it. I am very glad that I did watch it. In particular, what struck me was that Oliver Stone focused in on one element of September 11th; wisely, he did not attempt to capture all that went on during those horrific days. Perhaps someday that will be possible. This was a very tastefully produced film and very much worth watching. It was a glimpse into the lives of but a few of the people who were there and their stories. It's just one story at a time. Well done. ... and a big thank you to the people portrayed for sharing their experiences with all of us."

","I saw this movie in theaters and really thought it was good. As for everyone who says filmmakers are only trying to ""milk the tragedy"" and make money off of it. Well yea...that would be the point of ALL movie making wouldn't it. I doubt directors and producers and writers think to themselves, ""Let's make a movie that will lose us a lot of money."" This is a story that does need to be told and it shouldn't matter if we wait 5 years or 50 years to tell it. As for people who think that the film only focuses on the two men and shows nothing of all the others that were lost...I'm sure they thought that viewers would have the mental capacity to keep in mind that while the film only focuses on two people, that many others were involved. It would be a bit hard to have a film that focused on 3000 people and really let you into their background like World Trade Center did. All in all I really thought this was a good movie and thought it really showed us the good things that happened that day, though there was little."

"ulalame","5","1","3","27 January 2007"," I'm a little stunned, frankly.
","I actually generally like Oliver Stone as a filmmaker, or at least give him some begrudging respect for taking on the political moments of our time. He did a good job with Platoon and Salvador, at minimum.<br/><br/>I think this film was a travesty, under the title of ""World Trade Center."" Although the film itself was really quite touching, in the sphere of the tragedy that it touched (i.e. the impact upon first responders, and the successful rescue of two of them), I think it demeaned the entire experience of everyone involved to title it ""World Trade Center,"" and I also think that, because of the title, and the notoriety of the director, that the ""take"" on the tragedy was made needlessly narrow.<br/><br/>Basically, Oliver Stone turned one of the tragedies of the ages into a movie of the week.<br/><br/>I'm thankful that the story of the men who gave their fortitude and courage was told to the public.<br/><br/>But otherwise, I found the basics of the movie lacking in a big way. It was NOT the story of the time, day, period, or otherwise. It gives no insight. It simply tells a story of heroism and rescue. You'd barely even know the context if the movie weren't titled ""World Trade Center,"" and that context doesn't really play into the telling of the rescue story.<br/><br/>I was disappointed in a major way. I think because I expected a broader story."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","1","3","26 January 2007"," A well made movie, that fails to really capture the mood and emotions of that fateful day.
","The movie sort of has the bad luck that ""United 93"" was the first major theatrical movie released, regarding 9/11, so of course these two movies immediately got compared to each other. ""United 93"" is a movie that is far superior in its emotions and in capturing the the mood and emotions of that day. It makes you relive 9/11. ""World Trade Center"" is a different movie, with a different approach, that is less powerful, though still powerful nevertheless, just in a different way. It's probably the reason why ""United 93"" got praised way more and ""World Trade Center"" got based way more, even though it of course is far from a bad movie. Just because it's different doesn't mean it's bad. I mean, it's not like every good movie about WW II is the same either.<br/><br/>The movie mostly lays its emphasis on the heroic aspects of 9/11. The sort of message of the movie is 'we'll overcome' and not 'this is our darkest hour'. Maybe America and Americans needed this sort of movie, to heal their wounds and handle their emotions, that are all still fresh, by showing, as weird and disrespectful as it might sound, the positive aspects of 9/11, by showing the individual heroism and how people were brought together through the events and including a 'happy' ending. The movie doesn't ever succeed in capturing the total chaos, confusing and desperation of that day, perhaps only the first few minutes of the movie. It doesn't make this movie the most powerful or relevant movies, regarding the subject, around and my hope is that later Hollywood movies shall succeed better in this, since it concerns a relevant, important subject, that should be continued to be lighted in future movies, to contribute to it that 9/11 shall never be forgotten.<br/><br/>Let's be fair, in essence this movie is a disaster movie, like so many were made of in the '70's. And lets face it, those movies just aren't the best ones around. My biggest fear was that ""World Trade Center"" would be just as sappy and over-the-top melodramatic in some of it's moments, like always in '70's also was the case. ""World Trade Center"" is definitely sappy and over-the-top melodramatic at times but not halve as bad as I had feared. Some of the sequence even work out effective. It are however the emotions of the story work out but not the emotions of 9/11 itself.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most amazing thing about the movie is that its directed by Oliver Stone. A man who normally likes to handle controversial and provocative subjects and throw in some conspiracy theories. It would had been very easy to put in conspiracy theories in this movie and if one man could do it, it would be him. ""World Trade Center"" however in now way ever gets predictable or question the actions of the authorities, or anything of that sort. As a matter of fact, if you'd told me this movie was directed by someone else, I would had believed it. Nothing in this movie indicates that this movie is directed by Oliver Stone. Also his trademark of fast cuts and high pace is not notable in this movie. The movie is very natural and mainstream. It also of course means that this movie is also perfectly watchable for his non-fans.<br/><br/>The time-line is pretty messed up. Hours go by in only on screen minutes time. The movie focuses entirely on 9/11 and the morning after but the movie doesn't ever give us the sense of time, also of course since it mostly is set underground, beneath the rubble of the collapsed tower. It however doesn't always make the story flow well and causes some drags.<br/><br/>It's a true story and that's really amazing. The story of the two men who got stuck alive beneath the rubble and life to tell the story is pretty amazing, considering how many lives were lost on 9/11 and how many actually survived from the rubble. Yet the movie also decides to put some more characters in the story, as if the two main characters already aren't interesting and in a way symbolic enough for that day. Of course it also focuses on their families, which makes sense but it also throws in some other 'heroic' characters in the movie, that we however never get to known, which make them and the plot lines around them pretty shallow and needless.<br/><br/>Not sure if Nicolas Cage was the right choice for the role. I mean he has never really played a dramatic or touching role in his career, though I'm definitely not a Nicolas Cage hater. I think a movie like this would had been better off with a completely unknown cast. It would had made it easier to identify yourself with them and would also had made the movie and story work out more realistic and powerful.<br/><br/>The effects of the movie are really good. The the impact and the all look extremely realistic and is amazingly well done, with lots of respect. So the movie doesn't try to impress with its visuals or make the impact and collapse look spectacular. As a matter of fact, the collapse of the towers isn't even shown on screen.<br/><br/>See this movie for how well made it is but don't see it for its emotions or for the emotional and touching impact it will make on you. For that, I recommend you watch ""United 93"" instead.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

One aspect of WTC that really got to me was the way Stone juxtaposed details of every day life with the stark horror of being trapped beneath the rubble. Also, the casting was over-the-top great. You could not ask for a more believable cast. I felt I was watching the actual families of those buried in the rubble of the WTC as they interacted in their homes to the ever-changing news about their loved ones.

","The movie is okay, though it does play fast and loose with the facts in the name of ""drama""; since Stone was just the hired hand on this one, I guess he wasn't motivated enough to worry about the accuracy of the script.<br/><br/>But the DVD is a bit of a let-down. Originally shot in 1.85:1 ratio, the DVD (commemorative edition, so-called) actually projects at about 1.66:1. Some of this is undoubtedly an overscan problem, but by no means all. What it means is that, on each shot, we are missing information on the sides, that is, it's been reformatted to look optimal on an HD monitor, without much regard for the actual aspect ratio. Too bad.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, there's also a little too much in the movie with the guys in the hole saying goodbye to their lives. I would have preferred more on the actual rescue itself, since in McLoughlin's case, it took something like 8-10 hours to actually get him out. Once again, however, and in spite of the huge audiences that TV shows about engineering get, the Hollywood producers have decided to dumb down the process, so that the average 11-year old will ""get it.""

Frustrated with what many saw as a total lack of that very perspective (coming from the conspiracy ridden, anti-government lens of Stone) many found World Trade Center to be nothing but a cinematic slushee, a predictable yarn to patriotism, some cinephiles even suggesting as an overt attempt to mend broken fences with many viewers after the epic financial failure that was Alexander. While this film for the most part does not display any of the traits we have come to know Mr. Stone for adhering to in the past, we are still given an uncompromising film in it's patriotic induced fervor placing, instead of paranoid theories, two fact-based accounts told straight from the officers and wives who went through some of the harshest ordeals during the attack.<br/><br/>The real life events, as shown through NYC port officers John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno, usher the viewer through an unparalleled view in and underneath all the vast chaos that had kept the world captivated to their television sets days on end. Played by Nic Cage and Michael Pena, these beat cops are given a loving tribute as the microcosm to the thousands of good city workers who fought through this disaster, and the few who unflinchingly ran into the heart of darkness, as if only driven by instinct to protect a fellow human despite the surmounting odds against their favor. Basically it is this emotional sentiment which, lingering in all the haunting imagery captured for this film, overrides any overt exploitation or apathetic conflict that more cynical viewers have complained about. There are moments in the film that I would imagine would be entirely too hard for many people directly associated with September 11th to watch; Stone wastes no time carving out the cinematic vision he saw taking place for these two officer's lives that day. While there are numerous examples of how he might have gone too far and dramatized the reality of that day in a way that would be insensitive or uncomfortable to the relatives of any victims involved, this overall cathartic triumph of human spirit ultimately wins out, in turn prompting some of Stone's most focused direction in many moons.<br/><br/>I've never had the urge to rag on Nicolas Cage, it has been a pleasure seeing him evolve his craft over the years, but where that evolution ended seems to be apparent, replacing genuine character acting with the wide-eyed, over-eager line delivery he has indulged in so much lately. Here, although playing most of the time as low key and subdued as anything he has ever attempted, I still only saw this character as Mr. Cage with a uniform on top, unlike the lesser known Pena, who perhaps due to that very obscurity, gets away with playing a cop more authentically. For this genuine love letter to NYC and the American soul that the movie aspires to be, it was a tad disheartening to see this main role outsourced for star power, rather then playing it more realistically low-key in the spirit of all of these average-joe city workers, of which the eccentric star actor has a difficult time even pretending to be. Only distraught housewife Maggie Gyllenhaal, in all of her beautiful flights of insanity, justified the star recognition for her perceptive performance. Despite the many small factors that prevented the film from becoming the definitive classic that it may have been striving for, WTC details the twin tower's collapse more passionately then anything we will probably see for quite some time, making it the definitive 9/11 film experience for less ashamed moviegoers."
"Pavel-8","7","1","3","9 December 2006"," It's not United 93, but it's not bad.
","Movies about September 11th, 2001, are not easy to watch, nor are they easy to review. On a lesser scale, they are this generation's equivalent of Tom Brokaw's Greatest Generation watching World War II films. I remember my grandpa discussing ""Saving Private Ryan"", and he was always hesitantly uncomfortable, acknowledging that it was a well done, but he didn't enjoy it much. In a like vein, the fact that its viewers lived through the described day both abets and ails ""World Trade Center"", Oliver Stone's emotional story about two emergency workers trapped in the rubble of the twin towers.<br/><br/>Speaking of ""Ryan"", ""WTC"" also faces the same quandary as ""A Thin Red Line"", in that it follows a similarly themed movie that might be the year's best film, ""United 93"". Like ""Line"", ""WTC"" differs widely from its chronological predecessor even though the general subject material is the same. Though set at Guadalcanal, ""Line"" wasn't really about war, while ""Ryan"" was precisely about the horrors of war. ""United 93"" told a story from a primarily objective standpoint, allowing the audience's own genuine emotions to affect their viewing experience. Differently, WTC is about specific experiences on 9/11, looking to share the feelings of a the trapped officers and their left-in-limbo families. Those people certainly have their moments of primal emotion that can only stem from situations of life and death. The most touching ones spring from the family members left on the outside, forced to wait and wonder. For whatever reason, imagining the loss or endangerment of loved ones is more potent than imagining one's own physical danger, and the portrayal of that blistering boredom cuts to the quick of anybody with a heart.<br/><br/>As soul-wrenching as these events are, and despite the fact that they are true, they still feel like movie moments. Strong and good movie moments, yes, but even the best of those cannot match someone's personal feelings from that day, feelings created by actually being there. Make no mistake, the movie is very well made. Although Oliver Stone did direct it, none of his trademarks are present here. There is no kinetic editing (""JFK""); there are no flashy visuals (""Any Given Sunday""); there is no agenda of any kind (""Platoon""). Were his direction not so publicized, one would have no idea of his involvement. He wisely lets the story tell itself, using a straightforward story-telling method that gently weaves together the disparate experiences of the two men and their families.<br/><br/>Perhaps I erred in seeing this on September 11th, after a day spent reliving my own emotions and those of actual people who were there on that day. ""World Trade Center"" is a good movie that contains raw human emotion more powerful than most put on screen. But even that drama simply cannot match what we personally experienced when living through that day, regardless of the dire circumstances. That makes the movie less compelling than it should be.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Better drama than most, but missing an extra dose of passion to push it to the next level. 7 of 10."
"connask8","2","1","3","1 December 2006"," The movie focuses on 2 men and their families than wtc
","I didn't like it. I give 2 because at some point begins well. They focus on 2 men and their families affected by the tragedy. They should had make it like Titanic, minute by minute before, at the time and after the collision for all WTC buildings. Hollywood spends money and time making movies with spaceships and aliens with many effects, and can't make a film based on reality? I had spent many hours looking around the internet for witnesses stories and i have found many things, such as: the jet fuel went into the elevator shafts causing explosions on lobby level, many people killed into the elevators because they had installed door restrictors on the elevator doors and the people trapped inside until the towers collapsed, the explosion was so strong and marbles felled down in the concourse level, warden telephones were activated on floors 64,71,73,93,74,(tower 2), the fire alarm system indicated at many floors fire and trouble, and many other details which i believed that they will show them to the movie and they did nothing. If Hollywood use all these witnesses details could make an awesome movie. Go to this Url and see, its interesting, the presentation about 11 September of USA Today and its thousands times better than this movie... http://www.usatoday.com/graphics/news/gra/wtc2002/flash.htm and this is about elevators: http://www.usatoday.com/news/sept11/2002-09-04-elevator-usat_x.htm<br/><br/>I had fount about fire alarms but I've lost the URLs. If you check YouTube you gonna find videos inside wtc when collapses.<br/><br/>I hope that they gonna produce a better movie about wtc."
"shade-22","3","1","3","27 November 2006"," Thoroughly normal emotional porn.
","Nothing special - well-wrought piece of emotional pornography. Sure to get the inner patriot going (if you have one) and certainly effective in making us emphasize with the victims. But for all the effective sound effects and insistent focusing on faces and flashbacks of family life, the movie is ultimately empty. There is no great story, no truly interesting characters and no great theme other than a Hallmark comment on how America ""stood together"". The film wants nothing more than to show us how bad it was for these people and probably succeeds in making many Americans revisit the confusion and emotions of the first days after the attack. A great chance to say something about the actual attacks or the reaction has been wasted, the film says nothing and thematises nothing, it just shows the horror. All in all, it feels like a TV movie writ large."
"visualmagic","8","1","3","23 November 2006"," Recommended viewing for those who need to see...
","Let me start by saying that I am a cynical son of a gun, for want of a better euphemism. I am also an Aussie, so was fairly detached from 9/11. Not that detached that the whole of Australia barely worked that day, and the TV was going in full force. The impact was none the less huge, even here. This movie to me was clichéd, yes, was Hollywood, yes, was the closest thing I have seen to an accurate depiction of the events surrounding a small bubble of actual event, also yes. I have seen a lot of negative reviews of this movie, but Oliver Stone was always going to cop a curve ball, prepared though he surely was. Touching nerves is a good thing though, and I feel strongly after seeing this movie, that the ordeal suffered by the world on that day, has been stylized effectively in one of many storytelling facets. In actuality I cried. There you have it. I'm a cynic, an Aussie, not a sentimentalist, or a Nic Cage fan per se, (although a mate of my mates buys swords with him at Japanese auctions, and assures me he's a sound bloke), and yet, I learned something. I heard that on that same day that a natural disaster caused many more deaths in India on that same weekend, and for years I threw that into a verbal battle, but there is an inherent sadness in terrorist aftermath, an unjust heaving of the soul that although is equal in grief to the death of any loved one, is, on another level, amplified by the decisive hate of those who are taught to destroy western culture. Not to enter into a debate on religious creed, and staying with the movie, I enjoyed it, clichés aside, and feel that the uber-cynics should either avoid this movie, or accept its foibles without casting slings and arrows at an otherwise above average attempt to share a moment in shared history that has ultimately brought us closer as a world audience amongst the hurt. As a footnote, those who feel Oliver Stone has capitalized on this event may wish to look at most of his past films. This is a man who has a track record for factually documenting many events in history, and it would be awry in my opinion to cast aspersions on this most recent attempt which is clearly no different."

","I am going to keep this short and sweet. I feel this needs to be seen by many across the world, just to get in the minds of those family members having to wait for either that good call or bad call, the one that could change their lives forever. As well the journey of two men and all the courage that is needed to survive that kind of situation they find themselves. Overall an excellent tribute. Nicholas Cage is the perfect actor, and portrays his character to perfection. Really give this one a look. Surely a tear jerker. But a way to get everyone to remember everything positive and negative on that day<br/><br/>God Rest the souls of those who lost their lives on 9/11"
"rhyshovey-1","Null","1","3","24 October 2006"," you watch for the laser pointer, I'll open the Window
","I wish that I could say that I saw this movie, but it was one of the only movies that I can remember going to and coming out not seeing any of, almost literally. I remember being down by the paramount on melrose and seeing ""world trade center"" and then seeing Oliver Stone, I was exicted. Platoon makes its way into my DVD player, probably more than anything, it just comforts my soul for some reason, especially the parts in the bunker. Nicholas cage and Maria B are also actors I like. Nicholas Cage's diversity is impresive, I laugh when I imagine the casting for ""Ghost Rider"". Maria Bello, I've only ever watched her in secret window, and I must confess I was just busy thinking about how pretty she was. When I saw WTC I had'nt been to sleep in almost 1.5 weeks and may have been urinated on, and I was running to the ARcLight theatre out of fear of going home. I found myself hearing laughter when people were crying.http://74.106.224.202:8080/rhys/index.htm"
"Puckman751","5","1","3","17 October 2006"," Not What It Could've Been
","In my mind, World Trade Center needed to be good. It was coming out only a few months after United 93 came out and there was no way not to compare the two films. Though World Trade Center was a big hit overseas, you can't say the same for it's success in the US. Nicholas Cage plays John McLoughlin who was one of the police officers who went into one of the towers and tried to help to evacuate the building. As the towers fall, McLoughlin, Will Jimeno (played by Micheal Pena)and Dominick Pezzulo (Jay Hernandez)are trapped a good 20 feet under the fallen rubble. Unable to move, they must come together and help each other stay alive. The story also focuses on the families of the men. Mario Bello (Donna McLoughlin) and Maggie Gyllenhaal (Allison Jimeno) play the men wives. Both women do an outstanding job in their part, especially Bello.<br/><br/>I was disappointed by the film. It was, at times, moving but it really slowed down in some parts. Cage and Pena do all they can with the writing while Bello and Gyllenhaal created their own element. I think the big thing that will ruin this film for people is that you know the outcome of the story. Instead of being on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen to the families, you find yourself casually slumped in your chair, already knowing the outcome. Overall, I didn't find the film as inspiring as it could have been and wished I had waited for the DVD release."
"stephannie1","9","1","3","2 October 2006"," great film
","When i went to see this film, i went unsure what to expect. Its a touching subject to turn into film but Oliver Stone did the story of the two policemen justice. Its a touching storyline that plays on the emotion of the audience just minutes into the film. It is not a film full of action packed stunts but the portrayal of two policemen bonding and most of all, keeping each other alive during their dreadful experience. Full of flash backs the emotion of the situation builds as we see the families struggle to cope with the unknown. Unaware to where their loved ones are and whether they are alive and the reunion is one of the most touching parts of the movie. Nicholas Cage is at his best portraying John McGloughlin, a police officer trapped in the rubble. The best choice for the role. I advise everyone who hasn't already seen kit, to see it."
"IRateFilms","7","1","3","28 August 2006"," Stone is definitely back....
","Oliver Stone's newest endeavor, World Trade Center, has turned out to be a success. Although there was no controversy in this film, as there is surrounding the events of September 11th, Stone does portray the event with immeasurable authenticity. Oliver Stone can make a conventional film as he clearly depicts the events of September 11th sans his overused guerrilla style. The film cuts back and forth between Nicolas Cage, stuck in a copious amount of debris, and his family. Although Cage does not move for almost 80% of the film, he turns in one of his most genuine performances. The film was extremely heartfelt and very difficult to view for a native new yorker. There is a certain attachment to the emotional volcano that erupts several times throughout the film, that new yorkers have. Strangely enough, during the screening i was in, there were some youngsters talking on there cell phones. Someone complained and after a short confrontation the children were removed by police. As the children were escorted out of the theater a loud applaud could be heard from the theater guests. Not only did September 11th bring new yorkers together more than ever before, but the film recalling its events brought together the audience. I sincerely hope that this film revisits, and opens peoples eyes up to the fact that everyone can be friendly in a time of emergency. I just hope that one day we can all be friendly even when its not an emergency."
"geophyrd","8","1","3","28 August 2006"," Stone got it right for a change
","Before I review the film, understand that 9/11 wasn't something I experienced at a distance. I was in the WTC ten minutes before the first plane hit. When it hit, I was in my office right across the street. When the buildings came down, they ripped the windows off my entire building. My building was close enough that our ground floor level served as the morgue for the site. It was One Liberty. You can take a look and you'll be surprised how close. Wierdly, if you are into movies, when you watch The Siege with Bruce Willis, its our building that got the car bomb.<br/><br/>When the first plane hit, the building security told everyone to get to the other side of the building until further notice. When the second plane hit, I told our staff to get out. Go down the stairs, not the elevators, young ones help the old ones. I helped our last two older employees down 18 flights of stairs after locking the office. Not that locking mattered. Everything not nailed down that was worth anything was stolen within a few days anyway.<br/><br/>Down on the street, I stood in a crowd of thousands and watched several dozen people jump to their deaths. Everyone was crying. It never occurred to me that the buildings were going to come down. My impression was that it was a heck of a mess and I couldn't see how they were going to put out the fires. My instinct was to run to help. But I had a six month old and I stayed with our employees until I could convince them all to leave. Then I left. I'm not proud of that fact, but I also know that if I had gone to help, I'd be dead now. Two people who were debating doing the same thing with me died less than forty five minutes later.<br/><br/>In subsequent days, I was at Ground Zero many times, all related to work. No one went there for curiosity, not after the first time.<br/><br/>It smelled. The air was toxic. You could smell poison in the wind and the air was claustrophobic. They say that soldiers on the battlefield know the least about what's happening and that day, I can confirm it. There were rumors everywhere, that NY Downtown Hospital had been hit, that the White House had been bombed. I heard someone tell me that there had been assassinations. Everyone was confused because no one had the whole story. Not yet.<br/><br/>I'm not sure we still have it all. But that someone's plan involved the successful highjacking of four planes simultaneously...that sounds a little too ambitious to actually work.<br/><br/>I titled my review, ""Oliver Stone got it right for a change."" He really did. I've had a troubled relationship with Stone's movies in the past. He's a terrific filmmaker and its usually his lesser movies that get my attention. Platoon was good, but I'm not sure I've seen the definitive Vietnam movie yet. I think Platoon was more about war mythos than about the war itself. Maybe the best movie about the war was Born on the Fourth of July, but that was a Stone picture too. JFK was fun, but he admitted making up parts out of NOTHING. The Doors was an interesting character study, but I don't think for a moment that Val Kilmer was channelling Jim Morrisson. Alexander was horrible.<br/><br/>Having said that, Natural Born Killers, Salvador, Wall Street and U-Turn were excellent. Pure stories with the right balance of surrealism/realism, politics and drama. They told great stories in interesting ways.<br/><br/>Stone turns off the tricks here. The only trick on display is someone telling a human story amidst events so large that they dwarf everything else.<br/><br/>That day, it was what it was like. No one's story was big enough to notice on 9/11. The stories that made up the pastiche of the people's occurrences that day, they all melded into one big pot. That the pot is the collection of the stories, that is why I think America, as melting pot, is such a target for the terrorists. I believe they hate that we can pull off disparate views with such grace and elegance and Stone's movie makes a human story of an inhuman event.<br/><br/>I have trouble judging WTC as a movie. I think every actor did a fine job, particularly Nicholas Cage. The script was good, the effects perfect. Stone doesn't show the explosions but, after all, what would seeing them add to the human story.<br/><br/>But Stone's made me sit up and take notice. As much as I dislike some of his movies, I will always go see the new Oliver Stone film. Even when they don't work, they do it in the most interesting ways.<br/><br/>World Trade Center is the kind of movie if you wonder what it was like to be down there, at Ground Zero when the attacks came. Then it goes inside and we see the valiant efforts of men working to save lives.<br/><br/>Good movie and I will see it again"

","""World Trade Center"" depicts the genuinely moving, true account of two Port Authority police officers who were the 18th and 19th of 20 persons rescued from the massive wreckage of the World Trade Center.<br/><br/>The two officers, John McLoughlin and William Jimeno, had themselves, not a day earlier, volunteered for the difficult task of evacuating the towers after they had been hit in the terrorist attack of 9-11.<br/><br/>They were rescued by two men, at least one of whom was an ex-Marine who, without any prodding except that from their own consciences, reported to the WTC site, and, risking their own lives, searched the still smoking and burning, jagged wreckage for survivors.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage is breathtaking as McLoughlin. In his early scenes, he is so focused on his job as a no-nonsense sergeant that his eyes are like lasers. Later, when he is shot lying helplessly under the weight of the fallen towers, his face covered with ash and pulverized concrete, his mouth full of dust, Cage still gives an amazing performance.<br/><br/>Maria Bello, as his wife Donna, is quiet and yet riveting.<br/><br/>The only performance in the movie that stood out for its inadequacy is that of Maggie Gyllenhaal as Allison Jimeno. Maggie Gyllenhaal is not a working class Italian woman from New Jersey, and she can't act in a way that convinces you that she is one. But she was easy to overlook, given the high quality of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>There are strong early scenes depicting the officers' morning before the attack. Given what the audience knows will soon happen, these scenes are very poignant.<br/><br/>The attacks themselves, and the buildings' collapse, are depicted in a convincing way that doesn't milk the scenes for a sensationalistic, disaster movie effect.<br/><br/>Jimeno and McLaughlin's coffin-like, or, actually, torture-like conditions under the rubble are depicted graphically.<br/><br/>The claustrophobia these scenes might cause is relieved, a bit, by flashbacks and intercuts with the families' waiting for news and trying to cope.<br/><br/>I cried almost throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>Having said that ... I have to say that this wasn't quite the movie I had hoped it might be. September 11 was a huge event, and it deserves a movie that takes some risks.<br/><br/>So much of 9-11 exists on film already. Millions watched it in real time as it took place on TV. We've all seen or read interviews of the incredible heroism that flourished after the attacks; some of us know volunteers who have told us their own stories. A filmmaker has to ask him or herself, what can I add to the viewer's store of knowledge about this event? PBS broadcast a documentary entitled ""Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero"" that remains, for me, the most worthy treatment of 9-11 on film that I have seen.<br/><br/>Overall, though, ""World Trade Center"" is a moving, inspiring, dignified treatment that honors truly heroic men and the best in humanity. If only more films could make such claims."

","The second I saw the previews for ""World Trade Center"", I wanted to see it. The 9/11 attacks as said in the commercial is the defining moment for this generation. I was young when I saw the images of the South tower falling in school. I didn't fully understand the attacks, heck, I wished the news would stop airing 24/7 after the attacks so I could get back to watching my shows.<br/><br/>""World Trade Center"" was an attempt for me to understand what happened. I went on August 11th because it was one month until the five year anniversary of the attacks, I thought it would be a fitting tribute. I went into the theater, which was jam-packed, thinking that if I didn't cry during the movie, I was messed up.<br/><br/>I didn't cry. My friend, who cries at everything, didn't cry. Why? Because we were too caught up in the movie to think about how we were feeling. Only afterwords did we break down crying. This was a tough movie to watch, there were times when I wished the movie, which was switching between the wives' story and the survivors', that it would go to the wives' story because it was too painful to watch these men were going through.<br/><br/>I think this movie is a must-see. There were parts where you have to remind yourself, 'they survive, they survive', but you start to doubt that when you watch it. It's a gripping movie that has you holding your breath. These actors and actresses did an amazing job, I can't think of anyone else to be these people. I'm just waiting for the Oscar Nominations to roll in."

","I was not sure if I wanted to see this movie because I could not figure out how this most tragic day that changed the world could be captured without a bunch of bodies being strewn all over the place. I just couldn't see it. But i was coerced into going to watch it with my cousin, and this piece of work by Oliver Stone was Sheer Brilliance. I am not an American but I am a member of the human race and what happened on that dreadful day, cannot happen again. Oliver Stone's heart was obviously in this film - just in the way he made us love and empathize with those characters stuck under the rubble, and made us want to hold their families and tell them no to worry because we knew their loved ones were still alive and where they were; and the way that although we celebrated when these two heroes were found, there were still all of those other people who were missing, whose families would continue on that worrisome and formidable trek because their loved ones were either missing or dead. I mean, Mr. Stone turned the events of Sept. 11 into something so beautiful and I 'll go and watch this movie again. I feel like I have to. I am not a proponent of war but for Jesus' sake, I understand why Bush went to war. I have a deeper respect for the US military arm because I understand now what they are fighting for. I say Go Bush! and Beat The Pants Of Dem Heffas!!!! Americans can call it ""oil"" all they want.....but something like what happened on September 11 Cannot happen again. It just can't. It not only crippled a nation, but the world was crippled for some time. But Oliver Stone, I wish I could meet you in person. This Was Pure Genius!! Sheer Genius!! No-one else but You could have done this without leaving any stone unturned and with such sensitivity to the issue and with such heart. I urge everyone if they get the chance to just go and see this movie...it will surprise you. It's not at all what I thought it would be, but it totally surpassed all my expectations. It is truly worth ten stars!!! Only the ignorant people could have rated this movie a ""1""."

Just a moving story about courage in the face of one of America's darkest days. All the performances are well done (yes a horrible accent that came and went by Nic Cage). Visually moving and tragic. Being a native New Yorker my heart was broken again watching this film. Worth the money to see. Just be prepared to have emotions that you thought were gone resurface and the scrolling names of the fallen Port Authority personnel is particularly hard to watch and I am one of the few New Yorkers who did not have a personal connection with anyone killed that day.

","This movie will motivate you to live your life in a meaningful way. This is one of the rare movies that I would remember, especially in my adverse conditions. Because it taught me how to face the reality. Though as human beings, we are not aware of our abilities to cope up with the adverse situations, one can really make out how powerful we can be, (especially in those tough time) after watching this movie. We can get into such terrible situations that we could never dream in our wildest dreams. But with the grace of God and good wishes of our family members, we can get away with it; this concept was perfectly picturized very gracefully in the movie. <br/><br/>The brilliant work of the director Mr.Stone was worth appreciating. I just want to congratulate him for choosing such an inspiring story for the movie. The effect of the movie is so intense, not because of 9-11, but of the strong message that it's sending to the society. After watching the negativities in the daily news and also in violent movies, human brains are pretty much drained out. But, this brilliant piece of art has all the ingredients that would fill the audience's mind with a sense of humanity, hope and sanity. <br/><br/>This is a must watch movie for everybody, not just for Americans. Anyone can get into a situation like this in any part of the world. I have watched it once and want to watch it again.<br/><br/>What I learned from the movie is ""Life is not all about sex and money, but its about duties and responsibilities"". What keeps us alive is our responsibilities towards the family, society and the world that we live in and what keeps us alive after death is our honest effort to perform the duties. OK, this deep thoughts came to my mind after watching this movie. Can't help it, it forced me to think such things that I haven't thought in a long time. Good to know there is little sanity and goodness still left in this world."

You develop a deep emotional connection. The sounds, they are perfect in every way.

","Those who say the American people aren't ready for a ""9/11"" movie are, in my mind, either simply wrong, or perhaps overly committed to some sort of epiphany they may have experienced in the aftermath of the WTC attack half a decade ago. Five years is a long time, certainly more than enough to get over the ""shock and awe"" that was unleashed by Islamic terrorists upon the American mainland. Perhaps it has to do with a perceived failure to exact revenge, a lack of closure to the experience via righteous retaliation. Perhaps unconsciously we're aware that the temporary disruption of the Taliban in Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq have not given us that relief, certainly not in any tangible way, and has in fact possibly contributed to an increased animosity in the world toward the United States and a worsening of the always volatile situation in the Middle East.<br/><br/>The truth is, though, that Oliver Stone's ""World Trade Center"" isn't about the attack per se. It's about the indomitability of the human spirit and its will to survive. It's a disaster movie set in the rubble of two gigantic towers that collapsed.<br/><br/>Stone fans (and haters) will be taken aback as they realize that ""World Trade Center"" is NOT a typical Oliver Stone film. There are no conspiracy theories contained within. There's very little in the way of quirky film technique or over-the-top acting or splintered storytelling. There's no anti-establishment rhetoric or sentiment. In fact, ""World Trade Center"" goes out of its way to avoid these very things.<br/><br/>What you will get is a well-crafted story scripted by a relative newcomer, Andrea Berloff, concerning the fate of two New York Port Authority policemen, John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Peña), who were trapped under the ruins of the two towers. Their claustrophobic dilemma is juxtaposed against the effects of this misfortune upon their respective families and the efforts of the selfless many who labored to rescue them. That these two men actually lived through the collapse was miraculous in and of itself; that they survived long enough to be rescued beggars the imagination, especially when you consider that they were essentially found via sheer serendipity in the form of a driven ex-Marine (played with perhaps too much iconic resolve and fortitude by Michael Shannon) randomly searching through the rubble for survivors.<br/><br/>Some will not be satisfied with Stone and Berloff's effort to put a dramatic human face on the horrific events of September 11, 2001. Some will resent the inherent profit motive of film-making. Some will simply not wish to be reminded of that dark day, ostrich-like as that may be. I have no easy answer for any of them, other than to remind them that they are free to not see the film. There are still many of us who are not afraid to relive the emotional experiences we underwent five years ago, who are willing to engage ourselves in the catharsis that this film provides. It's a part of the healing process, and as far as I'm concerned, something like that can never start ""too soon."" At any rate, ""World Trade Center"" cannot be faulted on any significant technical grounds. The acting is faultless, with the possible exception of Cage's NY accent, which really didn't bother me all that much; all four of the leads--including the always impressive Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal as the distraught wives--fully deserve award nominations. Seamus McGarvey's cinematography is superb, the production design, art design, costuming, and so on are uniformly excellent; one feels as if they're right there at the scene. Craig Armstrong's music is at times heavy-handed, but invariably serves its purpose. The sound design is particularly effective, especially when the towers collapse; if that doesn't generate an Oscar nomination at the very least, I don't know what will. <br/><br/>Most pointedly, this is a film that, despite its horrific subject matter, manages to effectively illustrate a characteristic of human beings that belies the baser motives of the perpetrators of the attack: we have the ability to band together to surmount our difficulties, no matter how horrendous, and come out on top, unbowed, ready to move on against all odds. I find it hard to knock a movie that will tell me that, and do it with a relative minimum of schmaltz. Say what you will about Stone ""selling out"" or compromising his reputation and values, ""World Trade Center"" is a powerful piece of film-making that, in my opinion, ought to be seen by everyone with the emotional strength to watch it.<br/><br/>1/19/07 addendum: Having recently seen and reviewed ""United 93,"" I thought it worthwhile to return here. I note with interest that IMDb'ers gave ""World Trade Center"" a much lower percentage of ""10"" ratings, though still a healthy 19.4%, as well as a significant ""1"" rating of 11%, which I attribute to A) a strong anti-Stone sentiment, and B) unfair comparison to relatively undramatic, documentary style of ""United 93."" Also interesting is the cumulative ""7.6"" from 204 under-18 females, the highest rating cohort apart from the IMDb staff. One could probably write a thesis on the whys and wherefores of such voting.<br/><br/>I'm also amused to see that only one reader (so far) has found my comments to be ""useful."" I can only wonder how much this reflects a dislike of my politics as revealed, and how much it reveals the possible poverty of my writing. Another thesis, anyone?"

","I have heard many people say that it is too soon for a film depicting the events of September 11th, however, I believe this is a film that every American should see, even if they believe 9/11 was a government conspiracy. The film definitely put the events of that tragic day into a better perspective for me, I really felt as though I was there experiencing it first hand. I remember the last time I saw the World Trade Centers, it was two weeks before the attack...at that time I would have never imagined the events that would unfold on that beautiful Tuesday, and seeing this movie brought back all of the feelings I had on that day. It was a perfect portrayal of how unexpected the attack was...everyone was just going about their daily lives and when it actually happened they were all extremely confused about the situation and there was no clear explanation of what exactly happened, and worst of all, there was no plan to deal with it. This film portrays that very accurately, however, it does not focus on it entirely...it is more of a story of hope during that tragic time and I truly feel that every American should see it, regardless of their views about the war in Iraq or President Bush because that's not what it's about at all. It really is an excellent film, Oliver Stones did an outstanding job! I believe this movie will be the best made about this tragedy because of the fact that it does not entirely focus on the attack itself...it focuses on heroes and how much they risked that day. After seeing this movie I now realize just how much the rescue workers and volunteers risked in the hope to save others. They did not for one second hesitate about going in to save McLaughlin and Jimeno, even though they were buried under 20+ feet of ruble. Oliver Stone did a FANTASTIC job portraying heroism at it's finest on such a horrible day. One piece of advice: take plenty of tissues with you!!!"

","It has been six years since the disasters struck our soil. I happen to think of it every day. I know partly what it is like being in a skyscraper and having to face things like being stuck w/o a way out of a fire. I don't know if anyone remembers back in the 1980's a hotel fire in Las Vegas, NV at a hotel called MGM Grand. But I was vacationing with my parents and we heard this awful explosion and we were thrown to the floor. We escaped, but we were on the 24th floor of the hotel room part. It was smoky & scary for me then.<br/><br/>But this review is about World Trade Center. When I first heard Nick Cage was playing the part, I had dual thoughts; I'd see it because he was in it and at the same time did I want to cry my eyes out like I did when I watched Titanic? After waiting for the DVD to come out, I sat here on my computer and watched it.<br/><br/>I can understand the points of view from the survivors and from those two officers that were caught in the rubble. I also liked the fact of the DVD having the interview with the actual 2 officers. Cage does look like the one guy.<br/><br/>In the years since, a lot of patriotism has faded due in part to the ongoing war in Iraq. But when Flight 93 and this movie were created, it kind of can help put closure on things. But I think they should try to make a movie from inside the Pentagon's perspective. That's the only part of this sage that is missing.<br/><br/>It was not over-done. If anyone looks closely at the movie, like for example, some of the news footage is the actual stuff from what I can tell.<br/><br/>If anyone has not seen this movie, please do. It is very well done in my opinion. It sets into your mind what it is like knowing that everything you take for granted, including your loved ones, is given to you to hold dearly.<br/><br/>God Bless!"
"Austin_Powers-1","8","1","4","10 September 2007"," Two good cops, one bad situation
","This is the second film released in 2006 about the attack on America on September 11th, 2001. The film is based on the true personal story of two real life cops, who got trapped beneath the ruins the day World Trade Center was destroyed, and what a story! It is a story about the will to survive and about helping each other in difficult times. It could very easily have become a story which was all too ""Hollywood"", but the maestro Oliver Stone has made a film which catches you emotionally from the first moment. It opens with a beautiful picturing of how New York woke up on an ordinary day, which turned into a nightmare.<br/><br/>The film as a story is emotionally strong, but the film as a film doesn't turn out as well as UNITED 93. WORLD TRADE CENTER is more a ""search and find"" film just using 9/11 as starting point; after 30 minutes focus moves completely from the attack itself to the after-effects. But it doesn't make the film boring or bad; thinking of 9/11 and the true tragic incident of the two cops just makes the experience even stronger."

This is a story I will not soon forget.<br/><br/>I have to say that I honestly only watched it to see Maria Bello, whom I love, but I was really touched by the story and the acting of those I mentioned. They, especially Michael Peña did an outstanding job.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone is to be commended for his work on this film."

","When I first heard about this movie, I immediately wanted to see it. I saw it in a theater with my dad. I had heard a lot of good stuff about this film and was wanting to see if it lived up to the reviews. It did in my opinion. The actors did an excellent job of portraying how the lives of the people were affected by 9/11. It does a great job of showing how people were able to come together and work as one to recover from this disaster. Seeing this has gotten me to think differently about 9/11 and the people who were affected by it.<br/><br/>Everybody has to see this as a reminder of why we are fighting the terrorists."

","As I sat in the theatre near my home I looked around me. Some woman had already been in tear's. The movie hadn't started yet. I was wondering why she was in tear's. I shrugged this thought off and went to go buy some poprcorn, while at the stand I saw her daughter, now this probably was one of the most important moment's of my life. I asked her this. ''Why was your mom in tear's?''. ''She lost everything in 9/11. Her husband, my father, our life.'' Already I knew. I was going to cry during this movie.<br/><br/>So. The lights dimmed and the movie started. As much from telling from the previews it's about two men trapped under the World Trade Center. Now this movie was hailed as ''Too Soon'' and I'm going to have to agree. From a larger scale this movie was the best Oliver Stone picture he's done. With his awful portrayal of Alexander I was skeptical about this film and not all too happy to see it. What I loved about this film was the sense of knowing these guys were going to make it. Oliver Stone usually put's his two cent's in with every movie, whether it's political or not.<br/><br/>See It."
"kennyevans","3","1","4","10 March 2007"," A big budget bum of a movie
","Right away, this film is too soon after the event, too sensitive and politically straight-jacketed to be able to give a proper objective take on the subject matter.<br/><br/>The first few scenes/minutes of the film seemed incredibly stilted, with the actors not really knowing what they should be doing, let alone portraying characters who didn't know what they were supposed to be doing. Nicholas cage tells everyone to focus, whilst at the same time loading up a large trolley with about 300 kilos of equipment in a building where there are no lifts! There didn't seem to be the environment of emergency when the guys were wandering around the foot of the towers. You could see chaos but it seemed to be a long way away and they seemed detached from it. Maybe this was intentional but it did take away some of the drama of the first 15 minutes of the film. Just as soon as some action started, action that you knew was just around the corner and palpable, the film seemed to come to a standstill.<br/><br/>Of course trying to act your arse off whilst lying down, barely visible and covered in tons of material is tough. The acting though I don't think was in question except possibly for Cage's typically American gung ho statements whilst he rallied his half dead troops. It seemed to me that the whole film could have been 40 minutes shorter, a lot of the banter was just painting by numbers: the obvious longing for their partners, visions of times gone by etc. It was all very predictable and offered nothing new on that front.<br/><br/>Whilst not quite as saccharine as Pearl Harbour, there was that Americanisation of the subject that painted everyone in some kind of heroic light, from the main characters right down to the children, ready to drive into ground zero and start digging. It was over egged in my opinion.<br/><br/>They prayed to God yet did no one consider the possibility that it would have been easier for God to have flipped the terrorists wrist and cause the plane to crash into New York harbour than to see 3000 die and a handful live? Whilst they are constantly praying to the same God to save them. Was God having a huge joke with the Americans that day? Do Americans think they have a Monopoly on Gods actions for the good of their own patriotic humanity? A huge quandary ignored by the scriptwriters.<br/><br/>There was much about the event I felt should have been included that would have added more weight, yet avoided schmaltz. Not least a tip of the hat to the many that didn't get a positive outcome that day. The CGI was seamless, it could have been shot on the day it was that realistic. However, I couldn't help but think the whole thing was just missing something and as I said, felt like it was treading on eggshells regarding the real horrors of the events.<br/><br/>I couldn't say I enjoyed the movie. Let's let someone else have a proper go when the wounds have healed and the conspiracy theories have died down."
"schultzclan6","6","1","4","3 March 2007"," A little bit disappointed with this movie
","9/11. We all know the horrible tragedy that showed up on our TV screens. We all felt, even if we didn't lose anybody, like a part of ourselves had been ripped out. The traumatic effects of 9/11 left us all emotionally scarred, but we move on. And sometimes we remember. Our favorite way of remembering something is through a movie. So here we have World Trade Center: giving us the story of 2 men who get caught in the rubble of the Twin Towers, fighting with every breath for their own lives.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie is not as good as I have already made it sound. It's not because we got Nicholas Cage in the film, as everybody complains. As a matter of fact, I think he did OK with such a delicate part. And the other guy buried in the rubble with him was phenomenal. It's the writing and timing that completely wrecked the film.<br/><br/>The movie opens with these 2 guys regular lives, and fifteen minutes, the Twin Towers have been hit. A little too soon; we needed to know our characters a little better. Anyway, the guys walk in to the building LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED. I repeat, the men walked around LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED. There in a building full of panicked, bleeding people, and they actually make a couple of jokes AS THEY WALK through the building. I was so stunned by the fact that these men did not run through the building trying to help. This goes on for a frustrating ten minutes. The towers collapse.<br/><br/>At this point, I would like to let you know that I thought my father died. My father did not work in WTC, but he still worked in Manhattan, and he still hadn't called us, and we couldn't get through. I felt a burning sensation in my heart, and I remember crying my eyeballs dry, thinking my father was dead. That was so emotional for me.<br/><br/>So like I said, the towers collapsed. The two men spend about an hour and a half of film time under the rubble. We also have clips of their families panicking. One of the families, I can't remember which, was frustrating beyond words. I was really hoping that that idiot kid would drive to Manhattan and die in the rubble, because all he did was scream at his mother. There is also an over-the-top military man who finally saves these two men. We see them in the hospital, and what you see is a bit intense. Then the movie ends about 3 minutes later.<br/><br/>The only part that kept my jaw dropped was everything that happened before the men entered the WTC. After that, the emotional effects of 9/11 that I had felt that day rubbed off. The movie ended, with the only positive thing coming out after that point was the phenomenal actor.<br/><br/>Part of remembering traumatic events like this is to put the pain back in people, the fear, and the loss. Although it is a horrible thing to think about, we do it. Obviously the writer did not think of how he felt after 17 minutes. 5.6/10"
"cstrom-1","3","1","4","18 February 2007"," Incorrect information given about Marine who found PAPD
","I believe that once again producers/directors have altered and belittled blacks who have done something exceptional. The Marine, Sergeant Karnes, is a man of color...not a Caucasian as depicted in this movie. Sgt. Karnes was, and is an exceptional man, who went into an extremely dangerous situation because he was a Marine and an American who believed that he was supposed to help...even when he had not been ordered to by his government. He answered to a much higher power, and as a result, two men who might have died are now alive. If this movie is supposed to be an accurate depiction of what happened on September 11, 2000, then the director, Oliver Stone, should have made sure of the facts surrounding the man who located, and was the main reason for the rescue of the two men. And in answer to any question(s) about my ethnicity; I am a woman who is Caucasian and from the deep heart south who believes that a person who shows that much heroism should be portrayed accurately. After all, President Bush managed to get it right...why can't Hollywood's elitist paragons of propaganda get it right? Also, I'm appalled that Nicolas Cage would be associated with a group that couldn't even manage to portray the savior of these two men correctly."

I also thought that it was a good portrayal of how it would have been to be one of these great men and women of our police, fire, national guard and rescue forces in those circumstances. Nicholas Cage and Maria Bello were great in this movie. I was not surprised at all with Nicholas Cage,but in the past Maria Bello has not been that convincing of an actress to me, yet watching her in this movie I was really able to see the emotion in her, and felt that she was accurate. This movie had me in tears, of course, throughout the whole movie. Although I do believe that this movie was a little to soon for our nation, I still believe it is a definite worth seeing."

","Okay, When I first saw previews for this movie about a year ago I was really looking forward to seeing it. My Husband however along with a lot of other people I know didn't because they said a tragedy like that was nothing to make a movie about. Well I wanted to see it with some expectations hoping that it would help out our country, I'll explain later, let me talk about the movie. This complaint is one of the least important, but I was expecting them to use film making technology to actually show the towers getting hit, instead of just a shadow right before that happens. I know that sounds bad, ""Why would you want to see that again."" I wanted them to show it to open peoples eyes and remember that day. Most people are trying to forget it, and a lot have. The only people I can understand that from is people that were in NYC that day and saw it. as for the rest of the country, Remembering what happened should help this country to stop being so cocky and not let our guard down. I think the thing that bothered me the most about the movie was that none of the police officers were notified that the second tower was hit. One guy heard it from his wife on the phone. On September 11 2001 I was a Sophomore in High School and within ten minutes after the first one was hit, our eyes were glued on the TV, and I know half of America was as well, everyone was watching and saw the second plane hit the second tower. It was hit long before thought officers in the movie even entered the building, Nobody notified them that the second plane hit? They were still asking over the Radio if something was going on with the second tower when the first one collapsed and they got trapped in the site an hour after the second hit. And to back it up a little bit, back when the first tower was hit, all they showed was a little shutter. Please, I wasn't there, but I'm pretty sure that there was more than that. Once they showed the collapse thats when I started liking it. Thats when she made it sad and something you could get into. Okay, now what I was hoping of this movie, that it would open up peoples hearts and remember what happened that day. It recognizes Every one of thoughts people that died that day. It remembers the families that lost there loved ones. I guarantee that they can't forget that day. And we are just supposed to forget it as if it never happened. Because it's hard for US to see it. I remember everything about that day and have total sympathy for everyone who lost there loved ones.

But those are the only reasons I voted this movie a 3 instead of a 1. If I would have the option to decide, I would not watch that movie again unless I have a bed to fall asleep in...

It did evoke a few emotional memories from that awful day but overall it was not what I expected from Oliver Stone. It was not much better than any other average drama. The special effects were convincing enough and yet there still seemed to be something missing. There wasn't enough detail so as to show that there were other people in the general population that were also affected. It seemed to be a story about two men only.<br/><br/>I think Oliver Stone is a great director and has many films to add to his achievements but I don't think this is one of them, in comparison.

","""A curtain God made to shield us from 'what we are not ready to see'""a rescue personnel described this of the billows of smoke envaginating the rubble of the collapsed World Trade Centre towers. However, this comment becomes ironic when the movie World Trade Centre proceeds to show how buried under the economic landmark was a tale of love, courage, hope, faith, teamwork, perseverance and sacrifice.<br/><br/>Directed by Oliver Stone at a cost of US$65 million, the story is about five Port Authority personnel who ventured into World Trade Centre Tower 1, which was about to crumple, in hope of rescuing people out of the building. When the core of the tower finally gave way, the survival of the rescuers were unfortunately threatened.<br/><br/>The backdrop of the disaster helped bring out many of the themes shown in the film. Only when danger and unpredictability looms does humanity become all the more important to survival itself. Without the love from and of their wives, without their lion-heartedness and perseverance to endure pain and thirst, without the hope of being rescued, without the faith of God and without the sacrifice and teamwork of the rescue team, the Port Authority personnel would probably have had a highly reduced chance of survival.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the movie does not promise you a total understanding of humanity, neither does it promise excitement and action, but it would probably provide an afternoon of inspiration and a small glimpse into the lesser-seen side of humans."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","4","4 November 2006"," Oliver Stone's moving account of two 911 rescues
","It's been 5 years since the atrocity of 911, and with the publicity over the last 5 years one could become a little numb over it. In terms of screen presentation, there was ""United 93"" which focused primarily on the crashed hijacked plane and the BBC TV special, the premise of which is very similar to that of WTC, the true personal stories of survivors. It's a remarkable job that Oliver Stone has done with WTC, which moved me more than either of the other two mentioned, in more than one scene. And it is an Oliver Stone who has been at one time all fire and brimstone.<br/><br/>WTC started with the hustle-bustle of a morning in Manhattan, just like any other one, except that it was September 11th of 2001. Stone gave so much detailed attention to this opening sequence that even to an occasional visitor like this one, there is a warm, homely feeling. Moving from scene to scene via total blackout underscores an ominous note even this early in the movie. We are then introduced to two police officers, taciturn veteran John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage) and enthusiastic rookie Will Jimeno (Michael Mena). The attack of the WTC is brought onto the screen as abruptly as it happened in real life, and the rescue effort as chaotic. Only a quarter into the movie (about 30 minutes), the collapsing building brings the protagonist to 20 feet under the rabbles, where they act primarily with their facial expressions, and sometimes only with their eyes, for the remainder of the movie. It's also around this time that the respective wives (Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal) first appear.<br/><br/>It is not easy to keep the audience's attention in the remaining 90 minutes (particularly those with claustrophobia) on two half-buried victims' mental struggle to stay alive. Here, Stone does a remarkably good job (even though not 100% successful). Cutting back and forth to show the agony the wives are going through is a must. Gyllenhaal is particularly impressive, a pregnant young wife driver to the verge of breakdown trying to hold together. The various levels of her psychological turmoil surge and submerge like tidal waves. Bello's is a more subdued and intense role, which she handles well. I understand that her performance in ""A history of violence"" is Oscar-worthy (she was nominated only for the Golden Globe) and would love to see that film. It's the superb acting of these two actresses that make the re-union scenes in the hospital so moving. Hard-core cynics may still find faults, such as when Jimeno asks that his leg be cut off to make room for McLoughlin's rescue – a tad over done. But in general, the heroism is honestly and squarely reflected, as when a rescuer tells his colleagues his wife's name before plunging down through the rabbles, knowing full well that any remaining structure close by may crush down on him any minute.<br/><br/>In the end, the key message rings true – in atrocities such as these, needless to say, we see the evil side of Man. But at the same time, it also brings out his best."

""wow!""... the whole experience blew me away.<br/><br/>Seeing all those news reels and stuff brought back many memories and it also reaffirmed in me that peace knowing that there's always someone you can count on to be there for you.<br/><br/>Despite the whole feel-good atmosphere towards the end of the movie the one thing that stuck with me is the fact that people need people. If you want to a movie that is full of meaningful messages, this is it.<br/><br/>I admire the courage of the directors and producers to put out a movie of this stature and using a truly star-studded base, i think Nicolas Cage just brought out the real essences of what the survivors of 9/11 experienced down there. It was refreshing to note that the main character wasn't always the main boy, there were times when other characters had their spot in the limelight.<br/><br/>I can't stop repeating the fact that this is a need-to-see movie. if you miss it at the theatres then get it on DVD coz this is one experience we need to remember and always will. kudos to the directors, producers, cast and to the whole team.<br/><br/>Job well done!!!!"
"airjimmyshoes","10","1","4","1 November 2006"," The Film that America needed to see.
","Listen. Everyone is putting this movie down because September 11th is still a soft spot for all American people. However, we needed to see this movie. If this movie was in the eyes of John Doe, I wouldn't blame everyone for what they say. In fact, if it weren't in the eyes of Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena, it should have been in the bottom 100. However, the emotion you had during this movie was maybe only surpassed by Forrest Gump. The emotions of the families probably made you feel like you were a McLoughlin or a Jimeno. I remember crying like a baby when they were saved in the end. This film is indeed a guilty pleasure. Everybody says they hated this movie. However, catch them alone at your local Blockbuster, and they will be renting this film. We needed to see this film so everyone could know what happened in the eyes of two of the bravest men in American history and so we can be sure that good came out of the darkest day any American remembers."
"vinsond21","8","1","4","27 October 2006"," An intimate perspective of what happened ""that day""
","In its own quiet way, Oliver Stone's World Trade Center grips the viewer as unimaginable events unfold around two ordinary men working in the security department of the port of New York. We all know what happened that day, and most would also know the outcome of what happened to these two men. The 9/11 event was, after all, one of the most widely covered by the media. Yet for those of us who think we already know it all, there is nothing like revisiting that fateful day through the eyes of those who were right there in the thick of it. Here, the recreation of Ground Zero is impressive. It is as if the viewer was right there on the Tuesday morning of 9/11, and also with the victims following the attacks. Nicholas Cage gives a suitably subdued performance as befits his screen character John McLoughlin, while feisty newcomer Michael Pena as Will Jimeno shows himself to be an actor with much promise. Overall, the film is superbly cast, and both Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal inhabit their wifely characters of Donna McLoughlin and Allison Jimeno so well that they take your breath away. Donna's hugging scene near the end with a mother who was missing her son will bring lumps to one's throat. Unlike in other Oliver Stone movies, there is no posturing in this one. I was even compelled to see this movie twice, and i have to say that i cried more the second time around. This is maybe because the first time, i was just getting acquainted with the characters while the second time around, they were already like familiar friends. While what the suicide terrorists did on 9/11 was both evil and stupid and sickening, director Oliver Stone has helped to bring about some healing - local as well as global - through this movie. World Trade Center shows that the worst kinds of events can still bring out the best from those affected. On a more personal note, this is my favorite Oliver Stone film to date, and i never thought i'd see the day when i would even consider liking any film by this surprising director."
"forindcine","8","1","4","23 October 2006"," Two survivor and family stories
","Oliver Stone's film, World Trade Center, is a story about the rescue of two New York Port Authority cops who get trapped in the rubble after the collapse of towers one and two. Michael Pena, the Latino locksmith from the film Crash, plays Will Jimeno who is trapped with Sergeant John McLoughlin portrayed in a beautifully understated role by Nicholas Cage. <br/><br/>In this carefully based, true story film, Jimeno volunteers to partner with McLoughlin as they enter the WTC to assist in the evacuation. Before they get off the ground floor, Tower One implodes instantly killing most members of their first response team. The two end up wedged between debris with no hope of freeing themselves. <br/><br/>Stone does an exceptional job sticking to the facts without unnecessary play on your emotions. He effectively switches from scenes of the two trapped under the WTC to their families and wives in superb performances by Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal. His masterful directing ability weave timely transitions and laugh-out-loud humor even as you wipe away tears.<br/><br/>This film has great actors who portray the real lives of rescuers, victims, and family. Everyone involved with this film understands the story is about the 18th and 19th of only 20 victims rescued from the WTC wreckage. Jimeno is magnificent as he carries this film with little effort. Cage spends much of the film shown from the neck up yet provides the best performance of his career. Stone leaves all conspiracy theories behind and once again demonstrates what keeps him in a class by himself.<br/><br/>This World Trade Center film is a masterpiece."

","I'm not an American but I did watch the events unfold on TV as most people did. 9/11 had a huge impact on the world and more people than just Americans were shattered about this tragic event.<br/><br/>When I read that Oliver Stone was making this film I expected it to be a little on the political side. I was profoundly surprised that it's about the human courage and sadness that the event brought forth. Stone's approach to the film; focusing on two NY policemen and their families as they're trapped in the ruins and awaiting rescue totally grabbed hold of me. I've noticed some negative reviews stating the film doesn't cover enough ground or something like that. I think Stone's right on the mark, displaying the best human beings have to offer in a time of extreme crisis and how we can forgo our worst to help the next guy who needs it.<br/><br/>Convincing performances are all around and really bring the characters and their dire situations alive. The highest credit goes to Oliver Stone who here creates a real human drama about human courage and shows us that that's the best way to think of this horrible day. I was blown away and could hardly keep from crying."

","I thought this was a great movie! <br/><br/>It was very sad but that is to be expected; 9-11 was and still is a very sad day. Oliver Stone did an excellent job in his fidelity to the port authority cops' story. <br/><br/>The movie was done in such a way that you are reminded of what matter most in life: Family and Love. Two things we take for granted every day. There was also an apparition of Christ encouraging one of the cops to fight to stay alive. It is nice to see a movie that does not try to hide or cover up the Christian Faith and then portrays it accurately. <br/><br/>The movie has helped me to remember to tell my loved ones: ""I love you"" more often and to act that way towards them always because we do not know how long this life will be. It was nice to see the values of love portrayed correctly and how people are strengthened and survive from true, authentic Love.<br/><br/>This was a hard and very sensitive event to make into a movie. It was respectfully made; done in such a way as to respect the people who were affected. It focused on the positive and showed the heroism of many people during those days. I would encourage all people to see this movie. If anything you will want to go home and tell the people you love the most: ""I love you and I just wanted you to know that"". <br/><br/>I give it 5 stars!!!"
"csd-14","10","1","4","20 October 2006"," Inspiring!
","I have just seen this film as it was only just released here in South Africa. At the same time though I have read many of the comments posted here and I guess at the end of the day how you view and rate this movie depends on the way you look at it. My brother and I ended up having a big argument about the film in that he looked at the movie with the focus being on the terrorism factor whereas my focus was on the actual rescue of the police officers which was what the film was all about. Ever since I watched the events of 9/11 unfold many of the reports were always based on the terrorism side (which yes was a big aspect) but how much focus was given to those that were actually trapped, to the families waiting for news of their loved ones. To me this film made me feel a part of that emotion. Was it the best movie I have seen? Not by a long shot but it was nevertheless inspiring and will definitely be a part of my DVD collection when it is released. I think the whole movie was summed up for me in the final minutes when Nicholas Cage is brought out on the stretcher and passed along by all the rescue workers and the absolute joy by all at having brought someone out alive. No longer will the pictures in my mind of 9/11 be those of the buildings coming crashing down but rather the aerial shot of the hundreds of rescue workers clapping as Nicholas Cage is rescued."
"MrBiddle","9","1","4","18 October 2006"," I saw Jesus! And he had a bottle of water!
","WORLD TRADE CENTER is portrayed in typical Stone style... the rhythm of transition between scenes is bridged by elliptical ""black outs"". Performances are above par all through out. The opening scenes that quickly change from normalcy to the instant and unexpected pandemonium are handled very well also. <br/><br/>Then it progresses into scenes of a more grueling nature, featuring tension, despair and unpleasant anticipation. The sound design is excellent, as many have hyped about this film. It closes with the life affirming message from Nicolas Cage's character - a refreshing motion picture due to an apolitical perspective because it focuses on the essentials of the 2 men's accounts and those of their families. It is a film told on a very personal and candid level, very well worth catching if you want to know the story of the 2 men who went to risk their lives; but in return were the ones in need of the salvation and risk from the men who found themselves having that task to accomplish for them."
"Jay_Exiomo","7","1","4","18 October 2006"," Shards of hope amidst the bleakness
","""World Trade Center"" is different from the usual Oliver Stone film in that it's an article with a hushed apolitical tone. Here, Stone removes the usual sappiness of movies depicting heroism, pushes mawkishness to the sides, and tells a definitive story of two individuals who were among the victims of that fateful day.<br/><br/>Whereas ""United 93"" (the other 9/11 film released this year) featured mostly unknown actors, ""World Trade Center"" stars Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena as Port Authority cops John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno, respectively. Called in to the World Trade Center without knowing what the emergency was, McLoghlin and Jimeno soon find themselves trapped when the Twin Towers eventually collapses. Both actors, coupled by the script by Andrea Berloff, successfully underplay the sensationalism while still maintaining the realistic urgency and heroism of the big picture.<br/><br/>Stone is so determined to show the humanity of McLoughlin and Jimeno that his trademark themes take a backseat to the unfolding drama on the screen. Still it isn't without a few minor problems. Firstly, some parts slow down with a little too many narrative flashbacks. I'm not familiar with how much of these were real and how much were part of cinematic liberties, and indeed some of them are necessary for the characterizations of the leads but not all of it. But that's about it as far as quibbles are concerned.<br/><br/>This is simply an intelligent solid film, a little loose with the details of the actual events but overall true to what its subject is all about."
"antoniotierno","8","1","4","17 October 2006"," heartfelt, solid and respectful
","It's a touching and stunning film, politically muted - and mute too - giving a lot of powerful action sequences as well as many tactful emotions. Oliver Stone pays a tribute to these people, carrying a huge emotional impact and making everyone feel close to the guys trapped down there. Actually, this is a rather strange story of survivals since sentimentality seems even overwhelming the storytelling; nevertheless this is a marvelous movie experience, crude and effective at the same time. It simply tells about Americans trying to do their jobs, helping each other and feeling Americans. This flick manages to develop a story of strength and courage from a catastrophe."

","I was really afraid that this would be yet another pompous, ""America rules!"" kind of movie... But I came out moved and very pleasantly surprised. Nicholas Cage seldom does any bad character-interpretations, and he is convincing as John McLoughlin. But the two most impressing achievements in this movie, I think, was Michael Pena as Will Jimeno and Maggie Gyllenhaal as his wife, Allison. Hats off for you two!! I have seen some remarks that this movie was too focused on these two policemen, and missed out on the big tragedy that was happening and all the thousands of people involved.... I must say, I'm glad Oliver Stone didn't get too ambitious on this point! This is not supposed to be a documentary, and it is not supposed to tell everyones story. The movie also gains my respect for not being political at all! 9/11 was a terrible day, not only for America, but for the whole world... I was glad to see that some good things came out of this tragic loss!"

It showed scenes of family, grieving lost ones, distressed people looking for a way out and its generally a really moving story. It was a well made movie, with scenes that were more important than dialog. With the story line they were given, they have done a really good job. I feel as if the sadness of September 11 2001 has been respected and even admired. The characters followed and the footage used was carefully edited to give an accurate account of the day, without hurting anyones feelings. However, walking out i felt as if it was a little bit too deep. Leaving the cinema i felt really shocked that it actually happened, it was a turning point in the new world and this movie has shown that in a respectful way."

"ladies_pinch","8","1","4","15 October 2006"," Oliver Stone isn't all about making money
","Before seeing this film i was a little hesitant to see it, i thought it was a tad inappropriate to make a high budget film about one of the most tragic days in history. However now i feel that oliver stone wasn't just thinking about how much money this would earn him, the film was made to make a point. It explains how many people died that day and how many officers went in and how so few of them came out. The story of The two men trapped under layers of rubble is truly amazing, there wasn't a dry eye in the cinema screen, a good mix of film and actual footage from that tragic day makes you feel the effect of that day to its full extent. This film definitely shows you what a messed up world we live in. I feel this is the film that should be shown on jumbo screens throughout Iraq, to show those people how much people suffered because of them. Its amazing how the film is so effective, and it doesn't even show the planes going into the buildings, that is amazing film making."

","Ever since whatever happened on September 11 2001, people often asked each other what did they do on that day. From then on, it became one of those dates where it naturally entered the history books like the time when the Berlin Wall fell.<br/><br/>But back to the movie. Based on real-life accounts of New York Port Authority Police Department's Sergeant John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and his colleague, rookie cop William Jimeno (Michael Pena), the movie brings us back to the day which eventually changed the history of the 21st century since.<br/><br/>It started as just another day in the lives of these two men and their other colleagues at the Port Authority Police Department. They all went about doing their work till they received news that a plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. Some sounded sceptism at first, but whatever happened on at the streets of New York City later led to the men thinking that this was something big. McLoughlin and his team of volunteers entered one of the two towers. When the building finally collapsed, it was too late.<br/><br/>They were being trapped under 20 feet of steel and concrete and, silence.<br/><br/>Above ground, the country and the rest of the world (from Africa to Europe to the Asian continents, as being shown in the movie) started to comprehend what really happened. This even included McLoughlin's wife Donna (Maria Bello) and Jimeno's pregnant wife Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Allison was especially hysterical, given her conditions. It was quite a terrible ordeal for the two of them when they learnt that their husbands were among those reportedly unaccounted for.<br/><br/>Inside the rubbles, the two men kept themselves alive by chatting with each other about their lives and exchanging Starsky and Hutch trivia. They never knew that above the ground, ex-Marine David Karnes (Michael Shannon) was determined to find if anyone was still alive below the rubbles.<br/><br/>Criss-crossing various groups of people who all came together on the fateful day, director Olivier Stone paid tribute to those who survived and those who were among the 2,759 perished. McLoughlin and Jimeno were among the 20 who were being rescued alive from the World Trade Center's rubbles.<br/><br/>If one had noticed, the replica of Ground Zero just looked so real that it is just like the real thing. It was specially created to give the raw feel of the rubbles. And I am also lucky to sit through the entire movie over the weekend at the cinema given some of the scenes are just, painful to watch.<br/><br/>Emotion and humane and courage, this is what the movie is just trying to do."
"MaxBorg89","8","1","4","15 October 2006"," Far from perfect, but still very moving
","When I first heard Oliver Stone was going to make this film, I was surprised: the world's most political director, not to mention Hollywood's number one troublemaker, tackling such a delicate subject, still painfully echoing in collective memory? What would the movie be like? What theories would it expose? Who was going to be blamed this time?<br/><br/>When I eventually saw World Trade Center, I was happy to see Stone came up with the wisest decision regarding the film: for the first time in his career, he has made a picture that doesn't accuse anyone of anything (we don't even see the hijacked planes, just the shadow of one of them), but celebrates courage and kindness. Instead of building up a JFK-like investigation on who was behind the events of 9/11, he focuses on the true story of two average citizens who were caught in the middle of the chaos.<br/><br/>The men in question are John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena), two Port Authority officers who were sent to evacuate the Twin Towers and ended up being stuck between concrete ruins for hours waiting for someone to get them out. In telling this story, Stone divides the film in three sections: one detailing the protagonists'claustrophobic experience, another showing the nightmare their wives (Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal) go through, and the third about a Marine who decides to go to New York and provide some help.<br/><br/>World Trade Center is very unusual by his standards (except for the violence, which I think is a bit too strong for a PG-13), but Stone manages to deliver a good film without using his trademark conspiracy subplots: all he wants is to show us how a group of ordinary people didn't give up and just kept hoping for the best. The scenes with McLoughlin and Jimeno are the most effective, filled with consistent tension and superbly acted. Cage, in particular, relying solely on his voice and face, gives a stunning performance that should be considered for an Oscar.<br/><br/>There are, however, a few moments where the movie moves from great to ridiculous: some people have questioned the director's decision to over-dramatize the scene where the building between the Towers falls over Cage and Pena by playing it in slow motion, but that's quite forgivable in my opinion. What isn't, on the other hand, is the utterly risible ""Jesus vision"" bit and the redundant, pretentious flashbacks showcasing the two officers'private lives. The film also gets frustratingly rhetorical with the closing voice-over, emphasizing how brave those men were on that particular day and all the rest: it's practically a summation of the entire movie, in case someone failed to understand what Stone's latest opus was about.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, most of the time WTC proves to be a riveting film. Not an essential Stone film, but quite better than the half-cooked Alexander."
"chojensen","4","1","4","10 October 2006"," Old Vinegar in new bottles
","This movie brings nothing new - By far the worst movie by Oliver Stone. The terrible attack on world trade center made into a movie which only has one quality: We can all relate to the event emotionally, and that is the base Stone uses for this movie. In other words: An emotion-porn movie.<br/><br/>HERE IS THE SPOILER: He sends in a fanatic patriot who saves the day - Biting irony from Stone, but the movie is too straight forward to make it interesting. Stone doesn't violate the respect we all have of 9/11, but that in itself should have been a warning to Stone that there is nothing he can say with this movie."
"watchmanz","5","1","4","8 October 2006"," Wasted opportunity
","Not as good as I thought I would be. It was less about the World Trade Center events of September 11th, rather than a story of the Port Authority cops and two who became trapped in the rubble. Some parts of it were good but other parts were boring, and the boring parts far outweighed the good parts. For anyone directly affected by the events of that day, it will probably have special significance and meaning, but to me it was far short of what this movie could have been. In comparison I felt 'United 93' was a far superior movie and the opportunity this movie could have taken to pay homage to those who perished on that day was wasted. It is difficult to make a great movie about such tragic events, especially when so many of those directly affected are still alive to judge the movie, but this was just a rescue movie based on two or three characters, when it could have so easily been a great tribute to all those who perished, survived, and gave of themselves on that day and the days shortly thereafter. The typical US hero-achieves-against-outstanding-odds-complete-with-stirring-music didn't endear me to the movie either - the opportunity to real make a fitting memorial to all affected was lost, and that saddens me. Five out of 10 because it was still a good story and because Nick Cage is one of my favorite actors, but I wouldn't recommend it, and wouldn't watch it again."

","""We prepared for everything. Not for this. Not for something this size. There's no plan. "" - John McLaughlin (Nicolas Cage) Unfortunately, most people will go into this movie expecting a very pessimistic and horrific re-telling of the accounts of 9/11 but that's nowhere near's the case. It's a story of hope and the survival of two New York Port Authority policemen stuck under the ruins of the World Trade Center. It's a powerful, uplifting story that seems to be far too conventional for Oliver Stone. Stone does a nice job directing, and pretty much all of the actors are involved are solid here. Nicolas Cage delivers a good performance here, which is becoming more and more unusual which each passing year. Maggie Gyllenhaal is great in a small role, and Maria Bello holds her own in an even smaller role. The real stand-out of the cast is, however, Crash's Michael Pena, who delivers an incredible tour-de-force performance that isn't for even a second unbelievable and might very well earn him a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award Nomination come Oscar time. The film is little over-the-top and sappy at some points, but it's still a moving motion picture in that the good far out weighs the bad. Grade: B (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona)"

I was dreading having to see those aeroplanes crashing into the world trade centre but thank god, I didn't have to see it again! It was a gripping story of two Port Authority Police officers who were trapped under the rubble of the trade centre and their battle to survive until help came.<br/><br/>I think it was very well filmed and it truly portrayed what the families of these men would have gone through as well as the men themselves. It showed how the people came together in a bid to rescue others trapped.<br/><br/>I just cant see what everyones problem is with this film, I mean with reference to a review i read earlier; and i quote ""Or even in the building, why would they keep so many people inside the burning trade centre; wouldn't they move them out of there"" ....... the reason they kept so many people inside the world trade centre is because so many people were throwing themselves from the building that it was impossible to walk out of there and not get hit by a body.... that will be what all of those loud banging noises were!<br/><br/>With reference to another review i read earlier; and i quote "" constant poor lighting and typically unchanging scenery make it unpleasant to watch "" .....well I am sorry if the scenery was not as bright and colourful as you would have liked but they were TRAPPED UNDER TONS OF RUBBLE with barely any light - they were not in a green field with sun shining! I think this film shows that some good came out of this terrible tragedy in the end and although the film did not focus on the lives of all 2973 people killed on that day it did focus on two men who were willing to sacrifice their lives for those people... we should remember this too."

The film starts off by showing ordinary New Yorkers on an ordinary day...going to work, on the ferry, riding the subway etc. No one knew what was in store on that terrible day. Then, there is the sound of a plane and a loud explosion, and things would never be the same again...<br/><br/>World Trade Center tells the story entirely from the point of view of Jimeno and McLoughlin and their families. The special effects are outstanding...I really felt as if I was actually there experiencing what they went through. The collapse of the towers is horrific, as is the terrible situation that they find themselves in...trapped in the remains of the towers knowing that they could be killed by falling debris at any moment. The characterisation is excellent...you are able to empathise with the two officers and their families and you feel their absolute despair. By the end I really had come to love them.<br/><br/>The acting in World Trade Center is very good. Nicolas Cage, Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal are all excellent, and Michael Pena was wonderful as Will Jimeno...I really do think that an Oscar nomination could be coming his way. The unobtrusive score by Craig Armstrong was very appropriate also.<br/><br/>World Trade Center is a very sad film...given the subject matter, it couldn't be anything else. I was very tearful at the end and I heard plenty of sniffles in the cinema. It was some small scenes...the lift operator's mother, the empty subway train and the ""Missing"" posters that got to me. However the film's message is an uplifting one...that even in the worst of times, there is hope, and it emphasises the importance of family and love. Yes, it is often sentimental but never too sappy.<br/><br/>All in all, World Trade Center is a very fine tribute to all members of the rescue services who died or who were injured on 9/11/01. Well done Oliver Stone."

","What can I say about the world trade centre movie.? First of all this movie is a piece of art! I'm a film maker myself and movies like this are what really inspire me to want to work in the media industry with such great actors, talking of actors let's talk a little about the two actors that helped to drive this story forward and feel exactly how the people who's story was told throughout the movie would have felt on the day America saw evil.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage: Great actor and if someone else had played the part of John McLoughlin I really don't think that this movie would be the same without him! Michael Pena: He played the part of Will Jameno like a true actor should play their role when starring in a movie of this kind, great job, great performance! I can promise you from this day forward a movie of this kind only ever comes years and years apart, it's going to take years until this movie is forgotten, it's just wonderful and while watching this movie in the great surround sound environment at the cinema I really felt like I was in the movie myself because it's just so moving and unforgettable. If I went to the cinema tomorrow night to see this movie and the people behind the counter told me that it was sold out I would definitely pay £50 to just get into the screening room! And when I say into the screening room I honestly mean I wouldn't mind standing up the whole way through because at least I got to see a movie that is worth paying to see! To everyone that's reading this I tell you to go and watch this movie while you still can because it's made to be watched on the big screen, go and watch and feel what I felt while watching this movie."
"bryanrumbold","7","1","4","29 September 2006"," An incredible movie. Before we are ready or not.
","Well, what to say about an event turned into entertainment only 5 years after that terrible day. I know some of you might be thinking ""what about Titanic"". Well yes both were a great loss of life, but WTC is completely different. Why make a movie about something so soon after it happened. So much tragedy and now a company, and a list of actors and a director who we all know and respect want to do this. I will tell you why, its because it had to be done. So much death, so much misery but this film manages to shed a little bit of light, hope and how good we can be as a people when we stop killing each other. Many people died doing what they thought was the best thing to do, and that was ""save someone i have never met"". The movie itself is clever to avoid what we all saw that day. Yes a few scenes which are burned forever into our memory are in it, but for the best part of it nothing is shown. Its not the best movie ever, it will win awards just because of what it is. I like how it was made so that we can feel like we were in that hole, documentaries don't do that, but drama does. Watch it even if you don't agree with it. It was also clever not to draw out any new and fresh hatred for the Muslims as it could have, which if it had i myself would not have liked this movie to even have been thought of. Please take your time to watch this very moving and emotional film, as you will walk out feeling a deeper respect for all who were there."
"rudi-helmich","3","1","4","23 September 2006"," Disappointment
","Unlike other movies from Oliver Stone, this one is a movie which I'd rather forget. Only the fact you make a movie of one of the worst nightmares of America, doesn't mean the movie is good. This movie is too flat. Even the movie is only about two policemen, you never get to know them well. Everything is so predictable and too slow. It doesn't take you by your hart considering it is about 9/11, It shouldn't be to difficult. Carnes is the only person in the movie who gives it a blast. The movie is too soft with no time for showing the real horror which took place in the WTC. Cage had to be under the WTC too soon. You never get any details of the world trade center. It was Stones intention only to make a story about the two buried policemen but he didn't managed to get emotions out of me."
"vitaleralphlouis","2","1","4","20 September 2006"," September 11 Receives Small Movie Treatment
","Definitely NOT the definitive movie implied by the title, but a fine movie giving instead a very narrow focus which concentrates on two police officers, their families, friends, co-workers, rescuers. This was a good approach in my opinion, and was enhanced by excellent reflection of such values as patriotism, duty, religion and family. There is no trace of lefty spin. Not as good as United 93, nonetheless both films are works to be proud of. In a year dominated by one trashy movie after another, mostly fake superheros for the under 12 audience, at least a few films are still made for grown ups with mainstream American values."
"jzappa","6","1","4","14 September 2006"," What Happened?
","I mean...man...Oliver Stone. That's right, the genius behind Platoon, The Doors, Natural Born Killers, JFK, Born On the Fourth of July, Midnight Express, and Scarface, the ""Emperor of Excess,"" who got to where he is with his fearless edge. World Trade Center has no edge. If I'd not known it was directed by Stone, I would've actually said something like, ""Stone would be aggravated if he saw this."" Maybe he is, but the difference is that it actually is directed by him. Its problem is that it has the spirit of your average corny patriotic fluff. The dialogue, the characters, the plot itself, the slow-motion shots of melodrama...they're all on par with the work of some studio director-for-hire.<br/><br/>The film starts off very well. It begins with the quiet atmosphere of early morning in New York City. It has a growing suspense. There's an effectively disturbing minimalist depiction of the attack on the Towers. After that, the movie takes the Pearl Harbor route and inflates with stale dialogue and token worried-wives-sitting-at-home characters and aggravating clichés such as those. yes, it's a true story, but the fluffy treatment of it is what takes it down.<br/><br/>Perhaps Stone just wanted a surefire way to bring himself back up to the top after his long absence punctuated by the box office disaster of the underrated Alexander. A movie about 9/11 is both controversial and intriguing enough, and with his name attached, everyone knows they're in for a slashing perspective, but for whatever reason, he took the safest route through the story. Maybe he had to, because JFK and Platoon were made decades after Kennedy's assassination and the Vietnam War. Perhaps not enough time has passed for the masses to really be ready for such a harsh blunt-eye view of the September 11 attacks. I know I am, though.<br/><br/>Hopefully Stone will get back on track. He's been off of it for way too long."
"ndn109","7","1","4","28 August 2006"," carefully crafted emotional wallop
","Of course they are going to make it out alive. Or there wouldn't be a movie. There's no ""survivor story"" without the survivors after all, right? Still, somehow Stone manages to pile the dramatic weight on so thick that we are inevitably swept up in the officers' struggle for survival. It goes against the grain of most hero stories, because McLaughlin and Jiminez don't really ""do"" much in the active sense. They can't move, so their main heroic deed is garnering the will power to survive. <br/><br/>Profiling the marine story sort of telegraphs the rescue a bit early, but this is permissible. I mean it's a miracle of narrative agility that this material was able to lend itself to a taut, conventional two-hour movie anyway. I mean everything ""looks"" real, but the dialogue is more schematic than realistic.<br/><br/>The home-front stuff is a bit stiff dramatically, but I guess there really isn't much you can do with it. The performances are sincere, which makes up for the abyss of real emotion in these scenes. It isn't ""THE"" movie about the trade center towers collapsing it's just one story of the internal fight for survival and one that only scratches the psychological surface at that.<br/><br/>But I liked it? Yeah. The story's essential struggle was so deftly handled that I found its emotional pull irresistible. All in all, this was a fitting tribute to the bold heroism of New York's finest martyrs on that day."
"ruby_fff","8","1","4","28 August 2006"," Tribute to the concerted rescue efforts and validating inextinguishable spirit & faith vital for survival
","Perhaps no film will ever appease the devastation or recover the monumental losses of affected families, but the fact that ""World Trade Center"" the film was made attests to our remembrance of the event. Respectfully dedicated to the dead and the living, director Oliver Stone and fellow producers were brave in having a non action-pack approach to ""WTC"" without sensationalism. We were shown reenactment and the dramatic reactions/responses of people involved or cared and wanted to lend a helping hand.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage superbly delivered a restrained, understated performance, along with Michael Peña (the locksmith/father in Paul Haggis' ""Crash"" 2005), portraying two New York City Port Authority Police Officers under harrowing disastrous situation. The film may be 'underwhelmed' by the survival segment that 'replicated' the possible interminable feeling of waiting to be rescued. It is relentlessly devastating, energy draining, mind numbing. Yet the fortitude and strength demonstrated to keep going, to have faith (be it wavered or seemingly hopeless) - hanging on with the help of loving memories of family and loved ones - sustained the survival power (in the mind, since physically incapacitated). It is a moving experience in spite of the seeming inactivity. The 'unadorned' photography by Seamus McGarvey, with 'just enough' music by Craig Armstrong, and the effectively 'real' sound design and visual re-creations all enhanced what we see on screen.<br/><br/>Besides the core performances of Cage as Sgt. John McLoughlin and Peña as Officer William Jimeno, the script by Andrea Berloff afforded sketches of their wives' reactions poignantly portrayed by Maria Bello as Donna McLoughlin and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Allison Jimeno. One might find the pace slow with the survival segments or even the rescue scenes - but if to compare what the survivors, rescuers, families had gone through in real time - the actual waiting period is much more than a mere 2 hours we sat through at the cinema.<br/><br/>Also recommended: the TV film ""Flight 93"" 2006 (directed by Peter Markle, written by Nevin Schreiner) is a very good docudrama. It was done with respect, sensitivity, and truly dedicated to the families involved. Included on DVD are interviews with filmmakers, behind the scenes insight.<br/><br/>The film ""United 93"" 2006 by UK director Paul Greengrass (who gave us ""Bloody Sunday"" 2002), is objective and well-delivered, tightly scripted by Greengrass himself. DVD to release on Sept 5, 2006."

","I expected another cheesy, overdone and exploited movie about 9/11. But what a sensational surprise! Yes, it had to show the tragedy of that horrible time in NY, but that was not the focus of the movie. I went in with about half a box of tissues in my purse expecting another sob story view, but none the less, I felt compelled to view it as the fifth anniversary is approaching. Much to my amazement, I only needed one tissue for tears of joy, and a few moving moments.<br/><br/>The story of these two gentlemen should be an inspiration to all of us who have ever felt like we cannot go on another day, much less a moment in time. I became physically disabled on 8/1/01 after a back injury. After several surgeries, and a broken hip too, I really have begun to question my mortality and the reason for my life of pain. I am now only 41 with an 18 yr. old son and a 14 yr. old daughter. After seeing this movie and learning more about these two courageous gentlemen, I no longer feel sorry for myself or my situation. I feel very lucky to be alive and spared the horror and agony that they have faced. Believe me when I say that this movie has done more ""therapy"" for me than anything I could ever do or any medication! And yes, I realize there are many other stories as compelling as theirs, but this is just about their story. <br/><br/>GO SEE IT!!!!

It takes you into the real life of the men and women and how they dealt with the September 11th attacks on America.<br/><br/>When I left the theater, not one person left with a dry eye, I saw grown men crying. It took everyone five minutes to just stand up and leave the theater, I even had seen an elderly lady bow her head and say a prayer while the end credits were rolling. All I can say is this is a movie to watch, and doesn't give you a break emotionally. It makes you want to feel grateful for the simple everyday little things we take for granted.

","One of the best motion pictures produced in the last couple of years! ""World Trade Center"" presents a balanced view of one of this country's darkest moments; and, while it obviously must include violent scenes, they are done without sensationalizing the tragic events portrayed. It is, ultimately, an uplifting experience to see this movie... for all of the family, ages 13 and up, I believe. The entire production--the acting, directing, special effects, et al--is superb! It was especially satisfying to watch this story enfold objectively, and without any political commentary. If you see one movie this summer, I highly recommend that it be ""World Trade Center."""

It was totally silent. We were all absorbed in the moment of the movie and again, that awful day. When we left the movie I saw husbands walking out with their arm around their wives, and wives walking close their husbands side with their arm around his waist. What I saw was not a movie of insensitivity or destruction but a movie that once again made us unite, as families, spouses and Americans. As time has gone on I feel that a large percentage of people have forgotten the feeling of horror, helplessness and shear fear of that day. I think this film was necessary and very much needed to help some people remember all the lives lost on that fateful day. The filmmakers were also extremely sensitive in their shooting of some scenes. Bravo Hollywood! This time, you got it right!"

We had seen United Flight 93 two or three times this summer as well as TV documentaries and a lot of TV coverage since 9/11/01.

","After my second viewing, my emotions were stirred as strongly as the first. This clearly shows Oliver Stone at his best. Although Oliver Stone isn't typically aligned with the right, he is certainly aligned with the righteous. If this isn't a recruitment film for the Marines, I don't know what is. And I mean that in a good way. The fact that the individual who came from up state to save the two Port Authority policemen is a true story is both incredible and a rifle shot point made by Stone that a few good men can make a difference. In fact, if it wasn't for this staff Sargent, there probably wouldn't have been a story. Stone's use of the camera and closeups of the characters and the scenes put you inside the film. And when they cried, you cried. I'll bet the box office is just o.k. because the subject is so disturbing. Every American should see this movie.and it should be regular fare on DVD in every high school in America. Bravo to all involved...too many greats to list."

","World Trade Center was a good movie to go see. As I went in to the theater excepting it to be a movie about politics and everything that went on, thats not what it was. As the movie starts of you see everyone going on with there lives like a normal day and then you hear the plane hit the building (you don't see it hit) and that's when the story really begins. Srgt John McLoughlin assembles a team to go inside the towers to rescue people from the building and then everything goes to hell from there on in John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno wind up getting pinned in the rubble from the collapsing Trade Centers. The story is basically about the two men trapped in the rubble Nicolas Cage does a good job portraying the real life John McLoughlin on the other hand I think that Michael Pena does a great job portraying Will Jimeno. Michael Peña doesn't look the least bit like he's acting he really got into that part of Will Jimeno it's more like he actually went trough 9/11 himself. Michael Peña keeps the story alive as Will Jimeno and John McLoughlin keep talking to each other as they try to keep each other alive-trapped 20 and 30 feet below the rubble of Ground Zero. All in All it was a really great movie I even cried in some parts of the movie because i didn't know what to expect, some parts make you laugh especially when John and Will are talking about how thirsty they both are. I would highly recommend you going and see this movie because you might get something out of it."
"doctor_atomic2006","8","1","4","24 August 2006"," The human spirit emerges from the rubble...
","I sat maybe 5th row in the hopes I wouldn't have people around me. The movie started and the kids who sat a few rows behind me were mildly yucking it up. I was afraid I was going to go ballistic on someone if they disrespected the events about to take place. Luckily they quieted down by the sheer force of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie can almost be divided in two parts. The people underground who were pinned by massive concrete rubble and the ""outside world."" Those who eventually got trapped were Port Authority Cops who showed up at the WTC just after the planes hit and you could see a tower in flames. This was the moment I was dreading because I know people who were inside and I'll be damned if I was going to tolerate some exploitational use of the carnage that was about to happen. Thankfully, there was no exploitation. When people were fleeing for their lives the music on the soundtrack didn't sound like an action flick with high-energy music adding to the feeling of excitement. No, it was solemn. I always note the way the music is added to understand the film makers portrayal of violence. I felt assured when it was heard to accent the sadness of lost lives, not to exploit it.<br/><br/>They showed some archival news-clips as well as voice-over news reports. The contradiction of the earliest reports on it being a small plane but then it was a large plane. The contradiction of the flight number of the plane that went down in Pennsylvania which eventually known as #93. None of it was done to insinuate conspiracy, they were careful not to use these tragic events to make a political statement. The movie really wasn't about who & why 9/11 took place, but about bravery and hope and love. <br/><br/>So the guys are in one of the towers and suddenly they're trapped somewhere beneath. They realize they may not ever see their families again. Once they get trapped the movie unravels as cutting between them down beneath and the rescue teams atop as well as the family members who grieve hoping for word that their loved ones still live. Family members regret things they said yet cling to things they said and cherish in memory moments they had together when things were nice.<br/><br/>You can't help but feel that we should all treat our loved ones as best we can while we have them because you never know what events may make your next parting the last time you will ever see them again. We live in a crazy world. <br/><br/>It's a moving film. Done sensitively, if that is a concern of yours, I can tell you it's handled well. There was also a certain cathartic effect where I somehow felt better about things when I left. The human spirit is a beautiful, flexible force which will never die."

","I am sure it is very hard to film a movie that has such a painful subject for so many people, but Stone has outdone himself this time. Of course the movie plays on our emotions...just the title can do that. What is nice is that it appears to be a true portrayal of the events, at least regarding the two Port Authority Policemen. We also know that it turns out okay for these two cops...and that makes the suspense bearable. It was also clear that these poor brave first responders had no real chance of escaping, even after the first tower fell. So many things went wrong that day, even though so many people were able to get out of the buildings before they collapsed.<br/><br/>I just saw another documentary where the 2nd former Marine, who joins up with a former Marine who went to the site from Wilton, CT, was finally identified. I think that they only had his name correct, Thomas. Turns out that they have a white man playing him. The real Thomas said that he did not tell anyone that he was one of the Marines who found the two injured port authority policemen...he said it was too emotional and painful for him to talk to anyone about it.<br/><br/>I am also very glad that this 2nd movie (1st major movie, after Flight 93) did not end up trying to make any political statements. That was refreshing.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see what 9/11 was like for these 2 cops, their families, their co-workers.<br/><br/>Ingrid"
"tieman64","Null","1","5","2 November 2008"," Passive Victimhood
","""The resolve of our great nation is being tested, but make no mistake, we will show the world we will pass the test."" - George W Bush<br/><br/>Post 9/11 cinema seemed to witness an increase in at least three types of films: those that portrayed families under siege by faceless terrorists (""War of the Worlds"", ""Mist"", ""Cloverfield"" etc), those which attempted to appeal to the heroism, courage and duty that large scale national catastrophes elicit (""United 93"", ""World Trade Centre"", ""Spider Man"", ""Ladder 49"" etc) and those which openly attacked US foreign policy (""Lions for Lambs"", ""Syrianna"", ""Redacted"", ""Rendition"", ""In the Valley of Ellah"" etc).<br/><br/>Of these films, Paul Greengrass's ""United 93"" and Oliver Stone's ""World Trade Centre"" were two of the first to directly address the events of September the 11th. Both focus on the actual disaster, both attempt to be gritty and realistic, both focus on ordinary Americans and both pretend to avoid sensationalism.<br/><br/>But what ideology do these films serve? Observe, for example, how both films seem to focus on exceptions to the norm. Of the four kidnapped planes, ""United 93"" focuses on the only one which failed to reach its target. Similarly, ""WTC"" tells the story of the only 2 members of the Port Authority Police Force who made it out of the WTC rubble alive. In terms of historicism, these films mimic Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" and ""Private Ryan"", two other faux-realistic films about exceptions (the Jews who survived, the son who lived etc) which turned violent carnage into personal triumph for the purpose of national regeneration.<br/><br/>In ""United 93"", we have the passengers of a hijacked plane knowing they're about to die. They thus decide to storm the pilot's cabin and bring their plane down before it hits its target. They, apparently, make a sacrifice so that others may live ""free"". This notion of national duty and personal sacrifice is mimicked in ""WTC"". The effect is that both films mythologise 9/11 as a moment of American triumph, rather than a national failing. ""United"" deals with American heroism in the skies and ""WTC"" deals with American heroism on the land. Both serve to rebuild national identity: ie, we are a nation of victims, attacked by irrational ""savages"". If we hope to prevail, it is our duty to respond with heroism, solidarity and self-sacrifice, the very ""United"" of the film's title.<br/><br/>In his writings, Jacques Ellul examines the workings of Judeo Christian myths. He says that post WW2 political propaganda will increasingly appeal to both feelings of guilt and sorrow. Soldiers, firemen and citizens will become dead Christs, their suffering mythologised and used as emotional tools to, unintentionally or not, draw the support of the public. As the end of ""Private Ryan"" proclaims - a film which rapes pre-WW2 history as expertly as this current crop of Gulf War 2 films distorts post-WW2 history - we must ""earn this"", because ""they"" went through ""hell for you"". And so we pin ribbons on our heroes and build altars to our everyman Christs, praising them for protecting us from ""evil"". But the truth is we owe our uniformed Christs absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>By focusing their narratives on ""exceptions to the rule"", these films serve the purpose of preventing us from asking truly important questions. They avoid any context, political or otherwise, and are content to simply focus on ordinary people being affected by the sudden and violent intrusion of History. But it is a History without a Cause. It is History without Context. It is History without Meaning or Motive. That the majority of the hijackers belonged to a repressive country and puppet state armed and backed by the United States is ignored. That - as social scientists like Robert Page and others demonstrate in their analyses of all major terrorist acts over the past half century - terrorism is never religiously motivated but always designed for reasons of autonomy or national liberation, is likewise ignored.<br/><br/>The result of such things are three fold. Firstly, such art helps to bolster a virtual threat; an invisible, spectral enemy. The covert message of such mythology is that this omniscient threat of Terror legitimises our obscene measures of self-defence.<br/><br/>The second result of such art is to convey a sense of national victimhood. Such victimhood is itself a contradictory force. It provides us with the moral basis for retaliation and power accumulation...and yet such a power can only be acquired once one feigns weakness. Thirdly, in the guise of apoliticism, such art engenders a very specific type of passivity and acceptance. When the monster attacks, one just does one's duty. Such a reaction is automatic, even sacrificial, because trust (and a righteous belief in one's self, one's government etc) is understood.<br/><br/>Bizarrely, both films also exude strange, almost spiritual overtones. Terrorists are portrayed as angels of death, spectral enemies who sweep down from the heavens, and the directors also refuse to show planes actually crashing into buildings. To confront the actual crash almost seems too painful, too sacrilegious. <br/><br/>2/10 - Worth no viewings."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>September 11, 2001 (a day that was always going to get made into a feature film and what better time to do it than on the fifth anniversary.) A day that started as ordinarily as any other. People woke up in the morning, kissed their families goodbye and headed out to earn another honest day's crust and to go about their business as ordinarily as they ever would. None of them had any idea about the unthinkable events that would unfold as the day went on. When the first planes hit the building, a rescue mission was launched headed up by firemen and some brave members of the NYPD. They go in to rescue those trapped in the rubble, only for the building to come crashing down around them, trapping them underneath. This story focuses on two of those trapped, Captain John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Seargent Will Jemeno (Michael Pena) and their never-ending hope and determination to survive as those on the outside struggle desperately to bring them out alive.<br/><br/>As I said, it was only a matter of time before a film depicting the events on that fateful day in September of 2001 was made. And what better time to make it than on the fifth anniversary? <br/><br/>Notorious Hollywood hack Oliver Stone, a man who's made his fare share of greats in his time, from JFK to Platoon, but who has also made some quite rotten stinkers including Natural Born Killers and Any Given Sunday, to his credit pulls off the job at hand very well here. The films falters sometimes, but generally it avoids verging into sappy sentimentality and flag waving and instead just concentrates on crafting a poignant, realistic, engrossing, believable and effecting portrayal of events as they likely panned out on that day. It's not quite United 93 we're talking here and it's not quite as good as that film but, thankfully, it's not far off.<br/><br/>He gives the film a dash of gloss and reverence but I don't think Nicolas Cage was the right man for the job in the lead role here. Portraying a real life character in a real life event, he can't relate his snazzy, eccentric edge he gives his characters to the role, and comes off as a bit forced and restrained as a result. Thankfully, the supporting cast manage to keep things alive and kicking in the background, providing a raw edge to how the characters they are playing must have felt on that awful day.<br/><br/>The film pulls no punches and goes all out to provide a true and accurate account of what happened on that day and how those involved reacted to it. Sometimes it falters and becomes a little sentimental and mushy, especially towards the end as the script starts to run out of steam a little, but generally it keeps things going very well and has given Stone a more appreciative place in my conscious when he could very well have made a big and offensive mess of it as he has in the past. ****"

","Whatever happened to the critical Oliver Stone? I was expecting a movie that would make people think about what brought this tragedy upon people of the U.S., in the way Platoon or Born on the 4th of July questioned what the US was doing in Vietnam.<br/><br/>I also was expecting WTC would give us an opportunity to listen to voices that are not represented in mainstream media.<br/><br/>Instead, we got more of the same. It was more like an extended episode of 60 minutes.<br/><br/>Also, Stone shows an unusual revengeful facet that unsuccessfully attempts to provide arguments for the tragedies that the US has imposed to the world on the basis of a war against terror.<br/><br/>There are indeed traits in this movie that prove once again Stone's craftsmanship, but that is not the main motivation to go see one of his movies.<br/><br/>I would think that if it was still not time to present critical views of the 9/11 tragedy, then it was not time for a Stone movie."

","""Oliver Stone has made a comeback,"" that's what one critic ranted about shortly after the release of this film in a review. Gone were the thousands of quick cuts and the multiple uses of film stock (although there is the use of actual footage in some scenes); or his trademark overuse of the same talent (John C. McGinley, Michael Wincott, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore). This was actually a film that could of been done by any director-for-hire, but Stone also used one of his other trademarks and that was to cast Hollywood heavyweight and rising actors like Nicholas Cage, Maria Bello, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Pena and Jay Hernandez. And that is what distinguished itself from the other 9/11 movie out this year, ""Flight 93."" The result of this endeavor was a fair film that only captured the story of two trapped PAPD officers and their families on that infamous day of U.S. history since Pearl Harbor. Stone did not use any gratuitous violence and instead kept it taut and tasteful. It makes me wonder if there were constraints on Stone from the financiers and studio with just how much of the film he could add his personal touches to, and if he received some ""parental guidance"" in this one (like Stanley Kubrick so desperately needed at times). Because this film does not seem or scream a typical Oliver Stone film. <br/><br/>And because of the concentration on only two characters and their families in the story, that was one of the reasons why this film felt very much like a movie-of-the-week. It also did not feel as significant of an event such as 9/11 at times, and instead seemed more like another disaster film at times due to the extreme close-ups with Cage and Pena trapped in the rubble of the Twin Towers. The film ends on a happier and hopeful note (which again, is taboo for Oliver Stone), but at the same time the viewer feels as if the lives of the others are dismissed as if it were an Irwin Allen-produced disaster movie of the seventies, and only the immediate survivors show any importance. Only at the closing credits are the deceased and those missing on September 11, 2001 acknowledged.<br/><br/>One of my biggest complaints with this picture was that Stone did not use a bigger scope in terms of storytelling as he did with films like ""Any Given Sunday"" and ""Nixon."" Perhaps Mr. Stone is not fit to do mainstream or tame films. I just hope that he does not think he should do a comedy based on the strength of this film's success."

","Hot on the heels of ""United 93"" (arguably the best film of 2006), comes Oliver Stone's 9/11 drama ""World Trade Center"". Two New York City port authority police officers (Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena) get trapped as the first tower crumbles to the ground and we get a human drama that transcends time and the overall tragedy of that fateful day. The two men think about their lives and loves as their wives (Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal) cope with the very real possibilities that their husbands will not ever come home again. Stone's picture lacks the intensity and nervous feelings generated by ""United 93"", but the human interest is right on key. Stone, a noted conspiracy theorist who always has his ear to the pavement, decides to go the opposite route here and focus on the way that we joined together and raised up as one as buildings fell to the ground and changed the world forever. Sometimes difficult to watch and flawed, ""World Trade Center"" is still a memorable and important picture that will have significant historical and personal value as the years pass. 4 stars out of 5."
"Mxzplk","6","1","5","23 September 2006"," Oliver Stone gives up controversy and takes off any personality from World Trade Center
","Will Jimeno, rookie cop of the Port Authority of New York, and his sergeant, John McLoughlin, were survivals number 18 and 19 to be extracted from the rubbles of the World Trade Center, in September 11 of 2001. After them, only one more victim would be found alive. 20 people saved, against 2 749 fatal victims. That is the kind of statistics that suggests predestination and heroism that leads to, in a appropriated scale, a story with a high tone ending. Exactly the masterpiece, at last, that could interest a large studio dedicated into making a film that doesn't dishonor the facts, and that yet the public still wants to see. The most curious thing is that a project like this ended up in the hands of a director like Oliver Stone, known for his excesses, his conspiracy theories and his explosives political inclinations. But in World Trade Center (2006), the director does whatever possible to brake himself. Shows the two cops leaving their houses while their wives and kids are still sleeping. Follow them from start to what appears to be a normal day and, after, in the confusion of the emergence call. Bury them in great style and follow them in their mutual effort to stay alive, as well as their families, that are unaware of their destiny. Result: of two so specific stories such as of Jimeno and McLoughin (respectivelly Michael Penã and Nicolas Cage) it is made a narrative so absolutely generic - a sort of Apollo 13 on Ground Zero.<br/><br/>This confusion between respect and dull-ness (that former director Paul Greengrass skillfully avoided in United 93) is what makes World Trade Center so unsatisfactory. Fearfull of being accused of sensationalism, Stone suppressed all and any shots of the towers themselves. either of the impact of the airplanes, either of the collapse. Alleges that these images have nothing more to offer - and that is saying a lot more of his fear that he has today of his instincts to controversy then of the emotional spirit of the audience regarding the tragedy. In several interviews to the press and critics, the director said that his intentions were to portray the moment before the politicalization of the attacks, when the world was still on the same side of the Americans. It is highly doubtful that, considering the scenes of commemoration in arab countries immediately after the fact, that he believes what he is saying. The most likely is that he is trying to re-invent himself as a non-political being. And teethless: a film-maker with less past would have less motives to retreat, and would have served history better."

It did not take long before i found myself to be board and searching for something to do. I saw a preview for World Trade Center on the t.v. around noon and the preview did what it was supposed to do. It made me go into our kitchen and get out the newspaper, there was a 1:00 show and i really wanted to see it. I felt kind of weird about going to the movies by myself because i had never done that before and i knew my girl wanted to see it too and she would be (and was) mad that i went to see it without her. Finally i decided to go see it and for whatever reason i had to see it right that moment. I got to the theater and there was only about 12 people tops (including myself)and some other people were there by themselves so i didn't feel as dumb as i thought i would. I really wanted to see the movie because it is something that happened during my life and a day we all will never forget, i wanted to get a feel for what these two very brave men went through although i knew it was nothing nice and that the movie would be very sad and if at all happy it would be a happy sad. The movie was Phenomenal i sat by myself a 25 year old man and cried my eyes out at like 4 or 5 different parts. The movie was so good and i got so into it i basically put myself in the shoes of these characters and i cant even describe in words how great of a movie it was. All i do have to say is i think it is your duty as an American to go see this film. Obviously we all will never forget the tragic events that took place that day and sometimes we probably don't even want to think about that because of how truly sad and devastating it was, but we as Americans who are not from New York (im from Milwaukee, Wi) and were not actually there that day have to see this. Get into the film put yourself in their shoes and you will get somewhat of a better visual idea of how it may have felt to be there that day. It is sad but there is also a happy sad type moment when the two officers are pulled from the wreckage and their families become aware that they are indeed alive. Please see this movie, there is no possible way you can be disappointed the movie makes you sad, makes you cry, makes you proud to be an Amerian and that is what a good movie should make you feel. Don't go see something stupid don't waste $8.75 or whatever the cost is in your city on some movie that is not World Trade Center because if you are an American then you need to see this movie and if you don't see it at all whether at the theater or at home then shame on you."
"recycledlyrics","7","1","5","21 August 2006"," White washing in Hollywood
","Some of you may already know about the controversy in regards to the true identity of one of the heroes portrayed in the Oliver Stone's film World Trade Center (2006) The portrayal Mr. Thomas as a white individual was a disservice. I truly believe that Paramount had to have been aware that he is African American. I consider this to be another example of Hollywood white washing! At the very least, the men he rescued knew he was black, the other marine knew that he was black. Plus I am pretty certain that that information was relayed to the movie makers. For this reason I am boycotting the film. Even if they could not reach Mr. Thomas while making the movie, I strongly believe that they were certain of one fact; Mr. Thomas is a Black man. Now before some of you send a little heat my way I will say this I come from a mixed home, my intention has nothing to do with playing any kind of ""race card"" I just feel that a film claiming to be ""accurate"" in detail should be held accountable. This isn't a case where they casted people to play the part regardless of race. They intentionally set out to hire a white actor. Unfortunately, America's views of what a hero should look like has never been what I would consider racially unbiased. Would you or wouldn't you agree that there are many qualified black actors that would probably have been elated to have had that part? Just look at the ""Production Notes"" for this film, quite a lot of detail is given to things like the accurate colors of things and shadows and the like. So how could Mr. Thomas's ethnicity simply have been overlooked? It would only make common sense that attention to the color of a man's skin would be accurate too? The fact Paramount and Producer Michael Shamberg did wrong is history, it's in the past. What can be done now to redeem it? To ""remake"" the movie at this time is not practical and they likely won't do that. What they CAN DO is add Mr. Jason Thomas' name AND PICTURE to the credits. And assure that any future remakes of the film will have a black actor for accurate portrayal. I urge some of you who feel as passionate about the situation as I do to find an address and or email, contact these people and tell them to set things straight!!! I, a Native New Yorker, watched as my friends fell apart after losing loved ones during 9/11. I felt the loss through them but could do nothing to cure their pain. I understand that this movie is an emotional one. I am in no way trying to dishonor what so many have suffered through. America should remember what happened on that day- I only wish that this story had been told accurately.<br/><br/><ul><li>Nisa</li></ul>"

","We all know that the World Trade Center incident was a tragic event. Fortunately, having not lost anyone I cannot truly empathize with anyone and while I am sympathetic toward the message this film intends to portray, I personally believe that the tragic loss of life is not something we need to be reminded of.<br/><br/>I understand that this movie does not put emphasis on this, that it does so on the points of courage and freedom, the strength of the human spirit and I appreciate that. However, I feel that this movie, more so than anything else, plays on the emotions of us Americans for success. My fear is that this production will generate revenue based on sympathy, that it will sort of guilt trip us all into seeing it rather than it reeling us in by being a great movie in its own right. I cannot say for certain what the intentions of the cast and crew are, whether the director wanted to make a film to inspire and strengthen us or to play on an emotionally turbulent country to fill his pockets.<br/><br/>I do not intend to degrade the meaning of the film. I just do know that its in human nature to be greedy. I'm hoping that this is not the case. I'm just afraid that this movie intends to guilt-trip us into seeing it and turning out to be an over-dramatized hollywoodized film like Pearl Harbor.

","I recently was in the United States and thus decided to take some time out to watch the World Trade Center movie, before making my way back to the United Kingdom.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to seeing this movie for a number of reasons. One due to the fact that I am a budding historian, and enjoy films based around true events, that have shaped our lives. 9/11 has definitely had an impact on the way we live and work today. At the same time, one can in some ways not enjoy this film as you would any other, due to the nature of the events that the movie is based on.<br/><br/>After seeing United 93, which I thought was a very thought out movie, I had high expectations. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I felt that the start of the film was incredibly rushed, and did not really focus enough on what actually happened on that day. The story seemed to really start from the towers collapsing. It would have been more interesting to see more of the time before the towers actually collapsed. This is really the major thing that let this movie down for me, other than that the movie was alright. Nothing special, but alright.<br/><br/>However, the impact on this part missing for me was so big that I could not get back into the movie, and did not enjoy watching it."

But the power of the performances by Cage and Pena and their screen wives carried the movie home. The real life courage of the rescuers provided the power behind that.<br/><br/>The only element I did not like was the unnecessary coda at the end in which the Cage character suddenly is a voice-over narrator, mouthing platitudes. The movie is its own message, it needed no moral to the story ending."

","Before I start out with the review, I would just like to make clear that I am not anti-America in any way. I just think it needs to be said that this movie is just... not very good. Which is a shame, because the premise had lots of potential: we are, after all, talking about one of the first major dramatic events in the Western World at the dawn of the 21st century.<br/><br/>If this movie didn't have the WTC label on it, I doubt it would have been picked up as a script. For a disaster movie, it just is just LACKING in a lot of critical areas.<br/><br/>The movie starts out excellent: a new day rises over NY, a cop wakes up and goes to work, where he meets his partners. They get called in to the WTC. The place is falling apart around them as they try to rescue the people inside. They get buried alive. So far, the movie is pretty captivating. But then it goes wrong: <br/><br/>-The focus.<br/><br/>So, The entire movie focuses on 2 cops and their families who are waiting at home, eating themselves. We get some real footage (that didn't really fit well) some news footage and a Bush speech thrown in, as well. Couple of nice effects of the tower collapsing, too.<br/><br/>But it isn't enough. I was expecting to see it from the start. To see how the planes got hijacked, the scared people on board, the terrorists as they flew into the buildings. Indeed, the crash or the planes themselves are never even shown, just a lame shadow effect and a couple of loud bangs. Wow. They sure cut corners in the graphical department here. We don't see the planes going into the buildings, there isn't enough footage of the towers burning, and then collapsing. This is supposed to be about 9/11, right? How the towers were attacked? Well how about SHOWING US THE BLOODY CRASH?! This was a golden opportunity and they MISSED it. And what about all the other people who died, the people in the planes, what about all the victims on the top floors. Don't we get to meet them? <br/><br/>-The cast.<br/><br/>Sure, Nicolas Cage is a great actor, but... wait a sec? Is that the chick who got spanked by her boss in that S&M-themed movie, ''Secretary''? What the hell is she doing in a movie about the WTC? I can't see her as an innocent pregnant woman after seeing THAT flick, sorry. And a lot of the other family members looked like they had never seen a camera before. With a big movie like this, shouldn't there be some bigger names in it? <br/><br/>-The misplaced religious stuff.<br/><br/>What? Why are we looking at some guy sitting in a church, looking at a giant cross? Why is Jesus in this film? Don't get me wrong, I respect Christians, but this was just plain... weird. At one point I thought they were actually mocking the religion itself. Something about Jesus holding a bottle of water, and how he was trying to tell them to hold on. Are these writers on drugs? What does this have to do with anything? It was just more padding. This movie could have lasted an hour without all the useless scenes. They didn't put in the planes but they had room for some extremely vague dialogue and scenes like this?<br/><br/>-The dramatic scenes.<br/><br/>It wasn't all bad. There was some powerful stuff in here, like how the blond wife was fantasizing about how her husband was in his workshop while he was teaching his son to saw. Nicolas talking to his wife while half-awake was good. The woman at the hospital who's son got buried: good.<br/><br/>But what's up with the stupid children. Some angry kid keeps telling his mom to go look for his dad, in a collapsed building, with lots of dangerous debris and pitfalls? Is he insane? He is clearly past the age of 10, so he should know better than this. Or the hilarious subplot about what to name one of the guy's unborn child. Useless banter. Shouldn't we be focusing on the main plot? Maybe? <br/><br/>-The comedy.<br/><br/>This film is supposed to be a drama. Unfortunately, I, and most of the theater with me, laughed out loud when one of the officer's gun was starting to fire on it's own. Was that intentional? A big OOPS moment...<br/><br/>-The happy ending.<br/><br/>Yeah, the cops got rescued, and their families are happy. Years later they are still celebrating. A perfect ending to any random disaster movie.<br/><br/>However, this movie is about the WTC TERRORIST ATTACKS. For thousands of people, there was no happy ending AT ALL. It must have been an enormous slap in the face for all the people who's loved ones died that day, to watch... this.<br/><br/>You guessed it, I didn't come out of the theater very pleased. This movie was a very forgettable experience, and doesn't do the subject ANY JUSTICE at all. Somebody should have stepped in and rewritten the script. What a waste, what a waste..."

My dad lived most of his life as an EMT here in Kentucky. It's just that with a title and with a topic so broad, all should have be incorporated into the film.

A wonderful aspect of this movie is about showing America at its best after such a horrible tragedy. This being said however, the movie just didn't work for me.<br/><br/>Many of the scenes involving the family seemed unnecessarily stretched out. Horrific as the situations involving the main characters were, their scenes seemed a bit repetitive and again, drawn out. This movie was more 'situational' - not much happened in this movie as far as action. The disaster effects were pretty minimal. I was surprised that the whole movie seemed to have a low-budget feel - a surprise given the talent involved.<br/><br/>I did like seeing their reproduction of the ground-level area of one of the WTC buildings. Seeing the shops and modern structures gave me a greater insight / feel of what it was like to actually be there. Also amazing was to see what was going on in the lobby/ground level. It almost seemed like a 'safe zone' for those coming from above. I also liked learning of the determination and 'can-do' attitude of the US Marines character.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this movie could have been made much better. It's a tough one though - sensitive subject matter, so perhaps it ended up being what it was due to an over-focus on just one situation at the cost of avoiding everything else. I recommend seeing documentary versions of the 9/11 survivor stories instead."

However, once I had time to reflect on it, I realized the real substance is missing from the film, and my grade has dropped accordingly. What's the point the film tries to convey? We saw two people who were just walking, hadn't helped anybody to escape before getting stuck under the rubble, and they spent the next couple of hours talking to each other to keep themselves alive, and they got rescued. They are survivors, not heroes, and that shouldn't be the spirit of a 9/11 film. When I think of 9/11, I thought about heroism, chaos, and people who were killed on that day. United 93 touched on all, while World Trade Center showed very little.

Except, over 60 million dollars was wasted on this and it didn't even make a million dollars. The families and survivors would have been better off if Mr Stone just drove vans filled with the money wasted on this up to their doors. I would have had more respect for him than I do after watching this waste of time and money. I doubt any of them have watched it because they know what happened to themselves or their loved ones. I really hope some of those actors gave their money made from this to the families and survivors. How disappointing (I can't believe this got any reviews above 5 that weren't driven by national pride or feelings of guilt)."

","I've TRIED to like Nicolas Cage - believe me,I've tried - but the man Is so boring and totally un-versatile It's like seeing the same character In every last thing he's been In! The fact that his real name Is Coppola (Yes,his Dads' brother Is Francis Ford Coppola)and that he alleges to have changed his name to 'avoid the connection and make It on his own merit',he nevertheless had his career kick-started by his uncle Francis. In short,two hours of him being stuck under a pile of rubble Is enough for him to show his entire gamut of acting 'skills'. Now,to the Movie Itself. An absolute pile of flag-waving garbage - and that's about It,really. We might,of course,ask - 'what the hell was the huge, $63,000,000 budget spent on' (other than lining the pockets of Cage and Co.)? I've tried to work It out but other than a few million cups of expensive coffee for the cast and crew,well,who knows? There's just nothing good to be said about this embarrassing pile of Cinematic refuse. Oliver stone - and Mr.Cage,of course - must have been laughing all the way to the bank. If anyone outside of the 'good old US of A' has anything good to say about It, It'll be a miracle. Don't waste your time on this....and demand a refund."
"DegustateurDeChocolat","5","0","3","20 May 2013"," Disappointing Movie by Stone
","I decided to watch this movie because Oliver Stone is a guarantee of a quality movie. However, I was very disappointed by it since the plot, the events and the characters are those of a classic average movie with the predictable American happy ending. To be honest, if I hadn't known it, I would never have guessed it was an Oliver Stone movie. The director of many good movies like Talk Radio, JFK, Any Given Sunday and W. usually gives an original and very personal cut to his pictures, but this time he totally fails to give such a touch and instead he winds up being banal and predictable. Plus, the plot is boring and not at all entertaining, with big part of the movie shot in the dark of the debris of the WTC where the two Policemen are trapped."
"pinokiyo","1","0","6","17 November 2012"," HORRENDOUS acting. EVERYTHING is over-the-top CHEESINESS. Jesus? ANNOYING film. GARBAGE. Please burn this film.
","I'm going to say it straight.<br/><br/>The acting by EVERYONE in this film is soooo HORRENDOUS it's unbelievable.<br/><br/>You can tell all the actors really have absolutely NO empathy at all, thus the result of their performance.<br/><br/>EVERYONE in this film is PLASTIC and FLAT. It's really disgusting to watch.<br/><br/>They ALL sound like they're literally reading off a script right in front of them, as if they're looking at a sign that says ACT SAD - ACT MAD.<br/><br/>If you actually feel emotion from these plastic performances, I'm sorry but you're just as pathetic.<br/><br/>It's like a film made by student actors. Seriously. Did they just all have only one acting rehearsal and just use the first take? I don't blame solely on all the actors. The director is mainly responsible. It's BAD directing. It's like the director just asked them to act ""SAD"" or scream. It's a total flat play on human emotions.<br/><br/>It is like watching a soap drama; if you're into that then maybe you can tolerate this movie. They show Jesus in the film. Are you serious? They try to make everything so over-the-top, but it's just NONSENSE. TRASH.<br/><br/>This is an absolute disgrace and disrespect to the innocent people that died on that day. This film comes off more of a mockery. Even if you were to take away the atrocious acting, the chalkboard-screech-screaming annoyance, it's a disgrace they make a story about *WORLD* Trade Center just about two police officers being trapped. It's like nobody else mattered. <br/><br/>And please, I respect all the innocent people who tragically died on that day and I will NEVER forget that day. I don't understand why some people think questioning 9/11 and asking for the actual truth (there are still more questions than answers) shows disrespect, when in fact, people who just eat up lies instead are allowing them to die in vain.<br/><br/>That being said, films like this spreading TOTAL PROPAGANDA is a greater disrespect to EVERYONE. I understand some people rather live a lie and can't handle the truth -- don't want to hear anything about 9/11 and the word 'conspiracy' going together.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, films like this and United 93 is pure PROPAGANDA (maybe it's not so obvious to some of you like it's watching 'Triumph of the Will' but it's happening in current times). Clearly, the cheesy dialogues and scenarios are FABRICATED for more drama/impact and BRAINWASHING the public. The film United 93 is a propaganda done more in a believable way (the ending of that film is definitely intense), but it is still what it is: Propaganda. It's not the first time the US tried to create a fake heroic image (look up Jessica Lynch) and release a movie about it.<br/><br/>You don't take FACTS from Hollywood films. It's the LAST place you learn anything. It's just purely entertainment 99% of the time.<br/><br/>Are you going to watch Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor and actually believe THAT is what Pearl Harbor was really about? NO. But there's a lot of lazy Americans who don't take the time to really QUESTION, and just eat up information just because it's coming from our own government/TV. That is why those people are referred to as a Sheep. Of course we all take news from the TV when it first happens, I'm not saying that makes one a sheep, but even after all the years and new questions/answers have come out, and people STILL decide to ignore it, then yes, that does make them one.<br/><br/>Ask yourself these questions: There's many surveillance cameras around the Pentagon area. They were all confiscated. Why? They cannot prove it. You'll be surprised how many people are ignorant about a third World Trade Center collapsing that day. Why? Because the media didn't want to focus too much on that. It's a major red flag. Buildings do not collapse like that. That is a FACT. ALL evidences show, United 93 and Flight 77, had hardly any pieces on the ground. Plane crashes do not disintegrate and just leave a small hole. EVERYTHING that happened that day was an unusual phenomenon. Give me a break. When was the last time a commercial plane was actually hijacked? FOUR planes successfully hijacked and allowed to be in the cockpit? Not to mention pulling off unthinkable maneuvers at low altitudes that even the most trained pilot would not be able to replicate (I'm talking about Flight 77). What do you all people think about the Bush Administration? They were very trusting weren't they? It's just a sheer coincidence that the Bush Administration's think tank, PNAC, was hoping for a ""A NEW PEARL HARBOR"" an year before? It should be obvious when you add everything together and it doesn't make sense that we had a war in Iraq. Look who really benefited through all this. Watch the film ""Wag the Dog"" instead of this garbage if you still can't understand. It isn't a first time a President lied to America. Did we all forget how strongly Clinton tried to lie to America about his affair? Nixon? Ignorance is bliss.<br/><br/>Isn't it convenient how they allegedly kill off Bin Laden and he doesn't stand a trial or anything. The perfect scapegoat, the Boogeyman, came and went that helped both administrations (previous and current) in office. His body is also washed to the sea. Give me a break. So let's brainwash the public into believing this lie even more by having another movie an year later. We'll soon be getting another wide-release propaganda film called ""Zero Dark Thirty"" about Bin Laden. It's obvious from the trailers, it's just another popcorn drama propaganda flick. I wouldn't be surprised that film will brainwash more people about ""finding Bin Laden"". <br/><br/>Please start waking up people. Let's at least stop supporting crappy films like this being made."
"BeneCumb","6","0","1","12 October 2012"," With reference to Oliver Stone - rather mediocre
","Of course, the topic is difficult, painful and most of viewers remember this or can revive the live events via Youtube or similar channels... But female characters (performed by Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello) are over-dramatized; families and friends of those who work within rescue, military, and police should be - and usually are - always prepared for the worst as those jobs are dangerous everywhere. And the women having children with them must be strong and realistic, not panicking around and letting off steam on relatives.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage could have obtained more screen time, so the real stars for me are 2 Michaels: Pena and Shannon (though the part of the latter is relatively small).<br/><br/>Pre-rescue scenes under ground are too long, dull and hard to watch due to darkness. Tensions are not highly maintained throughout the over 2 hours... As a whole, the movie is too lengthy - not surprisingly, Mr Stone is known for long and epic works - but still I think that World Trade Center is one of the weakest movies Stone has directed."
"morphricky","1","0","2","21 July 2012"," Audio-book or movie?
","This movie obviously have good intentions when the actual survivors helped write this, but in the end, it left me unaffected and bored.<br/><br/>I actually had to stop the movie once and watch it a couple of days later. This is a movie right? It feels more like an audio-book since more than half of the movie takes place in darkness. You can barely make out the people on screen and I actually felt relieved in the scene where fire comes flying by the actors. Finally we can see something! Of course the fire dies out and the screen turns so dark I can see my own reflection. I have seen plenty of other movies and documentaries where people are trapped and it really doesn't need to be this dark. <br/><br/>The script is a complete disaster. When Jimeno is brought to the hospital and his wife talks to him... I actually felt bad for the actors. It was so cheesy and so predictable it made me cringe. In fact, most of the script in this movie is either incredibly cheesy or way over the top. I felt bad for McLoughlin having to listen to Jimeno while they are trapped, his voice becomes nails on a chalkboard. So as you can imagine: Having to listen to that grating voice while you can barely make out the characters or anything on the screen... ugh!<br/><br/>I feel bad writing this as I know the two wives helped write this, but I found both their characters annoying. And their relatives were as well, especially Jimenos relatives. They seemed to come from those comedies where the in-laws/relatives are obnoxious and pure horror to be around. One of Donnas children comes off as a spoiled brat with no manners and the rest of the children are fillers with no personality. Heck, even the wives themselves have no personality, they are just whining and crying that they are missing their husbands. When they are reunited with their husbands I felt nothing! The only character who seemed remotely like-able and I wanted to give a hug was the black woman at the hospital. And she was on the screen for tops 5 minutes. Maggie's character (who I honestly can't remember the name of) is apparently so distraught that her relatives gets her medication to prevent a miscarriage, but you never get the feeling of her being this distressed. Most of the time she just walks around with the same expression on her face, you can never tell what she is feeling. When they actually suggest to the character the medication she just seems like she would say ""Okay, sure."" with a shrug on the shoulders. But because of her constant devoid staring, I have no clue what the character was supposed to feel.<br/><br/>I feel this movie would have been much better if the movie had started with developing the families in their every day life, then have the disaster and them worried about their husbands. These random flashbacks while they are trapped makes it very hard to relate to anyone of them. <br/><br/>I'm sure the real people are a lot more interesting than portrayed in this movie and I felt more sorry for the people involved by reading about the survivors on Wikipedia than while watching this ""audio-book"" devoid of emotion."
"Fielga","6","0","1","27 May 2012"," Movie a 3, special features a 6
","Just to get the full disclosure out of the way, I cannot think of one Nicolas Cage performance that I can stand. For whatever reason, everything he does is counter to what I enjoy seeing. Whether or not that has an impact on my rating of this film, I'm really not sure. Just wanted to get that out of the way for honesty's sake.<br/><br/>Now on to the movie itself! The beginning seemed to hold promise for a few minutes, but there's just something unpleasant about the way it was filmed that makes watching it a painful experience. And for me, it wasn't painful in a sympathetic or patriotic way, just painful in a ""wow this movie isn't any good"" kind of way. It has very few redeeming points to it for me. The acting wasn't awful (Cage being the exception, but refer to my opening disclaimer for that one), the script was passable enough, the camera work was mediocre, it just left me with an overall feeling of ""meh.""<br/><br/>If there's anything good that I can say for the movie, I did enjoy how it focused on the interaction of these two men and how they managed to survive rather than focusing on the source of their predicament. In many ways it can be called more of a personal drama film than a film about September eleventh.<br/><br/>However, I strongly suggest watching the movie with the commentary on. One of those who narrates through it is Will Jimeno and it was really an enriching and touching experience to hear all that he had to say about his experiences. The special features are significantly more valuable than the movie itself."
"kayikonii","Null","0","1","17 September 2011"," A late comer who shouldn't have bothered
","I had yet to see this movie, and as the 10 year mark for Sept 11th came around, I remembered that I had yet to see it. So I got my hands on it to watch. Expecting something completely different then what I saw. I am very into the history and human events that happened on 9/11. I have been moved to tears many times, but this story about the two cops was one I missed.. and so I thought I might get a sense of how they dealt with the day.<br/><br/>The first 15 mins of the movie were somewhat able to pull me in. I felt that everything was being rushed way to quickly. You are not really able to feel like you know what point in time these guys are dealing with because they almost refuse to really show any shots of the towers themselves. Only A couple. They never once showed tower 2 being hit. Just made a tiny comment about it through a game of 'telephone' on the bus they are all in. It was a very powerful moment in that day. To just glance over it like they did felt strange to me. That was when the film started to lose it and detach itself from the real events. Maybe Oliver was trying to make us feel that way.. since many of the first responders had no clue was what going on. However, we know what happened. So to not touch in on those things.. made the movie feel detached. Like someone else said.. I saw the French men documentary where they filmed both inside and outside the towers. The brother that was inside.. was able to capture how in the dark the fire fighters were.. While the brother outside, showed us what was really going on. So you were able to understand our public side of the events, and the firefighters. They also filmed the towers coming down.. inside tower one! And it was more moving and gripping then this movie.<br/><br/>They get to the building, and again, you have no idea at what point they got there since they don't show any wide shots of the buildings. They try and throw the time line out at you through quick lines that feel rushed. Then they walk around kind of mindlessly under the buildings. Then the first tower comes down. This part was very powerful. As it at least ties into something that actually happened. And it's something we know happened... .after that however, the movie almost completely detaches from the tragic event it is supposed to be a story of. Stone had more then enough things to grab onto to help this story along, but he ignored all of them. I even forgot I was watching a movie about Sept 11th. They do not show any of the rescues really. OR the fighting done by the firemen and first responders, to try and find people. Unless you personally know what happened on that day, you have no idea about how devastating the entire event was in this movie. He didn't' have to make a story about the fire fighters, but to not address them at all, further detaches from the real 9/11 day. If he bothered to display the horror that happened, THEN showed these two men were able to make it out alive, would have added more weight and depth to their story.<br/><br/>The acting.. was disappointing. These are all professional actors, yet this was like acting in a bad play. I did not see one tear fall from any of the wife's eyes at any time in this movie. Though they -pretended- to cry. The only person who even moved me at ALL was the mother of the man who ran the elevators in tower 2. Her very small moment and emotion in that moment... completely blew away all the other actors out of the water. It made their acting even more painful to deal with. Maggie was all over the place and devoid of any real emotion. I could tell she was an actress trying to act these things. I never once felt like she was a wife who was upset about her husband.<br/><br/>All and all, this movie was just discussing. I'm watching it 10 years after Sept 11th, and I'm insulted by it. I'm insulted because Stone had the ability to tell a great story here about an event that changed America... and he completely flushed it down the toilet and threw out some really bad made for cable TV movie that barely even makes you feel like it's trying to tell any story about 9/11. I would rather watch the real PA cops talk about their ordeal then watch this drivel again. Oliver should be ashamed of himself making this. It's insulting and the fact that it fails to even be touching to such an event, makes the movie feel like it's nothing more then trying to make money from one of the worst days in American history. If he had used his money and time to do a movie that had a point and touched on something real.. then maybe I could see why the movie was made. But since it was a cheap, bad acting job.. clearly it's just a movie that was made... just to try and profit off of 9/11.. and I'm insulted."
"SgtPluck","2","0","1","11 September 2011"," Disaster Movie in every possible sense
","As part of RTE's excellent coverage of the 9/11 anniversary, they showed World Trade Center as the Midweek Movie. I normally love to slaughter terrible films, but the subject manner of this and the presence of World's Greatest Actor Nicolas Cage meant I went into this hoping to be moved by it. Sadly this was not to be the case. 9/11 may be the most important event of the last 20 years but this felt like a made-for-TV disaster movie from the early 80's starring Paul Newman, whose expressions throughout the film manage to convey both the boredom of ""contractual obligation"" and fear of ""career suicide"".<br/><br/>The film starts promisingly enough,with the calm before the storm of the morning on 9/11 being conveyed with an appealing sense of menace(planes flying overhead, a rundown of the firemen so you can guess who will be dead by the end, family lives established). However, the disaster is fairly poorly handled, with the insertion of archive footage of the attack making it look more like a 50's B-Movie than Oliver Stone probably intended.<br/><br/>Once the firefighters are trapped under, the film takes a horrible turn for the melodramatic, with Nicolas Cage's gloriously entertaining overacting style being a terrible fit to the character of an ordinary man in a nightmarish situation. His shrieking and shouting bring to mind the infamous ""THE BEES"" scene from the 2006 ""The Wicker Man"" remake (possibly the best film I've ever seen remade as possibly the worst film I've ever seen.) rather than any actual fear or pain.<br/><br/>The family lives of the two men are every bit as ridiculous, with the obligatory small-child-makes-the-parent-see-the-truth scene, which is so badly handled here that it makes your skin crawl. Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal do what they can with the characters, who are so underwritten as to be cast-offs from US daytime soaps with dialogue to match, with every line written to maximise hysterics and manipulate emotions. I find it hard to believe that the firemen's wives on 9/11 went through the whole day with perfect hair and make-up.<br/><br/>As well as this,the film's attempts to convey the scale of the attacks are cringeworthy, with CGI shots pulling away to indicate the smoke from Ground Zero billowing into space having the feeling of a music video. The film's main redeeming characteristic comes in noticing the smaller details of the chaos of the day,such as deserted supermarkets and people covered in dust in police station waiting rooms. Had it focused more on this, it could well have been a better film ,rather than the schizoid mess of disaster movie blockbuster and serious drama we ended up with, with the worst aspects of both and none of the best. It's like a 70's disaster movie but not even fun. In fact ""TERRORIST!"" starring George Kennedy would probably have been a better film. In fact if you'd edited 9/11 footage into The Towering Inferno starring the now-dead Steve McQueen and Paul Newman it'd be a better film.<br/><br/>There is one film that gets what 9/11 must have been like for those there on the day. It's from 2006 as well, and it's called United 93, focusing on the passengers of the United 93 flight which crashed into a field in Pennsylvania. It has none of the gloss which so disastrously mars World Trade Center, and is all the better for not using recognisable actors, CGI or attempting to give the audience any spectacle. 9/11 is a lot better served by such fare than nonsense like this."
"jeddjong","8","0","1","20 February 2011"," Oliver Stone turns respectful and sensitive in this solemn and well-told tribute
","Touching, humane, scrupulous and realistic. Not words that are usually heard describing an Oliver Stone film, with all due respect to the director. Despite the extremely touchy subject matter (or perhaps because of it), many other paths could have been taken, from the flamboyant to the downright controversial, judging from Stone's previous works at least. However, he chose to take the docu-drama route, basing the film on testimonies of two particular survivors, the 18th and 19th out of only 20 rescued from the rubble.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage plays the hard-edged veteran New York Port Authority cop Sgt. John McLoughlin, while Michael Pena is the wide-eyed rookie Will Jimeno. The real-life duo are the two remaining survivors of a Port Authority police squad helping in evacuation efforts when the towers collapsed that fateful September morning. The unlikely pair find themselves alive, but badly injured, trapped under 20 tons of concrete and mangle metal, the aftermath of the terror attacks on the Trade Center. It becomes a struggle for everyone: McLoguhlin and Jimeno fight to stay awake and alive, their families brave the emotional trauma and rescue teams attempt a tricky extrication. Beinga true story, we are assured a happy ending, and are relived when it comes.<br/><br/>However, it is the journey that counts, a harrowing one expertly portrayed with honest, gritty storytelling which is mostly factual anyway. The lives of a sergeant and his subordinate abruptly splice together, the story on all sides seamlessly narrated. Flashbacks and scenes of how the two families deal with the situation provide respite from the darkness and claustrophobia of the rubble. John and Will's wives, Donna (Maria Bello) and Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal) respectively, go through the most pain as they fear for their beloveds' lives.<br/><br/>The film is carried by the leads' credible performances, acting from the neck up but still delivering credible performances that move and convince. Cage and Pena play each other off with near-perfection, the two exuding just enough chemistry under the most impossible of situations. The normally glamorous Bello and Gyllenhaal are believable-enough as the traumatized wives, though they definitely fall short of Cage and Pena's deliveries.<br/><br/>The only traces of director Stone's usual flamboyance are the dramatic computer-generated imagery (CGI) depictions and the large, true-to-life set-piece reconstruction of Ground Zero. The director wisely uses these as mere tools in the telling of a very human story, noticeably steering clear of anything that might be offensive. Even the planes smashing into the towers are not fully depicted; a passing shadow of the first airliner hints and the tragedy to come.<br/><br/>However, as the story is based on real life and revolves simply around the two men's ordeal, fans of Stone's more high-octane motion pictures such as Platoon and Alexander will find World Trade Center mildly uninteresting at best, terribly boring at worst. Before watching the film, one must understand that the action and thrill are mainly psychological, and is all about appealing to one's nobler sentiments. World Trade Center is not your average summer action flick, but rather, as corny as it sounds, is a testament to hope, faith and the human spirit, displaying the fragility of family and the strength that lies dormant within us all. A first-rate human drama, a solemn and unexpected offering from Oliver Stone.<br/><br/>RATING: 4/5 STARS By Jedd Jong"
"johnnyboyz","7","0","1","13 December 2010"," As the world watches on in awe and disbelief, certain men stuck under the debris of the World Trade Centre frighteningly form their own perspective of said day's events.
","World Trade Centre tells the terrifying true story of a handful of very specific kinds of policemen, namely Port Authority officers, caught up in the cataclysmic New York-based events of the eleventh of September in 2001. It is a rather harrowing retelling of certain events involving a group of men buried alive under an entire skyscraper that has fallen at the wayside, as their loved ones back home in the form of friends and family watch on in terror at the attacks unfolding on television, all the time looking on in sheer anxiety at how badly those they know are caught up in it. The piece is a somewhat gruelling two-hour plus experience about a pretty gruelling, rather harrowing scenario brought to life on the screen by American director Oliver Stone; the observing a fleeting chance at life several men have which is tense and involving. It's one of Stone's more toned down features, not overly aggressive nor confrontational despite finding room for political thematics, but most certainly warming and dramatic regardless.<br/><br/>At the centre of it is the dry, husky and worn tone of Nicolas Cage portraying John McLoughlin, amply flanked by two others in the form of Jay Hernandez's Dominick Pezzulo and Michael Peña's Will Jimeno; the three of them trapped under a whole heap of rubble following the deliberate crashing of two jet airliners into the World Trade Centre in 2001. For these men, like everybody else, what appeared to be another usual day beginning at dawn turned into a nightmare scenario. Stone opens the film in a melancholic fashion, some sharp angles looking directly upwards at the sky and the tall buildings to some angelic music feeling like a fleeting, final glance at what once was. When we're on the road with McLoughlin, there are some glancing shots of police officers on duty with another wide shot capturing a busy highway leading into the city, in what is a broader emphasis on those of whom were more affected than others that day; specifically in emergency service personnel and commuters only. There is little in the way of character establishment up to this point and the camera keeps its distance from most figures on screen at these points, be they workers in their cars or officers on the beat, so as to get across a broader and more archetypal sense of who'll come to be affected. The feeling of all New Yorkers being linked together as one feels prominent.<br/><br/>When the time comes for a bus load of the authorities to ship out to the scene of World Trade Plaza, McLoughlin is asked as to what's to be done but states that there ""is no plan"" since such a situation has never previously been processed nor preordained. The feeling of disillusion and disorientation felt at the time in the lack of a plan as well as the magnitude of the task at hand in that they're going in blind is here effectively emphasised. A range of men occupy the bus as they all head in, that collective sense of everybody being involved and in the situation 'as one' as before effectively put across by way of the Hispanic; African-American and Caucasian Port Authority officers riding on into the danger zone capturing a broad scope linked to the fact everyone is in it together. Upon arrival, the actors are given the final task before heading in of gazing upwards at the proverbial burning towers and recalling whatever emotions or reactions conjured on the day when it happened; here being the point that any audience member whom was an outsider looking in that day, regardless of nationality or where one was, are now to be taken inside so as to experience the true tale of a group of men first hand at how it all unfolded from within.<br/><br/>The interior lobby reveals innocents on the way out looking beaten and bloody, anxious to get away from the very location we're heading into. McLoughlin and his team look dirty; worn; scared and marked as it is, the venturing into the torrid unknown resonating with what prior knowledge we have of what'll transpire settling in and gearing us up for what will be a terrifying procession of events. Stone handles the men being trapped underground rather well, the characters exchanging information based on one another; rousing each other not to give up and to stay awake at all costs as they lay there in an elevator shaft having had dozens of storeys collapse on top of them. Back home, the wives of those involved in John's wife Donna (Bello) and their four children as well as Jimeno's in the form of Allison (Gyllenhaal) can only watch on via the television with bated breath as action is taken on what is now ground level.<br/><br/>Michael Shannon's Dave Karnes appears to run his own operation in trying to save anybody still trapped. A religious ex-SEAL, Karnes decks himself out in army clothing and ventures out into the rubbled remains of World Trade Plaza with an angry attitude of wanting to get out there as soon as possible and react so as to sort everything out. Karnes is a character that might be read into as being representative of America's attitudes post-attack, the verbal establishment of America now being ""at war"" with somebody with Karnes' attire and attitude to do what he does is political allegory disguised as acts of bravery. Stone captures a somewhat perfect overall tone to the film, respectful and knowledgeable of bravery without ever being too sentimental or mawkish. He doesn't overplay the achievement of what these men did at a fateful time; and certainly doesn't go down a route similar to that of John Sturges, whose adaptation of the men trapped at Stalag Luft III camp in The Great Escape was given a bright and breezy lift. Stone's film is smart and taut, an involving watch based on the stories of those at the forefront."

","One would think the subject is perfect for an emotional and exciting film, but this one falls completely flat. It is a mind-numbingly boring example of connect-the-dots filmmaking. There are endless shots of guys trapped under rubble followed by shots of concerned family members. Rinse. Repeat. Although based on real life people, the characters seem to be from central casting. The dialog is so dreadfully inane that one feels bad for the actors forced to deliver such pedestrian lines. Genius director Stone apparently wanted viewers to truly experience the pain and suffering of that fateful day: by having them sit through this wretched film. The victims and heroes of 9/11 deserve a better tribute."

I was home sick at five years old playing with blocks listening to CMT when all of a sudden it flashed to the picture of the North Tower with smoke billowing out of it. The concept of terrorism and a terrorist attack was foreign to a five year old so I assumed that it was either and accident or put on for a show. World Trade Center captures detail after detail down to the slightest spec of information on the two New York police officers who were buried under the rubble and debris left from the fallen South Tower. Both Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena give a four star performance and their strong acting rarely lets up.<br/><br/>I want to start off by saying Nicholas Cage is on my list for worst actors. I've never found him amusing to watch and I've always thought of him as overrated and overpaid. He's done some fair movies in his career like Leaving Las Vegas and National Treasure, but overall his filmography is loaded with overbudget and overrated garbage that has the interest level of either a remake or a movie that's been done a million times. Much to my surprise, Cage gives a very respectable and highly amusing performance in this film. His acting skills are profoundly shown here and he brings out his life rather than just being someone who ""collects the check"" in half of his movies. This one we see some of his best skills flood out on the screen like a never-ending wave of nourishment.<br/><br/>If you're introduced to the story of the two New York police officers who were trapped under the rubble of the South Tower for hours, than the story is the exact same thing. We see the North Tower on fire ten minutes in the film, before you know it we see John McLaughlin and Will Jimeno inside the South Tower, and before you know it we see them under the South Tower. After they are called in, they arrive to the tower to see smoke just pouring out of the windows nonstop along with paper flying every which way like Mardi Gras confetti in the streets. So the scenery in the street shots are well done and recreated to the exact pin-point detail as they could've been.<br/><br/>I too admire the fascination in the events/timeline of September 11, 2001. Great facts and different features stem from that day and even though it's a day looked on by many as a great tragedy, it has interesting perks that make it a very amusing concept to learn about. For example, the questionable devil's face appearing in the smoke of the South Tower and the news reports are something I find extremely interesting since seeing it at five years old left me with just vivid memories of newscasters viewing the incident. The most interesting shots/bits of information are most definitely the news reports when we see a plane crash. You can hear and almost taste the reaction/fear brought down by most. It's a creepy feeling when watching the plane hit the building, even to this day.<br/><br/>World Trade Center is said not to be a political film by director himself Oliver Stone. While WTC is more of a disaster/docudrama then anything, I can tell it has the urge to strike up opinions on who's the better political party, Republican or Democrat. You can almost hence that the director wants to state his opinion on the matter, but instead just letting the characters take the lead in the recreation of the events taken place on September 11, 2001. Being very moved by the movie and the events taken place I call WTC a strong, powerful movie that not only captures the suspense and intensity of the day itself, but also takes into consideration the different points and dialog made by McLaughlin and Jimeno. The character's random and rambling dialog is definitely interesting and one of the strongest points of the movie without hesitation.<br/><br/>Starring: Nicholas Cage, Michael Pena, Maria Bello, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Stephen Dorff, Jon Bernthal, Jay Hernandez, Michael Shannon, Donna Murphy, Frank Whaley, Jude Ciccolella, and Danny Nucci. Directed by: Oliver Stone."

","In his previous movie (JFK - 1991), (Oliver Stone) talked about a true tragedy that happened to America, namely the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy, accusing the arms dealers, the CIA, the mafia, and maybe the presidential foundation at the time; namely the dark powers which control and rule for their own sakes whatever the loss of anyone. This time, he talks about the true tragedy only.<br/><br/>It's heartwarming, sometimes excruciating, movie, but with noting to say unless the meaning of goodness inside all, and how life is precious, so precious thing to be wasted without all the love that we can give. It's pretty well-meaning work. (Stone) was pure, simple, and compared to his other movies so tame and romantic. He didn't go to explore the reasons or judge anyone. Instead, he made a movie about a man who discovers that he used not to look at his wife's eyes as much as he must of late. Maybe it's a way to learn, on a very human level, a lesson from the catastrophe that hit the Americans in 2001.<br/><br/>It's finely scripted, directed, and acted. The details are many and tiny; hence fascinating. The true story, that the movie selected, got all what a Hollywood movie needed; a huge disaster, beautiful buddy-thing under awful circumstances, the operation to save, and sure the happy ending. And it's what the audience needed at the time to express a lot of suppressed emotions as well.<br/><br/>Anyway, I loved (World Trade Center). It's rich and powerful sad movie, where thousands of innocent people suffer what they totally didn't deserve, being victims of the ones who are ""trading"" the ""world"" for their own profits. It reminded me of (Stone)'s trilogy of Vietnam where many Americans were sent to hell for a crime they didn't commit. Maybe in a crime was committed to them and others, and by not too far criminals than the same profiteering powers that caused many disasters, big part of 9/11 is one of them. So the world had become a Trade, and we all merchandise to be sold. This movie arouses returning to the human side. That's a great step yet before knowing who are selling?, and what's they earned? Maybe that's what (Stone) would have done in his next movie (W.). I hope that he questioned and answered there what was waited from him here, and when he didn't, his fans left disappointed.<br/><br/>It is to everyone died in, or survived from, the tragedy as simply they are all victims. Though still the saddest matter, for me, is that more thousands of innocent victims all over the world, especially in Palestine and Iraq, don't have the luxury of making movies, with big budget and stars, about their daily loss and tragic history, or even caring about saving them in the first place."

","This film was a total disappointment. It went in a pretty decent direction at first, and than we have to see 2 guys in a freaking hole the rest of the movie. I am sure the audiences wanted to see a lot of things that happened during the event of 9/11 but you don't get that at all. You basically get a little piece of the big picture. It felt like the film was made to strike into the inner emotions of people to trick them into seeing this dull film with two guys talking about painfully boring stuff. I am not a fan of Oliver Stone and think he is a boring director with no soul, but this is taking to another level of boredom. This felt like a waste of time, when I am pretty sure the audience wanted to see more depth in the incident. Some may like it and cry for it, but most importantly buy this drivel, cause they may think it's the right thing to do. The only thing this film did was it got people emotional since it's a event that a lot of people feel close to. It was in no way a compelling film. I give it a 4 out of 10 since I have seen worst films. Now some over the top patriotic people or rednecks that maybe reading this may bash on me and say stuff along the lines of ""You hate America!"" nope, I feel bad for the victims and respect the people that tried to save lives during the incident, I just hate bad film making. Now I give this film a 4 out of some patriotism cause I personally think the film deserves a lower score.<br/><br/>4/10"

","This was the second film to show the devastating incidents of September 11th 2001, after United 93, from director Oliver Stone. Basaically it is a normal day on New York city (the date has already been mentioned), when all of the sudden, the North Twin Tower is seen on fire, and police officers, including John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Peña), are called to the scene. Not long after the second tower is hit by another hijacked plane, and not long afterwards, the floor collapses underneath McLoughlin and Jimeno. They are still alive under the huge amount of rubble, and even with their bodies in pain, they are not giving up hope waiting for help to come. Eventually it does come, and both get out alive with very bad injuries, and are seen as heroes, as well as the people who saved them, showing even with evil, there is always good to go against it. Also starring Maggie Gyllenhaal as Allison Jimeno, Maria Bello as Donna McLoughlin, Stephen Dorff as Scott Strauss, Jay Hernandez as Dominick Pezzulo, Michael Shannon as Dave Karnes, Anthony Piccininni as JJ McLoughlin, Alexa Gerasimovich as Erin McLoughlin, Morgan Flynn as Caitlin McLoughlin, Armando Riesco as Antonio Rodrigues and Jon Bernthal as Christopher Amoroso.

","The time I heard Stone would direct a movie about 9/11, I was excited because it's a director with guts and strong opinions. When I discovered the story deals with two firemen escapees, my interest goes down because his legendary punch would be gone.<br/><br/>Now, watching the movie, my deception is even bigger. The tragedy is lived from two very personal point of view, so the big scope of this tragic day is left behind: you barely see the twin towers, the planes, the falls, the fires, the dust fog and the pain of thousands <br/><br/>Worst, you got a collection of ""holes"", that is the escapees in the darkness unable to move.

","Yes they saw a lot of concrete. This comment is small and for people who have seen the movie. It is small because I will talk about the political contents of this movie.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone, who showed some courage with JFK, now shows us a completely politically neutral film about two men hoping to survive that fatal day.<br/><br/>Wrong. There is some statement in this. Towards the end, The catholic soldier dressed up in a military suit says something like ""Someone will have to fight back"".<br/><br/>Now, maybe on the one hand, Stone wants us to believe that the attack came from the outside and very soon U.S. Soldiers will pay the attackers a visit or on the other hand, someone is somehow (with whatever methods, guns, words,...) fighting back to the attacker, no matter who that one is (Arabs, the U.S. Government itself etc.) I wonder why Stone made a completely (politically) useless movie, just to shout out (discreetly) that last line in the end. Why wait 2 hours for doing so? Sure thing is, you have not really missed anything.<br/><br/>P.S. Besides that, the movie is... well enjoyable, but if this movie wasn't about the 9/11 WTC events as script background, it'd be a complete waste of time. With all due respect to the brave and respectable rescue teams and victims of that day: the movie is quite boring, because somehow you just know that they're going to survive, absolutely pointless.<br/><br/>I know its not correct to point that out because the movie is about the bravery of 9/11 civilians, but someone just had to do so. Sorry.<br/><br/>I would have preferred that the movie had put more emphasis on the voluntary helpers and how the state dropped them and their consequential health problems off. We should now know that 911 rescuers have many breathing illnesses but because they were not contractually employed by the government, they receive no health care whatsoever. They literally risked their lives to help. they got NOTHING back. That is absolutely cruel and disgusting.<br/><br/>The movie did not even question such cruelty. This movie does NOTHING, as if it was directed by the government. Sick..."

It was a day of horror not slow, boring and to direct around what really happened is absurd. I'm actually very surprised that no one has come forward and put together a spectacle of a motion picture for 9/11. I'm very disappointed Hollywood. For being someone who's attending film school . . . maybe one day I'll make it my business to direct one for all America, what really happened for all to know. A meaningful piece of art, filled with visionary pictures and touching literature. Screw you Mr. Stone for being a P****. 0/10. Terrible movie.<br/><br/>P.S.

","The dashes in my summary are there to emphasize that this should have been the movie's title. Well, yes, we see some images from the WTC tragedy but 90% of the movie is only about the two cops and their families.<br/><br/>If the movie did not have the title ""World Trade Center"" probably nobody would watch it. You remove a few minutes from the beginning and end of the movie and what you are left with is a below average drama with a happy ending. 9/11 was anything but a happy ending.<br/><br/>The movie says nothing about the ""why"". I think in a tragedy like this the why is the most important. I don't want to start the whole zeitgeist thing again but come on! A movie about 9/11 and you show the triumph two cops. Shame on Oliver Stone.<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment is that Nicolas Cage accepted a part in this movie. After movies like ""Next"" how could he play in this one. He is one of my favorite actors but because of this movie I don't like him that much anymore.<br/><br/>I actually got tired of people repeating ""I love you"".

Like : the acting is OK, but just OK. Knowing how she suffers, Jimino's wife reaction is nearly annoying during the entire movie. Nic is OK as usual (but nothing will beat Leaving Las Vegas). The scene of our 2 cops trapped are brilliant. And the scene of Jesus, his Sacred Eart, appearing to Jimino while he is near to die are profound and moving, above all if you are a Christian. The whole scenes of the towers collapsing are also effective. But on over whole it seems or sounds very commercial, very superficial. Not bad at all but it misses the Oliver Stone's touch."

","I appreciate Oliver Stone movies when they're fiction, but HATE what he does to facts/history. I had a chance to buy this film at a very low price, and since 9-11-01 remains of interest and concern to me, I held my breath and went ahead with it. The other factor that pushed me towards it was Maggie Gyllenhaal. She's been great in everything I've ever seen. I've come to trust her. Nicolas Cage has a spotty record with me, but I'm still willing to check him out  despite my fear he'll over-act. Well, Maggie was great, Nicolas did NOT over-act, and Ollie did NOT disregard the facts or the emotional truth. (My pessimism says it was because this episode in our history is too fresh, clear, and important to us to let him risk getting away with the usual fact-bending and lying. Whatever the case, EVERYONE did a great job. It was a tense, very emotional, intimately accurate look at those first couple of days, and the limbo in which a few ""lucky"" people found themselves. Michael Pina and Maria Bello were no less impressive. The score was ominous, sad, meditative, and never intrusive. I was very moved by this film  not in the same way as the documentary footage, of course, but by its tight, claustrophobic storytelling of one tiny set of moments for just a few of the thousands  millions  of people affected then, and who remain affected."
"NormanCroucher","5","0","3","23 September 2007"," Modern Art takes on the tragedy of 9/11
","How do we define the right time to make a motion picture about a recent and terrible tragedy? Was it too early for a cinematic retelling of a real life disaster? Was it in bad taste to recreate the event on celluloid with movie star Nicolas Cage fore fronting it for the box office? Was it an injustice to those who perished on that fateful day of September the 11th, 2001? The real question I asked myself before sitting down to watch the film was; is this just a cynical, manipulative Hollywood heroism feature designed to capitalise on the deaths of thousands of innocent people? <br/><br/>The casting of Nicolas Cage in one of the central roles was a foolish move for Oliver Stone, for while he is very good in the part, we cannot forget that this is a real event that is still fresh for many of those who lost someone, and to cast a movie star in the lead is to sell the idea to the public that this was as much about honouring the fallen as it was about ticket sales. This should have been much like ""United 93,"" and cast with relative unknowns. The recognisable faces ultimately takes away from that feeling of reality that Stone brings to much of the horrific visuals recreating, almost unsettlingly, the iconic image of the towers wounded, bleeding and falling. Michael Pena fares much better as his low key, natural performance brings heart and soul to his scenes with Cage, trapped underground in their hellish environment. Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello are also brilliant in the roles of the waiting, worrying wives, Gyllenhaal particularly believable as the five month pregnant Allison. Most surprisingly of all is Stephen Dorff playing one of the brave emergency service workers who risked life and limb to save the few who survived amongst the smoke and debris. His performance stands out as the finest in a film overrun with actors thinking that it was the right time for this story to be told.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone ditches the conspiracy theories, shockingly doing away with his political ideals in the process and muting any such conjecture surrounding 9/11, although occasionally giving cheeky, yet subtle references to certain inconsistencies of that day, such as the pentagon being hit by a missile, united flight 93 being 'mistaken' for another flight, the way in which the buildings exploded and fell etc. Instead he opts for out and out themes of heroism, courage and the instinct for survival. Even the score for the film is what you would expect, understated melodies that are constantly reaching toward the life affirming. <br/><br/>With all of that said, it isn't a bad movie. The second act is where it falls down under the weight of its own melodrama, but the first twenty minutes and last half an hour find some honest moments and moving fragments of life amongst all the dramatic re-enactments. Like two grieving women embracing in an emergency ward, one black, one white, both strangers. The long hospital wall plastered over with the missing posters of loved ones in their thousands. The twisted metal, dusty rubble and rising smoke of ground zero itself. That beautiful bird's eye image of the decimated towers from the air, that grey cloud of smoke and fire reaching into the sky. The sense of unity and empathy so real and powerful between the people of New York is touched upon in the scene where hundreds of emergency service workers form a line over the mountain of rubble to help get these men out, suggesting that the ripple effects from the terrorist attack made them stronger, rather than weaker.<br/><br/>It is surprising that in a film by Oliver Stone, although inevitably certain for a film about 9/11, there is a patriotic, flag waving rhetoric disturbingly buried amongst the pieces of shrapnel and concrete along with our two protagonists. The marine who comes back to serve out of a sense that God has asked him to do so doesn't sit well and seems almost designed so he can deliver the uncomfortable line at the end, ""Someone has to avenge what happened here."" Revenge is a less honourable message, and certainly a much less empowering theme than love helps us survive the worst of times, and hope helps bring us together, while disaster turns ordinary people into extraordinary heroes. The religious element is puzzling too. Jesus comes to Michael Pena's character in a hallucinatory dream to offer him water, now are we supposed to buy this as the real deal, or simply a dream? I just found it wholly inappropriate when so many people still ask ""Where was God that Day?"" Apparently he was going around offering water to those who really needed a drink.<br/><br/>At bottom World Trade Centre is a well made movie, designed to pull the heart strings. Yes, it is manipulative. Yes, it is obvious. It is as you would expect a film so soon after the event to be. But Stone elevates enough moments and points out enough detail for us to find something of worth in the endeavour, at least beyond the immediate cynicism. The true life story sifts through the wreckage to find shreds of humanity and hope for those of us who like to hang on to these glimmers of heroism and find a semblance of good from that fateful day. Commendable for its initial intentions it might possibly be, but if I want to remember 9/11 I will watch the much more heartening, and real life tributes that are shown on TV each year to commemorate the event on its anniversary. Real world tragedy has always inspired art, but I would refuse to accept art masquerading as real life tragedy."

There is only so much you can see of that before it starts to get boring. We get the fact that the wives are worried and waiting.

"Christopher_Reid","6","0","1","1 July 2007"," Okay but fails to capture the gravity of 9/11.
","Unexpectedly the biggest problem with World Trade Center is how mild it is. Most of the dramatic moments are weak and quite predictable (though not by any means bad) compared to the power and resonance they could have had. It's as if the filmmaker's decided that the only way to make a movie about 9/11 without offending too many people was to soften it's impact and focus on story lines that don't tread too far from what's already been done countless times before. What's the point of making a film about 9/11 if it doesn't explore any of the things that made 9/11 unique?<br/><br/>I think it may have been a bad idea to cast relatively well known actors in the main roles. Part of the horror of 9/11 was that it could have happened to anyone and once we see famous actors, we know they're going to be the stars of most of the scenes. United 93 was wise enough to use unfamiliar faces and present a fairly objective glimpse of each of their characters.<br/><br/>In most technical areas, World Trade Center is pretty good. The acting's strong, the script does its job, the directing doesn't get in the way but it just doesn't seem to amount to much. By steering away from what made 9/11 the tragedy it is, the film loses almost all of it's potential power. For me, the most powerful part was the statistics shown at the end of the film (this doesn't spoil anything). So reading some text with some nice music was the most powerful moment in the film. Not a good sign.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it is not incredibly entertaining. There's basically no humour nor are there many subplots or back stories. Vague details are given but not enough to be fulfilling. Still, it's by no means bad and perhaps worth seeing just to better understand what some of the people involved went through (and for the generally good music). But if only Oliver Stone had had the courage to dive into the subject matter head on it could have been a great and very powerful film."

","Oliver Stone has always been a director of grit, one who was unafraid to take on controversial subjects and create powerful films that opened the audience's eyes to the mire below the surface. In WORLD TRADE CENTER he seems to have taken the opposite stance: take an historic tragedy that affected the entire world and reduce it sown to the entrapment of two Port Authority Police Officers in the rubble of the midline of the two towers destruction in hopes that the event might become more intimate. He manages to just the opposite - he makes a huge horrific tragedy seem like a family crisis and despite casting some fine actors in the roles of actual people, the film falls short of communicating the bigger picture.<br/><br/>The film starts well enough with two of the policemen rising early in the Am to go to routine duty, then the unrecognizable 'bump' sound occurs and quite to everyone's disbelief the events of that terrible day unfold in a manner that does indeed convey the complete surprise of a nation of people unfamiliar with terror happening on home ground. The Port Authority Police enter the impending collapse of the towers to save victims only to become quickly trapped in the rubble, reducing their ranks to two men who hold on for survival that finally comes.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage is the sergeant John McLoughlin who is trapped with Will Jimeno (Michael Peña) while John's wife Donna (Maria Bello) and Will's pregnant wife Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal) cope with the news of the day and the discovery that their husbands are trapped in the rubble. The long movie is a back and forth interplay between the trapped men and the terror of the families. Where Stone drops his credibility is in focusing on a retired Marine Staff Sergeant Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon) who upon hearing of the disaster gets a marine haircut and travels to the spot looking for survivors at night, eventually discovering John and Will and getting help for them to be rescued. That is all well and good, but the film adds the tag line 'We'll avenge the terrorists who did this' that seems like a credo for the irresponsible governmental attack on Iraq. It just takes away the film's energy and makes it a political PR piece. And that is too bad: the other film UNITED 93 is a far superior work in depicting the personal aspect of a national tragedy.

I think it could have switched to the other events more often than just voices in the dark. I watched Flight 93 and enjoyed it more if you can say enjoyed. It is a gripping couple of hours and for the most part was close to the actual facts. I you want to see this event again then overall I think you will enjoy the acting of Nicklas Gage and the rest of the cast most of whom I was not familiar with. It is an entertaining two hours."

","Even thinking about it days later, World Trade Center is a terrible disappointment. I was not feeling overly excited to watch the film in the first place, but the obvious idea of the subject matter is captivating. September 11, 2001 was a day that everyone can remember, and no one will forget. So having been the second film in less than six months about the subject, it had big shoes to fill. Sadly, it is not up to the task.<br/><br/>The film, directed by controversial Oscar-winner Oliver Stone, focuses around two PAPD officers trapped under the wreckage of the World Trade Center following its collapse. Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) has a wife, Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and a child with another on the way. John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage), is an expert on the towers, and has a wife Donna (Maria Bello), and four children. The film goes back and fourth between these four characters, simultaneously showing the pain that Jimeno and McLoughlin are being forced to face, and their wives, hoping and waiting to hear that their husbands are alive.<br/><br/>The storyline is very simple, and I think this is where the film finds itself in trouble. When it starts out, it paints itself to be about the towers. Many blatant scenery shots of the New York City skyline have them both emblazed in the background almost like a huge target. They are totally in your face, and even if you have no idea where to look for them in really far shots, you can still find them right away. When the planes hit, we do not actually see the impact, but the chaos taking place on the ground does feel authentic, and well done. I liked the shadow of the plane on the huge skyscraper moments before it hit, but was less impressed by the unrealistic CGI shot of the burning building. Likewise, when the police crew watches a person tumble to their death, the poignancy and meaning to this person's ultimate death is so contrived that it almost looks like we should laugh at as a CGI effect, it looks awful. As well, out of a just over two hour film, the trade center only appears in less than the first thirty minutes.<br/><br/>Another thing I disliked was how the movie was based entirely around the two characters, with little to nothing being actually about the trade centers, other than the event that causes their problem. If the movie is going to be called, World Trade Center, you would assume the film would be about the event a whole lot more. Yes, there are the media coverage scenes, and the very well captured early moments of on-the-street chaos. But as the film goes on, there is really nothing to distinguish that the film is about the trade centers at all. It is almost as if it could be about any other disaster, maybe even a fictional one. It just feels half there, and half not. United 93 was actually about that plane and the people on it. The World Trade Center does make a small appearance in the film, but after that, is not really what the film is about anymore. I understand the poignancy and the human emotion the film wanted to evoke, but it could have been called something much different since it is about something much different.<br/><br/>Where United 93 excelled at its fast-paced editing and its heart-racing thrills, Center just fails. Its opening is fairly fast, and almost as fast as you can snap your fingers, the trade center comes down. From there, it just kind of drags on. The characters are bland, and really have a lack of definition among them. The men want to get out, and the women want to ensure the men are alive. Okay, you can only convey that so many ways on screen before it becomes repetitive. I know they were going for some authenticity, but just having the actors do the same thing over and over again becomes tedious and loses the emotional focus at the heart of the film. We, as the audience, know the ultimate outcome of the situation, and need to have something interesting going on while the film progresses to hold our attention.<br/><br/>United 93 shifted focus from the effect the media had on everyone watching the news footage, to the knowledge that terrorists were holding the plane hostage. We know what is coming, but director Paul Greengrass draws us in, and makes the events seem fresh and not drilled into memory. Here, Stone just wants to tell the story, and does not bother looking back or even caring whether the audience is paying attention or not. No subtext, no shift in focus, no good editing, it just stays the same and drags itself out.<br/><br/>The acting is okay at best. Cage has seen far better days, and has put a whole lot more effort into other performances. Bello looks and feels subdued. She is clearly being held back, and her role suffers as a result. Pena is excellent, but only to a point. I really enjoyed Gyllenhaal, but like Bello, she feels like she is being held back, and not giving the role everything she has. Supporting turns from Jay Hernandez and Stephen Dorff are well done, but are barely shown. And despite his character actually being a real person, Michael Shannon takes his role far too extreme and becomes too propagandist for his own good. His over-the-top character is a real low point in the film, and had I not found out he was real, I would have assumed he was put in on purpose by Stone.<br/><br/>On the whole, the film is just a disappointment. It has an okay storyline and a good message, but is just not the powerful film that it should have been. You are better off sticking with the far superior United 93.<br/><br/>6/10."

","I recently watched both Flight 93 and World Trade Center. From the reviews I read, I expected Flight 93 to be the superior of the two but after watching World Trade Center, I came to a far different conclusion.<br/><br/>I respectfully disagree with the commenter who thought that the movie dwelled too heavily on the the two Port Authority officers being trapped in the wreckage. Instead, I thought Stone did a superb job in encapsulating the entire 9-11 experience through the eyes of the two families. I lived through 9-11 and didn't need to see a newsreel of the day. The movie hit the right note by focusing on the emotional effect of the disaster on average families - the scene in the hospital between Maria Bello's character and the mother who lost her son in the Towers was particularly well done.<br/><br/>For someone who lives on Long Island and knew many who were working in Manhattan that day (but fortunately, no one who was in the Towers), it was tough not to become emotional and I there were several parts of the movie that brought me to tears.<br/><br/>All in all, I feel that this was a job well done and should be mandatory viewing by high school students so that they will learn what 9-11 meant to us, a little bit like Schindler's list."

","I do not know what everyone else thinks, but I think it is absurd that they are actually making movies about 9/11. I love this country and I am extremely proud to be an American, (so don't reply and call me a communist or anything) but when other countries attack us and say that our society has a complete lack of morals, I think that movies like this give them ammunition. Has Hollywood really sunk this low? I swear, those people will do anything for a buck. It seems that the only thing that is truly worshiped these days and the only thing held sacred in this country anymore is the almighty dollar.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I am an advocate of free speech and freedom of the press and media, but I think some things should just be held taboo. For example, when I heard that murdering bastard OJ Simpson wrote a book and was going to have a TV special called ""If I Did It?"" I was embarrassed for this entire nation. Only in America would a son of a bitch like OJ Simpson get proved innocent, let alone have the chance to write a book about ""how he would have committed murder"". Thank God, the network brass and the publishing company canceled both of the projects. I understand that ""United 93"" and ""World Trade Center"" are not the same as ""If I Did It"", but calling those movies tributes makes me sick. How much of Stone and Cage's salaries were donated to the grieving families of those who were murdered. How much of the $170,000,000+ world wide gross was donated? Obviously this movie made a profit, and someone in Hollywood made money on a subject that is still painful for millions.<br/><br/>All that being said, I am speaking from a New Yorker's point of view. My Uncle Brendan was murdered on September 11, 2001 and I know there are others who suffered loss that day who share my sentiment. Jeanette Pezzulo, the widow of Port Authority police officer Dominick Pezzulo (who died on 9/11 and is played by Jay Hernandez in this film), has expressed anger with this film and feels it is wrong McLoughlin and Jimeno participated in the production. She's quoted as saying, ""My thing is: this man died for you. How do you do this to this family?"". Staten Island resident Jamie Amoroso, whose husband also died during the rescue operation, has also expressed her anger over the film and said she does ""not need a movie"" to tell her ""what a hero"" her husband was.<br/><br/>Like I said earlier, I think this is the greatest country in the world, and I thank God everyday that I was born an American, but I think that the fact that movies like this are being made is absolutely unacceptable. <br/><br/>The Departed- Best Picture; Martin Scorsese- Best Director (Finally!!!)"

I would say it's slightly above that, but not quite enough to warrant a 7.<br/><br/>I was really apprehensive at first - I was scared that this would be some self-indulgent diatribe on the suffering of the American people (I apologise to all non-U.S. Americans, but I'm trying to be obvious here).<br/><br/>Instead it turned into a story about a group of Port Authority police persons stuck in the rubble, the angst of their families and the combination of positive and negative emotions that comes together in order to save them.<br/><br/>To be honest with you, 30 minutes into this I was convinced that Cage's character wasn't going to make it out. That would be too saccharine. Wouldn't it now? All powdery and a bit clammy on the tongue...<br/><br/>I see comments here which are highly critical of this movie simply for the fact that it doesn't pay tribute to the diversity of rescue personnel that were caught up in this affair, doesn't account for the less than 300,000 persons that died, doesn't ""expose the truth behind 9/11"". Do you hear yourself talking? Definitely too soon, but remember - it's just a movie. I remember seeing a telemovie about the 93 attack well before this happened.<br/><br/>I won't engage in a debate here on the merits of what came before or after, although many people have raised them and they are poorly alluded to in the film itself. Suffice to say that one thing I did get from this movie, coming from a position of little sympathy, is an appreciation for the emotions of the families of the victims involved in this event.<br/><br/>I should also add that this is classic Stone direction with lots of use of original footage, shaky cameras, aerial shots, it all comes together.<br/><br/>I'm feeling sufficiently depressed that I'll be putting off the whole flight 93 experience for a while (that movie seems to go by a few different names) - all I can say is don't underrate this movie. It's not the most amazing piece of work you'll ever see, it is self-indulgent in many ways that I wasn't expecting, you will see lots of things you've seen many times before and asked to never see again whether out of boredom, pain or frustration... but you will see another side to the story.<br/><br/>Perhaps one that is more important than the events themselves."

It seemed like Hollywood decided to take a break on originality and simply find a way to turn a profit from everyones sorrow. A movie with the title World Trade Center should not be a heroic survival story, but a tragic truth to the events that happened on September 11th.<br/><br/>To put it simply, if you are looking for a generic and emotional tear-jerker that has very little to do with the events of 9/11 then I highly recommend this movie.

","When most movie-goers think of Oliver Stone, they usually think of cutting edge (Born on the Fourth of July), or visceral film-making (Natural Born Killers), or even historically disturbing cinema (The Doors). But few  if any  would consider Stone schmaltzy or an opportunist. Watching WORLD TRADE CENTER, though, one can't help but feel a touch of the latter and a significant amount of the former.<br/><br/>UNITED 93 was similar in that it took the recent horrific events of 9/11 and reintroduced Americans' fears to that awful day. It utilized (for better or worse) those feelings we all have and made money off of it. This isn't as terrible as it sounds, though. Cinema has been doing this for as long as celluloid has been running through projectors, but never has the filming been so close to the actual date of the events (or at least rarely).<br/><br/>One can't help but think that Stone must've been desperate for film material or somehow felt closely connected to the events that day. Either way, the script (although based on actual events) was lackluster at best. There are just a few exceptions that we'll cover in a moment.<br/><br/>This is the (true) story of the port authority police officers that responded to the World Trade Center attacks on 9/11, and is specific to the two men from the port authority who were trapped and later rescued from under the rubble. Nicholas Cage (National Treasure) stars as John McLoughlin, a gruff Sergeant who was around during the first bombings on the trade centers several years earlier. His entrapped fellow officer is rookie Will Jimeno played by Michael Pena (Crash), a family man with a new baby on the way. Both men have to deal with their isolation and near certain demise as they lay pinned and stranded only a few feet from one another. The story jumps between the rubble strewn men, their wives and families, and a retired marine who feels the call of duty after the attacks and risks his life to find survivors in the buildings' wreckage (the schmaltzy portions are firmly entrenched here as we're spoonfed everyone's tearful response to that terrible day).<br/><br/>It is this ""marine"" that most might have the biggest trouble with script-wise. He seemed almost inserted into the story to give some grist to an otherwise empty milieu. His need for ""revenge"" felt hollow amidst so much emotion. And although this may be ""the way it was,"" it didn't translate well to film.<br/><br/>Interestingly, Nicholas Cage gives an admirable performance even though he's not jumping into and out of danger, or battling evil-doers with deadly weapons. He's confined as is co-star Pena and their concern for one another is touching, as is their concern for what will happen to their families as they lay thinking/dreaming about them (these were some of the best parts of the screenplay but only a small portion of the whole).<br/><br/>The most powerful part of the film was its sound editing. When the buildings collapsed and then later continued to creak and groan, they took on an ominous characteristic that brooded poorly for our two main characters and gave movie-watchers a great sense of dread.<br/><br/>But when the sound becomes the most impressive part of a film, there's more problems than applause."

I wasn't getting buried guy from New York under the rubble, I was getting bored guy struggling with the accent under the lights. At no point did he convince me that he was anything but Nick Cage blowing an accent.<br/><br/>Sorry, I was sorely disappointed, both in the film and in Cage's performance. What a waste of my time."
"bing148","6","0","3","14 December 2006"," An uneven film which is still very much worth seeing
","World Trade Center is at it's best an incredible film. Featuring fantastic performances from Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena, along with some of the best scenes of the year, the formula for success is definitely present here. Unfortunately, poor pacing really stops it from achieving what it could have. World Trade Center is worth seeing. But it could have been so much more.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage does an absolutely fantastic job playing Sergeant McLoughlin. He's entirely believable as a man who just wants to get home to his family. The same can be said for Michael Pena, a young cop with a young daughter and another on the way. The majority of the film takes place with these two buried in the rubble of the World Trade Center. This makes their performances all the more exceptional, as they're just laying on their backs and talking. But when these two were on the screen, I couldn't look away.<br/><br/>The same quality does not always carry over into the sub plots of the film. Maggie Gyllenhaal gives a fine performance, which combined with her equally impressive turns in Sherrybaby and Stranger Than Fiction make this a fantastic year for her. But the other people in her story line just don't do that good a job. I didn't really feel the sense of panic that I remember from that day, which would be magnified for the loved ones I would imagine. I got that from Maggie and from the main two, but not from the others involved. Maria Bello's story line was worse though, as Maria was just sub par here. I don't know why, she's a fantastic actress. I thought she gave quite possibly the performance of the year last year in A History of Violence. But here, she just didn't feel real to me. I just didn't find her believable. The story of the marine who went to the towers to help likewise, just didn't feel quite right, though the performance is good.<br/><br/>When you're watching the two main characters, this movie is phenomenal. But the rest of the time, it just feels off. I recommend watching it, but you could almost fast forward through the sub plots and miss nothing."

","Is it even possible, after the suffering, relentless media coverage and two ensuing wars to take a bit of distance and consider 9/11 without all of its symbolisms? If we do, we have a sequence of events. The hijack. the crash. The collapse. the grief... We can try to look at events in a broader context, what triggered them, but then things get politicized at an alarming speed.<br/><br/>On 9/11, about 3000 innocent people died. This is a tragedy. as a statistic it pales in comparison to many places on this planet on any given day, yet our media amplified it and created a legend out of it. CNN, FOX and company have milked all the melodrama out of this human tragedy, and now in 2006 we have 2 films to commemorate it. That raises an important question: do these filmmakers think us so stupid as to need a reminder so soon? The only way to make this worthwhile is if the film seeks to understand these events.<br/><br/>Paul Greengrass's ""United 93"" offered a clinical observation of the hijacking and its emotionless precision made for more effective cinema, delivering raw, humbling reality when television had drowned us in melodrama, hyperbole and crassness. He gave 9/11 a sense of reality and a humanity which it had lost. <br/><br/>Oliver Stone, unfortunately, goes to the other extreme. His tale of two firefighters trapped under the debris may be based on reality, it never feels real. Going for a more austere style than he is used to, Stone inter-cuts the plight of these men with the anguish of their wives. It is an attempt to pay tribute, but, given the massive significance of the surrounding events, you can't shake the nasty feeling that said tragedy is being exploited to wring more tears out of you.<br/><br/>Stone's worst traits come out in the form of forced foreshadowing and symbolism, particularly an oft-mocked instance where Jesus brings water to a dehydrated fireman. Coming from the man who gave us JFK, Nixon and Bon on the Fourth of July, this is not just disappointing, but downright baffling: given how politically-charged this tragedy was, one might have expected Stone to question the media-version of events, tying American imperialism and the enemy's religious fanaticism to attacks on home soil and the resulting suffering of the innocent... But there's never even a hint of such thought. All we get is more salt in a barely cauterized wound.<br/><br/>The symbolic significance of 9/11 crushes the film's characters and story, dooming it to only arouse emotion in those who have lost loved ones, or by playing on the national feeling associated with the event. Neither of these qualifies World Trade Center as a good film. <br/><br/>This offensive garbage is everything we didn't need or want from a 9/11-inspired film."

","Why was this film made at all? Only five years after the real event why was it necessary to do this? This long, dull story of two trapped police officers is just rubbish. Perhaps Oliver Stone should consider retirement. Did Nicholas Cage really need the money? Initially the film attempts to capture some of the confusion, incorrect assumptions and disbelief of civilians and authorities made as the events unfolded but then settles down into a stultifying dialog between two men trapped in the wreckage with an obligatory happy ending. The events of that day were so dreadful and appalling not only because of the scale of the attack but because of the ignorance, bigotry and hatred of the perpetrators. That hatred and its fundamental cause, the perversion of religion was not even touched on by this story. We now live in a world that is as irrational and intolerant as the middle ages - both in the Christian religiosity of the United States and the fanaticism of Islamic fundamentalists. This film is a waste of time and attempts to explain nothing."

At least the movie did not convincingly show the tension built up there on 911. If for courage sake, for love sake, etc, so many movies in the past had already done so. I would watch over and over The Shawshank Redemption for the category of courage, I would watch Titanic for the category of love, I would watch repeatedly Erin Brockovich for the category of persistence, I would watch United 93 for the category of tragedy, love, and courage. So World Trade Centre makes no difference in 2006 movie history.

The feeling of your world coming down around you is just so scary. The scenes with the tower were done tastefully but i still think u needed to combine the scenes with the trapped people with more scenes of the towers disintegrating. No scenes with people in the offices... no scenes with people on the stairs climbing down while rescue workers are going up.PLUS why only focus on the survivors.... one tends to forget about the 2749 other people that died. The audience should be trusted to take the bad with the good. at least maybe show more on the other people that were rescued from the wreckage.<br/><br/>Dialogue was mediocre and the acting was good especially pena... whose emotions did not seem forced although he would have been better served with some good dialogue. Cage was surprisingly wooden and the dialogue did not help. kudos to stephen dorff for a hard hitting but small role towards the end. Maria bello did not have much to do while maggie gyllenhall did good with her role.<br/><br/>Not what i expected from oliver stone at all.... i expected him to let go at the audience and let them feel the devastation and the destruction but in the end it was almost a clichéd Hollywood movie... he took the soft option. Maybe studios felt that the American people were not ready for a movie on this but i think they would have appreciated it. Plus thru a movie, an even bigger audience could have been reached and touched by the braveRy and fortitude shown by the people after such an attack.<br/><br/>I feel there are many other 9/11 stories that need to be told.... and probably told in a more visceral way but i still think that people need to see this movie and understand what happened."

","This movie wasn't my first choice to go see in theaters. However, I decided to go when the original movie I'd wanted to see was sold out...I'm glad the other one was sold out, that's all I have to say.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone does a great job of depicting the aftermath of the first plane hitting the North Tower, and the PA officers' reactions. It had probably been similar to the incident many years ago when a biplane accidentally hit the Empire State Building, or in recent times, the private plane that hit the apartment complex. It was most likely seen as a simple, harmless incident. Or not.<br/><br/>I was on the edge of my seat during the slow-motion sequence in which you see a side-shot of the PA officers running for the elevator shaft in the underground complex next to the Towers, and the debris from the collapsing tower pouring in through the doors, and then the shaft collapsing at their feet. It was nearly enough to make me close my eyes when the second tower collapsed, for I knew the story of what eventually happened to the third officer that attempted to free McLoughlin and Pezzulo.<br/><br/>I was also struck by the unique way this movie introduced the characters: McLoughlin naming off all the officers that would assist him in evacuating the towers. I thought of Flight 93 during that sequence, in which the characters were introduced by close-ups of their plane tickets.<br/><br/>The conversations between McLoughlin and Pezzulo in the rubble were moving, as were the sequences with the Marine that eventually rescued them (although the producers hadn't known that the Marine wasn't a white guy.) Every bit of this movie was well-thought-out and touching. It's one aspect of 9/11 that hardly anyone knows or cares about. Most of the movies that are made about 9/11 are about the planes. To be frank, I'd never heard of the incident before I saw the movie.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone, although it may be emotional and intense for some. It's a powerful, heart-wrenching film that (almost) made me cry. No American that wants to learn more about 9/11 should miss out on this movie."

","Steeped in controversy over whether it is too soon, amongst other things, comes Oliver Stone's take on the events of September 11th 2001. Focusing on two port authority police officers who having no game plan for an event of this magnitude enter into tower one only to be trapped when it literally comes down on their heads. For all Stones usual bluster this is told in a very subtle and poignant way. Opening with various members of the forces getting up ready to travel to work for what they believe a normal day we see one man walking out onto the deck of the Staten Island Ferry into glorious sunshine and as the camera pans round there is the New York skyline complete with the twin towers in full domination. It is like seeing a ghost and this scene wouldn't be the only time that the hairs on the back of my neck would stand up during the movie. Thankfully Stone never really shows the impacts of the planes mostly because from the point of view of the officers on the ground they didn't see or know what had hit the towers and so instead Stone shows big looming shadows blocking out the sun on the faces of street traders looking up or on surrounding buildings and using the same technique used in United 93 the rest is just shown on televisions in the background. It is one thing knowing what happens in a true story but still when Stone brings down the first tower it is still incredibly powerful, the sound is so intense, the atmosphere is so confusing it is like you are there with the officers. Trapped under tons of rubble the survivors shout to each other and you begin to feel the silence and the claustrophobia creep in but not for long as Stone shocks you back into the situation when the second tower falls. Once the initial chaos subsides the film becomes more a character study, how people cope and deal with situations. The officers under the mess their wives at home following the unfolding events on the news and having no idea if their husbands were even there, never mind alive or dead, if they were. So a mention has to go out to both Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal who play the roles of the confused wives. One of the things I was worried about was that the film would be all American gung-ho and over sentimental and in a few places it is but not enough to really matter. In the end Stone has played down his usual directorial theatrics and delivered a film that not only captures the horror of that day but also shows us what the human spirit is capable of, yes evil but also hope. Not an easy watch and not amazing but a good effort handled well and a film that should be seen and remembered by everyone."
"jayaka","Null","0","3","2 October 2006"," Politically motivated
","The film is well made film showing the pain of that day.Oliver Stone has been very clever though as he sneeked in the politics fueled by Christian Fundlementalism in by the back door disguised as a heroic marine. There is a scene where the Marine is in a Church looking at a cross and we are led to believe he is a good man who wants to help but later we see he is fueled by hatred and wants revenge. It is classic my god is better than yours, we are good and you are bad.The Marine reveals the stupidity of the conflict which the deaths in those towers are the results. We are seeing one side of the Violence and it's affects the marine allows us to channel our hatred. We also see Bush who is the President of the USA.It is him who has been attacked by these terrorists and what he stands for ie a blend of self righteousness and power.The film is communicating the devastation that can happen when these things are mixed up and confused.Religion and Politics ,or the mix of them seems to lead to Fundlementalism."

","What i hoped to gain from this movie was understanding. This tragedy was so far away, that i couldn't relate to it. Even though i have been on top of the WTC, the events on 9-11 didn't shake my world. It was just something far away. I hoped this movie would have gave me some insight. It did not.<br/><br/>The opening is chaotic, just as i imagine it was on that day. what happened? was there one or where there two planes? chaos and doubt with the people involved. Good! up until then i was positive.<br/><br/>Then the search-party becomes trapped, and the focus shifts on the families and the rescue-workers. Still OK. The scenes with the relatives where quick and short. It made me feel a bit unruly, again, just as i imagined those people would have felt.<br/><br/>I did not relate to the characters. Even the death of one of them (where did he shoot at?)did not make me go 'oh no!'. Did the director think we automatically relate to these people because we know so much about the disaster already? The death of this team-member later on in the movie, with some more background on him, could have had far more impact on the viewer. Then they have had lost someone they knew. Now i didn't care, because i did not know the guy.<br/><br/>the characters in the story are shallow. The doubts, the pain is only there because you can see them act it out. It's not there because you feel it. For instance, i still wonder what's up with the marine or the paramedic. I see them, i know what they are doing there, but not WHY they are there and what their doubts are.<br/><br/>Then the movie skips two years, and everybody (the survivors) is happy and fine. Are they?! What about the people who lost relatives in the crash or due to the contamination of the site? What about the feelings and doubts of the survivors and the impact on their live and the people around them? This movie seems to focus mainly on the feel-good value, instead of the tragedy it was, and i think still is.<br/><br/>But the weirdest part is, and i'm probably be the last guy who would play the political correct card, where are all the black people gone off to? New York, and the only black people i see are a cop who answers the phone, a cop/guard who says a line and stumbles away and a woman in a hospital who lost a relative. I could be mistaken, but to me all the rescuers where white (there was a black cop returning to the station, and even he was white from the ash).<br/><br/>The movie ended with the line that everybody learned to depend on each other in those terrible times. I was glad they said that, cause i did not learn that from the movie."

","I went into the cinema without expecting anything in particular. Technically it was excellent, and I did like the way in which the film shows the events through the eyes of the officers. It shies away from showing the actual moments of impact and from over-dramatising the terrible things that were happening to those people up in the towers themselves. However; having avoided some clichés it then shoots itself in the foot with lines like ""mommy, when is daddy coming back?"" and with the closeups of a Christian cross and representations of a back-lit and glowing Jesus Christ. Maybe the humour was in the water bottle.<br/><br/>For me the most poignant moment of drama was not the interminably drawn out suffering of the cops under their slabs of foam painted to look like concrete but the encounter towards the end between Maria Bello's character and the woman who was coming to terms with the loss of her (son ?). That moment did seem more real than any other.<br/><br/>Overall, the film left me thinking about how these films, even from the best directors, are generically about the triumph of human hope and endeavour. At least this one was only partly predictable. After all the agonising, everybody involved with the two rescued officers gave us an uplifting and happy dénouement but the immense suffering of thousands of others on that terrible day was confined to a few brief moments and a few ""summing up"" captions at the end. The officers were spared and so were we. Perhaps we should like the film for that very reason."

","""World Trade Center,"" directed by Oliver Stone in 2006, is based on the tragedy that happened on September 11, 2006. This film is about two port authority police officers, John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage) and Michael Pena (Will Jimeno). When American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 slammed into the Twin Towers, these two brave men, other police officers, and firefighters went into the burning buildings to save all of the innocent people who were trapped inside. As McLoughlin and Pena attempted to make their way to the stairwell, the Twin Towers came crashing down, trapping them inside. They lay pinned underneath all of the rubble for hours. Lying there, they passed time by praying, telling stories about their families, and just trying to keep one another from falling asleep. They were both worried about dying. While they were buried under the rubble, their families sat at home watching this terrible tragedy take place on the news. Both families sat patiently awaiting the arrival of their husbands and fathers.<br/><br/>This film let citizens of this country know what it was like to have to deal with such a horrific tragedy. While watching this movie, I was right there pinned underneath all of the rubble with McLoughlin and Pena. Sitting in the movie theater, I felt all the emotional feelings from the movie as if I were standing right there as the towers came crashing to the ground, filling the streets with debris.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the film. The movie was very descriptive and it felt like I was there in the midst of everything going on that chaotic morning. The film did a great job of recognizing all of the firefighters, police officers, and military men and women who came to help and put their lives in harm's way. But, what about the flight crews and passengers that were aboard those two Boeing 767's that crashed into the buildings? Not one time during the ""World Trade Center"" did the film recognize all of the brave souls that were on those flights. That disturbs me. Those pilots, flight attendants, and passengers deserve recognition, too. All in all, this movie was emotional, yet great. I will definitely be buying it when comes out on DVD."
"mindbetty","6","0","4","18 September 2006"," What I Think
","I haven't seen the film but i want to say something about what jhf3488 has put. i understand that your family have or had a lot to do with the police or what ever over there and that you had friends and family working in the world trade centre. i also know that it was a horrible day and that it should never be forgotten but i think that you are wrong in what you are saying about Hollywood making a film about it because i think it is a grate idea. this mite be the medias way of making sure that it is not forgotten and i think to shine a bit of light on what had happened that day didn't hurt anyone i think it is good that people get a feeling of what it was like for the police and the firefighters to go into the world trade centre and TRY to save people. i think that there has been a lot of things about it all on the TV over in england about what people on the planes and in the world trade centre went through and there families and i think that there is no harm in showing the police's side of the story and seeing there journey that day. it mite not be the best way for Hollywood to show how they feel about it but they will find that out through rating wont they but at least they are doing something in keeping what happened that day on the face on of the earth and NOT forgotten. <br/><br/>sorry if i offended anyone but this is how i feel and this is my point of view and it mite change when i see the film but i just wanted people to know."

","You can't review this movie. You can't rate this movie. I went to see this movie, thinking I would come out with a fabulous review for it, but I didn't. I can't even give it a number out of ten because it depends who you are. You have to see this movie for yourself; you can't let anyone tell you what happened, or how to feel, or whether or not it was good.<br/><br/>World Trade Center made me feel that I take things for granted. And I do, I'm not going to lie to you. Everyone takes things for granted. Especially life. This movie brought you back to that day, but not as a bad thing. No. As a good thing. It brought you back to show you what really happened and what two men went through for what? 14 hours? Maybe more. Thrist, sleep, air, it was all an issue, and all we take for granted every single day.<br/><br/>The performances from every single actor in this movie were phenomenal. My heart must have stopped 5 times throughout the movie. The problem with seeing this in the theatre is that there are really rude people who don't know when it's the right time to laugh. Yes, there are some little humorous breaks here and there, but its mostly all drama.<br/><br/>All I say is that, see this for yourself. Don't let anyone tell you anything besides their feelings, because that's all I got out of it."
"UserMarc3792","6","0","4","29 August 2006"," World Trade Center- who said it was a bad movie?
","The movie was very emotional. Once I saw the movie, I cried but other people are sticking to their agreement that the movie sucked. Well I personally rated the movie a six because the acting was beautiful and it really touched my heart. I would have liked to see more on the World Trade Center and how it changed our lives, HOWEVER the story told a excellent thing. That we should be grateful for what we have and who we are today because really all jaws dropped when we saw the news flash that the world trade center came down. I loved the movie, I loved the acting but I really think that there should be more of the world trade center falling down because 9/11 really is nine one one and I guess the maker decided to quote that in a movie rather than just a presenter. I'm sure that the two firefighters that the movie was based on- (the real people) saw the movie and knew ""wow the movie is based on me. I didn't think people would cry at that"" I appreciate all the work that was put into the movie and I appreciate that people gave up their lives to save people. It was very moving and it did in fact show how America can share one but once war starts, America will give back to the fighters and pull them out of the rubble alive. That just goes to show you that 9/11 was not just a tragedy but it was a lesson we have learned since the lesson on Titanic in 1914. It was a nice film and I look forward to see others dedicated to the firefighters,army leaders,police team and just day to day people who saved others knowing their lives could go any second. There is one thing I would like to point out.... Five years does not change America. It only just changes the people inside it."
