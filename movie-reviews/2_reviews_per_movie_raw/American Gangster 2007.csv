","American Gangster has been really hated upon in many of the former posts I have read. Yet it seems like they are all saying the same thing, that Gangster didn't have enough action and was really drawn out. Anyone who has every seen a Ridley Scott film will know that his films are long! Blade Runner, A Good Year, Matchstick Men, Hannibal, Black Hawk Down, Gladiator, G.I. Jane, Thelma and Louis, and Alien all ran for at least two hours or more, so big surprise there guys. In addition Scott didn't set out to film another scarface, he set out to tell a story not just about Frank Lucas but rather a tale of corruption and how pervasive it is. One user commented that this film had many side story lines that ""bloated"" the story. This is completely untrue as every ""side story"" is actually the overarching story about the fight against corruption in every facet of life, even Frank Lucas attempts several times to eradicate the corruption in his organization.<br/><br/>Over all this is a great film which really gets into every nook and cranny of an issue. Don't see this film if your just looking for cheap thrills, this is a thinking film about the pervasive dishonesty of our culture.<br/><br/>I gave this film 8 stars because i could find nothing solid that detracted from it, but rather a slew of minor details which gradually brought its score down. But I will put this film in my top films for the year, if only because I have been immensely unsatisfied with the bulk of releases this year."

","Ridley Scott's new flick American Gangster was a good one. Though Im not gonna be saying it's the best film of the year or anything like that. It was directed well, barely any dull scenes, great acting by an enormous cast and was really well-written. Unfortunately the story never seemed ""new"" to me. I was reminded of other drug-related/crime movies, like BLOW, CITY OF GOD, and evening TRAINING DAY.....""My Man"". Though it's in the leagues as being entertaining as the above mentioned movies, it really just never felt like I was watching a ""new"" story. But speaking of story, I never knew anything about Frank Lucas, and his story is fantastic. A black man who was more influential than his Mafian brethren? Tell me you're kidding. Nope, he was a force in Harlem back in the late 60s and early 70s and barely anyone knows about it. But for me this area of the film was the only stand out part. Sure there are other good scenes, done well, but nothing worth mentioning. Well, scratch that, naked women workin in a drug lab was an eye-opening scene.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington won the Oscar when he portrayed the crooked cop in Training Day who said ""My Man"" all the time. Well, in the American Gangster you got him saying this line again, and by God does he have it down. There are scenes when you know he's gonna say it, and he still pulls it off incredibly well. Denzel is one actor you really never have to worry about it in the acting department. You've got Russell ""Mr. Oscar"" Crowe playing the other lead, and like always, he always has the character down. He was great in this flick, the accent, the mannerisms, all of it. Though, his character's story was interesting in that he was in charge of the case to figure out who the big boy druglords were, his side story with his wife was for me the ""dull"" parts of the film. They were well-acted and all that, but mostly, it was just character development that isn't needed. Russell Crowe's good enough an actor to portray a struggling cop without a family problem. And also let me say Josh Brolin as the crooked cop was great. I didn't need a side-story of him doing tons of drugs and banging prostitutes....but ya know he was doing it.<br/><br/>American Gangster was a really good flick. It had amazing acting mixed with scenes that shed a new light on drug-trafficking....or should I say Old light. Though since there are so many other drug/crime cop films out there it seems a little been there done that. But don't let that sway you if you enjoy good movies and or crime films. And also, Frank Lucas is one hell of an interesting personality. My man. 8.5 outta 10"
"vidarium","9","292","401","26 October 2007"," Surprisingly Coherent
","Watch American Gangster without preconceived ideas. While the film is long it never drags. You don't get the sense that you've seen this movie before. It's not Serpico. It's not The Wire. It's not The Sopranos. While much is going on, the story is easy to follow. There is action, but this isn't an ""action movie"".<br/><br/>Both Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe act convincingly and give depth to their characters.<br/><br/>The film leaves you wanting to know more about about happened to the lead characters. You care about them that much. Now *that's* film making."
"Desertman84","10","14","16","18 September 2012"," One Of the Best Gangster Films Ever Made
","American Gangster is a biographical crime film directed by Ridley Scott and written by Steve Zaillian. The film is based on the criminal career of Frank Lucas, a gangster from La Grange, North Carolina who smuggled heroin into the United States on American service planes returning from the Vietnam War. It features Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe in leading roles,together with John Ortiz, Josh Brolin, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Norman Reedus, Ruby Dee, and Lymari Nadal in supporting roles.<br/><br/>There was a time when no one noticed reserved driver Frank Lucas, but when the criminal kingpin he was charged with transporting through the city streets suddenly dies, Lucas seizes the opportunity to build his own criminal empire. In the following months, Lucas solidifies his status as Harlem's most innovative drug dealer by delivering a product that is purer than the competitors' and cheaper, as well. When innovative businessman Lukas attempts to go semi-legit by becoming one of the Manhattan borough's biggest civil supporters, however, street- savvy outcast cop Ritchie Roberts begins to sense a sizable shift in the hierarchy of the drug underworld. But Roberts is one of the few honest detectives operating within a corrupt system, and as he sets out to investigate the case, crooked detective Trupo does everything in his power to compromise the integrity of his idealistic counterpart. Upon clearing all of the usual Mafia-connected suspects, Roberts begins to believe that a previously unknown black power player has come out of the woodwork to dominate the local drug trade. While Roberts and Lucas may be operating on opposite sides of the law, the one thing that both men have in common is a strict code of ethics that separates them from their opportunistic colleagues. Now, as a confrontation between the two men becomes inevitable and the fate of each becomes inexorably tied to the other, it gradually becomes apparent that only one of them will emerge from the conflict victorious.<br/><br/>American Gangster an epic, true crime drama, that although not entirely original in its premise is excellent in its execution.It maybe long at 157 minutes but immerses its audience with its twists and intricacies as it plays out and considers the logistics and consequences of crime and police corruption, with a plethora of show-stealing performances from the cast especially Washington's steely grip on his impersonation of Frank Lucas."
"superduperspit","10","271","398","26 October 2007"," A cops and gangsters classic!
","Starting off, this probably shouldn't be grouped in as a mob film. For one, Crowe's character is as much the lead as Denzel, this is a cops catching the criminal movie. But also, there's not much mob, it's Frank Lucas at the top and everyone else trying to attach to him, he's one man and that is made very clear.<br/><br/>American Gangster works on numerous levels. It's in part a portrait of late 60s-early 70s Harlem and America, full of drugs and desperation and weakness, where the strong rise above the rest and the cops are dirtier than the rats. As a crime thriller it's entertaining and at 2 hours 37 minutes, never loses interest. But, maybe most surprisingly, it's also a superb character drama and study. Literally every character who steps on screen is compelling, has depth to them, has their motivations, and is tossed into conflict. For example there's a scene early on where Crowe's character Richie and his partner are searching a parked car and find a very large amount of unmarked money in the trunk. Without giving away more, it and the following scenes lead to some surprising moral and character statements by Scott. Richie's morals vs everyone else the temptation of the streets is commonly laid on him throughout the film, and thanks to Crowe's great great performance, it adds a lot to the movie.<br/><br/>Denzel is brilliant here. Frank Lucas, with his collected yet fiery, always powerfully menacing performance is one of the better king bosses I can think of in recent memory. When he's not talking, just the way his face is set, he totally totally gets in this character. The academy would do right to easily give him a nomination this year. I also wanted to add that while the two leads don't get on screen till the last 20 minutes, they have a long extended scene that is pure dynamite and gold. They play off each other perfectly and it's well worth the build-up, and maybe are among the highlights of each performance.<br/><br/>Going through supporting actors, Josh Brolin gives one of the year's most surprising performances as an insufferable and despicable dirty cop. He's so slimy, money-grubbing, and yet intelligent and an equal, he's just cunning. Cuba Gooding, Jr. is decent in his one scene, though it's hampered by being mostly unneeded. Chiwetal Ejifor makes a believable side character though he's not given as much to do, and finally I think Ruby Dee could be a sleeper Best Supporting Actress contender for her role as Mama Lucas. Every other short and thankless role I didn't mention is acted superbly here as well, it's a sign of a great director that they're all so on their game.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's direction, brilliant, what can you say. He creates New York and the rats living in it to the point with fantastic attention to detail, and most of the scenes in the film are shot and constructed simply perfectly. This includes the short but brutally effective opening scene, which stands as one of the more memorable openings I've seen in a while. Actually any time there's gunplay or action, even if there isn't that much overall, it's stunning. Particularly, at the end there's a police raid scene that stands as the ""holyyyy crap"" sequence of the film. Going from a hallway to a heroine preparing apartment, and without revealing anything more, it's incredible, simply incredible. Remember when people were going nuts over the tracking shot gimmick in Children of Men? I felt that way about this one. If there's a god, Ridley will finally pick up his directing Oscar this year, he deserves it for this and his wide career.<br/><br/>American Gangster is probably one of the best cop-based films I've seen, and up there with gangster ones. It does one of the best jobs of examining the rise and fall of a crime or drug boss right from the beginning, and dives right into on the other side what it means to be a cop and to strive for something, as well as just telling an awesome and magnificently directed gangster story.<br/><br/>One of the year's very finest films."
"jfcthejock","8","264","388","25 October 2007"," A True Gangster Epic
","Now i've heard some mixed reactions to this movie, and I must say I don't think that. American Gangster is a perfect gangster film. A rise and fall film, but it is done better than both Empire and Carlito's Way put together. Where Empire fails, American Gangster prevails where historical accuracy is needed as well as a good background story. It's violent and sometimes shocking, but being an avid gangster/crime fan i know that compared to others this is almost nothing.<br/><br/>A brilliant biopic of New York gangster Frank Lucasm the film also utilises Lucas's relationship with the Italian Mafia perfectly, giving you almost a two way view of the city's underworld. Denzel Washington excels at the part as Lucas, and Russell Crowe as the cop out to get him is almost blinding. Crowe does a great American accent, as well as portraying a cop out to just do his job but can't properly. It's a a film about Lucas's rise to fame in New York's Heroin business, and his fall due to both Crowe and police persistence.<br/><br/>Like with most gangster films, you are always put off by either the acting or the story. But here this is not the case, you have a true story that does not mask Lucas's violent life but rather portrays it as a life of both murder and violence. It does not glamorise his life in any way, it's a film that says criminals never get away with what they've done. Both Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe are perfect in the criminal and cop relationship.<br/><br/>I would say now do not listen to the negative reviews of this film, they do no justice for the film. I'd recommend this film to fans of crime flicks and those who just want a riveting film to watch."
"dianewds","10","144","207","2 November 2007"," Ridley Rocks!
","Finally a good, accurate, gangster drug-trafficking film that makes you think. It's far from Polyanna and lets no-one group off; not gangsters of any race or ethnicity, not cops on the take, addicts, etc. And importantly, the story, based upon the true life story of Frank Lucas, does not profile a stereotypical black gangster gone wrong but instead shows an elegant, intellectual man who rises to the top of his game but then learns something new in the end. The film is a sure-shot into the Oscars but more importantly, for me, it's a film that is socially responsible and imparts a thoughtful message for any viewer,especially in light of current times.<br/><br/>Technically, it's got it all going on. Script,Camera, lighting,and not only par excellence from Crowe and Washington but the entire acting cast. The film uses fabulous close-ups and unbelievably good action shots. I disagree with any reviews that claim the movie is not packed with enough action or violence. How tiresome that would be! Instead, while including some of the best action/violent shots ever filmed, Mr. Ridley gives us a relevant and real-life look into the narcotics business top-to-bottom and across the board. I would far prefer to see a movie that has a dozen or so magnificently staged violent shots that dare to go deeper and translate both internal as well as external motivations as to depict real life. The film is not only entertaining; its portrayal is authentic to the real life grizzly and sometimes grayed world of crime/justice as well as didactic and amazingly...uplifting. What a nice surprise."
"Quinoa1984","9","145","211","4 November 2007"," a big, intense American crime movie, led by stars and director in top form
","American Gangster seems on the surface to be what has been dubbed by some critics as ""the black Scarface."" As Ridley Scott's new film details, this isn't really the case aside from the point of 'rose up from nothing became something through crime', which could be said about almost every gangster film including the Godfather. Here Scott and screenwriter Steve Zaillian, without calling attention to it ala Paul Haggis, have made a film about class issues underneath the typical gangster-movie form. Even more than the Departed, one sees as the film goes on an environment of paradox: Frank Lucas was a low-life, a killer, a ruthless thug, and at the same time found time to take his mother to church every Sunday and gave out turkeys to folks in the neighborhood while providing them enough dope to die off in the process.<br/><br/>In fact, Scarface has got nothing on Frank Lucas when it comes to moral complexity: here's a man who did rise up out of poverty, learned the stakes of gang life as a driver for the Harlem boss for fifteen years, and then after he died cut out the middle-man as an importer of the freshest product of heroin right out of Vietnam. Then through this there's a whole other level to American Gangster; Scott and Zaillian could have made it simply a saga of betrayals and investigation via Richie Roberts. But the side that one saw in Serpico is amplified here- it becomes all the more engrossing to see how the crooked cops and ""honest"" gangster Lucas were linked together, which also leads to an ending that amps up the interest. Lucas didn't get out like Henry Hill, but a good man all the same? Probably not (he ended up in jail again, as the film doesn't point out).<br/><br/>So there's a lot of story to explore, and Scott makes it one of the most invigorating, nostalgic (ironically speaking) New York crime films in years, as far as the storytelling goes. And like Heat, Scott gets a lot of mileage from his star power. Washington goes even deeper into the role of the villain than he did in Training Day- he plays him as classic family man, cold businessman, and charming man-of-the-community. He makes it so much his role that you can't imagine anyone else going down a Harlem street shooting a guy point blank in the head. And Crowe also adds some good subtlety to the piece, a flawed man with his family and someone who tries to keep his morality straight (the million dollars given in to the station) amidst total bully-crooks like Josh Brolin's ""special"" detective. By the time the two stars finally sit down for one scene, it's on par with De Niro and Pacino.<br/><br/>Why not a 10/10 or 4 stars? It is, despite a rightfully fleshed out narrative, with some unnecessary bits (Cuba Gooding Jr, what happened there?) on a two hour and forty minute picture. But Scott does make American Gangster gain momentum as it goes along and reaches a powerhouse climax that is first intense and bloody (it IS Scott after all), followed by a striking human angle. And it holds nothing on Scarface, at the end of it all, as far as being legitimately dramatic without the ham, as the actors and director click for most part on material that just needs to be told without any pretension- and with that dose of significance of real urban crime in the 1970s in NYC."
"AdiVrj","8","159","239","29 October 2007"," excellent story, flawless performances
","American Gangster is one of the best movies i've recently seen and it is a pleasure to watch even if you are not a gangster movies fan. The story is more captivating than i expected i must say, following Frank Lucas(Denzel Washington) - the afro-American drug lord who raised above all, even the Italian mafia - and Richie Roberts(Russel Crowe), the honest cop in a city full of corruption, sort of Frank Serpico but with less guts. <br/><br/>Denzel Washington delivers a marvelous performance of a man calm and patient yet heart-stopping ferocious at some points, fearless and ambitious but likable as always. His performances are always incredible, he's a great actor, the greatest afro-American actor of all time i dare to say, it's simply a pleasure to watch him in any role.<br/><br/>Russel Crowe delivers a good performance, he's one of the actors that never disappoint in my opinion and i think there's a great chemistry between them (Washington and Crowe) even though few scenes bring them face to face. Richie Roberts is in danger for being one of the few cops that actually do their jobs and refuse to take bribe so i think there's a big resemblance between Richie Roberts and Frank Serpico (Al Pacino 1973).<br/><br/>Cuba Gooding Jr. could have gotten a bigger part, or more scenes because he's a very talented actor and he proved himself many times that he's more than capable of delivering excellent performances. <br/><br/>The drama is less than expected but the movie is very well paced and it never gets boring even if it lasts more than two hours. Everything fits perfectly and there is an excellent antithetical presentation of the wealthy life of Frank Lucas opposite to the lives that he's drugs ruin every day, every hour, every minute... <br/><br/>I strongly recommend to gangster movies fans, actually to those viewers who enjoy good movies because this movie is above average and you will enjoy every second of it."
"worphilms","6","80","119","31 October 2007"," Professional But Derivative and Dull
","If you have seen Serpico, Scarface, and The French Connection, you don't need to see American Gangster. Ridley Scott's new biopic unfortunately shows how a group of stunningly talented craftsmen can create an uninspiring, lackluster, and by-the-numbers piece of cinema. Certainly there are good moments. There is a nice verbal face off between Crowe and Washington (ala HEAT) but its appeal lies more in the power of its stars than in the power of the story. Never is there a moment when I was unaware that I was watching Crowe and Denzel.<br/><br/>The film makes much of the fact that this is a true story about a powerful BLACK gangster whereas other mafia-ish crime stories usually feature Italians. While this may have been an interesting counterpoint, the point is only dealt with in showing that the distinction is irrelevant. Denzel can be just as powerful a crime lord as the rest. So where's the drama?<br/><br/>Crowe's character is yet another, in a long line of movie cops, who is a womanizer and bad father/husband, and yet the most honest cop on the force. This never changes throughout the piece. Where's the drama?<br/><br/>None of this is to say that Scott and company failed at presenting the authenticity of the world and it's characters. The production design is flawless, the characterizations seem to be right on the money, and the music recalls a hipper time. Authenticity, however, does not always translate into dynamic and exciting story telling. <br/><br/>There are no surprises, no real twists, and the inevitable fall of Washington's character and thus his organization, is anti-climactic.<br/><br/>Worth watching if its free."
"AudioFileZ","9","135","211","26 October 2007"," Keeps The Viewer Involved And Interested....Well Done.
","The story about Frank Lucas is one that proves fact is more interesting than fiction. The fact that such a character really did exist yet I do not remember it certainly intrigues me. I guess I was just too young at the time it broke. Now approaching my later forties finds me longing to research it further after seeing this movie.<br/><br/>I get the feeling Ridley Scott was amazed a person such as Frank Lucas was actually able to do what he did and live to tell about it. I certainly share that amazement. The care in which he tells the story serves it well. Though it's basically a gangster movie it's not particularly graphic in violence except in a few scenes. Even Denzel's and Russel's portrayals of the two central characters are not quite as dark as the usual more stereotypical gangster/cop persona...Still there is a sense of doom and danger ever present as the viewer knows neither law enforcement, government, or mafia will let this man's drug empire go on.<br/><br/>To sum it up I believe this is an excellent telling of a true crime story. It's intriguing, entertaining, and certainly serves as a cautionary reminder to remain vigilant in combating drugs."

Yet it was still a very good movie.<br/><br/>The acting performances were also good but not great. Denzel Washington gave a very good performance but not Oscar worthy, it felt like I have seen this before from him. Russell Crowe just was not given the room to actually act. I wish Crowe would have been given more of an opportunity to show off his talent. Josh Brolin gave the best performance as a corrupt police officer. He displayed perfectly the corrupt cop blackmailing both sides for the benefit of himself. I do not really understand the Oscar nomination for Ruby Dee playing Frank Lucas mother. She barley even had a cameo in this movie. It is kind of sad to see how far Cuba Gooding Jr. has fallen not having much of a role in this movie. <br/><br/>What really kept this movie up and kind of brought it down was its steady flow and writing. It did show you some interesting things such as going to Vietnam and having a very unique and surprising place to smuggle in the drugs. Yet as I mentioned before the performances were good but not great because of the writing. I attribute this to the writing. Some of the writing did not allow some of the actors to expand as much as they could have on their roles.<br/><br/>Also the directing was very good but not great. Ridley Scott did show some interesting scenes and had good camera shot. The cinematography was good as well. Yet because the performances were not to great that brings him down because his job to guide arguably two of the best actors today.<br/><br/>This movie was a bit over-hyped but I would still recommend it.

It's a terrific crime film that accomplishes damn near everything it set out to do, and with an amazing cast of performers along with a stellar lead performance and riveting direction from director Ridley Scott (in top form here), it's one of the essential American crime movies of the past decade, drawing influence upon genre classics - such as Superfly, Goodfellas, and Black Caeser, while effortlessly carving its own identity.

You would find more character, depth and sense of place in any episode of Sopranos/Hill Street Blues/Homocide:LOTS. It could easily have been set in the 80's, 90's or even 2000 for all it was worth. There was scant regard to the richness of the environments or the period.<br/><br/>There was very little insight into Washington's character except for a few sparse flashbacks and intermittent lazy exposition and we're not expected to dislike him in any way. By the end everyone is happy and laughing and the moral we're offered is, corrupt cops are bad and get punished whilst Frank Lucas, a cold blooded killer, torturer, crime lord and major league heroin importer is a likable person with a bit of a temper occasionally who only has to serve a measly 15 years having had his sentence reduced from 70yrs aided by the Crowe's character turned defense lawyer!?!?! Most of the supporting characters lacked depth and the subplots didn't really add much to the overall story. As each one dies or just doesn't appear any longer, there is very little sense of loss. Most are just cardboard cutout characters.<br/><br/>There were so many missed opportunities to make this an engaging and enlightening story about an evil man, but Ridley Scott seems to have lost his punch. This is no 'Casino', in fact you would be better off re-watching 'New Jack City' than getting a sore arse sitting through this 2 hours and 45 minutes of two dimensional tedium.<br/><br/>IMDb voters need to get a grip and think more about rating films instead of giving every second rate film like this a 7 or higher rating."

Thankfully most of the movie revolves around him. Crowe's role is rather small by Russel Crowe standards.<br/><br/>We follow Denzel's character, Frank Lucas, as he begins to establish his heroin empire in Harlem, meanwhile Crowe's character, is mainly concerned with him piecing together Lucas' ingenious smuggling ring as he heads up the newly formed drug enforcement police. Denzel's shockingly vengeful character is built throughout the movie, while Crowe's is sparse, as it should be.<br/><br/>There is an interesting side story battle between Denzel and a particularly corrupt cop, who himself has a very interesting end. <br/><br/>The movie stays true to the actual story, and the period, as unbelievable as it is At first you find yourself rooting for the bad guy, however Scott carefully details the effect Lucas' organization is having on the community, which then lends you to appreciate the job of the police. <br/><br/>The end of the movie wraps up nicely with a summary of all the main characters' endings, and some very interesting facts about the original 70's era drug enforcement cops.

","Yeah, yeah I know its Ridley Scott and it will probably win a few academy awards and he made Alien and Gladiator and bla bla bla but when I watched this with a friend, we almost fell asleep from boredom. It's suppose to be a gangstermovie but all they do is talk, talk, talk. Almost no action at all. Russel Crowe displays wooden acting which he has done in all his movies except from ""Proof of life"" and ""LA Confidential"". Denzel Washington doesn't look anything like the real Frank Lucas. He is way too handsome. And he plays the character too much like a nice guy and here is why that is a problem.<br/><br/>I read an interview with the real Richie Roberts, who caught Frank Lucas, who don't understand why is Lucas represented as a good man in this film. According to Roberts, he killed more black people than the KKK, ruined several black families and he was a drug-lord. He was a murderer and a criminal, nothing more. And Ridley Scott makes him seem like a businessman who just happens to be moving cocaine and heroine.<br/><br/>And the real tragedy of it all, was that Frank Lucas only got 7 years in prison, instead of the 70 years, he was sentenced to serve. Because he testified against cops that took bribes from him. And now, because of the movie he sees himself as a hero and a star. And that's how the audience will sea him as well. Nice going Ridley: you made a very, very, very long and really, really, really boring movie, making a murderer and a drug-lord seem like Martin Luther King.<br/><br/>I know nobody will agree with me, but even the greatest moviedirectors in the world, makes bad movies from time to time and this is one of them."

","The best thing this movie had going for it - which is no surprise - is the acting duo of Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. How many bad movies do you see with either of those guys starring in them? Not many, and neither actor disappoints here. Both play fascinating guys, Washington, a big gangster (""Frank Lucas"") and Crowe, an honest cop (""Richie Roberts"") <br/><br/>This movie reminded me a lot of the '83 ""Scarface"" film in which Tony Montana (Al Pacino) rises from the bottom up to be a big drug lord, only to have things crumble big-time. We see a similar tale here with ""Lucas,"" except that his fall is sudden in this story, unlike Pacino's character. <br/><br/>Director Ridley Scott and photographer Harris Savides also give us a slick- looking film, very pretty spots and stylishly-directed.<br/><br/>The story wasn't quite as good as the people who photographed it and acted in it. It's still a good one in that it entertains. I was never bored despite the two- and-a-half-hour length of it. I was a bit confused in the first 25 minutes but things straightened out after that. <br/><br/>The supporting cast in here is very deep with a lot of familiar faces, going all the way back to 83-year-old Ruby Dee.

","I love Denzel and Russell. They have made great movies.<br/><br/>This was not one of them. It doesn't deserve an 8 but it doesn't deserve a 2 either.<br/><br/>I'm sure it has been said already but there were too many unnecessary parts in this movie. Who cares about Richie Roberts (Crowe) custody battle? There were too many scenes concerning his divorce and custody battle. They did nothing in terms of character development except to further pound in into our heads that he is a good man.<br/><br/>I didn't mind the 2 1/2 hour tag but the time could've been used better. One minute Denzel is just a driver and the next he is calling his connect in Vietnam buying heroin. I understand that the movie wanted to be different but it could've fleshed out Frank Lucas's rise to power.<br/><br/>And boy did I feel cheated toward the end, throughout most of the film, Frank Lucas is a reserved man even going out of his way to rough up a few of his friends/family members who draw attention to themselves yet his Puerto Rican wife buys him a chinchilla coat with a matching hat and all of a sudden he is breaking his own rule? I think the wrong things were left on the cutting room floor so to speak some scenes I could have definitely done without while others seemed to be missing from the movie.<br/><br/>It's not a MUST SEE but it's not a waste of time."

","Any movie that runs for 157 minutes needs to be exceptionally gripping in order to keep its audience fully engaged from start to finish but that's just what ""American Gangster"" manages to do. Its story about the rise and fall of a Harlem drug lord is extraordinary because he's home grown (rather than the usual Mafioso) and achieves his success primarily by using his business acumen. The fact that he's a fascinating character provides a consistent level of interest throughout and the knowledge that the events depicted are based on a true story gives the whole undertaking even more substance.<br/><br/>Depictions of a series of developments in the lives of both the American gangster and the narcotics detective who eventually becomes determined to bring him to justice, provide an effective means of telling the story and also work well in highlighting the different characteristics of the two men who are both principled and both flawed in their different ways. The period in which the action is set (the early 1970s) is very accurately evoked and Ridley Scott's disciplined direction ensures that the switching of focus from one character to the other never creates confusion or interrupts the momentum of the narrative.<br/><br/>Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) who'd worked as a driver for Harlem crime boss Ellsworth ""Bumpy"" Johnson (Clarence Williams 111) takes over the running of the gang after his mentor suddenly dies of a heart attack and soon builds his own empire by taking a very innovative approach to his drug dealing business. Bumpy had observed that local legitimate businesses were no longer being run by families because increasingly, middlemen were being cut out so that the suppliers could maximise their profits. Using the same principle, Lucas flies to Southeast Asia where he makes deals with local suppliers and military personnel so that he can import heroin into the United States in the coffins of soldiers who'd been killed in the Vietnam War. His scheme works perfectly because the product that he markets as ""Blue Magic"" is twice as pure as anything else that's available and is sold at half the price.<br/><br/>New Jersey police detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is despised by his colleagues who treat him with contempt for turning in $1,000,000 of unmarked notes that he'd recovered from a car used by a drug dealer and is also hated by his ex-wife because of his infidelity and his failure to be a decent father to his son. When his partner dies from an overdose of ""Blue Magic"", he's given the opportunity to head up a special squad to try to bring the local drug trade under control.<br/><br/>Lucas' spectacular success in selling heroin enables him to use the massive profits to expand the rest of his operation and buy a mansion in New Jersey into which he moves his mother and brothers. He gets married to a Puerto Rican beauty queen who he meets at one of his clubs and at this point, his future looks good. Lucas' success had been partially attributable to his belief in being conservatively dressed and maintaining a low profile but one fateful night, at a top boxing match, when he fails to adhere to both these practices, he attracts the attention of detective Richie Roberts and from that point onwards, his fortunes go into reverse.<br/><br/>Frank Lucas was a man who professed to believe in honesty, integrity, hard work and family values. He was certainly good to his family, generally courteous in his day to day dealings and an astute businessman but was also ruthless and capable of some appalling brutality. In a wonderfully measured performance, Denzel Washington conveys the dignity, intensity and complexity of this charismatic character and makes it clear that Lucas' principles and beliefs were based on what he's learned in the days before he took over the gang from Bumpy Johnson.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is also very good as the detective who's honest and hardworking but is detested with equal venom by both his colleagues and his ex-wife. The supporting cast also do well with Josh Brolin, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Armand Assante standing out.<br/><br/>It's the characters, the strength of the story and some great acting that ultimately makes ""American Gangster"" so compelling and the fact that it doesn't have to rely on chases and explosions to keep its audience's attention testifies to this."

","This movie is a total failure. Totally devoid of any cinematic merits.Waste of money and talent. Seriously, I struggle to find in it just a single redeeming feature.<br/><br/>First, the script and structure. It's 1 hour long exposition when a viewer is just bombarded with very thinly motivated events. Frank Lucas is the bodyguard, driver and sometime enforcer of some crime boss, then his boss dies. Lucas makes a phone call to Thailand and goes there and gets wads of horse. All of sudden without any interference from drug-overlords he becomes a major purveyor of best heroin, which sells for half-market price. At the same time, a story told million times before about a good cop within corrupt police environment, who has some family troubles. Secondly, the acting. Washington just can't play mean types. He lacks a mean streak in him. It's simply unconvincing, especially when in crisis he starts mumbling something frenetically. And this guy shoots a competing gangster in the face in the middle of busy street (again without any consequences). And Crowe just doing his Crowe thing - nervous wrecked action man thing. Thirdly, pretentious attempts to give the whole thing some historical context. Constant reminders of Vietnam war going on in the background. It's so clichÃ©. Was it so necessary to pipe this thing every 15 min or so of valuable screen time? And last but not least, putting an air of deep message behind this razzle-dazzle with statements about America, American dream, etc. It's been done many many times before with much more effective results."

","American Gangster is based in 1970s America.

I saw this film hanging around and I was like ""I might as well"". That is probably one of the best choices I have ever made. The acting was magnificent from Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe to Chiwetel Ejiofor (the guy from 2012. Yeah, we'll forgive him) and Ruby Dee. I loved the conflict between both Denzel Wahington's character and Russell Crowe's character because it is so unique in the way they interact with each other even though they are on separate sides of the law. Denzel' Washington's character was my favorite. He is a genius and he is one of those characters that doesn't really like what he is doing but does it to better his family. I makes it hard to think he is a bad guy even though he is a bad guy. When you like the bad guy, you know you've done a good job (Heath Ledger's joker, Geoffery Rush's Captain Barbosa, Tom Cruise's Vincent in Collateral). Now, because it is a gangster film, naturally, you compare it to other gangster film's and I defiantly it is one of the best because of it's presence, writing, acting and Ridley Scott's amazing directing. To be honest, I found it more entertaining then The Godfather. That's right I said it. The music as well is brilliant. It makes it easier to immerse yourself into the era. Loved every second of it."

In spite of being a good film, the IMDb User Rating Top 250: #210 is overrated. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""O Gangster"" (""The Gangster"")"
"Grant_Price","5","20","34","23 November 2007"," Spoilers for what? Nothing interesting happens.
","The latest Ridley Scott/Russell Crowe collaboration reminds me a lot of Serpico (1973.) You've got the star talent (i.e. Crowe in place of Pacino), the premise of an honest policeman working nearly alone to expose corruption in the police force and the backdrop of 1970s New York to do it in. Also, like Serpico, it fails to deliver in most respects. Much of the film concerns Denzel Washington as the eponymous American Gangster Frank Lucas, a violent criminal from Harlem with a monopoly on the heroin trade in New York. Russell Crowe is Richie Roberts, the narcotics officer tasked with bringing him down. Sounds exciting doesn't it? Well it isn't. At 157 minutes long, 'Gangster was always going to have a job keeping the audience's attention for the entire time. However, it didn't even keep my attention for half the time. The various threads at the start of the film take over an hour to actually intertwine with each other, by which time I didn't care anymore. Even then, there's no payoff until around near the end with a pseudo-Godfather montage of Richie destroying Lucas' entire operation while Lucas attends church with his mother. I for one expected Lucas to go down in a blaze of frenzied violence inside the church (indeed a Denzel-Training Day death was all I was waiting for,) thus salvaging some of the previously wasted 2 hours but no, it's not that kind of film. Instead, Frank Lucas provides evidence against all the corrupt narcotics policemen in New York and gets to serve a fifth of his prison time for it. So basically the story is 'Policeman arrests baddie who rats on other baddies and goes to prison but not for long.' How disappointing.<br/><br/>As for the characters, Denzel Washington fluctuates from being a cool, controlled, intelligent and observant customer to a Tony Montana-esquire psychopath who repeatedly attacks his brothers and cousins if things go wrong. Indeed, the only cool instance worthy of remembrance by Lucas is where he shoots a rival without hesitation in a street in broad daylight. If only the rest of the film had been full of these little gems. Instead we are treated to the estrangement and divorce proceedings of Richie Roberts from his wife (yawn) and constant reminders that as an honest cop he has to do everything himself, with no help from the suits upstairs. Josh Brolin puts in a trite performance as one of the cops on the take, adding nothing except a homosexual moustache to the proceedings. For once Cuba Gooding Jr is competent in his role, which is the best one could hope for. Finally, the last individual who sticks in the mind long enough to form an opinion of is Armand Assante, who is actually rather good in his hunting jacket and Vito Corleone mannerisms. Oh, and special mention has to go to the Vietnamese heroin plantation owner who looks like a drag queen in a suit.<br/><br/>Overall I would not waste my time with this again even if there are a couple of cool moments and the clothes look splendid. Considering the extensive hype and promise surrounding the film, the quote by Frank Lucas ""The loudest man in the room is also the weakest man in the room"" sums up American Gangster nicely."
"MovieMan1975","7","62","122","5 November 2007"," Unoriginal Boring Disappointment
","American Gangster may be the most boring, unoriginal, flaccid film that Ridley Scott has yet to make.<br/><br/>Coming from the man who created Alien, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, and Blade Runner, it boggles my mind as to why this film was not infused whatsoever with his signature style, pacing, and panache.<br/><br/>This film tries so hard to be a sweeping epic crime saga, but in the end, cannot hold a candle to any Martin Scorsese work, for instance.<br/><br/>American Gangster is dull. Its also boring, pointless, flat, limp, and completely cliché ridden.<br/><br/>A combination of Serpico, Dead Presidents, Donnie Brasco, Goodfellas, Carlito's Way, and what have you... this film ends up being a mishmash, using mostly the boring parts of the aforementioned films.<br/><br/>None of the characters of very engrossing, with Denzel Washington's character coming across as inauthentic and about as deep as a puddle of water in the Gobi.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, the film has no major glaring flaws, a testament to Ridley Scott's experience and craft. The script is acceptable, but lacking any style or idiosyncrasy and lacking any real depth. The story has no message, no meat - its just a random story; even having it based on real events gave it no gravitas. The acting is also acceptable, but lacking any bravado. Crowe is his likable credible self, showing flashes of energy - but unfortunately his character is nothing but a poor man's Frank Serpico. Denzel somehow totally misses the mark. His character is seriously underwritten, and Denzel gives us one note for almost 3 hours - and that is mostly of his now trademark ""self-righteous African American"". Despite being the ""bad guy"" in the film, Denzel does not give us a true villain. If the moral ground of this character is supposed to be grayed, giving us an anti-hero, its not. At least not sufficiently to give Denzel proper ammo to work with. What we get is a murderer and drug dealer, who is not such a bad guy because he buys a white man's mansion for his mother. Somebody please hold the bucket whilst I puke in it.... The rest of the supporting cast is also serviceable, but like the leads, lacks any true punch. One exception is Josh Brolin, who gives the one memorable turn as a crooked cop. The look of the film is interesting - a kind of grayish beige-ish wash out... as if you are looking at ""cleaned up"" 70's footage. However, like everything else in the film, the camerwork lacks the ballet and balls of Ballhaus or Richardson, for instance. Considering how Ridley Scott has taken the visuals of most his films to the limits, its a major disappointment that he decided to make the aesthetics of this film to be one dimensional.<br/><br/>The generic title of this film should have been a red-flag that American Gangster was going to be a flat, cliché-d, overlong flaccid crime ""epic"", with no interesting visuals, a boring pointless story, and characters devoid of any interest."
"kefahuchi","6","23","41","27 October 2007"," OK, not great.
","Well thank god Denzel pulls a solid performance out of the bag because without it this film would fall apart.<br/><br/>The story/plot is really too broken up and episodic to fit Ridley Scott's direction. Characters come and go without any real feel for how they develop the story or flesh out the main characters; if you want an example watch out for Frank's baseball playing nephew. It just makes no sense. Then have a think about how Scorcese or De Palma would have handled these characters.<br/><br/>I'm not knocking Scott and the two leads do their job pretty well. It just needed to be a much narrower story. Then all those little touches and neat sequences (Washington's immaculate outfits or Crowe following the $20k bait) would nail the story in your mind's eye."
"Turfseer","4","12","19","23 December 2007"," 'Gangster' is no 'Scarface'
","After watching the real Frank Lucas being interviewed on BET, I couldn't believe that Denzel Washington was cast as him. Denzel unfortunately is no Laurence Olivier and is unable to play anyone other than Denzel Washington. As others have pointed out, it's particularly difficult for him to play bad guy parts. There's no range or nuance in his performance to the point that he could have been playing any other gangster. The real Frank Lucas is a very unique character and Denzel virtually made no attempt to show any of this guy's idiosyncrasies. The writers do a poor job in fleshing out the Frank Lucas character as Denzel has little to do in his interactions with the other characters (Lucas's wife is the worst written part--her biggest scene is ducking a bullet meant for Frank toward the end of the movie).<br/><br/>The story takes a very long time to get going and probably a half hour could have been cut from the beginning. The transition from Lucas going from small time protégé of Bumpy Johnson to big-time drug dealer is not very convincing. Other scenes seem completely over the top (for example, when Frank shoots a rival on the street to impress his family members and then calmly comes back and joins them to finish his meal. Have you ever heard of a murderer who doesn't want to get caught remain near the scene of the crime?)<br/><br/>While the director attempts to show in part that Lucas's actions had very negative consequences for his community, the victims are shown at a distance in a docudrama style. In fact, the film would have been better made as a docudrama for the History Channel than a feature film. <br/><br/>Russell Crowe does a serviceable job as the beleaguered detective (and later prosecuting attorney) who tracks down Lucas. But he's basically reprising his hard-edged detective part form L.A. Confidential. I read an article that the detective/prosecutor played by Crowe had a much lesser role in taking down Lucas in real life. One gets the feeling about American Gangster that the screenwriter only was able to collect the basic facts surrounding the life of Frank Lucas and virtually had little knowledge of Lucas's family members, criminal associates and opponents. Hence, the most fleshed out characters are the detective, his family and fellow cops as opposed to the people we would like to know more about (such as Nicky Barnes, etc.). The screenwriter ends up padding the script with some long drawn out chase scenes to make the film more dramatic. But at its core, there are few interesting revelations here aside from the surface facts of Lucas's story found on TV and in magazines. I would rather watch Al Pacino in the sensationalist ""Scarface"" which was far more entertaining than the plodding 'Gangster' which never rises to the grandeur it aspires to."

I've increased from 7 to 9 as it's still not a grand storytelling. This is still a great film, and if you haven't seen it or have only seen the cinema cut, the extended is my recommendation.

And did Crowe even get his hair cut for this movie? Denzel pulls off the bad guy and the DOP had some flair at certain points. Midway thru the movie we move through 1970s New York with mood and grist but other scenes are shot like they're out of an MOW.<br/><br/>If I could vote 6.5 I would but its more weighted towards a 6 than a 7. Most of all, its so disappointing. Anytime you can shoot a period movie in New York AS New York with apparently unlimited money with all the time for casting and you come up with this you've got to be disappointed. The whole Kramer vs Kramer subplot with Crowe's character and his ex-wife could have been left on the cutting room floor. My guess is that with Crowe doing so many Ridley Scott films in a row that he's got too much power on set and in the editing room. Combine that with a director with limited narrative skills and you've got a loser. Crowe steals the scene near the end where they finally meet face to face and I'm sure if it was edited differently, it easily could have been Denzel's scene to steal."

The filmmakers had an incredible true story to work from - the rise of Harlem drug dealer Frank Lucas, who became bigger than the Mafia by importing 100 percent pure cocaine at discount prices from Vietnam, smuggling it into America in the caskets of dead soldiers. They also had two of today's best actors and mega stars in Oscar winners Denzel Washington, who plays Lucas, and Russell Crowe as the cop, Detective Richie Roberts, who is chasing him. Washington and Crowe are mesmerizing and there are powerful performances by Ruby Dee as Lucas' mother, John Ortiz as Roberts' partner and Cuba Gooding Jr. playing against type as fellow Harlem drug dealer ""Mr. Untouchable"" Nicky Barnes. But despite all of this, the film is bogged down by a meandering and sloppy screenplay that takes too long to tell the story, and then has to rush at the end to play out the final act when the two adversaries come together. The film also suffers from cast overload as actors like Chiwetel Ejiofor (superb in Don Cheadle's ""Talk to Me""), Common, and T.I. play characters that lack depth.

I love gangster films, but this was not my favourite.<br/><br/>So what can I say about a film that sometimes looks like a Harlem Sopranos, or has cliché TV announcer exposition through the early 70s. What stands out in this film that makes it unique? The story of Frank Lucas is kind of well known. Denzel is great in the role. Crowe is almost exactly in the era and location to be Serpico. No car chases, but otherwise has a ""French Connection"" quality to it (including a key scene). Did Ridley Scott want to de-emphasise production style for pedestrian docudrama? Did this movie not try hard enough to show a unique view of a well worn genre?<br/><br/>I say.. guilty. Although competent acting gives this a positive rating from me, I can't recommend it for much else. Therein lies another drawback, the 2 1/2 hour running time. Something I believe is unjustified for - once again - lack of depth, in what we are supposed to feel for all involved.

","Ridley Scott makes an awful lot of noise in his well heeled films and says very little. American Gangster is no exception. This glossy and slick looking tale about a Harlem drug kingpin and the cop that brought his empire down is a slow moving, disjointed and suspenseless two and a half hour bore. Even though the film primarily focuses on its two main characters they never really develop much from the first reel. Gangster Denzel Washington moves Sphinx like throughout the film. Looking like he stepped off the cover of GQ, his handsome sinister look never really takes off and when he does go into an occasional rage, it is unconvincing and inconsistent to a character that sleep walks through most of the film. The opening scene immediately establishes the savagery Lucas is willing to administer to maintain power but then the rest of the film is spent attempting to sanitize him. <br/><br/>Russell Crowe, a lot more animated, is terrible as well but for different reasons. Once again he is the working class stiff super hero who can do no wrong as he maintains a squeaky clean honesty throughout, refusing bribes, turning in partners and bucking a law enforcement system that seems to be totally corrupt. In addition he is working his way through law school which will give him added superpowers in the films epilogue and of course he manages to screw hot chicks, display his tough guy and sensitive side and on more than one occasion step in to save the day. His only flaw seems to be his lack of fatherly attention to his son. However even this is assuaged when his wife goes into a tirade about his poor parenting skills but is quickly mollified by his martyr like explanation. A sense of shame comes across her face. Even though her outburst is justified it's hard to hate this gruff but lovable shaggy dog, the most honest man in all of New York. <br/><br/>While too much time is wasted on Detective Roberts story it does enable director Scott to juxtapose heavy handed irony all over the place. On Thanksgiving, straight arrow Roberts sits home in a cluttered apartment having a sandwich of dry turkey and potato chips. Meanwhile at the Lucas mansion Scott creates a wonderful mise en scene that evokes a Norman Rockwell Saturday Evening Post cover. He likes it so much that he replicates it later in the film. Much of the film is overkill with repeated montages of violence and intravenous drug use. Scott shows a real nostalgia (along with the requisite cheap shot Hollywood interpretation of a racist, antisemitic, incompetent portrayal of government officials) for the Seventies but it never gets below the surface. It is all gloss and pose and lacks the passion and realism of the excellent 70's cop films, The French Connection and Serpico which it attempts to imitate.<br/><br/>National treasure Ruby Dee is treated just like one and her performance as Frank's mother reflects it. It is one of many failed opportunities by Scott to flesh out Lucas as a man through his relationships with family and friends. The one with his wife is nearly invisible. Her major contribution to the film is getting the reserved Lucas to dress up like Super Fly. Josh Brolin's corrupt Detective Trupo is the film's only bright spot. He portrays a fierceness and intensity far more convincing than anything else in this entire film. American Gangster deserves the death penalty."
"charchuk","4","12","21","14 January 2008"," Thoroughly mediocre
","This is basically a paint-by-numbers crime drama, and I didn't like it much at all. Not only is it just repeating themes and story lines that have been done ad nauseum in older, better films, but it brings absolutely nothing new to the table. The characters are all very conventional, unsurprising, and totally bland. Any attempt to add depth into these one-dimensional, shadowy figures comes across as very obvious and totally disingenuous. Crowe's character is occasionally interesting, but he soon reverts to the ""womanizing boy scout"" that is too natural, and, thus, not natural at all. Denzel is just playing Denzel, there's no hint of danger or hostility in his performance, even when he's performing criminal acts. You get the sense that he could stop selling drugs and coach a football team. The dialogue is all very obvious and to-the-point, the sets and costumes are loud and garish and, again, far too obvious, and the direction is uninspired and largely unremarkable. It's a solidly made, but thoroughly mediocre mob tale."

","Well, I did not like the movie that much, because the story wasn't quite creative. There are other movies almost similar to American Gangster. The introduction of the two main characters was far too long. It would have been better to connect the actions of Frank and Richie more effectively in the beginning of the movie rather than in the middle of it. What was great though was the choice of the musical underlining, the camera perspectives and most important the acting itself. Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe developed their characters very good during the movie and it was great watching them hunt each other. The ending was a really good one, too. Everything was solved. There were no questions left AND I thought playing ""Amazing Grace"" was a kick. They couldn't have chosen a better song to show the irony in the game they all played."
"ElMaruecan82","10","5","7","11 October 2019"," Frank Lucas, the gangster who means business... literally.
","""Every gangster's downfall will be his false sense of invincibility""<br/><br/>I found that quote in a Youtube comment from the clip showing Frank Lucas' arrest and that it belongs to notorious mobster Carmine Galante who ended up shot in his favorite restaurant, gives it such an eerily prophetic dimension it can work as a mantra of the gangster genre.<br/><br/>They all start with a fascination for the gangster-figure and end with the realization that sooner or later, wings get burned.""Goodfellas"", ""Scarface"", ""Casino"" etc. all follow that arc and even ""The Godfather"" if you consider the sequels, providing the perfect canvas for a captivating character studies. And as Lucas, Denzel Washington, intimidating in all calculated smoothness, encapsulates the 'initial reaction', exuding the kind of macho appeal we secretly long for in our boring and compromising lives like Pacino, De Niro or from the old days Cagney and Robinson.<br/><br/>It's a timeless story rooted in any decade of America's contemporary history, a gangster makes his bones, expands his territory, earning many friends, a few enemies and the dreamgirl. Gangster films are the antithesis of fairy tales for they have a happy beginning and all build up for the downfall that might come from greed, human mistakes, ambition, betrayal, sometimes even principles... there's always a price to pay. Lucas could keep his fortune and quit drug business while he was at the top, he chose to move on, ego was his downfall but he had understandable motives that show that gangsters storylines aren't schematic for the sake of it.<br/><br/>The genre is perhaps the best social commentator to the American dream, the irony that a man had to use capitalistic methods to reign over Harlem and restore order. He might be a killer and a heroin dealer, Lucas is a visionary businessman who learned from the 'best'. While Scorsese's films feature flawed characters, ""American Gangster"" is closer to ""The Godfather"" in its depiction of a brilliant man who took the wrong direction: a good manager whose ""my man"" catchphrase resonates as Brando's offer one can't refuse, so when it's time to get off the cover and pull the trigger, he won't hesitate. One of the most memorable scenes have him kill a rival in broad daylight and it's not much the boldness of the move than the certitude that no one will snitch on him.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's biography of Frank Lucas' life accomplishes something I didn't think was possible, combining many elements of the gangster genre that, taken alone, would've been enough to make a great film. First mention to the organizational aspect: the death of Bumpy Johnson left Harlem chaotic and comforted the Italian mafia couldn't keep control. Lucas understands the necessity of leadership and in all admirable pragmatism, decides to sell a better product at a lower price, and the Vietnam war offers a perfect cover to smuggle heroin directly from the main source. On its own, his success is a marketing school-case enhanced by a memorable moment where he lectures a big customer (Cuba Gooding Jr.) on the value of brand and merchandising.<br/><br/>Another value that plays a key role in the film is family. Lucas isn't a womanizer, he believes in family ties, gives jobs to his relatives, buys a house for his mother (Ruby Dee), gets married and shares a Happy Thanksgiving dinner with everyone. But ike in ""The Godfather"", family is a double-edged sword as Lucas owes the most of his troubles to screw-ups from his relatives, including his nephew (Chewitel Ejiofor) and to counterbalance these effects, the crowning moment belongs to little Mama Lucas who prevents Frank from killing a corrupt cop (played by Josh Brolin) because even she knew it was personal and her angst toward her son spoke in subtext: ""this has nothing to do with business!"" Dee deserved her Oscar nomination for that scene alone.<br/><br/>And I guess Washington (who was perfect) was snubbed because we've seen a lot of that before, ""The Departed"" was still fresh in memories and other titles keep popping when you watch one scene or another: Lucas asking his nephew to keep a low-profile and not to be too loud fashion-wise channeled De Niro's warning after the Lufthansa heist in ""Goodfellas"", Lucas' shooting a man on the forehead being his ""defining"" moment echoed the restaurant scene when Michael shoots Sollozo. Still, the most significant parallel is the climax, set in a church where Lucas is sitting with his wife and mother intercut with shots where cops arrest the family members. The baptism was Michael's rise, the mass isn't much Lucas' downfall but the cops' triumph as the film isn't just about criminals but about the law. The film is both ""The Godfather"" and ""The French Connection"".<br/><br/>Though it occupies one tenth of this review, half the film belongs to the investigation lead by Richie Roberts, Russell Crowe as a cop who ostracized himself after refusing to keep a million dollar found in a car. It's only fair for a gangster reminding of Michael Corleone to have a ""Serpico"" against him. And I loved the way the film patiently waited for their two paths to converge at the conclusion and have them talk about a simple concept: ""the right thing"". A brilliant man did horrific things and lead a happy life (though briefly), a man acted straight and lived miserable. Lucas was a criminal but a self-made man, Richie served the law but without any reward whatsoever.<br/><br/>Washington and Crowe magnificently embody the contradictions of the American dream, making for a multilayered story of men acting according to their beliefs for right or wrong. It's easy of course to root for Roberts, as for Lucas, I guess all you've got to do is listen carefully to the lyrics of ""Across the 110th Street"", the song says everything, speaking from Harlem's heart of darkness, from the 'soul' before passing the torch to rap music at the end of the film... when Lucas was history already."
"adrian290357","5","5","7","16 January 2009"," Mediocre
","I am afraid I am borrowing views expressed in some of the other crits: This film borrows extensively from classics as The Godfather, The French Connection, Scarface and even Apocalypse Now but it comes nowhere near any of them. The acting is not bad but I have a problem with the development of the central character, Frank Lucas. He appears to have some principles but quickly embarks on the narcotics trade, cares not who else it might affect, and does not think twice about executing a competitor in public. Lucas kissing his brother on the mouth and later beating him up smacked of The Godfather Part II relationship between Pacino and Cazale but it did not come across anywhere near as viscerally. In the end, just so that he does not spend the rest of his life in jail he is willing and reptilian enough to turn in all those that he bribed and that served him. Perhaps his flaws are only human but I care more for a mad bugger like Tony Montana in Scarface than for this cold-hearted kingpin that uses national institutions such as the US Army for personal gain and should face high treason but instead skulks away with a reduced jail term as if that were ennobling and worthy of 157 minutes of film. Russell Crowe comes across more credibly as a copper who places job before family but real life has its ironies and I did not think a honest man like him would become a defense lawyer whose first client would be... Frank Lucas. Ridley Scott's direction lacks verve and inventiveness and it rambles here and there, especially when Lucas' family comes into the picture. The period detail is adequate though I have seen better. The cinematography is of tolerable quality (I have watched more polished TV productions). Finally, the screenplay is a patchwork of clichés I would not have wanted my name associated with. This is a big production movie with big stars to match with the aim of doing well at the box office, and I am sorry I paid hard earned money for this product thereby indirectly helping maintain this industry that treats spectators like so many sheep. American Gangster is mediocre film-making, its moral values are dire, and the lesson I gleaned was an old one: As long as you have money and connections you can get away with murder. I doubt that knowledge makes me a better man but it sure as hell renders me fitter for survival. Is that what I want out of life, though? NO!"

"eric262003","4","9","15","19 January 2009"," Nowhere Close To a Classic Gangster Flick
","For those who are looking for a equally compelling gangster movie like ""Goodfellas"" or ""Donnie Brasco"", well keep looking, because ""American Gangster"" simply doesn't fit the bill. It's like buying a new car, that looks great on the outside and everything looks like it's in tact. Then when you start, the motor, smoke comes pouring out, the tires become flat, and eventually, the engine dies out. That's how I felt about this movie. The critics hyped about how wonderful this movie is, only to end up with a bag full of nothing. <br/><br/>My dismay is in so many locations, I don't know where to start. Right off the band wagon, it was a bad idea from the beginning to let Ridley Scott take the director's seat for this project. His storytelling abilities truly leaves much for him to be desired. A story of this high level should have been handled more carefully,pulling away no stops, with a superb cast of talented performers, this movie had potential to up there with ""The Godfather"" and ""Goodfellas"". <br/><br/>Within the parameters of ""American Gangster"",there are several hooks and angles in the real story, the creative team sorely neglected. For example, Frank Thomas (Denzel Washington) was completely illiterate that even counting seemed foreign to him. Pretty good for a man who has a fortune of over $250 billion. And his way of counting was by scales. So let me ask you, why did Lucas sport a calculator? <br/><br/>The relationship between Lucas and his accomplice Bumpy Johnson goes on without any reference. Johnson was one of Harlem's most infamous and well-known residents. Lucas shared an alliance with Johnson for a span of almost 15 years as a loyal and dedicated friend. Johnson was like a second father to Lucas. Other stuff that was ignored includes Lucas' upbringing or how he hired a hit-man to take one of his brother's out. Other side stories that were neglected include his young cousin killed by the KKK or his transition from a petty thug, to a powerful drug-lord. Or even the era when there was time when Harlem was a city you were proud to call home, only to see it crumble under his wing with fear and terror.It was during the 1960's and 1970's that the city of Harlem took a turn for the worst which had potential to be a compelling story. But thanks to the carelessness of the crew, we never get to see the whole picture. <br/><br/>These stories plus others should have been there and I hold blame to producer Brain Glazer for not including these stories that I aforementioned. It left me lost in the dark without a clue. It's obvious that no research was done before the filming commenced. I was also appalled that such a talented performer like Cuba Gooding Jr. as the infamous drug lord Nicky Barnes be demoted to just a semi-cameo performance. But he's not the only one who's been let down here. The cast had a strong talent pool and yet they ended up playing mostly watered down performances. No blame to the actors, but to the crew behind this madness. I think the handling of this movie would have been better if Martin Scorsese or Spike Lee took over the directors seat. Then I would have seen potential.<br/><br/>Overall this film was far too patted to be a riveting film. The motives behind the crew was that the movie was destined to keep you entertained rather than tracing the story based on fact. The key to great film is sitting at the dinner table with friends and family discussing it with those surrounding you. After this movie was over, my friends and I had nothing to say, because this movie offers just that, absolutely nothing."

Never have I seen a movie that had so much hype surrounding it and be such a snore on the screen. Usually these kinds of movies are at least semi entertaining. This one was nothing but a big bottle of sleep aid. Every time I kept thinking it was going to get better it just got worse. Russel Crowe was mildly entertaining but like Washington, lacked any believability in his character. I have seen many movies this year. If this one gets recognized for anything by the motion picture association it will be a huge miss carriage of justice to movies who truly deserve it as well as the actors who will be by passed for Washington. This movie deserves nothing. A huge waste of my time and money."

"mick-137","6","6","9","29 September 2008"," A missed opportunity given the resources assembled
","A well-crafted film with great performances, but which lingers on the unimportant details and then strangely rushes the crux of the story. It's a bit like a Grandpa Simpson anecdote. The early sections of the film amble along at the pace of a six-episode TV show, filling in enormous amounts of the characters' back stories, much of which is simply not relevant to the plot. By the time the two main characters lives finally begin to converge, there's no time left to explore how and why their relationship develops the way it does--which is the really interesting part of the story. This has the odd effect of making the denouement, even though it is based on fact, seem somewhat unlikely."

","There is nothing about this film that would make me watch it again. Firstly, the plot. Frank Lucas (Washington), a black man from Harlem involved in organized crime imports pure Herion from Vietnam and makes a killing selling on the streets of New York City. He is a ruthless gangster which is capable of doing anything to defend his business. Enter Russell Crowe at Det. Richie Roberts, the vehemently honest cop who once handed back $1 million in unmarked bills that he found. Roberts heads up a special task force to find who is smuggling this pure heroin into the streets on the New York.<br/><br/>That brief summation is basically all that is worth noting sans the ending. There's is some insight to Roberts' family, his womanizing, and divorce proceedings with his wife, which seems to have been included to fill time. There is no interesting character development, perhaps other than Lucas' mother, once full of praise for her boy finally faces the harsh truth about his life of crime. The performance's aren't that great either, there is just nothing in this script for them to work with. It seems that the writers had this potentially interesting story to tell but evidently no clue about how to tell it. Subsequently, the plot jumps around all over the place. ""Who's this guy Lucas' is beating up now? Pfft. Who cares""..is what was my eventual mind-set. Forgettable, really."
"bob the moo","Null","7","11","28 November 2007"," A strange but effective mix of ""movie gangster epic"" and The Wire which produces more strengths than weaknesses (but does produce both)
","Having spent over a decade as Bumpy Johnson's driver, Frank Lucas looks to step up into the gap following his death. Looking to avoid the glitz and publicity of his peers, Lucas makes a connection in the Far East after seeing a news article on the abundance of drugs and its impact on US soldiers. Using military aircraft to transport the goods, Lucas enlists his family and trusted associates to put a cheaper but higher quality product onto the streets, quickly dominating the market  his low profile meaning he avoids the traps of dirty cops and investigations. Meanwhile clean, but deeply unpopular cop Richie Roberts is allowed to put together a small unit to look into the source of the new wave of drugs.<br/><br/>I do like my crime dramas and it seemed obvious to me that I would enjoy American Gangster given the calibre of people involved in it and, watching it last night, I must say that I did find it a satisfying and enjoyable film. The pace is comparatively slow but yet the story comes over as packed  not busy to the point of being hustle and bustle but more just constantly engaging and interesting. Based on a true story, the film seems in no particular rush and I did respect this in the delivery as it allowed me room to be involved in the telling rather than it trying to constantly hold my attention with action or loud noises. Of course some viewers will feel the absence of these stimuli more than I did but for me it worked.<br/><br/>I was surprised by how uncinematic it felt though. Considering the sweep and scale of the last Crowe/Scott film (Gladiator), American Gangster is remarkably absent of visual flair. As other reviewers have commented it did have the feel of an episode of The Wire in how ""matter of fact"" it was. Of course to me there can be no higher compliment than being compared to that HBO series and personally I had no problem with this approach despite it feeling a little odd on a large screen. The cast fill that same screen though and the film is deep in names all giving solid performances or better. Washington plays his character out well while Crowe contrasts with him nicely in individual and shared scenes. Neither has a lot in the way of character development beyond the obvious but the overall approach of the film made this less important than it otherwise would have been. Supporting these two are too many people to discuss within IMDb's word limit. Ejiofor, Brolin, Levine, Common, RZA, Gooding Jr, Assante, TI, Morton and of course The Wire's own Elba all turn in supporting roles among other faces; although it should be said that anyone enamoured with Elba's Stringer Bell as I am will be disappointed with his smaller, simpler character here. If anything the cast is almost too deep as it did distract at times to be constantly thinking ""that's the guy from etc"" but in terms of quality it is hard to really complaint.<br/><br/>As I said I had no real problem with Scott's visual style and restrained ""factual"" delivery but in a way it could have done with learning some lessons from Scorsese. By this I specifically mean the use of music. The tracks are all great but they are not so much ""used"" as they are ""played"". Goodfellas is a great example of how to use music and somehow this film just did even try to compare  indeed even choosing some tracks that were only ever going to put the viewer in mind of another film (eg Across 110th Street from Jackie Brown). All told though I did appreciate the gritty and unflashy approach of the film as it did suit the manner of the telling.<br/><br/>So a strange but effective mix then. In a way it carries itself like a classic gangster tale suggesting that it sits up there with Godfather and Goodfellas. But then in other ways it channels The Wire's ""matter of fact"" and unflashy style to deliver an engaging and convincing story that is well delivered by all. Somehow the mix works for the greater good even if it also produces some downsides to both. Not the perfect classic that some reviews would have you believe but certainly a solid and roundly strong product that is worth seeing for many reasons."

","Denzel Wahington unconvincingly plays Drug Mogul Frank Lucas who becomes one of America's most ruthless Heroin distributors in 1960's by sourcing pure Heroin from Vietnam during the war there. Inexplicably Frank Lucas inherits this African-American organised group and manages to import pure heroin through use of the American Military forces in Vietnam. On one hand Lucas has this heroin empire which must have connections running to the top of American executive government to have pulled thus off over a period of time and on the other hand he operates outside the internal corruption of the New York Police and other enforcement agencies who eventually play a major part in his down fall . Denzel is as unconvincing as he was in ""Training Day"" and play good guys.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott manages once again to pull off another epic , blockbuster type film with the most incredulous cliché story line and badly cast actors. I refer to Scott's use of Russel Crowe who plays New York Cop Det Richie Roberts. Like in ""Gladiator"" is to flabby , fat , morose, monotone and expressionless to play an action hero. Anyone who thinks Crowe is even a fair actor is deluded his accent was pathetic for a New York Jewish Cop let alone a strong determined one. Crowe's body language and his awkwardness in even with just plain walking make him the most overrated actor in Film History since Cate Blanchett and Toni Collet. <br/><br/>Scott last great film was ""Aliens"" which was more a success for its art direction than his directing and since he has produced a string of mediocre but highly successful films. The success of this film is more due to its production marketing values and lacks substance. <br/><br/>Scott's scenes of the damage that Heroin does set against the excesses of Crime bosses would hardly surprise even the most unaware audience these days. The main message of this film is that even if you cannot act if you are rich enough you can end up being cast as a hero a in a big budget films. Action entertainmentThis film is full of the same old drug trafficking conspiracy theories connected to the Vietnam war and south east Asia. The worst aspect is that it has Russel Crowe who cannot act to save his life. This flabby aging old mole faced bastard has two expressions on his face arrogant and conceited. When is America going to get over its adulation of wealthy and privileged Australians buying their way into the best roles and then buying Oscars. <br/><br/>The United States of America has plenty of great actors and its a pity Denzel Washington and other great Actors have to appear in films in which Australians give it the kiss of death. <br/><br/>America be ashamed."

","How do I put this? American Gangster is good enough of a movie to distract you from the questions you'll find yourself asking about the plot, for a while at least. The movie is very well acted - Denzel and Crowe don't disappoint. They are, however, showing their age. Neither have the chiseled face bones, and Denzel looks like he has man-boobs in one scene when he has a wifebeater on. Not that this detracts from the movie in any way. Just don't expect Crowe to look like he did in Gladiator, though. I won't go through all the nice points because I was expecting it to be good (and it was), but I will talk about my biggest concern.<br/><br/>Getting past all the badassery Frank commits, we never get a clear picture of who Frank (Washington's character) is. He's charming in front of his family, and then all of a sudden he's bashing people's heads in the middle of a dinner party with his family members around. He plays with Crowe's character in one scene, then abruptly capitulates to him in the next (even though he says something to the effect of never giving up earlier in the movie). He lets his nephew, get involved in his dealings instead of telling him 'no', but hands out turkeys to the public. Sometimes an unpredictable/double sided character is good, but not here; when the poop hits the fan, so to speak, the audience has absolutely no idea what Frank is going to do because we are still not really sure which kind of person his really is deep down. I somehow expected this to dawn on me, but the ending happened before I could figure it out. I also wasn't sure if I should be rooting for Frank at the end. I mean, everybody roots for Denzel (even in Training Day, right?) because he's Denzel, and that kind of complicates things.<br/><br/>Expect a lengthy (in a good way) movie with an abrupt ending that has you wondering what the hell his family thinks of him now (I don't want to ruin the ending, so I won't say more than this). Also, don't expect as much action as is hinted at in the trailer. This isn't a gun-toting shoot-em-up, and the Italians mentioned in the trailer aren't starting a turf war or anything.<br/><br/>I did really like how the last scene was shot, though. Overall, if I were to set it up in one sentence, I would say that American Gangster is a great movie with a somewhat flawed ending."
"rerity22","1","6","10","3 May 2009"," Denzel Washington is repellent
","There is something inherently wrong with this movie, something that does not make sense and is quite contradictory. One thing for sure, Denzel Washington's depiction of Frank Lucas is terribly disturbing. There is an obvious contrast between the personal history and character of Denzel Washington (as Lucas) and the violent, greedy, selfish actions he commits. One wonders constantly throughout the movie how Washington's (Lucas) conscience had led him to do what he does--the movie never tells us. What the movie does say is that Frank Lucas is the opposite of what he does: He is noble, literate, and--something so blatantly deceptive and dishonest--a fighter for the working man, for the middleman. I don't suppose that the movie wants Lucas, and his mentor, to be perceived as a noble figure--after all, he did commit murder, right?--but why is there no sense to his actions? Why is he a thoroughly chilling mystery-man? Why is someone who possesses such obvious criminal motives, depicted as a hazy and aloof personality? My only thought is that Denzel Washington believed that only a man of such mystery can control and dominate others the way Lucas has. But this is something that could not make sense in this context, after all he did shoot people (does anyone shoot people in public and walk through the streets as if he has just saved the world from its evil destroyer? This was what it seemed like when Washington has done it). It merely makes the movie contradict reality--a man like that would NOT walk through the streets feeling noble, and certainly nobody would think him as such. This alone make the movie repellent and unreal. It avoids the real circumstance of a criminal and no less a gangster like Lucas. (I don't think the movie deserves a 1 rating, but its present abnormal high-rating makes it a fair balance)."
"arieliondotcom","2","6","10","14 December 2008"," Spoilers: ""Big D"" the Wannabe
","The sad thing about this movie is that it won so many accolades in a time of such sick political correctness that saying ""We were better at being gangsters than you"" is seen in a positive light and transparently ripping off other directors gets you an Academy Award and other nominations. Big ""D"" (Denzel) does a great Tony Soprano imitation in a bad rip-off of the Sopranos. Although based on a true story the movie is clearly a knock-off of ""the Sopranos"" and of the Godfather. (For example, the culminating moment of the film where it all ""comes down"" happens intermixed with the family piously in church, a la the culminating point of The Godfather.<br/><br/>But as I say, the worst is that this is held up as the best to which Black youth can aspire. As one (white) character says, incredulously, among epithets, (paraphrased) ""You're saying Blacks could be better mobsters than the Italians and that's impossible."" As if we're supposed to say ""Damned straight they can! Whoopee!"" How ridiculous and how sad that this is held up as some sort of goal to be met or surpassed. And then, the ""good guy"" works hard to get the ""bad guy"" off easy. How grand.<br/><br/>The American, and especially, the Black, culture deserves better than this. Film deserves better than this. Politically correct though it may be to promote it and whatever fantasies Denzel had and to award this travesty, don't waste your money, your time or the aspirations of your children in seeing this trash."
"madbeast","3","20","45","4 November 2007"," Generic Cops and Robbers
","This is a generic, throwaway cops-and-robbers movie whose only memorable feature is the charismatic presence of Denzel Wasington as a Harlem drug lord. It takes the overly familiar formula of juxtaposing the life of a super criminal against the elaborate investigation of a dedicated and untouchable law enforcement officer (in this case, a forgettable Russell Crowe), essentially giving you two movies in one until the investigation and the crook go head to head.<br/><br/>The problem is, neither movie is all that interesting, taking formulaic routes that we've seen a million times before. The only real result of giving equal prominence to the cop and the robber is that you wind up with an interminable running time.<br/><br/>Both Washington and Crowe give performances that are reminiscent of roles that you've seen them in before (Washington in ""Training Day"" and Crowe in ""LA Confidential"") and if you have a hankering to see those actors, either of those earlier films would be a better use of your time (although the far-fetched ""Training Day"" is only superior by a nose to ""American Gangster,"" and then only because of Washington's riveting performance). If there is a competition between the two stars in this film, Washington wins hands-down even though this is just a retread of material that isn't really worthy of either one of them."

","By any measure this is a fine film and certainly one of Ridley Scott's best. One of his great strengths, is his ability to create a sense of ""place"", and 60s/70s New York is faithfully, and affectionately, re-created. Clever use of archive news footage of the Vietnam war is interwoven into the story line in seamless style.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington, as Gangster Frank lucas, and Russell Crowe as Cop Ritchie Roberts, play an accomplished double hander which aspires to, but doesn't quite match or surpass, De Niro and Pacino in ""Heat"".The ""French Connection"" is overtly name checked, and visually alluded to as it competes with esteemed company such as ""Goodfellas""and ""Serpico"" as well as the aforementioned in this well stocked genre.<br/><br/>Washington gives arguably his finest performance as an understated black gangster (I didn't realise that was possible!)who makes good selling heroin whilst supporting his brothers, cousins, mother and other members of his extended family.Ritchie Roberts by contrast is portrayed as having a dysfunctional home life.<br/><br/>For once the wealth of drug trafficking is not shown without cost.The human carnage is painfully depicted - a million miles away from ""heroin chic"". The running time of almost 2 3/4 hours is fully justified as the carefully constructed plot comes to its climax.<br/><br/>So why does it fall short? Well really only by the standards of the competition. The dramatic intensity of the personal duel between De Niro and Pacino in ""Heat"" is missing, but only because Lucas character is super cool. And the Shakespearean sense of tragedy and impending doom so magnificently evoked by De Palma in ""Carlitos Way"" is similarly absent.<br/><br/>Based on a true story the denouement where Lucas plea bargains to take down the bent cops is a bit of a plot turn when Roberts avowed intent was to get the big guys - and the Vietnam Military traffickers just disappear off the horizon.Frustrating and unsatisfactory.<br/><br/>Nonetheless a worthy movie that I suspect will stand the test of time."
"doveed","7","3","4","18 November 2018"," Great Talent/Good Movie
","A great story, a great director, and a great actor came together, and ultimately made a good movie. With all of these ingredients, it would be hard to fail, and they certainly didn't fail. But the problem with this movie is that it wasn't edgy enough. Denzel did a fine job, but he didn't come across as a cold blooded killer. Denzel is a pretty serious guy and he brought that seriousness to the role of Frank Lucas. But I didn't see any homicidal undertones in his performance, the way I saw it with Al Pacino when he played Tony Montana. That guy was a true nutcase. Denzel was just a little too polished, though it worked fine. The same can be said with Ridley Scott's directing. He made a lot of good choices, but again, something was missing. I would have liked to see him take a few chances or do something a little more drastic to capture the drama. But these criticisms aside, American Gangster is definitely a well-made movie that is worth seeing."

","Movies like these can't work without the right cast. I mean, I shouldn't even have to say that. It's a rule. There are plenty of different kinds of movies that can get by on style, visuals, or action all on their own. But what separates a movie like ""Gangster Squad"" from a movie like ""American Gangster"" is the cast, and how the cast is used. It has to be both.<br/><br/>There are lots of familiar faces in this film. On top of Washington and Crowe, you have Chiwetel Ejiofor, Idris Elba and Josh Brolin. The director is Ridley Scott, a man who knows how to helm ambitious projects, like ""Black Hawk Down"", ""Gladiator"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"". The pieces are all there.<br/><br/>One of ""American Gangster""'s biggest strengths is that there is a rich cast of characters, but the viewer is never lost, because the focus is primarily on Denzel Washington's Frank Lucas, and Russell Crowe's Richie Roberts. They carry the film, as they certainly should.<br/><br/>The plot is centred around a lengthy crusade by Roberts and his team to get to the bottom of New York's biggest drug conspiracy, which is of course being controlled by Lucas. This is a major theme regarding Lucas; he likes to be in control, to be able to gun down a man he doesn't like in the middle of a crowded sidewalk without any consequences. As a result, this makes his character seem all the more vulnerable when he isn't in total control of his situation.<br/><br/>At the same time, Roberts is fighting more than just drug crime. He isn't the most honest guy, but he just might be the most honest cop. He is repulsed by crooked cops, and as a result he estranges himself from most of his workplace kin. So, as he fights to nail down the source of the drugs, he is also fighting against everyone who considered him a ""boy scout"" whenever he did what he felt was right.<br/><br/>Everything comes together in a conclusion that rewards anyone who takes the time to savour every moment of the film's 160 minutes. I rank this among the finest crime dramas I've watched."
"smellthecult-com-1","10","3","4","23 September 2009"," Real life drug crime drama
","Ridley Scott's epic drug lord / police corruption drama is a marvellous affair. Denzel Washington, cast against type as Frank Lucas, simmers in his role as the drug boss lynch pin of New York, responsible for trafficking heroin direct from the source in The Golden Triangle, a region which encompasses areas of Burma, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand, allowing him to ship the substance into the US and sell it at a higher quality and lower price than any of his rivals, transforming the drug scene in the city and propelling him to most wanted status in a very short space of time. His actions cause many problems for the authorities, not least amongst them the fact that, to begin with at least, they have no idea who he is, nor any clue as to how he is managing to sell such high grade scag for such a low cost. A narcotics unit is set up, led by a rather scruffy looking Russell Crowe to figure out who is behind the sudden deluge of smack, but it's not just the criminals who are working against him. The New York Police Department itself is rife with corruption, with literally dozens of officers taking bribes and back-handers to ensure that the flow of drugs and, therefore, money continues and, inevitably, they are none too keen for the ultimate provider of their illicit fortunes to be taken down. Intelligent, intense though never over-bearing, this is a thinking mans thriller. Based on the real life of Lucas, this treads ground similar to the equally excellent TV show The Wire, where nothing is absolute, there are no black and white's. The good guys are as corrupt as the supposed bad guys and the bad guys are as liable to attend church as they are to gun down a cop. A fascinating insight into a city whose authorities are spiralling into anarchy and chaos, the running time of nigh on three hours passes in no time. Excellent stuff."

"doug1717","4","3","4","28 February 2008"," Sparse Entertainment That is Watchable, But Barely
","I was so surprised that Ridley Scott did this film. I almost walked out in the first 20 minutes. There is no narration, and no readily accessible plot. There are place names and dates printed on the screen to tell you where the film is set, but they are so small as to be almost unreadable. Later, these subtitles are noticeably brief on screen, so you can pretty much ignore them. It won't matter anyway. The film is lost in its own lack of direction. Ridley Scott presents a series of images and scenes with no real flow. You have to piece together enough to figure out what is going on. It's as if you are an unwelcome voyeur to his film and if you don't give up early, you eventually find enough of a plot to follow by default. Acting wise, Denzel Washington plays it flat. He isn't scary. He isn't intimidating, and he isn't gentle or endearing, even though Scott tries to make his character human via his family relations. You will not find Frank Lucas approachable or sympathetic like you do with Henry Hill in Goodfellas. Frank Lucas is boring. You won't care about about him. Russel Crowe also brings little into his performance. He's a good cop who sacrificed his family to do the right thing. He is a mere shadow of a Serpico, in fact he is little more than a caricature or sketch of a character who likes to bully noisy kids and who is litigious with his shrew wife. This is a sparse film that isn't very interesting. The time period is the 60's but aside from the cars, the hair styles and clothes are not late 60's and the only things that sets it in that time period are the ever present black and white TV's with iconic images of Nixon, Tet, Trang Bang, and the fall of Saigon. I think I only saw 2 Afro's, and one was a disguise. Clothes, hair, music and feel of the 60's and early 70's in America are all missing from this film. Overall, it can be watchable, but not entertaining or engrossing. There is very brief nudity featuring lovely young women, but that's the only memorable part of this movie. There is little use of music to set the scene or enhance the acting. A very poor and lazy production from an otherwise brilliant director."

Instead, the movie is mostly about how Denzel Washington's character smuggles heroine into America, with maybe three gun fights that last about 5 minutes each.<br/><br/>In a 3 hour ""action"" movie, i expect more than Russell Crow's character whining about how he wants a job in narcotics and to catch Denzel, and Denzel standing around with his family and friends in his mansion...<br/><br/>One of the few good points is the final fight when the police are trying to catch a drug smuggler who helped Denzel.<br/><br/>The previews were very misleading and the movie, while have some interesting points, was certainly not worth 3 hours of my time, when i went to see maybe 30 minutes of it.<br/><br/>I know that the movie is supposed to be a true story, but even so, if it had been advertised as more of a history piece, i would not have had such high expectations of it.<br/><br/>Also, this movie just continues to go with the ""war on drugs"" theme that the U.S. is currently going through (and has for quite some time).

","Right off the bat, I'm certain that when Hollywood says, ""based on a true story"", the kernel of ""American Gansgster"" might be true, but much or most of the rest is made up out of whole cloth. First off, I doubt that the main criminal character in this film was nearly as charismatic and charming in real life. I'm willing to bet that he was a clever, intelligent, manipulative, psychopath who you wouldn't want to cross in real life. People like this are much more interesting to watch in movies than to deal with in real life. I have tons of doubts about what Russel Crowe's real life ""hero"" character was like too. But setting reality aside, this is pretty much a flawless movie. It's actually built around a plot with minimal special effects; the sets, cars, clothing, music, and so on are all historically appropriate with a real eye for detail; and it's simply impossible to criticize the cinematography. Many people (kids especially) may find that it's a little bit slow for them, but I often enjoy a film that takes its time and is somewhat ambiguous, both of which this film certainly is. As long as you know what to expect (specifically, a lot less violence and a lot more character development than most modern movies), this is a great film."

","One in which it isn't about the Italian or Russian mob. The gangsters here are American born and run Harlem. Headman Bumpy Johnson dies and his driver, Frank Lucas, decides its his time to take over the business. Frank's getting squeezed by local players and decides he must do something to get more of the dope market and to be the top dog. There are reports that soldiers in Vietnam are becoming addicted to heroin because of its cheap price and easy access. Frank goes over there and uses some connections and makes a deal to ship pure heroin using Army planes back to the US for distribution. Before long he has control over the dope market in New York and is top dog. He even shoots someone on the sidewalk in front of many people to prove he's not afraid and to put fear in the commoner.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe plays the cop whom is assigned to form a drug force to take down big players in New York. His investigation leads to once unknown Frank as being the big supplier.<br/><br/>So, the latter part of the film is the police investigation into Frank and how the dirty cops play into it all. The film also shows us some of Frank's personal life with his mom and wife. And it's all very entertaining. The film is long at over 2 and a half hours, but it seemed to fly by. That's the mark of a good film.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I'm a big fan of Russell Crowe and he doesn't disappoint here. He's good in this as well as Denzel. The film is one of the best of the year."

"jaredmobarak","6","4","6","18 November 2007"," My manAmerican Gangster
","I've been hearing that American Gangster is just your run-of-the-mill cop vs. robber flick, again showing Ridley Scott's prevailing mediocrity. Hey, I love the cast and I find Scott almost as intriguing as his brother, so I was all for it. Generic gangsters with Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe should still be better than most. However, while finding it to be unoriginal, I didn't see it as a crime film. Instead it was one of my least favorite genres, the biopic. We are shown Frank Lucas go from driver of Harlem's bigshot to king of the drug world and Richie Roberts from beat cop/law student to drug investigator head/prosecuting lawyer. Rather than give us all conflict, we get sequence after sequence of how these two got where they get. Not only that, but I couldn't tell you at the end who was the good guy and who the bad. Both men are glorified and shown to have enemies that they vault over because of character, whether moral or not. They both beat the odds, and honestly, I liked Denzel's Lucas as a person more than Crowe's Roberts.<br/><br/>There is just too much going on here. How many times do we need to see Robert's boyscout mentality and Lucas' calm demeanor and non-flashy appearance? Both men do what they should to be successful in their field, only while Crowe continuously gets punished for it in lifebut not career per seWashington just gets richer. Who should we strive to be then? Like the young man with a 95 mph fastball, who gives up his gravy train, says, ""I want to be like you Uncle Frank."" You don't see Robert's son looking up to dad, instead he seems to not even know he exists, pretty much because he doesn't to him.<br/><br/>I don't want to slight the story though. This is a very intriguing premise, how a black man subverts the middleman, like local electronic stores, to buy his drugs from the source in Bangkok. This no name does what the Italians never could, sell superior product for half the price, and stay almost completely under the radar. Whether the expensive chinchilla coat from his wife truly was the cause of him appearing on enemy lists or notit is a bit convenientit was bound to happen sometime. Although, keeping a low profile and staying conservative is a novel idea that you'd think more criminals would want to adopt. The Frank Lucas story works, but I think it would truly succeed as its own tale. Just show us his life, or maybe just his heyday as a ruthless criminal, not as a kid from the streets that works hard and runs his city. Glorifying crime should not be what Hollywood wants to do.<br/><br/>While the Lucas tale was good, the Roberts one was great. Now, the Richie Roberts Story is something I would definitely watch. Here is a guy that is married to his job and estranged from his wife and kid. Someone who finds a million dollars of drug money and doesn't take a penny; will not cover for his partner or friends if they do something illegal; and who will stop at nothing to actually put bad men behind bars. Even more unbelievable is how he not only takes down the most dangerous criminal in New York, but he also prosecutes him in court, getting him to cooperate in taking down corrupt cops. Then, the craziest revelation of all, he becomes Lucas' defense attorney and gets his term shortened by fifty years. It is too bad that rather than give two hour-and-a-half films on each guy separately, we get a bloated three hour parallel tale of the two at once. I only stayed invested in anticipation to finally see these two powerhouses on screen together.<br/><br/>In that regard, Washington and Crowe deliver the goods like usual. Supporting them, however, is a big time cast of names. I can't believe all the people they got to be involved here with bit parts. Ejiofor, Hawkes, Brolin, Gugino, Common, Ortiz, Gooding Jr., Assante, and more vault the story to a higher level through their professionalism. Even RZA has a nice turn, but did we need the money shot of his tattooed name on his shoulder? Come on, cover that up, it was just stupid. I really hope John Ortiz will continue to get work because like in Miami Vice, he makes a small role his own.<br/><br/>So, in the end, as with most biopics, this one just shows too much. It lulled me into a sense of cruise control, just watching and watching, waiting for something special to happen. There are moments, like the final shootout that works nicely and a good exchange at the end between Lucas and his mother, but they are few and very far between. Only in America can a man without conscience, a murderer and drug-lord, blow-in a few corrupt cops and skate out of jail time to once again roam the streets. I understand the utilitarianism of it all and that he might be a marked man now, but honestly, he turned in police officers not gang leaders. There won't be any hits put on his head; he'll be able to retire with no problem. Not to mention, I'm sure, that probably no ramifications were experienced by the military and their involvement in the smuggling of contraband into the country. It's like this all happened and we learned nothing from it."

Everything is muted and full of dark grays, in Russell's world it has that great new jersey bleakness to it and in Mr. Washington's world although more violent is altogether more vibrant and also darker at the same time. The look of this film itself is a 10/10. there is a great film in here somewhere and had it been a 3 1/2 hour epic film it would be winning awards across the table, but alas its a 2+ hour semi-epic trying to break free from the confines of a self contained studio film. from the beginning i thought this was a fiction tale but of course, it is based on a true story and it is a very good one. i wish they had spent more time on just how does one black man in that era build this empire, now that is a story that hasn't been touched on enough but ultimately it shows how he gets his one connection: he gets the house and the other usual rap song trimmings and then comes the regularly scheduled love interest, who is given nothing to do. i could care less about her she apparently doesn't care what frank does as long as she gets fur coats but we've sen that overused plot device for years now and frankly I'm sick of it id rather frank be gay so at least it be something different<br/><br/>after a killer start an OK middle and a by the motions 3rd act i was left wondering and hoping that there is, a as always a Mr.Scott directors cut out there with the hour and a half of character development that is sorely needed<br/><br/>acting; as i said before i think Scott and Russell are getting to comfortable with each other Russell's performance is strange he supposed to be a bumbling civil servant who turns hard ass throughout the movie, but something about it just doesn't work for me. at times he seems too relaxed but ultimately the character itself is under-developed<br/><br/>as for Mr. Washington the man can do no wrong in my eyes, he really makes this film. As we already know its fun as hell to watch him play the bad guy and you can tell hes having a lot of fun with it too, i only wish we saw more of him being really ruthless but instead we just get the usual initial set-up to his being a bad ass. But its damn fun to watch.<br/><br/>bottom line: there are much better films on this subject most of them can be found from 70's. unless you are not a big film goer then settle in and watch a very entertaining film even if it does nothing new.<br/><br/>p.s. i don't know who fixed up this comment section for i.m.d.b. but if i cant use the actors name what good is it. thats why i had to use Mr. Washington and Russell because i.m.d.b. does not recognize Mr. Washington's first name Mr. Scott's first or Russell's last."

","When you put two of the best actors of the past 25 years on screen together you expect to be riveted. I can actually say that neither had memorable performances. I'd go as far as to say it felt like both were going through the motions here. I saw this with a buddy and we both walked out feeling the same way..entirely underwhelmed. I couldn't identify one scene...NOT ONE....where I sat there and said ""That's why Denzel and Crowe are who they are....there is their genius at work"".<br/><br/>The movie is awfully slow at times and actually bores you with the amount of details given. The first hour is terribly un-engaging. There is nothing you see here that you haven't seen in Godfather, Goodfellas, New Jack City, Blow, Scarface, etc. It's basically all of those movies put together, but without any memorable scenes.<br/><br/>I'm sure some will talk about the violence scenes where Denzel has his fits of rage. I didn't find those moments overly believable or interesting. And what more is there to the movie in terms of powerful moments besides those? Even if those scenes did do it for you, unlike me, was there any other moments actually compelling where you say ""Wow....that was amazing"".<br/><br/>I was telling people before I saw this movie that I thought even the trailer seemed pretty flat...I wasn't excited to see this because the trailer did little for me, but I hoped that it was merely a case of not wanting to give away the good stuff. In reality, there wasn't any ""good stuff"".<br/><br/>I found all of the characters to be either one dimensional or cliché. I'll give the movie a 6 because it's not a ""bad"" movie by any means. It just falls way short of being what it wanted to be. When you look back at Crowe and Denzel's career, I wouldn't come close to mentioning this movie as one of their finest pieces of work.<br/><br/>Not to try to compare apples to oranges, but the story-telling, the acting, and the tension in Michael Clayton is far superior to this film. I wouldn't consider this for any major Oscar Nominations."

And we both agreed to the conclusion of yes, this very well could be, top notch acting with great directing, where this all gonna lead to? It feels like epic proportion that's for sure.<br/><br/>10 stars.<br/><br/>It's best ""gangster"" movie I've seen during the years 2000 by far, anything that comes close to that is probably some of Martin Scorsese work during the 1990's."

","The title suggests a gangster movie of epic proportions. And the first time you see Denzel in action you think and hope that this movie will be like ""Scarface"" or ""The Godfather"". And I really wished I could say that. Sadly ""American Gangster"" doesn't deserve to be compared to those masterpieces! The fact that this movie is based on a true story does give some merit. But that doesn't mean that you have to ignore other parts that are so important when making making a movie. Denzel and Russel are more than solid in their performances. Although I had the feeling that Denzel repeated his role in ""Training Day"" that was downplayed considerably. Even then you can rely on these top notch actors. My main problem with this movie was the lack of intensity! There were very few dramatic or significant events that could have intensified the viewing experience. For the most time we get to see the business side of things. Very rarely we get to see the personal and emotional side of what characters are going through. This lack of depth is much needed. It would have made the characters far more interesting and easier for the viewer to make a connection. If you like movies like this you will enjoy it without a doubt. But don't expect something new."

","First off, I don't have any idea how this movie landed up in IMDb's top 250 list. The movie could've been much better than it was. It can be understood that Scott was dealing with an era movie, of which he has done many. But the drug infested New York City of the late 60's is definitely not his playground. He relies too much on Denzel's acting skills, which alone are the only thing worth seeing in the movie (Russell can be a much better actor, and here, he sure fails to pull off a decent American accent). The movie tries too hard to fit into many different thematic genres but fails to deliver in any. It tries to be a cat & mouse chase between the cop Russell and the drug lord Denzel, but Russell never brings on the game and two leads end up confronting each other only in the end at which point the story seems to belong somewhere else. The Movie tries to be a full blown gangster movie, but the story never takes off and fails to impress. don't expect the raw energy seen in Scarface, or the wholesome gangster experience in Godfather. The 2 hrs 40 mins could have been put to better use. Instead the viewer is left sitting there expecting a plot twist any moment, but it never happens. The story is unevenly paced, with the first 2 hrs 20 mins. dedicated to showing Denzel's rise to power and a few obstacles here and there. All of a sudden as if due to a shortage of reel, in the next 20 mins you see the police craking down denzels whole operation, sentencing him, getting a little help from him (to catch others involved), and releasing him after 14-15 odd years.. . Ridley Scott has done better movies and there have been much better Gangster movies than ""American Gangster""... Wait for the DVD if u must."

","When I first heard about this film, I was hopeful and expected some pretty good things, but once I started seeing the trailers that all changed.<br/><br/>At best I thought it would be an OK film that could wait for a DVD release. Well since I had the chance to see it at no cost to me I went ahead and did so. My instincts were correct, about it not being worth a theater going experience. But I was way off on it being at least OK. It was much worst than expected.<br/><br/>By no means did I expect such a dull film. It lacked detail and jumped around in a horribly irresponsible manner. This film depicts a POS that smuggled drugs in the caskets of American soldiers yet glosses over that fact. It doesn't show the rise nor fall of this man in any detail what so ever. In return avoiding depicting the monster that he was, even his acts of violence were shown in a cleaned up matter or off screen all together.<br/><br/>And the end can be argued as to showing him in a somewhat positive manner.<br/><br/>Not only is the film irresponsible but it takes way to long just to end up saying absolutely nothing at all."

","At the end of this movie, the writers have Lucas (Denzel Washington) casually helping to fight drugs in Roberts' (Russel Crowe) situation room. Highly unlikely! Even more ridiculous is Roberts acting as prosecuting attorney against Lucas. Would he testify from the witness stand or from the prosecutor's table? Then, we are told that Roberts becomes a defense attorney for one of the Lucas boys! No conflict of interest here! A conflict of simple, basic legal principles.<br/><br/>Washington and Crowe give excellent performances. It is the story that is flawed. Perhaps the ridiculous ending was deemed necessary to bring the 3-hour story to a close. In my view, it should have been done much sooner."

","I caught a screening of this, and I am completely shocked that this thing has an 8.8 on IMDb. Not a single element of this film was even remotely original, the ""story"" was scatter brained and played out like a bad game of gangster edition madlibs, and the characters were harder to care for than an already dead house plant. It's a perfect example of how, sometimes, a movie's parts can be much better than it's whole. Watched in parts, the film is spectacular, but when those parts are put together, you're left confused as to why anybody in this entire movie does anything they do. The characters are given cheap depth, such as being completely evil 99% of the time, but then, for one out of place scene, they're nice to their mother. Directed by Ridley Scott and starring Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington, this was a very pretty but weak film with an ensemble team of the most overrated players in Hollywood."

","I don't want to give away anything about the film so I will give you my broad opinion. The anticipation I had for seeing this film was off the charts, and I tell you, that excitement ended about 5 minutes into the film. Ridley Scott delivers something that has the feel of a student film, the acting is mediocre except for Denzel, Josh Brolin and Russel did a decent job oh and Mama Lucas was also believable at times. The dialog is so so, the cinematography was nice, the cuts could have been better. I was never able to get absorbed in the film, it felt so fake and unattached. <br/><br/>I compare this film to the New York Yankees. You have an all star cast and crew, but even with all the talent in the world if someone can't make them bond and become one unit you have a talented ugly mess. I don't see American Gangster getting nominated for any awards what so ever."
"zetes","7","10","23","4 November 2007"," Well made, but too familiar
","Ridley Scott is one of those directors who has built up a lot of good will from audiences, including myself, over the years. But as each successive film of his is released, I find myself wondering why that is. Two of his movies, Alien and Blade Runner, are arguably masterpieces. Does he have more than maybe a couple more that are even good? Granted, I've missed a couple of well-liked works, notably Black Hawk Down, but the guy also has made Kingdom of Heaven, Hannibal and A Good Year. He's incredibly uneven. His newest film is a gangster epic. It's good, very classically made, respectable, entertaining enough. But it's nothing special. There is not even one moment in it where I was thinking ""wow"". Its best sequence, the raid on the drug lab, is easily topped by the similar scene in We Own the Night, which opened last month. Denzel Washington's performance isn't anything we haven't seen him give before, and Russell Crowe's is too methody to be considered very good (he was better in 3:10 to Yuma, but he was methody there, too). And it's a huge sin to waste Chiwetel Ejiofor this badly. The story is your basic criminal rise and fall, with a side story of the hard-working, honest cop. The film offers no insight into the situation. There are about seven montage sequences set to era-appropriate pop music. The honest truth is, I barely remembered I saw this movie four hours after it ended. If you've seen The Godfather or Goodfellas, you don't need to see it. On the other hand, if your options are this, Scarface or Blow, you'd be best off with this. Just don't pay too much for it. A rental, at best."
"slipbyron","10","11","26","21 October 2007"," American Gangster
","In 2000, Universal Studios and Imagine Entertainment purchased the rights to ""The Return of Superfly"", a New York magazine story by Mark Jacobson about the rise and fall of the 1970s heroin kingpin Frank Lucas. In November 2003, Universal and Imagine entered negotiations with director Brian De Palma to helm Tru Blu, with a script by Steve Zaillian based on Frank Lucas. Zaillian interpreted the story as one of ""American business and race"", focusing the script thematically on corporate business. Production was initially slated for a spring 2004 start. In March 2004, the studio entered new negotiations with director Antoine Fuqua to helm the project, as well as actor Denzel Washington to star in the film as Frank Lucas. The following May, actor Benicio del Toro entered negotiations to star as Detective Richie Roberts, who brought down Lucas. Production of Tru Blu was reset to begin in early fall 2004, with the film slated for a release date of June 3, 2005. In September 2004, actress Dania Ramirez entered negotiations to join the cast of the film, now titled American Gangster. In October 2004, Fuqua abruptly abandoned the project, with the studio citing creative differences for the director's departure. The studio began searching for a new director to replace Fuqua. Due to the search potentially escalating a budget already in the US$80 million range and the difficulty in recouping the amount based on the film's subject matter, Universal ceased looking for a director. The studio canceled production of American Gangster, citing time constraints and creative elements for its reason."

","This film went through hell on its way to the screen. It was fondled, butchered, divorced and remarried, sunk, then revived. Along the way, the story evolved from a one story to several, only loosely connected as the studio tried to cover all bases.<br/><br/>Scott hired on basically to keep working. its one of his lesser projects, like ""Hannibal,"" where he follows the script fed by others. But still, he has a cinematic style that makes this worth watching if you love visual poetry. In fact, you can watch this with no sound whatever and possibly enjoy it more. That's because Scott designs his shots and shaves his editing so that (almost) each shot anticipates the next. Its unique in modern film-making, and when he goes, this style will probably die. ""Gladiator"" was the height of this, and Crowe understands what he has to do to feed it. He's not there much, but the sequence where the raid on the drug lab is so ""in the future"" it will be a film school staple for decades.<br/><br/>Washington doesn't get this end of film-making. He was inherited from an earlier incarnation of the film. So instead of being inside the film, he's placed outside. He's not the story, but what the story uses to tell itself. Its a subtle distinction -- and Washington's cluelessness as an actor is used against him -- but it makes the thing a bit more coherent to consider his character as simply shaped by the forces around him. Washington has such a narrow range, I couldn't help compare this to Spike Lee's picture. Spike goes for the story as it appears in the actors. He discovers it and captures it in bits. He doesn't compose a movie; its coherence comes from found characters. So his pictures have no cinematic soul, and give the illusion of finding reality. That can work when he actually finds life, which is rare. He didn't in ""X"" so the choppy nature of that arc stands in contrast to the energetic action of time this has.<br/><br/>Scott also likes to designate watchers, even if not written in the script. See how he manages to photograph the two wives in such a way that they are internal surrogates for us?<br/><br/>The one thing that annoys is those labels to tell us where were we are, Thailand, Brooklyn, Fort Bragg and so on. This is just cinematic laziness. Scott could easily have shown us where we were, and in fact does some of the time. Studios again, I suppose.<br/><br/>Yes, it references films of the period, specifically gangster and blaxsploitation.

","American Gangster had all the appearance of a fantastic film. It could have been 2007's Best Picture and been the best crime drama in years. Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe are two of the most talented actors today and the more minor players in this film are also worth mention (look out for the RZA and Common). Ridley Scott has directed such screen classics as Alien and Blade Runner and there is no reason to think that American Gangster would have been different. So what went wrong? American Gangster has a few problems worth mentioning. First is the pacing, while others may complain about a lack of significant action scenes, the major problem for me was a lack of significant personal moments especially among Frank and the other characters. Too often are we treated to unnecessary shots of crack whores and coke snorting instead of seeing how Frank relates to his family. The plot interrupts interactions between the characters, a prime example is when Frank's nephew (T.I.'s character) telling Frank why he no longer wants to be a major league baseball player. He tells Frank that Frank is his role model and instead of seeing Frank's reaction, Huey Lucas interrupts the scene to keep the plot moving. The second real problem with this film is the acting, specifically Denzel Washington's acting. Frank Lucas was more likable than fearsome, something that was most likely not intentional. The audience may occasionally see him snap but these scenes seem unnatural and interrupt the film's flow. These bursts of violence were often quick and made Frank seem more like a stern parent than a cold-blooded killer."

Now, the movie title might suggest that there is lot of killing and gun firing, but mind you it is not.If you are looking for a heavy action movie, don't waste your money and go see something else. Because, this movie is for people who enjoy true biopics. Someone who will enjoy a good story telling. I also read Mark Jacobson's article "" Retun of superfly"" on which this movie is based. I gathered a rather satanic picture of Frank Lucas from the article but surprisingly enough, Denzel Washington who has given us some stellar performances, does not depict Lucas very well. He plays ""himself"" extremely well. So does Crowe. But his character did not need him to go to the depths of John Nash or James Braddock. So was a little disappointed with Denzel Washington's performance. This movie is not in the leagues of godfather or scarface, does not make any exaggerated statement, what it does is beautifully tell the tale of a man who rose from the poor to become one of the biggest heroin dealers in USA. If you like such tales and also want a take home message, then you would love this movie. 9/10 !"

","This is a beautifully directed film that is without a point or a theme and is about unpleasant people. Both leads do a good job but are woefully miscast. The visuals are dazzling but it's impossible to care about anyone. You follow a 70's heroin dealer, played by Washington, and the honest but emotionally bankrupt cop who is after him, played by Crowe. As a result, unlike the Godfather, you never are rooting for either character. The drug dealer is glorified, his amoral acts painstakingly justified by events in his past, when in fact this is a man who imported vast amounts of a deadly drug that decimated the culture and hope of his own people. The cop is friendless, sells out his only buddy, is unemotional when that buddy is killed, and is shown neglecting his son and screwing random one night stands over and over. If you didn't get the point the first time, hold on, you'll have seven more chances to get it. The first hour is entertaining enough, although any intelligent viewer will squirm at the idolization of Denzel's drug dealer. After that, the middle is repetitive and drags. I have no clue what the screenplay is trying to say, or what the director believes the film to be about. I wonder if Denzel Washington would like his children to admire the character he plays as much as he seems to."

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","3","5","13 March 2016"," A crime classic
","Ridley Scott's vast, intricate crime epic American Gangster is one of the director's finest achievement in film to this day. It's sprawling in nature, expansive in scope but never chaotic or muddled. It always maintains a laser focus on its characters and story, thumping along at a rhythmic pace which swells and falls to the time of one of the most iconic stories in true crime. It's Scott's Heat, a titanic tale of cop vs. criminal in which neither are the villain or hero, but simply men adhering to rigid, ruthless principles moulded by the environments they have grown up in. Both men have an intense set of morals completely different from the other, yet equally as captivating. Russell Crowe is a troubled bruiser as Detective Richie Roberts, a cop so determined to convince himself of his own upstanding nature that he won't take any illicit payoff in any amount or context. In contrast, every other aspect of his life is a shambling mess. Denzel Washington is quiet fury as Frank Lucas, an enterprising gangster and drug smuggler who rides the tidal wave of capitalism like there's no tomorrow, flooding the streets of Harlem with pure heroin directly from the southeast Asian source, and rising swiftly to the peak of underworld infamy. The two are on an inevitable collision course, two juggernauts with different empires backing them who will stop at nothing. Lucas believes himself to be untouchable, shirking the flashy, preening nature of his peers and remaining out of the limelight, until cunning Roberts catches onto him. The rough and tumble world of New York in the 60's and 70's is lovingly brought to life by Scott, his cast and crew who go to impressive lengths in order to bring us that grit, realism and specific anthropological aura of another time, another setting. Speaking of cast, this has to be one of the most rip roaring collection of actors ever assembled, even to rival that of Heat itself. In Richie's corner there is senior Detective Lou Toback (a sly Ted Levine, perpetuating the vague Michael Mann vibe even further), a scummy colleague (Yul Vasquez), and an off the books team of gangbusters including John Ortiz, John Hawkes and a mumbling RZA. He also clashes with his bitter ex wife (Carla Gugino) in an ugly custody battle for their young son. Over on Frank's side of the hill are his huge extended family including Common, TI, Chiwetel Ejfor and Ruby Dee in one of the film's finest performances as his strong willed, passionate mother, one of the only people who could talk sense into him and keep the animal inside at bay. Lymari Nadal is great as his bombshell Puerto Rican wife as well. His rivals include superfly-esque Nicky Barnes (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and a brief, hostile turn from Idris Elba. He also deals with the Italian mafia, personified by a hammy Armand Assante, an earnest Jon Polito and a slimy Ritchie Coaster. One of the best performances of the film comes from Josh Brolin as positively evil corrupt narcotics detective Trupo, threatening everything that moves with his grease slick hair, porno moustache and silky, dangerous tone. As if that army of talent wasn't enough, there's also work from Kevin Corrigan, Joe Morton, Clarence Williams III in a powerful turn as an ageing Bumpy Johnson, and a blink and you'll miss it cameo from Norman Reedus as well. What. A. Cast. The whole thing rests on Crowe and Washington, though, and both are like Olympian titans of crime and conflict, sweeping up everyone around them in a whirlwind of explosive violence, shifting alliances and the booming arrival of capitalism giving the American people in every walk of life a defibrillator jolt of economic change, laying the foundation for the world we live in today, one brick, one bullet, one business deal at a time. Scott achieves legendary heights with this one, a crime film for the ages that one can always revisit to see not how one hero cop took down a villainous drug lord, but how the forces which inexorably bind humans to various fates in accordance with their decisions swept up two extraordinary yet mortal men into historic infamy. In a word: Epic."
"secondtake","7","3","5","4 November 2013"," Gangster themes revisited with style and violence--a strong if familiar vein
","American Gangster (2007)<br/><br/>Almost by design, this movie starts off filled with mobster clichés. The idea is to set up a world that we are well acquainted with from earlier classics like ""The Godfather,"" and we see power, ruthlessness, loyalty, money, and ambition quickly mixed together. The clichés are almost boring (not that Denzel Washington is ever boring)—the gangster is charming and clever, the cop is dedicated to his job and his wife is leaving him, and all the minions and hangers-on are as they should be, colorful and secondary.<br/><br/>So it almost ends up being just another gangster movie, this one being about a black godfather. But ""American Gangster"" then adds some new elements, including some brief scenes set in Thailand and a long coda at the end where the cops and the criminal cooperate. I won't give too much away there.<br/><br/>All of it is filmed well, edited with clarity, and acted in a straight up realistic manner. For director Ridley Scott these are almost backhanded compliments. You might expect more. In fact, as much as the grows on you as it goes, and gets more colorful and complex, it remains really conventional as a movie. It's smart enough and slick enough to work, but it doesn't rise above—and it had the ingredients to rise very much above. <br/><br/>In addition to Washington there is a really stunning (if clichéd) cop performance by Russell Crowe. And mixed into the large supporting cast are some stunning talents. Washington's mother is played with intensity by Ruby Dee (who I know best in Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"") and Armand Assante is a convincing old mob type in the Brando vein.<br/><br/>Mostly it's Washington's movie. He's the title character, and he plays it mostly cool and charming, flashing his smile and running his efficient and risky business with confidence. There are lessons in the story about going it alone (no middlemen, for example), about family in crime (Italian style and African-American style), and about the limits of family loyalty (drugs and money are powerful temptations). <br/><br/>There are also hints of the mayhem of the times—the late 60s and early 70s. Vietnam forms a vague but constant backdrop (not civil rights protests, oddly). And drug use is of course an important theme in the movie, though without particular judgement. People who have died using it are shown to be reckless types to start with (I'm abbreviating). One could easily say that the dire, evil, selfish, murderous aspects of being a drug king are glosses over—hinted at for sure but shown with those some old clichés the movie uses throughout, which has the feeling of acceptance.<br/><br/>A really good movie. It's not one bit original, but in a way that's the point. This is the story of an extraordinary rise by one black man in the heat of the late 1960s to a position of unrivaled power and wealth. It's told with precision and familiarity and a certain amount of artful competence that makes it really feel solid and significant."

"MasterDebator5","9","3","5","28 September 2008"," Ridley Scott's gangster epic just misses 'classic' status
","American Gangster<br/><br/>Directed by Ridley Scott. Starring Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe and Chiwetel Ejiofor.<br/><br/>About halfway into ""American Gangster"", it becomes clear where the movie's strengths lie. The strong leading performances from Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe lift the film above typical gangster fare, but are not quite enough to secure it a place among classics such as ""The Godfather"" or ""Goodfellas."" The movie tells the true story of Frank Lucas, the man who gained notoriety in the 1970s for smuggling cocaine into the U.S. during the Vietnam War. Washington effortlessly embodies Lucas's persona, making the transformation from two-bit thug to unofficial King of Harlem all the more fascinating to watch on-screen.<br/><br/>Director Ridley Scott knows his way around violent films, having collaborated with Crowe before in ""Gladiator."" However, Scott decides to ease up on the aggression this time around, allowing his more-than-capable stars to draw the audience in with their natural abilities. Of course, with a title like ""American Gangster"", one should not expect anything remotely kid-friendly. ""Gangster"" has its brutal moments, but they are not Scott's primary concern. He sets out to tell the story of Frank Lucas, and he takes an interesting approach.<br/><br/>""Gangster"" spends the first two acts glorifying what Lucas does. It seems as though the life of this drug dealer is without significant problems. Only as the movie winds down does it begin to show the darker side of the business. This is where Scott slips up. Lucas is faced with problems at every turn, from the police to his own family, and it leaves him with feelings of mistrust and paranoia. But by praising Washington's character for two thirds of the film, it feels insincere when Scott suddenly becomes critical. This is the man the audience has been rooting for, and now he is supposed to be seen as the bad guy? The director seems unable to make up his mind, and it is illustrated in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, ""American Gangster"" is one of the most entertaining films of the year. The running time may be pushing three hours and it may send out mixed messages, but great performances and thrilling action sequences more than make up for any missteps. Even the mildest fans of the crime genre owe it to themselves to give it a try and enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>Final Grade: B+"

","Strong performances from Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington add some sheen to this film's flatness and predictability. The rise and fall of Washington's Harlem drug kingpin is fascinating to watch, but there is a reek of familiarity that leaves a sour taste. Scott, who is a good director, makes his visual most of the material and controls the deliberate pace, but he can't give the drama the extra bite it requires to be truly engaging. More stylistically akin to Lumet's ""Prince of the City"" than a ""Scarface"" or ""Goodfellas"", it is a character study, a look at corruption and the delicate nature of relationships forged in an amoral milieu. Crowe, who plays a stubbornly honest cop on Washington's trail, is low key and convincing; Washington, who also turns in a low key performance, is excellent. Good but not great."

","This is a difficult movie to review. It is such a panorama that there are bound to be good and bad parts, good and bad performances. But first, there must be Razzies going to the Director and the Boom Mike Man, and maybe the film editor. The boom mike appears so prominently and so often in this picture that a regular laugh went up from the audience in the theater I was in each time it appeared! Now, this in not some college film school project ... this is Ridley Scott for crying out loud! Both leads did a creditable job, but poor Russell Crowe's character is so annoying that one winced each time the movie switched to him. He also gets in a gratuitous sex scene with his pretty young lawyer that actually detracts from the movie. Denzel carries aloofness to new heights with his stoic portrayal of Frank Lucas. But he is effective, where Crowe could not do a thing to help his Richie Roberts.<br/><br/>The only time we are reminded of Lucas' humanity is when he inexplicably shows an attraction to Eva, whom he later marries, played by the somewhat homely Lymari Nadal. Fortunately, Ms. Nadal is not asked to deliver too many lines, but to just stand around and look pretty; she is capable of neither.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin steals every scene he is in, he has here a sinister screen presence, and we need to see more of him. Armand Assante tries vainly to mimic a Mafia don. Ruby Dee annoyingly and cloyingly turns in the obligatory unknowing gangster's mother routine. Cuba Gooding Jr does what he can with the 20 or so seconds he is on screen (actually, the boom mike got more screen time).<br/><br/>Yet, despite all of the above, the aggregate turns out to be a pretty fair movie, albeit about 30 minutes too long. It's a tough call, but I would advise waiting for the DVD, as it pales in comparison with similar movies of this genre, such as Scarface or King of New York."

It is an incredibly clichéd movie though, right through to the end credits where we have a subtitled epilogue of what happened to the characters after the film ended.<br/><br/>There are some very good scenes, but there are also some very bad scenes which border on being unintentionally funny.<br/><br/>This is a film thats only really worth viewing on the big screen; watching it on your home system would only be detrimental to its value.<br/><br/>This is a very studio produced film; its over-budgeted, the actors are over-paid. at times I was left wondering where the money went.

","American Gangster (2007): Dir: Ridley Scott / Cast: Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe, Josh Brolin, Carla Gugino, Ted Levine: Convincing gangster film that begins in 1968 chronicling two separate agendas. Denzel Washington plays Frank Lucas, an African American drug lord who traffics drugs in from Asia. Russell Crowe plays Richie Roberts, an honest cop who leads a narcotics investigation that eventually leads to Lucas. Director Ridley Scott creates realism that allow this to propel above just a typical gangster film. He has already made his mark with films such as Alien and Blade Runner, and this can align effectively within his body of work. Another plus is that he casts two actors of strong familiar presence as well as talent. Washington and Crowe are compelling as opposites although Crowe's custody battle seemed to distract. Washington is playing against type as a gangster who slowly becomes unraveled. Crowe is a strong counter during the investigation. Supporting roles were not quite as broad and are played by actors who should have pushed this film to excellence. We have Josh Brolin in a role that is far too predictable and bland. Carla Gugino turns up because I'm guessing that the film required a female presence, but the role is cardboard. The cop stands for integrity while Lucas stands for the revealing and punishing of sin but ultimately the door is still open for change. Score: 9 / 10"
"ShootingShark","5","2","3","2 July 2012"," Engrossing But Depressing Saga Of Black Drugs Baron In Sixties New York
","Frank Lucas is an aspiring crimelord in Harlem in the late sixties, who uses his military connections from the Vietnam conflict to smuggle pure grade heroin into the US. Frank gradually carves out an empire, expanding his territory and paying off the authorities, but an inevitable day of reckoning is coming ...<br/><br/>This is a fairly straightforward gangster story, charting Frank's rise and fall over several years from the late sixties to the mid-seventies. We see his motivation to succeed, his ruthless methods in establishing himself as a force to be reckoned with, his intelligence and cunning, his aspirations for his family and friends, his paranoia as the cracks start to appear, and his ultimate downfall at the hands of the narcotics squad. In many ways the characters here are archetypes - The Crime Boss With A Heart and The Cop Who Can't Be Bought, but they are also often enigmatic and hard to read. Washington plays Frank as a thoughtful, careful, even moral man, which makes it hard to understand why he has no qualms about getting rich off the suffering and misery of black Americans caused by the poison he spreads. The movie is perhaps at its most effective when contrasting Frank's elegant surroundings with the squalor and depravity of wasted addicts shooting up his powder in sordid hallways and bathrooms. The danger with this type of material is that in essence Frank is a completely worthless human being; a scumbag killer and dope-peddler who when caught squeals like a pig about every crook he knows, but as played by such a charismatic and gifted actor he becomes much more empathetic and noble. As a straight thriller though, it's fairly gripping stuff and the recreation of the period on such a grand scale is superb. Everybody in the large cast is great, from Dee as Mama, to Gooding as a rival infringing Frank's trademark, to Gugino as Crowe's soon-to-be-ex-wife - I especially like Williams, who is riveting in his one scene at the start as Frank's mentor Bumpy. A solid if not stellar crime thriller, albeit something of a downer, and loosely based on real-life events of the time. Trivia - Washington and Crowe appeared together previously in the 1995 sci-fi thriller Virtuosity, with the good guy / bad guy roles reversed."

","American Gangster is a good but overlong action crime drama with solid performances by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe as the two leads. They both continue to show their talent as actors in these movie despite it's flaws. Director Ridley Scott is admirable in making this film based on a true story about Frank Lucas a heroine drug kingpin from Manhattan and Richie Roberts a dedicated detective determined to bring him down. Washington and Crowe don't share a lot of the screen time together but when they do both actors make the best of it. Well done. The rest of the cast including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Josh Brolin, Cuba Gooding Jr., Carla Gugino, Ted Levine, Joe Morton, Armand Assante, Common, and Idris Elba are effective as the supporting characters in their very limited screen time. The rest of the cast are okay in their roles as well. The film may be a little light on action except for some but it does have some character development, drama, some humor, and a little suspense but not much. What weighed down the film the most to me was the running time of 157 minutes. It had a slow pace at times making the movie feel long because dragged in some areas. Despite some flaws though American Gangter isn't that bad of a movie I've seen worse (The Spirit, Elektra, and The Wicker Man to name a few). Overall if you can get past the long running time first this film based on a true story is worth watching at least once mainly because of the exceptional performances by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe."
"MrGKB","7","2","3","23 August 2008"," A fine, but currently overrated crime bio-pic...
","...""American Gangster"" is a strong film that unfortunately has limited repeat viewability save for Denzel ""Glory"" Washington and/or Russell ""Romper Stomper"" Crowe fans. Its current position as an IMDb Top 250 film (albeit near the bottom of that list) is most assuredly a temporary aberration; as newer films catch the fickle fancy of youthful moviegoers, it will fall off the list. Still, it's a fine piece of entertainment, if a less than accurate one (according to what I've read about it), and does manage to convey the zeitgeist of the time period fairly well, despite the plethora of visual anachronisms that eagle-eyed viewers may be apt to catch. Script doctor Steven ""Schindler's List"" Zaillian's screenplay delineates the rise and fall of a notorious Harlem drug kingpin in the late 60s/early 70s, while limning in tandem the problematic circumstances of the policeman aiming to bring him down. The usual issues of honor, integrity, and purpose are explored to varying effect (cf. ""The Godfather,"" ""Casino,"" ""Once Upon a Time in America,"" etc.), and the minutia of drug-dealing and criminal investigation are convincingly illustrated (see ""The French Connection,"" ""Goodfellas,"" ""Blow,"" and so forth and so on). Washington delivers yet another excellent performance as the homicidal crook with a sense of gentlemanly conduct, Crowe is equally strong as his determined opponent, and the rest of the cast is pretty much without fault. Production values are the expected top-rank, Harris ""Zodiac"" Savides DP work is superb, the score and incidental music selections are of a piece, and who can argue with Clarence ""The Mod Squad"" Williams III in an uncredited cameo role? All in all, a fine several hours of Crimestoppers entertainment, but far from the ""classic"" status that the current IMDb rating would indicate."
"pyrocitor","7","2","3","15 August 2008"," Conventional yet compelling crime drama
","Certain films appear almost tailor made for success right from the moment of conception, and American Gangster proves a perfect example. Detailing the thrilling true story of a Harlem drug lord, helmed by an enormously renowned director and giving two of the finest stars in the industry the chance to generate murderous chemistry and flex their dramatic muscles, it seemed near impossible that the film could not be a runaway smash hit. And indeed it would seem this was the attitude of those involved with the production of the film, as while the film in question is hardly a failure, the impression is given of all concerned being content to coast by on the film's respective successful components instead of really pushing the envelope to extract every ounce of the film's cinematic potential. As such, American Gangster remains an engrossing and powerful piece of cinema but considering the movie magic that could have resulted, the sturdy film feels almost like a disappointment, or at the very least a somewhat misplaced opportunity.<br/><br/>As laudable a package as American Gangster is, the inescapable sense of it offering little of new to the crime genre and in many cases unabashedly borrowing from past efforts (one scene in particular is purloined directly from The Godfather) stifles one's appreciation of its overall quality. Had the film been released twenty or so years ago, it would doubtlessly have been praised for its storyline and thematic innovations, but after countless entries into the genre of late, characteristics such as repeatedly drawing explicit parallels and contrasts between the cop and criminal squaring off against each other and police corruption making it difficult for the one honest member to function hardly come across as revelatory. While it is clear that all parties involved have done more than their fair share of research into the life and legacy of infamous 1970s Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas, the telling of Lucas' tale falls prey to overly familiar crime film conventions so frequently that there is little to differentiate the film from countless other explorations of the rise and fall of successful drug lords apart from the nationality of the title character, proudly flaunted ""true story"" tag or not. <br/><br/>However, quality is quality, and in the hands of such an esteemed filmmaker as Ridley Scott it proves a difficult trait to avoid indeed, as Scott anchors a firm directorial grasp throughout. After a slow start, detailing Lucas' work ethic and value system, Scott's film really takes off, with the veteran director extracting the maximum possible amount of tension, cinematic power and emotional clout from the compelling story, convention aside. Scott's depiction of 1970s Harlem indeed looks and feels the part, painting a vivid and memorable picture of the highs and lows of financial offerings, albeit one that does feel like an immaculate construction without the level of grit or authenticity other filmmakers such as Scorsese have pumped from the much filmed city. However, with some quality cinematography and editing and a suitably seventies musical score the film remains an overall staunchly constructed package, despite the feeling of it being very much a package and less of a flowing story.<br/><br/>As title character Frank Lucas, Denzel Washington is truly the film's main centerpoint of quality, his quiet charisma and nobility creating a character who audiences can empathise with while simultaneously being repelled by without missing a beat. Rather than struggling with the differentiation, Washington inhabits the character so fully that such contradictions appear second nature, fully engrained in such an able-bodied performance. Russell Crowe is also a strong presence as Richie Roberts, the struggling, scruffy policeman striving to take Lucas down, but despite Crowe's trademark rugged charisma his performance still appears bland by his usual standards, coasting by on a simplistically written ""struggling, divorced but honest cop"" archetype. Ably backing the two powerhouse leads, Chiwetel Ejoifor wonderfully essays Lucas' nervy yet enthusiastically likable brother and second in command, and Josh Brolin gives a gleefully repulsive performance as a seedy, corrupt policeman. Ruby Dee shines in her few scenes, a dignified yet formidable performance as Lucas' weathered mother, and Lymari Nadal instils a quiet serenity into Lucas' beauty queen wife, preventing the character from simply becoming an undignified moll. <br/><br/>While American Gangster boasts impressive exteriors, on the inside it proves somewhat of a hollow effort, offering little new to its genre and seemingly lacking in genuine spark underneath the awards baiting outside. However, the quality on display cannot be ignored, and the film remains an impressively crafted, powerfully acted and undeniably compelling piece of work - if only there wasn't an ever persistent sense of missed potential throughout, an even greater film lingering frustratingly out of reach. <br/><br/>-7.5/10"

The story is interesting, and it follows history pretty accurately -- at least more accurately than many ""based on a true story"" movies. But, as many other users have noted, the movie doesn't take full advantage of the dual story threads -- the relationship between the gangster and the cop should have received more time at the end, and there are many minutes of film in the first half that could have been cut to make that possible."
"robhiphop","5","1","1","14 April 2009"," Sprawling crime epic that plays it strictly by the numbers
","I had this one sitting on my DVD shelf for a while. For some reason, I could never drum up much enthusiasm to watch it. Well, it's another decent if ultimately perfunctory effort from Ridley Scott. Pretty much the same deal as the last 5,000 or so films he's done. You won't finish watching this and think ""Wow, that was a really bad film"", but you'll probably be left with the vague sense that the 2 and a 1/2 hours viewing time might've been better spent doing something else. That's quite a plummet in quality for the visionary maverick behind Alien and Bladerunner. I could watch those films over and over again (and do). But I could never imagine bothering to give American Gangster a second viewing.<br/><br/>Finding precise fault with the film is not particularly easy. On the surface at least, it's a well constructed movie and Scott does a good job in weaving the disparate pieces of the sprawling narrative together. On a technical level, American Gangster is pretty much flawless, albeit in a style so well worn that we could politely file it away in a drawer labeled ""serious adult drama"" and then forget about it.<br/><br/>And therein lies the problem. There is nothing you will see in American Gangster that smacks of genuine inspiration. Scott is attempting to give us a modern American crime epic, but what he's really delivering is the standard set of movie archetypes that are now endemic to the genre. Denzel Washington's Frank Lucas is the smart, ruthless and fast rising crime lord who will eventually see his world come crashing down around him. Russell Crowe's Richie Roberts is the determined, incorruptible cop who lives and breathes to bring Lucas down, at the expense of neglecting his personal life. Pretty much the same deal you've seen in about a million other movies then.<br/><br/>Both Crowe and Washington have received critical plaudits for their performances here, but it's about what you'd expect from two Hollywood heavyweights. In other words, you will never for a moment become totally immersed in these characters or their story. What you will see is a pair of Hollywood big-shots doing their level best to inflate what are actually fairly run of the mill roles into something of serious importance. You can practically hear these guys reciting their Oscar acceptance speeches somewhere off in the wings. It's more about affected posturing than it is about actual substance. Josh Brolin easily delivers the film's strongest performance as a ruthless and conniving cop on the take, Detective Trupo. You can really feel the oily malevolence behind the character. Considering Brolin's recent run of hot form, maybe that's not so surprising.<br/><br/>The story is told competently enough but fails to produce anything in the way of an emotional pay-off. Scott strives mightily to capture the grand themes of American crime cinema: greed, corruption, big business, redemption. You know the drill by now. Unfortunately, Scott just doesn't have anything fresh to say about these things. The truth of the matter is, guys like Scorsese, Coppola and David Chase have pretty much told us all we need to know about the American crime genre. If you're going to delve into this kind of territory, then you're going up against such heavyweight fare as the Godfather, Goodfellas and the Sopranos. And American Gangster doesn't really cut it in that kind of company. It's like the wannabe kid brother who gets left behind as the lookout while the older kids go off and do the really cool stuff.<br/><br/>Like so much of Scott's output in recent years, American Gangster has a curiously flat quality. It never really feels like it comes alive. You might say it's perfectly acceptable film making. Scott knows his trade well enough. Too well, maybe. It's just not an especially satisfying meal. It's two and a half hours of mildly interesting story that never strikes out of the genre confines and into fresh and engaging territory. There's much worse ways to waste your time than watching American Gangster, for sure, but if you're really looking for that crime epic fix, then you'd be better off re-watching your Godfather DVD or playing through Grand Theft Auto: Vice City."

Dispensing with the showiness of his rivals, and inheriting corporate branding techniques to sell his dope, Lucas' rise is swift. Along with his obsessive reticence Lucas is also unique in his pioneering method of bringing heroin to America via air force planes out of South East Asia. Crap dad/honest cop Ritchie Roberts (Russell Crowe) has his sights set on bringing down the operation but Lucas' 'under the radar' profile makes him an impossible target. Roberts' campaign can go nowhere until he can identify the ringleader. <br/><br/>Apart from the de rigueur 'crime doesn't pay' platitude, American Gangsters' message seems to be that there's no accounting for taste and that those with zero dress sense can triumph over those in designer wear. The campaign of Crowe's unglamorous and dowdy cop with rubbish hair appears hopeless against Washington's immaculate Brioni suited drug lord; that is until he commits a massive fashion faux par by attending a prize fight dressed as a squirrel. ""The loudest man in the room is the weakest man in the room."" Failing to take his own advice the demise of Frank Lucas is mere paperwork after that. <br/><br/>The depiction of Lucas' corporate marketing - a la Coca Cola - to sell 'quality' heroin to the 'discerning smack head' is something of a hoot. Maybe that's how it went down in 70's Harlem but most users in my experience would inject the contents of a leper's colostomy bag on the off-chance of a hit. Also Lucas's smuggling of his product into America via air force planes from Vietnam is not quite the innovation. He may have believed this was his baby but it's a fair bet that this enterprise was pioneered, marshalled and monitored by the C.I.A, partly as a means to keeping urban negroes in a state of stupor so as not to organise themselves 'Black Panther' or 'Nation of Islam' style. Whether he was aware of it or not Lucas was almost certainly working for the 'man'. <br/><br/>The big 'toe to toe' between Washington and Crowe falls short of the build up. For one, it's a long time coming, and by the time this keenly awaited 'final reckoning' takes place Lucas has already been arrested and on the ropes. It's a great scene, but fails to ignite in the way DeNiro and Pacino's 'two guys over a coffee' showdown in Heat does where no one has the upper hand and the prize is still to be taken. <br/><br/>American Gangster's DNA is impeccable; you've got a director in Ridley Scott who is probably incapable of making a bad film and two of the biggest and charismatic stars of the day in Washington and Crowe. On paper it must have been beautiful but maybe it's this fail safe 'cannot lose' combination that raises the bar of expectation to an unreachable degree which excludes American Gangster from the cigar handing out ceremony accorded the likes of The Godfather, Scarface and Goodfellas. The tone and timbre of the piece evokes the best of gritty 70's crime thrillers but there's a certain restraint about the whole affair - as if taking its cue from its antagonist - and restraint is an arm a mob movie can't afford to chance."

","The film starts out with some fire. Then it turns into a dialogue ridden, action deprived, prolonged film about drug trafficking and those who oppose it. Many of the story lines are unnecessary and bloat the film.<br/><br/>The acting was okay. Denzel was, well, Denzel. You've seen it before; it's just he's in a 60-70s suit. Russell Crowe was good because he was a perfect match for the part. However, it's not his best performance and if he's nominated I'll be surprised. Lots of cameos and a hell of a cast behind them.<br/><br/>The action was good but it was sparse. Lots of stake outs with little to no action. There were little spurts of action through out the movie but the total time of action was probably around 10 minutes. That is, until the end. The action that did happen at the end - way too late - was top notch and lasted about 10 minutes. It was tense and well shot.<br/><br/>The resolution was perhaps the best part of the film, mainly because it happened at a faster pace than all the bloated and unnecessary building of the sides.<br/><br/>In all honesty, American Gangster was mediocrity at it's finest. Has some very good craftsmanship. You'd expect that from Ridley Scott. But, alas, it has some of the worst. The contrived dialogue and slow pace are the two worst things. The visible (I hope we got an early print.) boom mic was horrendous. It's like they didn't even try to edit that or cover it up. Sad.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that it's over-hyped. It'll make it's money, but I think it could have been so much more. But then, that's the definition of mediocrity."

","""American Gangster"" is an okay mob movie. Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington hand in solid performances (as expected), and Ridley Scott directs the story tastefully, although it could have used a bit more drive. You find yourself looking at your watch a couple of times. Where Scorsese and even De Palma have directed overlong gangster movies that keep you on the edge of your seat from the first minute to the last, Scott made this one as unagitated as most of his great movies (""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Gladiatior"") - and apparently people like him for it, so maybe it's just me who's got a problem with that.<br/><br/>Personally, I didn't feel connected enough. The main characters don't ever meet each other until the very end and then it's over way too quickly. Especially, Denzel Washington's change of ambition seems rushed there and the ending is more than a bit reminiscent of ""GoodFellas"".<br/><br/>Actually, this problems plagues the whole movie. We've seen it all before somewhere else: The tense job an unbribable cop has to do in a corrupt environment (""Serpico""), the schizophrenic life of a gangster who is a loving family man in one minute and a brutal killer with no qualms in the next (""The Godfather""), the glamorous rise and fall of a gangster boss (""Scarface""). Sure, these things never really gets old, but they have become a bit trite nonetheless.<br/><br/>As a depiction of life and crime in the 60's and 70's, this year's ""Zodiac"" was the more entertaining movie. ""American Gangster"" is still well worth seeing, but not among the highlights of 2007."

","Just saw the new Ridley Scott movie American Gangster. IMDb.com has it rated at 8.2/10 but I just don't get it. I remember when Scorseses Gangs of New York came out. I just could not wait to see it. Man, did that movie bomb. And damn did American Gangster disappoint too. It's not that the casting and acting was bad. Actually they were both great. It was the direction and the storytelling that lacked big time. At no time during the nearly 3 hours the movie played did I connect with any of the characters. It was like a summary of a 'true story'. There were some promising bits in the movie that could have made this a much better experience, but it never delivered. Yes, I was entertained for nearly 3 hours but I was also entertained by the movie Shoot 'm up, maybe even more. The only reason I would rate American Gangster higher is the powerhouse cast. That and the bad direction is the only thing that stands out. Ridley, please don't miss twice in a row like Scorsese did with his two gangster movies: Gangs of New York and The Departed (which only won an Oscar because Scorsese was overdue for one). The Ridley Scoot that I knew: Blade Runner, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Kingdom of Heaven, The Company, (and I could go on, but I won't do that because it will ruin his track record), was the guru film director, the Yoda of movies, the godfather of cinema. Now he has straid from the path and has now become a mediocre director. Please find your way back. Preferably before your next movie, please. The same goes for Scorsese!"
"wax-rhapsodic","6","29","113","15 October 2007"," Misguided Marketing Murders 'American Gangster'
","The Oscar buzz surrounding the highly anticipated Ridley Scott movie American Gangster is ostensibly doing the production plenty of favors. Rarely is a movie slated to be released in November the beneficiary of such publicity and fanfare.<br/><br/>Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment will likely be pleased with the opening weekend returns if the preceding publicity translates to box office performance.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the word of mouth that is likely to spread subsequent to opening weekend will not be as favorable as the hype will have you believeand that's not necessarily a failure on the part of the movie, but more a function of misdirected marketing by the producing companies involved.<br/><br/>By now all of us have had the opportunity to see the movie trailer for American Gangster, one that is very specific in its depiction of what to expect come November 2.<br/><br/>Despite what the movie trailer suggests, American Gangster is NOT a violent, ""action"" movie. It has some flurries of violent hyperactivity, but the OTHER 2 hours of non-action make a stronger argument for characterization as anything BUT an ""action"" movie. In fact, the movie has less violence overall than any movie with ""Gangster"" in its title should be allowed to have.<br/><br/>The violence and action are reasonable expectations too. Drugs, mafia, guns and the depiction of murder all line the trailer of a movie with ""Gangster"" in the title. One would think that's an invitation for classic, violent ""gangster"" cinema.<br/><br/>But trust Mo'Kellythis is NOT an action movie and in many ways completely divorced from the ""gangster"" genre. If you attend this movie expecting something akin to Casino, Goodfellas, or any of the cookie-cutter urban dramas, you'll be thoroughly disappointed.<br/><br/>But it's not necessarily your faultor the movie's for that matter. You're being misled.<br/><br/>This cinematic story of Frank Lucas tells of a cerebral criminal mastermind. Lucas is portrayed in this film as exceptionally reasoned, measured and intellectually resourceful in a way that is more powerful than any gun wielded by his nemeses.<br/><br/>The movie American Gangster is true in that sense to its introspective protagonist. It is more descriptive of the internal conflict between Lucas' Christian/family values upbringing and his desire to live the American Dream. Accordingly, Scott spends over 2.5 hours in his attempt to give his viewers a glimpse more into the ""mastermind"" as opposed to ""criminal"" portion of the ""criminal mastermind"" equation.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the trailer suggests the exact oppositeand that could (and likely will be) disastrous.<br/><br/>Specifically, the storyline is loosely based on the life and criminal career of a Harlem heroin kingpin who rose and fell concurrently to American involvement in Vietnam.<br/><br/>For those who know their New York drug kingpin cinema history, the movie New Jack City (1991) was a thinly veiled reference to the criminal exploits of another Harlem drug lord and Lucas contemporary; Leroy ""Nicky"" Barnes.<br/><br/>The American Gangster parallels to New Jack City are inescapable given their shared elements in a historical and cinematic sense. (New Jack City was a fictitious account of the emergence of crack, whereas Barnes and Lucas were responsible for the influx of high-grade heroin) When moviegoers finally sit down for American Gangster, they've most likely seen New Jack City. Although NJC is set in a period later than American Gangster; since it borrows its storyline from the heroin drug trade of the 60s, there will be elements in American Gangster that will reek eerily familiar if not seem ""copied"" from NJC. Without a thorough understanding of the historical contexts of both movies, American Gangster will in many ways be wrongly construed as a ""copy"" of NJC. In actuality, AG is more accurate and honest in its depiction of the drug trade than its wholly fictitious counterpart of yesteryear.<br/><br/>But back to the Oscar hype Academy Award winners Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe do well in their respective roles, yet given the fact that both have a slew of films with truly stellar performances in which to compare American Gangster; it makes you wonder where the buzz originates.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington's portrayal of Frank Lucas is not as engaging as his Malcolm X, not as incredible as his Reuben ""Hurricane"" Carter or even as evil as the corrupt detective Alonzo in Training Day. We know when we see the ""best"" of Denzel Washington and it is readily identifiable.<br/><br/>This is simply not it...through no fault of his own. He's an actor who's made a career of ""cerebral characters."" A ""cerebral gangster"" simply does not provide the platform for Washington to show the range and depth we already know he's capable of displaying. ""Frank Lucas"" is a ""Denzel,"" we're all intimately familiar with and thus less than ""Oscar-worthy."" Denzel has raised the bar far higher in other performances and this fact can't be ignored in any truthful commentary about his latest effort.<br/><br/>As for Russell Crowe, copy and paste the previous paragraph and substitute Crowe's information accordingly. After seeing Crowe at his best in The Insider and A Beautiful Mind, it's a bit disingenuous to argue that his portrayal of Detective Richie Roberts is worthy of comparison or similar acclaim. Again, it's not dismissing Crowe's contribution, but this role simply did not require any heavy liftingheavy lifting we know Crowe's capable of handling.<br/><br/>In the end, American Gangster does not measure up to the hype. The blame should go more to the Universal Pictures marketing department and less to director Ridley Scott. People turning out will presumably expect to see lots of violence and action surrounding the life of a high-powered drug lord. Instead, they will find they've spent their money on a biopic of an introspective family man with flashes of the aforementioned.<br/><br/>American Gangster is neither a great movie nor a bad one. It's just ""a movie."" Combine this with a misdirected marketing campaign and you have the classic recipe for movie-buyer-remorse."

","man was that trailer cool. Too bad the trailer is the best part about this movie.<br/><br/>Saw this last night and the first thing you need to know is that its LOOOONG. No just long in that its 157 minutes, long in the way that you FEEL all of those 157 minutes. The pacing is so uneven and there are so many obviously unnecessary subplots (the women in Richie and Frank's lives especially) that I began to get annoyed at the running time even as the movie was still playing.<br/><br/>The other glaring problem is the movie's apparent lack of social responsibility. Here you have a story that is set up to depict the rise to power of the first African-American gangster in U.S. history and the way Ridley treats him as a Jesus figure completely robs the movie of any moral complexity. They have one scene that cuts back and forth between Denzel having a pimptastic Thanksgiving dinner while his ""customers"" are shown overdosing in tenement buildings across Harlem. That's it. The rest of the time we're meant to believe that this guy who is responsible for spreading ultra-pure Heroin across the city is revered as some sort of messiah. Sorry, I just didn't buy it even if it is based on true events.<br/><br/>The acting is good in a been there done that sort of way. We're so familiar with Russel and Denzel by now that we take them for granted and I don't think these characters were any real stretch for them. Josh Brolin steals the movie in every scene he's in as an unbelievably corrupt cop while Joe Morton's inexplicably blond mustache steals every frame that it is in.<br/><br/>Won't get into spoilers but the ending is particularly troublesome with a very tidy conclusion that alters the real facts the whole movie is supposed to be based on. Overall this is good but not great. Will probably get Oscar consideration in acting and directing categories as it is in the gangster chic motif that Hollywood seems to love."

Crowe's accent can only be described as ""Crocodile Dundee Goes to Harlem.""

","Directing is key - Spielberg does it without stars and makes good films. Tony Scott and Zel are a good pair. My favorite was crimson tide - it rules, it rocks. There was no such tension in this movie - prob because it's based on a true story, and jerry goldsmith's orchestral scores were missing. So its about a good cop investigating this business man. Plot's not important. But Zel didn't get a lot of dialog to express his character's character (I know it's redundant).<br/><br/>I would've liked to see more of Zel talking and yelling, and getting mad or happy through dialog (not that serious look he has in most of the film) with occasional outbursts of murdering his fellow men. Ha ha. I liked it when he busted a cap.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe - holds his own ground - brilliantly - more of a pleasure to watch - how's he gonna do it, how's he gonna get nail that sucker. Well would be cool if Zel knew he would get caught - at least he would keep a low profile - like he said he would or like he made his bro keep a low profile. Damn, his Puerto Rican wife with that loud fur coat and that glamour with photographs, what was Frank Lucas thinking ? Oh right, it's a guess by tony Scott that the coat was what set off a catalyst of events that led to frank's capture. OK, 30 minutes left for frank to snitch on all the dirty cops. Oh, and now he's out of prison in 1991. The end. What??? Come on man, he's back in the dark with the shot of a gun to shine one second of light on the dark background. Part 2 the return of superfly? Wait, that was the temporary name of American gangster. I wonder what happened to his wife and how did he get all that bling bling ??<br/><br/>My review of this movie is this: I've seen it twice, still, it runs real well, smooth, cool, entertaining to watch the stars. I don't like this movie cause it could be better, had to have gone in a different direction. More writing, more words. I liked Shawshank - how much were they talking, thought the whole movie right?

Or was it Russell Crowe playing the good cop/bad habits bit that did little more that make me shrug my shoulders a couple times In the end, I felt nothing for these characters, Ridely Scott left something to be desired in his directing, and I'd already seen this movie a hundred different ways.

All the major actors do a solid job, the dialogue is well written, and the production design is great. But to what point? There's nothing happening to keep me interested, mostly because the characters seem to come from the book ""Cops and Gangsters in the movies: This is how it's always been done"".
Also: Has Ridley Scott met more that five women in his life? Basically all the female characters are naked, or beauty queens, or the 200th version of a neglected single mom, yelling at her unreliable ex. None of them is a real character. That, too, is really boring."

While other crime films focus on the Italian or Irish mafia scene the best being the infamous Godfather Trilogy this movie is highly original in telling the story of a Black Crime family. What's like with almost all truly great mob movies like Goodfellas or Casino is that the character is ambiguous looking out for his family. The times he is living in (70's) with the international dealers he has to deal with shows that the character has to make a living somehow and of course his violent tendencies is a big reveal into the real world of the mob as opposed to the exaggerated or gentlemen approach taken in other mob movies. The movie is full of action, suspense and mystery as the cops try to figure out who is behind the recent drug epidemic. This series foreshadows Breaking Bad which became a major series in the 00s.

Based on a true story this film manages to impress viewers with good dialog and good acting especially from Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. <br/><br/>The movie delivers a clear message, no matter how bad-ass you are and no matter how careful you are, getting into the drug business is a bad idea, especially when underpaid honest cops are around. All Jokes aside, this movie is really good and its message can be interpreted in many ways, from a socio-political perspective or an anti-crime one to perhaps even a business ethics perspective, its up to you.<br/><br/>Artistically this movie is great like I've stated before and I believe it deserves a 9\10"

Frank Lucas, not so much. Though, if this film is close to reality, Lucas may have been even more successful than Barnes, Johnson or many of the Italian mobsters.

This marked the third collaboration between Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe and was a success. The movie also compares to historical landmarks such as Schindler's List,Gangs of New York,Munich,Valkyrie,The Last Samurai,and Men of Honor. Also Scott depicts the film almost near accurately. I thought that this was a perfect crime tale to put onto film and i enjoyed it a lot."

","American Gangster works on numerous levels. It's in part a portrait of late 60s-early 70s Harlem and America, full of drugs and desperation and weakness, where the strong rise above the rest and the cops are dirtier than the rats. As a crime thriller it's entertaining and at 2 hours 37 minutes, never loses interest. But, maybe most surprisingly, it's also a superb character drama and study. Literally every character who steps on screen is compelling, has depth to them, has their motivations, and is tossed into conflict. For example there's a scene early on where Crow's character Richie and his partner are searching a parked car and find a very large amount of unmarked money in the trunk. Without giving away more, it and the following scenes lead to some surprising moral and character statements by Scott. Richie's morals vs everyone else the temptation of the streets is commonly laid on him throughout the film, and thanks to Crow's great great performance, it adds a lot to the movie."

","I'm not particularly fond of Russell Crowe, but when he came together with Ridley Scott, some terrific movies got made. Throw Denzel Washington into the mix and you have the makings of an epic drama. American Gangster was beloved by critics and the academy alike, but it also received negative reviews from the people the story was based on, who claimed it was ninety percent fiction. The film takes almost 3 hours to tell us the story of Frank Lucas, a man who was mentored by the great Bumpy Johnson, and ran Harlem, along with much of the heroin on the east coast from 1969 to 1977. In passed years, even prior to this film, Frank Lucas has been immortalized as some kind of hero. Many believe that he kept the people of Harlem out of poverty and ultimately did the right thing, once his conscience caught up with him. The film American Gangster seems to agree with this take on the story and portray Lucas as a man larger than life, who you want to like, despite his criminal activity. The truth is that Lucas was no hero, as for a decade he ran a crew as large as any organized crime family, and he was responsible for the deaths of thousands of people who overdosed on his junk. When Lucas turned states evidence, leading to the arrest of 150 people, most of whom were corrupt officials in New York City, it had nothing to do with his conscience, he just wanted to stay out of jail. That's not how it portrayed and was the only thing that really kept this film from getting a five star rating. American Gangster is shot much in the same style as Heat, with a large cast and fasting moving scenes. Denzel Washington is always good, but when he's playing someone from his own community he really steps it up to a whole other level. Washington absolutely should have received an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Lucas. Regardless of how true the story may have been, Washington was just amazing. Denzel is paired with Russell Crowe, who portrays the man who is chasing him, a very deep and interesting man that seemed to fit Crowe's personality to a tee. American Gangster is a long, fast moving story, that may not be all that accurate, but you will be hard pressed to find a better cast then the one they had and for that, American Gangster is labeled as a must see movie."
"Leofwine_draca","9","2","4","28 August 2012"," As good as the best of Scorsese
","A tough, exquisitely-made gangster film redolent of Martin Scorsese at his best. Ridley Scott has pulled out all the stops here, making this one of his greatest ever films; if I had to choose a top form, this film would be in the list (alongside ALIEN, BLACK HAWK DOWN and GLADIATOR). American GANGSTER feels like an epic, a fully rounded, completely engrossing true story of one man's rise to the top in the drug trade.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington has long since proved his acting chops and it's no surprise that he's on top form here as Frank Lucas, an extremely ruthless henchman who decides to go into business on his own. Despite the lengthy running time and the decades-long scope of the film's narrative, what follows is never less than fully engaging. Scott is on top form as director, this film is a beauty to watch, and the various montage scenes are particularly well handled.<br/><br/>Playing opposite Washington is Scott regular Russell Crowe as a scruffy but dedicated cop determined to bring down his man. Crowe goes for the subtle approach, never overshadowing Washington, and he's very effective with it. The supporting cast are excellent, particularly Josh Brolin as a corrupt cop. Despite the familiarity of its format and the inevitability of its outcome, American GANGSTER is a film that holds its own against the other all-time American gangster greats like GOODFELLAS and CASINO."
"ntvnyr30","10","2","4","15 April 2012"," Ridley Scott's Epic
","Ridley Scott is one of the finest directors and why the Academy Awards keeps snubbing him is beyond me.<br/><br/>This is truly an epic film, depicting the gritty New York/New Jersey drug scene in the 1970's. Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington are the main protagonists and both are sublime as usual. To me, the real badass of the film is Josh Brolin. He steals every scene as Detective Trupo of the Special Investigations Unit. Such corruption was commonplace in the 1960's and 70's, which resulted in Frank Serpico exposing the widespread practice of cops ""on the take."" Crowe is excellent as the honest cop searching for a decent team of crusaders to solve the puzzle of the distributor of Blue Magic.<br/><br/>The attention to detail in recreating 1970's New York is outstanding. The whole picture has a ""French Connection"" feel.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is great too: Cuba Gooding Jr., Armand Assante et al.<br/><br/>This is a really great film. However, as I commented on the message board, the one thing that disturbed me was the fawning over the real Frank Lucas on the extras DVD. This is a man who killed people directly or indirectly and people were all too willing to ""kiss his ring"" when he was on the set. Is there any decency at all anymore?"

He's really good as the good guy like he's in Remember the Titans, Inside Man, Unstoppable and so on. But he really comes alive when he goes to the other side of the aisle.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is also very good in this movie as the detective who then also serves as the prosecutor is the one responsible for bringing down Washington's character of Frank Lucas who was one of the most powerful cocaine smugglers/king pins in US history. Frank took over the Harlem drug trade after legendary gangster Bumpy Johnson died.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin plays a corrupt NYPD detective who tries to blackmail Lucas."
"samit_d","10","2","4","10 July 2010"," American Gangster - A review
","To summarize this movie in a few words would be impossible. This movie breaches the movie making industry in a way that no other movie has ever done before. To follow fact and make fact is very hard for many directors but Ridley Scott has done it again. Amazing character roles by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe show that Hollywood just isn't Sex, Money and Press. <br/><br/>Portrayed in this movie is the life of a Harlem drug lord by the name of Frank Lucas. It shows his life as a right hand man and a man of power. What sets Frank Lucas apart from other drug lords is his transparent honesty. To offer better heroin to the streets of Harlem and still looking to make money he goes and buys direct from a source in Southeast Asia in the jungles of Vietnam. <br/><br/>In his struggle to power many businesses are destroyed most of them owned by the Italian Mafia. The Mafia's motto being, ""Never Forgive and never forget"" never forgot what Frank Lucas did to them. His product Blue magic destroyed the streets of Harlem, leaving thousands dead but the demand of his product grew.<br/><br/>On the other side of the bridge a small cop by the name of Richie Roberts tries to make ends meet with bar exams on his plate and the divorce from his wife who is going to take his kid away. He and his partner find a million dollars in the trunk of an abandoned car and instead of keeping it like another cop would have done and his partner insisted Richie turned the money in. This display of honesty goes to the Federal Narcotics Bureau and Richie gets the permission to form his own narcotics squad with only people that ""wouldn't take a nickel off of the sidewalk.""<br/><br/>As Frank grows more powerful Richie's investigation into the drug trafficking business grows bigger. At the boxing match of the century with Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali, Frank Lucas gives himself away to Richie Roberts by wearing a a mink coat. Discovered to Richie Roberts his investigation into the drug underworld expands. <br/><br/>Though this review may contain many spoilers you can end the movie for yourself by watching it. <br/><br/>*Remember: Don't support Piracy :) *"
"tjsdshpnd","7","2","4","19 October 2009"," Long but Engrossing Movie
","The movie name may suggest that it is a movie glorifying another Gangster or Mafia head. Well it is not only that. It can be divided into two streams of stories that hold two different perspectives - One good and one Bad (This is left to the discretion of the viewer who to consider good and whom to consider bad). Based on a true story and set in the late 1960's, this movie talks about two people, A gangster drug-lord with a heart of gold - Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) and a honest but somewhat crazy cop - Richie Roberts (Russel Crowe). Lucas revolutionizes the Drug business by cutting down the middlemen and selling 100% pure dope with a price half than the impure ones. His product named 'Blue Magic' is a rage on the streets and it shuts down the business of other Mafia's. But Popularity brings in enemies as well which helps the cops eradicate his gang slowly. The movie is about 3 hours long, but for such a long movie, it does not loses the viewer's interest. I for one was very much keen to know what will happen next which made me complete the movie in one sitting. Credit should be given to the direction .<br/><br/>Denzel Washington and Russel Crowe, both have been given enough screen space. But separately. They share screen space just for mere 5 - 7 minutes in the climax. Nothing bad to say about both of them. They played their part nicely. A good watch for crime genre lovers.<br/><br/>Rating : 7/10"
"hitchcockthelegend","9","2","4","30 April 2008"," Far from being Scott's best work, it still however is a riveting crime picture.
","This is the true story of 1970s Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas who submarined the Mafia gangs by importing his heroin uncut direct from Thailand, and thus able to corner the drug market with cheaper prices. On his trail is Richie Roberts, one of the few honest cops operating out of his corrupt department.<br/><br/>American Gangster may turn out to be one of the most divisive films in Ridley Scott's cannon, gone are the visual traits that are beloved by so many of his fans, and in comes straight forward story telling, heavy on plot and filmed as a near to a documentary style as Scott has ventured thus far in a mainstream picture. I have no doubt that cries of Scott merely dipping his toes in crime picture waters from the past will be used against him, and for sure there is nothing remotely new in the Steve Zaillian screenplay here to make anyone sit up and take notice. But I applaud Scott for making, what on the page looked to have been a run of the mill crime caper, into a riveting character study. Full of 70s fashions and police procedural gusto, American Gangster lifts itself above the average crime capers of yesteryear because it boasts two of the best actors working today in the lead roles.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe plays Richie Roberts with much restraint, and it's thru this restraint that the character becomes more believable, Roberts has his issues for sure (notably of the romantic kind), but his unflinching deep rooted belief in honesty gives the character an earthy aura, and it's down to Crowe that the character succeeds on the screen. Taking the honours here, though, is Denzel Washington as Frank Lucas, full of zest and charming menace, he infuses Lucas with credibility as both a caring family man and also a merciless crime lord. Great performances, both. American Gangster is a fine film on the screen, but on the page it looks to be lacking in bravery or any sort of invention, but it's nice to see Ridley Scott taking on yet another genre and at the very least making it a notch above many other directors best works in the epic crime caper pantheon. 9/10<br/><br/>Footnote: I have recently caught the extended cut which has a further 17 minutes added to the original theatrical release. Of most interest is the alternate ending that is nice as regards watching Crowe & Washington share more screen time, but in light of the big picture you can see why it was cut. Stick with the theatrical version is my honest opinion."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","2","4","7 April 2008"," Good, but not as brilliant as some would have us believe...
","Ridley Scott's crime opus is a real slow-burner that starts a little shakily as it struggles to introduce the central characters in a way that doesn't confuse the viewer, and proceeds to tell its epic story at a stately pace that defies both genre conventions and present-day trends. There is no doubting the quality of the product here, there's no doubting the fact that it is a relatively big and important film, and yet there's still that nagging feeling that it isn't really as good as it could have been <br/><br/>Denzel Washington wins more screen time than co-star Russell Crowe and quite frankly acts Crowe off the screen. Ten years in the States and Crowe still has trouble concealing that antipodean twang when he's playing an American. While Crowe fights against his accent, Washington fights against his nice guy persona. Presumably he was chosen for this role because of that charisma  it adds depth to a bad guy when he's also a nice guy  but for some reason he just doesn't convince as this urbane businessman capable of shocking acts of brutality; his dark side simply fails to convince, and his violent outbursts too often seem too much at odds with his usual calm demeanour.<br/><br/>Despite these niggles, as you would expect , the film is extremely well made. Scott could make a decent film out of the shoddiest of material, and with a cast like this one you just know you're in for some quality performances. Certainly, the acting and visual style outshine the plot which  despite being based on true events  is straight out of the Warner Bros. Big Book of Gangster Stories © 1937. We are never in any doubt as to how the film will end, and it is to Scott's and writer Steven Zaillian's credit that we're still willing to stick with it to the end credits anyway."

","The acting by Denzel Washington was superb! I believe that he enjoys playing this type of role (""Training Day,"" etc). Russell Crowe was very good. James Brolin made you really hate him. This usually means that the actor did a good job. Good direction. Good photography, a little dark at times, but well shot. Good story line that was interesting and easy to follow. Politics must have had something to do with the fact that the movie did not win any academy awards. The ending was somewhat surprising, but done well.

Denzel Washington's brilliant performance made me acquire older movies that he stares in. He really shows class and skill, portraying the change that took place in the character, almost like a ""mafioso"", only not with an Italian accent. Russell Crowe turns in an excellent performance as well, being an honest cop in a corrupt society. When I saw this movie, I did not know it was inspired from a true story, until the ending credits. <br/><br/>American Gangster definitely made it to my Top 10 List, which include masterpieces such as The Shawshank Redeption, Titanic, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, Goodfellas, Se7en, The Departed, The Pianist and the list goes on. <br/><br/>If you have enjoyed any of the movies listed above, then I highly recommend American Gangster to you.

","What American Gangster lacked was not action, a better script or competent directing. It had all three of those in spades, plus everything else one needs to create an epic drama in the spirit of Scarface, The Deer Hunter, etc. My only issue was that it tried soooo hard to live up to the great 70's/80's epics that it fell miserably short. It became a sloppy poseur instead of a genuine piece of art.<br/><br/>Now, I don't know who to blame for this (I mean, even the poster of the film is like the classic Scarface poster!) so I won't start naming names. All that needs to be known was that it was obvious. It was cliché and it was sloppy. Very very sloppy.<br/><br/>Hollywood HEAR US!!

"dl_lacy","Null","2","4","30 November 2007"," American Gangster is no Superfly
","Denzel Washington, who has been on a streak of playing bad guys since ""Training Day,"" was a good choice to star as Frank Lucas. However, he knows like I know that the star of ""American Gangster"" is really the legend of Frank Lucas. So instead of choosing to act, Washington just walked through the film. You'd think with the title, ""American Gangster,"" the hero of the film would be Washington as Lucas. However the hero is Russell Crowe as Richie Roberts, the cop that busted him. Although the subject of the film was the rise of a black drug lord, it shifted back and forth to the story of a white cop who becomes a prosecutor, which quickly became tiresome and made the movie clock in at 2 hours and 37 minutes.<br/><br/>Why was it necessary for us to see scenes from Robert's personal life? Especially when Crowe was not interesting as Roberts. Why couldn't we meet him when the real life Lucas met him, which was when Lucas was incarcerated, not outside of a church where he just attended a funeral with his family? The time that it took to tell us about Robert's life could have been used to tell us more about Lucas' life. I learned more about his childhood from the BET series, ""American Gangster,"" than the movie.<br/><br/>This is typical of Hollywood. Whenever it makes a movie about blacks, it has to be told from a white perspective, with a white actor who shares top billing (Crowe), and a white director (Ridley Scott in this case). Do you recall ""Cry Freedom,"" the movie from 20 years ago that starred Washington as Steven Biko, the black activist? It also starred Kevin Kline as Donald Woods, the white South African journalist who befriended him, and who told the story. Two years later, Washington starred in ""Glory,"" about the first company of black soldiers in the Civil War. He won an Oscar for his portrayal of one of them. The company was lead by a white colonel played by Mathew Broderick. Therefore he told the story.<br/><br/>As an African American and aficionado of the black cinema of the 1970s, I must say that it is important that we make our own movies about our subjects, directed by us. 35 years ago, a group of black businessmen financed the movie, ""Superfly,"" directed by Gordon Parks, about a drug dealer who outsmarts the system and everybody else. Although it has the same subject as ""American Gangster,"" ""Superfly"" was criticized for glamorizing the drug dealer when ""American Gangster"" is praised for it.<br/><br/>""American Gangster"" takes place in the same period as ""Superfly"" but director Scott did not do a good job in restoring some locations to the way they looked 30 - 40 years ago. For example, when Washington as Lucas walked out of the Lenox Lounge in one scene, you can see the sign for Jimbo's located two doors away as clear as day. The restaurant has only been there for 5 years. Scott and company should have just covered the sign. The music in ""American Gangster"" was on target with the period, but the film lacked one major thing that ""Superfly"" had, and that's soul."
"Robert_duder","6","2","4","26 November 2007"," A little over hyped and over rated but some impressive developments from a strong script
","When American Gangster released they made it seem like this was this years ""The Departed"" and it featured a strong and talented cast and director and the 'based on a true story' premise. So I did eagerly want to see it and I won't say I was disappointed, I only say that I thought they jumped the gun with all the praise because with some minor stand out moments and performances American Gangster was pretty all around average. The story dragged and was brutally long and despite reviewers and critics saying that it flew by, for me it felt long and too long at that. While the film was an interesting look at two men on two different sides of the law, both outcasts within their own people it just doesn't really appeal to people that might expect something like The Godfather, or other mafia type epics. The film definitely tries to be and feel epic but I don't think it hits the mark. Director Ridley Scott is probably one of the most versatile directors in Hollywood. I don't think you can ever know what to expect from the guy. He can do Sci-Fi, drama, Action, historical Epic and you just don't know how he's going to do it. I think he really set out to make this about the characters and I suppose from that perspective he was very successful.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington used to be one of my favorite actors. Gradually I saw his ego over take his talent and you could barely watch his films without seeing his enormous ego screaming ""I am Denzel."" So I was very pleased to discover a really stirring and moving performance (perhaps Oscar nominated?) by him as underground Drug Kingpin Frank Lucas. Maybe his ego just fits well with Lucas but regardless Washington is cold blooded and ruthless and powerful and yet somehow a sympathetic character. Definitely his best role in years. Opposite him is the amazing Russell Crowe as ethically strong Det. Richie Roberts. Roberts is ethical to a fault and is looked down on by some of his fellow officers but essentially makes him the prime candidate to go after what is fast becoming the largest mob drug lord in the city. Washington and Crowe don't share a lot of screen time and yet have good chemistry playing off of each other. Their characters independently hold the film together and make it interesting enough because they are so different and yet in some ways face the same problems in their respective lives. I'd like to point out other cast members but essentially it's all about Crowe and Washington and no one else really gets to stand out or is given anything to really work with. All the eggs are in two baskets in this case and that might be part of the fault of the film.<br/><br/>The film has it's moments of sheer brutality which are literally jaw dropping and it also has some really intense and smart moments but then it's gummed up by all this middle stuff that just seems to make it drag for it's 2 hour 40 minute running time. Despite being set in the sixties and seventies nothing really sets the time period out with the exception of some clothing and such but I thought the focus on a 'black' gangster who basically takes over the drug running business from The Italians in this time period would be more of a focus. Regardless of how you look at the film it's a stunning example of the talent of Washington and Crowe but unfortunately doesn't go much further than that. Some will enjoy it and others will agree with me that it fits some of the bill but it's just far too long. 6.5/10"

From that moment on the two characters inevitably spiral into each other, indeed, there is no way to avoid the collision of these two forces of nature.<br/><br/>Even as two members of exact opposite races, these men know and understand each other when they finally meet and collaborate.<br/><br/>As far as some of the other dramatized events, we don't know the veracity of these incidents, I think the story was told as truthfully as could possibly be told. There is a lot of irony in this story, and Ridley Scott has a finely tuned idea of how to use this in filmmaking.<br/><br/>I have seen video of the real Richie Roberts, and Russell Crowe does a great job with his looks and mannerisms, as does Denzel Washington with Frank Lucas.<br/><br/>This film is peppered with great character actors who do their jobs wonderfully, especially the character actors of colour. Josh Brolin picks up the mantle of a true American scumbag, Bob Leuci, but the fictionalized portrayal renders a name change for the character, ""Detective Trupo"", not quite ""Prince of the City"". Brolin's character becomes a thorn in the side of both Roberts and Lucas, who both provide sharp sticks up Trupo's fundament when he gets too nosy.<br/><br/>This film portrays the biggest cop-bust of all time when 2/3 of the New York City drug enforcement department was sent to the hoosegow. This is of course history, so it's not really a spoiler. You just have to see how Ridley Scott provides this historical takedown: during the climax of the film it happens from every direction possible.<br/><br/>A lot of research went into this film to make it look and sound exactly right. And the documentary style coupled with peppered flashbacks draws us into the story.<br/><br/>There is an extended version that I have seen a few times that expands some of the more delicate or violent scenes, but the theatrical version provides just about the same amount of information."

Don't get me wrong i wasn't bored while watching the movie, but i wasn't surprised either. And yeah, Russel knows how to work with his favorite surrogate director Ridley Scott. Like a good boy he gives the same kind of epic acting he always does by altering his role in a way that it looks fresh again. Further on Ridley borrows Denzel from uncle Tony to shine as the bad guy. The same was done in Training Day and... yes he won the Oscar. This time no nomination. I think because of the material given the movie just tries to hard to be epic. It doesn't feel epic, it's the true story of a bad-ass gangster, it's a biopic. <br/><br/>The supporting cast was just out there to give the two stars more time to shine. Cuba Gooding Jr. completely wasted in a minor role. Armand Assante as a forced Corleone ripoff and the most annoying Josh Brolin. Love the guy in NCFOM and even the Goonies. Seeing Josh in more mainstream movies is cool, but get a new haircut and shave the mustache. Did he had a mustache in the valley of elah? I don't know. Maybe they had separate roles. But the point is, the same clichés are used. Just like Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven the the supporting cast just doesn't do much. It's all about the billed stars. And then the biggest movie cliché used so many times in the history of mainstream pictures, the part where the one star meets the other star in the movie. It was actually cool in Heat, because that was Pacino's and DeNiro's first for real together on screen time.

"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","4","12","19 November 2007"," One of the year's best!
","I've been wanting to see American Gangster since the moment I saw the trailer, it's good to see a film that actually looks very intelligent and also has a terrific and talented cast. I saw the film today with my mom and we were both just blown away with American Gangster. It is without a doubt one of the year's best films and I guarantee you that this will be on the nomination buzz for the Oscars. First off, we have an original Mafia movie finally, something that hasn't really been touched, an African American who had power and was just put as high as an Italian Mofia boss. I didn't have an idea that someone like Frank Lucas could have the power he had, because of American Gangster, I now have a little more knowledge of history and the crimes in the 70's. Frank Lucas showed what one man with a little determination could rise quickly, but also have to suffer the severe consequences of his actions. Despite how the rise and fall story is used so often, the cast and crew made American Gangster into a real film.<br/><br/>Frank Lucas is an African American man growing in the world of the 70's in America. Drugs are becoming a hot commodity, or at least the good and pure kind of drugs that you can only get from Vietnam. When he hears about this, he heads over there and makes a deal with the drug lord, he manages to bring in 2,000 kilos into the United States! He's now a popular customer there and in America, he's living the high life. He moves his family into a gorgeous mansion, he gets a beautiful Puerto Rican wife, and is respected by most of the community. He's never even suspected of anything, that is until his wife gives him a coat that stands out quite a bit in a crowd, and he is photographed by Detective Richie Roberts. Roberts is now on Lucas's case and has problems of his own, over half of his team is being bribed by drug dealers, and he's under the same pressure to just give into temptation of a bribe.<br/><br/>American Gangster is the best Mofia movie this year, I promise you. It's a fantastic film and has just flawless performances. I wouldn't be surprised if Denzel Washington will be nominated for a best performance award. His performance as Frank was so brilliant, he was scary, yet smooth, unpredictable, yet charismatic. He couldn't have played it better. Russell is riding on the roller coaster of great performances this year, he's not as powerful as Denzel, but he stands great on his own in American Gangster. Ridley Scott, our director, has proved that he can handle the Mofia genre, he handled the film with utter perfection and this is his best film in years. American Gangster actually surpassed my expectations, I definitely do recommend this movie, it's a great one.<br/><br/>10/10"

","The comeback of 70's style movies is in full swing. Maybe 3-D movies will be next. I like the sound track, feel, and pace of the movie. Washington is a OK actor, and the rest of the cast is good. Crowe plays a strong role, but the script seem to typecast Crowe into a flat character. The script is strong, and the shoot out is memorable. Borlin shines playing a dirty cop. A true standout performance. The stages, camera angles, and diolouge is right out a 70's cop show. I liked the movie. I found We Own the Night had a slicker feel and more tension. I would rent Americian Gangster, but buy We Own the Night. 6 out of 10. Good for a Saturday movie night."
"buzznzipp1995","10","3","8","10 November 2007"," Harlem Harlequin...almost
","Denzel Washington and Russell Crow. What a seemingly odd coupled-arrangement for a casting, yet they soared together. I sat and watched the story wind-up as the power Lucas (Washington) had learned and then collected, taking 'Bumpy's' place in the middle of Harlem. He practically lived a sort of gangster's romance novel. Seeing the woman, (Miss Cuba)that drove him wild inside, he had to have her...and he did, for a time. This being a true story, was a real American crime family saga, from a black man that learned from the Italian mob and his former boss. There was a killer cast of characters from Brolin what a superb hard ass cop, to John Ortiz (The Job- 2001, Miami Vice- 2006) who, as his partner was fantastic as a seventies Latino cop. His problems grew and eventually when Crow's character confronted him, he cut and ran and eventually paid...with his life. Sad, you like Ortiz's police officer and rooted for him, yet you knew, that he was going down, almost midway through as new information about him surfaced. It made me angry and ashamed to see him like that. There is an officer that is good and smart and couldn't stay on the outside of trouble. <br/><br/>Crow's character, was on a mission plain and simple, he is dedicated to his work and doing it efficiently and as directly honest as possible. He is hard driving, but someone you could count on if you were an officer needing back-up. I really enjoyed his portrayal as that officer. I also had it in my heart for the casting of Clarence Williams III as 'Bumpy' the Harlem gentleman gangster, who ran Harlem. The rest of the cast shined, right along with Crow and Washington. You could feel the authenticity and purity of their characters playing out their respective roles in this fast climbing and ever faster descending rise to power drama of a drug lord in Harlem. Crow's cop puts his own task-force together, with a handful of hard street wise and very savvy undercover officers. They were not perfect, but they did their job and performed it to the letter, not letting up, until the case was completed. He (Lucas)had a style that led him into the spot that he would fill until his ultimate demise. Denzel was a wonder. Crow was a strong and concrete, believable force in American Gangster. They were a marvel as the mob-man and the motivated cop. Ted Levine, I can't get by without mentioning his brilliant addition to this spectacle in New York blue. Ted played the Commanding Captain to a 'T'. Levine at one point or maybe two looked and seemed to have 'Martin Landau' down cold. Ted looked like him and sounded very close to Landau as well, I laughed out loud, it was smashing, I couldn't help but be amazed by Ted in this. What a positive casting pick for this True Story drama. The final Church scene that came following the 'raids' was haunting, the gospel singing with the police in the streets outside of the church, as the cold burrowed through and the rain fell the gospel singing in the midst of a criminal finally, was something I had not quite seen and felt before-gripping, chills down the spine. The two sitting in the interrogation room, taking information from Frank the gangster, was quite a heart-enthralling event. What I mean in this is that he or rather 'they' Crow and Washington's character had a definite connection to each other that worked and encompassed. <br/><br/>I didn't quite know what I would take away with me, upon viewing the trailer, but I watched a classic story unfold with hammer hitting conviction and concrete reality. There was different events that Lucas attended with boxers like Ali and seeing Sammy along with the celebrity spectators, he saw a lot and as Sammy often sang to a packed audience... ""If you can't do the time,then don't do the crime."" The ending was a perfect one for an ex-gangster with absolutely nothing left, no wife, no money, no family, no friends, no business....not even a ride home...that is if he had one. <br/><br/>That's that....Recommended Highly (****)"

","I am a huge Denzel fan... I really expected more from this film. All I really got was 3 hours of pure boredom. People are posting that this movie is going to be a classic like ""Scarface"" or ""Godfather"", but in my opinion there is no way this movie stacks up to any great classic. This is one of those, you strained to sit through it now it's over throw it away. This movie has no real depth on how things are carried out throughout the movie. There's no real depth to the plot. It's mostly people walking around talking for 3 hours. There's very little action. Very little to keep the audience in the movie besides it's based on a true story. TRUST ME IT'S NOT ANYTHING TO HIT THE BOX OFFICE FOR my recommendation, wait until it comes to DVD or even better yet just wait until they play it on regular TV. Shouldn't be too long before it makes it as a 8pm movie on AMC or USA."
"ashkxii","10","4","13","3 November 2007"," Simply the best movie of the year
","Based on a true story, American Gangster is so far the best movie I have seen since ""the Departed"". Denzel Washington, at his best as usual, teamed up with Russel Crowe who delivered an Oscar-worthy performance. Interestingly, the supporting cast were all phenomenal specially Armand Assante, who played the Italian mob. Like ""the Departed"" did for Martin Scorsese, this movie might bring Oscar to Ridley Scott who has three Academy Award nominations for the best director (Thelma and Louise, the Gladiator, and Black Hawk Down) under his belt. The only problem is that the theme of the movie is similar to ""Departed"" and it is unprecedented that the same type of genre wins two-year in a row. The same happened to ""Babel"" which in my opinion was very close if not better than the Academy-Award-winner ""Crash"" but came one year after and did not win although nominated for several Oscars. Unlike ""Scarface"" and ""God Father Trilogy"", it does not contain lots of action scenes and gun shots but it is far more than that. It is a well-depicted tale of a loyal protégé who became one of the most successful heroin dealers in the US and a devoted NARC who went after him despite of the odds fighting the corrupt NY police system. The bottom line is, this movie will be nominated for multiple Oscars this year and do not be surprised if Denzel or Russell get there second golden statue. This movie is great, skillfully directed, perfectly performed, and simply is the best movie of the year."

"SimonHeide","2","2","5","19 January 2008"," huge disappointment
","I had really been looking forward to seeing this movie. Ridley Scott is one of a kind and Denzel Washington and Russel Crowe usually burn pretty much through. Still the movie was a big let down; it's a story told a million times. The story was plain and quite straight forward, very similar to other gangster movies in some respects. Many gangster movies are pretty much like this: you follow the upcoming gangster and see him make it to the top. The reason why he makes it to the top of the food chain is different from movie to movie but it has almost always to do with cruelty; scarface, untouchables and goodfellas to mention a few. Frank Lucas has that ability too but on top of that he seems like a fair guy who has a philosophy that dictates that he never shall attract attention to himself by dressing up for instance. And it also seems like he has adopted his mentors (Bumpy) behavior of giving out food on thanks giving thereby making him less prone to envy and hatred (he must have been calculating doing this or else he is a hypocrite) . And then he has the joker above them all; he skips all the middle men and gets his drugs straight from the fields in Vietnam. The Blue Magic..<br/><br/>We shift between Frank Lucas as the before mentioned gangster and the honest hardworking cop Richie Roberts who has difficulties both in his private life as well as in his professional career. He is simply to honest (reminded me of Serpico) for his fellow cops. He gets assigned to a special drug enforcement unit and from the very beginning we assume that the two are gonna meet. The development of the story is very slow. There are some turning points in it that I didn't get at all. How did Frank, as a driver, get to be the top guy? Near the end Lucas and Roberts becomes friends which maybe isn't exactly odd but still you don't see how it came to be that way so you just have to guess. The thing that bothered me the most was, that it was told in a very uninvolved way.<br/><br/>If you are totally new to the genre of gangster movies it might be a good one to start with since it has so many elements from previous movies incorporated but if you are familiar with the genre stay away. Really!<br/><br/>regards Simon<br/><br/>Ps. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review. If not consider the possibility of a lobbyist.

"DICK STEEL","9","2","5","6 January 2008"," A Nutshell Review: American Gangster
","Ridley Scott's American Gangster has many similar parallels to Derek Yee's Protégé, in that it's a story about the scourge of drugs, and each containing the respective insights into the entire production, processing and distribution processes, stemming again from material sources in South East Asia. While the latter is a fictional account, American Gangster is based on the true story of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), the black drug lord whose meteoric rise to power was deemed incredulous because of race and colour, and the story of the detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) whose team had broken through the complex web of mon dealings to take down the gangsters, as well as their corrupt own.<br/><br/>This epic movie, clocking in at slightly more than 2.5 hours, takes its time to tell the respective stories, which on their own could be standalone equivalents, no doubt boosted by the powerhouse performances by award winning actors Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, who is into his third collaboration with Ridley after movies like Gladiator and A Good Year. While the story may seem straight-forward without any spectacular twists and turns, it's based solely on the credible performances as well as the re-creation of the late 60s-early 70s environment of New York, where blatant corruption seemed to be the norm of the day.<br/><br/>Crowe's Richie perhaps have the lesser screen time of the two, like an Elliot Ness equivalent in being the incorruptible cop in a corrupt force, whose reputation of turning in a million dollars instead of pocketing it, preceded him. This made him an automatic choice in creating his own squad of Untouchables, assembling a team of similarly principled men to work outside the system, to go after the big fish. While his boy scout character might seem boring, here's where the script by Steven Zaillian adds a little flavour in throwing in shades of grey. While Richie is honest to his job, a little examination into his private life has him being quite the ladies' man, as well as struggling with his estranged wife to fight for custody of their child.<br/><br/>Washington's Frank Lucas on the other hand, had the meat, given after all the movie is about the crime lord. The first hour charted his rise and it is the buildup that makes this movie so compelling as it tapers toward the inevitable finale, as you discover how deep the rot of corruption is, and having links to the Vietnam War and the army. His ""Blue Magic"" heroin product sells for half the price and double the potency as middlemen are cut off, and shipment is relatively free - I'd dare say this is ingenious, and makes a monkey out of the authorities.<br/><br/>And it is his segment that proved to be more interesting of the two - OK, so everyone would like to know how he did what he did, versus a straight cop's quest to putting away those involved with the entire business. There were many fine points made especially for those who are in the business of being crooked. If you notice all the high profile corporate fraud cases, most are done in because money corrupts one into an opulent lifestyle, bringing uncalled for attention to oneself. Here, Lucas' principle is similar, to keep a low profile, but alas everyone has their moment of oversight and carelessness.<br/><br/>To continue my admiration of the guy's work ethics, and probably because of the nature of the business, no one is trusted except for family. I guess a crime family is easier to raise since blood is supposedly more trustworthy than random hired hands. While we see Richie's assembly of a few good men for his cause of righteousness, we also witness the creation of a mob family from scratch, but as we all know, time will tell if the kinks within the family can be worked out, or go against the ruler with an iron fist. Scott somehow seemed to emphasize family for a fair bit, with periodic shots for comparison put side by side for the audience to form their conclusions.<br/><br/>Don't be expecting any major scenes of killing, choosing instead to be based on powerful dialogue as the gun battles here are few and far between, usually over as quickly as they start because Frank Lucas doens't fall into the usual fictional villains' lapse into monologues. The action sequences might be few, but they are sure pack their punch despite their short duration. Everything's paced rather nicely, and I particularly enjoyed the entire buildup, though the ending felt a little rushed because there are little that could be elaborated at that point. Fans of Denzel and Russell who want to see these two strong actors share the same screen/scene, will be a tad disappointed, as they do so only toward the finale, lasting no more than 10 minutes, but those turn out to be the gem they were, so savour every moment of it properly.<br/><br/>The second mobster movie this week, it's a difficult toss up between Ridley Scott's American Gangster and David Cronenberg's Eastern PRomises. If you're tired of blood and gore with a twist, and would prefer something based on a true story told in a more straightforward manner, then American Gangster will be your choice. IF I may say, there's nothing really spectacular about the plot, but it works, thanks to Ridley Scott's confident direction, and the A-plus performances by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe."
"futures-1","Null","2","5","23 November 2007"," Everyone was on vacation here
","Just a quick note: I was loaned my first (and last) pirated copy of a film  THIS film. Why would ANYONE who loves films a) want to ever again see a poorly digitized, poorly formatted version of an Art form they claim to love and respect, and b) want to rip off the people who create what you claim you want to see? Okay, with THAT said, Russell Crowe, Denzel Washington, Ruby Lee, and Armand Assante lead this true 1970's story of police corruption and the escalation of drugs in New York. Think ""Serpico"" mixed with ""The French Connection"" mixed with ""Superfly"". Seriously. I was a little disappointed in Washington, who, more than anything, simply did his ""Denzel"" routine in a different outfit. He smeared too much of his patented ""proud black man deserving respect"" routine over what was, let's face it, a sleazy drug dealer and serial killer. (See ""Glory"" or ""Malcolm X"" if that's what you want, see ""Training Day"" if you want to see him stretch beyond his habits.) He was poorly cast in ""American Gangster"", and did not have the push to reach beyond what he can do in his sleep. As I think about it, Crowe - and just about everyone - was cast and then given a pass to do what they've done before and before and seemed satisfied with that. The story, even with it having a basis of fact to it, was not unique within the genre. Yes, it was good suspense drama, with strong dosages of violence, nudity, drug use, etc., and for some, on some evening, this will be enough. One viewing is enough for me. Even Ridley Scott, who directed it, seemed on vacation. The set and costume designers seemed to have worked the hardest of anyone."
"yarnickjiang","7","3","10","3 November 2007"," Why glorify a drug-lord?
","This film has all the ingredients for a spectacular project; Interesting story,big actors,good budget but it just doesn't utilise these ingredients effectively. The story is epic, a progressive look at a man's rise and fall in the drug world, with settings from the slums of Harlem to the jungles of Vietnam. There are moments of excitement but very few, and the whole theme is too formulaic, echoing films like 'Blow' and the 'Godfather'. Drawing on the synopsis, you could make an accurate prediction of all the main events in the film. The 'Frank Lucas' character seems to mirror Pacino's 'Corleone', as the 'family man','the silent introvert thinker' and 'the calm gangster prone to the occasional act of extreme violence'. In addition, although Washington pulls a great performance, he fails to portray Lucas. Lucas was a violent drug-lord who killed thousands with his product, and still boasts his deeds to this day(youtube.com). Washington portrays an ethical figure with strong family values trying to live the 'american dream' while corrupt cops and gangsters try to stop him. In reality, he should be classified in the same category as the other scum in the film, since his actions were just as, if not more, unsavoury. In my opinion, 'Frank Lucas' is not portrayed in this film, Denzel plays himself and it's difficult to hate a sincere, well spoken, handsome gentleman. Denzel doesn't even put on the strong southern accent which Lucas has. If this film was not based on a real character, then I would rate it as a mediocre gangster movie elevated by grand performances from the front men. But since Washington is supposed to portray an arrogant, vulgar drug-lord, my valuation is lower. In the future, it would be no surprise if films depicting Hitler as the misunderstood leader, or Charles Manson as a fallen icon, are released."

","It's been a while since I saw a movie that good - at least in that column of genres. I want to let you know that all these rumors like ""just another mediocre movie"" are too subjectively driven.<br/><br/>The trailer was cut to together very professional, I grant, so you'll watch American Gangster having high expectations to it. So did I. Still, I have not been disappointed. My expectations have even been overshot. The atmosphere catches you beginning with the first minutes and keeps you in your seat tight until the end (for those who after around 150 minutes runtime still cant get enough, wait until the credits played through - you will be rewarded with a few extra frames). Historically, it is kept close to the happenings; just extended by some scenes / additional content for the big screen which is totally legitimate to me.<br/><br/>American Gangster gives you an insight view of the personal life of the gangster Frank Lucas, the way he dealt with his family and his relationship with Eva - Denzel, a real gentleman. During the movie he develops a very nice and human character which is yet to be unsettled big from time to time. Hence, the movie was done the right way. Actors fit perfectly to the person they embody: Denzel was simply great, Crowe, of course, too. I had some trouble accepting Crowe as a cop (after watching 3:10 to Juma recently), which however abated after a time. The way the setting of the 1970's was reproduced is incredible: Details everywhere - just mind-blowing. If there was the possibility to sense this movie more intense I wouldn't hesitate to do so. Additionally, I want to point at the sound: it was awesome! I am sort of a person only able to enjoy movies entirely when they are set to music on a high standard which is necessary to really develop a comprehensive atmosphere.<br/><br/>Since there is nothing left to say (from my end at least), I hope this comment was helpful to those who are not sure about which title to choose the next time going to the movies. If you feel addressed, I recommend to watch American Gangster which truly allows you to immerse into the 70's of Harlem."

And by the way the film editing was great too. <br/><br/>The acting was fantastic, Denzel Washington is really a bad ass guy, but deep inside he is a good hearted family man, showing that when dealing with his wife, his brothers and his mother, he was really great, however Russel Crowe was controlled by the role he played, this role is a recipe for a great supporting role; being a confused cop who can't focus on his job because of his family; but I don't think Russel Crowe was prepared enough for supporting roles, nonetheless he did a very fine job.<br/><br/>Saying that I don't think the actors performances will get Oscar nominations, instead I think two persons in particular could get nominations:<br/><br/>Steven Zaillian: for his sharp and smart script. And of course Ridley Scott for this great achievement.<br/><br/>Although the drug matter has become a usual subject lately but Ridley Scott can always come up with something new about every movie he direct.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I know we've seen all of this before, rise and fall of the American gangsters, it was done beautifully and seen through the lens of Martin Scorsese in Goodfellas and the lens of Brian De Palma in Scarface, but what's great about American Gangster, is that now we get to look at it through the lens of Ridley Scott, and what a great look it is.<br/><br/>What's great about American Gangster is that it is different to the two movies it has the biggest connections, again, Goodfellas and Scarface. American Gangster manages to stay away from pretty much everything you would expect, and gives you a fresh, new perspective into some very interesting leading characters, Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts, played brilliantly, as one would expect from such greats of greats, Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, but more on their performances later.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott has always been an interesting director, and this reviewer has always found his work interesting. I certainly had high expectations with this movie, and though those particular expectations were not met, I was pleased by a whole different film I had no idea I was about to watch.<br/><br/>With a movie like this, I was sort of expecting a fun gangster movie, most gangster movies are fun, we all know that, it was fun to see Joe Pesci be an unpredictable pig of a wise guy, it was fun to watch Al Pacino sprouting all those four letter words, shooting and introducing us to his ""little friend"". With a gangster movie, you expect that sort of thing, but Ridley Scott gave this material a whole new spin, he turned into a gritty, 70s type drama, with real characters, historically significant circumstances, and a fantastic realistic meets Hollywood approach. It was fun but in a different, unexpected way.<br/><br/>You can definitely feel the touch of the European style of directing that has always made Ridley Scott an interesting director. His direction is sober, straightforward, and rather innovative for the genre, this film does not look like any gangster movie, no operatic feeling like The Godfather, no kitsch like material like in Scarface, and no rhythmic editing and skillful sequence shots like Goodfellas, this is a unique movie in terms of style and narrative.<br/><br/>The story is not about a flashy and dangerously like-able gangster and the ""untouchable"" goody good cop out to catch him, the story is much deeper, dealing with US involvement in Vietnam, corruption on law enforcement agencies, and the dramas of imperfect men and women caught in all this turmoil.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Harris Savides is very good, the film has a great look, it heathens the gritty scenarios sometimes portrayed in the film with a blurry feeling that enhances the feeling of the movie. The editing by Scott's old ally Pietro Scalia is flawless as one could expect from such a consummated editor, and the subtle attention to detail in the art department is great. Along with a realistic costume design by Janty Yates.<br/><br/>The film is not a biopic of Frank Lucas, or of Richie Roberts, it's about the clashing of these two men, and that could not have been orchestrated better by Scott and Brian Grazer the producer, for getting both Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe to meet face to face on an acting duet that slowly, patiently builds up to a great showdown. It can be compared with Michael Mann's crime epic Heat, and it's Pacino/De Niro showdown. Both Denzel and Washington carry the movie with amazing skill, it's a thrill to follow both story lines because of the two actors that carry them, developing the characters into rich, detailed personifications of the real men behind the story.<br/><br/>The supporting cast of numerous familiar faces such as Carla Gugino, Armand Assante, Ted Levine, Joe Morton, Josh Brolin, Ric Young, Cuba Gooding Jr. and the surprising Ruby Dee in an Oscar nominated Supporting Performance, they all make the canvass of the movie feel even richer.<br/><br/>Now, this movie has been played down for not being memorable and exciting as other gangster films, but that detachment from classic gangster movies is what makes it exciting, cause it's not familiar territory, just as Goodfellas was great for being different from The Godfather, American Gangster is great for being different to gangster movies of it's sort, and taking us to new, unexplored territory.<br/><br/>Big congratulations to Ridley Scott for proving he is still a master of the craft, and for the two male leads, Denzel and Crowe, for giving us great performances. This American Gangster is one big American Classic."

","""American Gangster"" tells the story of a heroin dealer named Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) who inherits a crime empire from his famous boss Bumpy Johnson. He is smooth and very friendly on the outside, yet adhering to ruthless business tactics on the inside.<br/><br/>The movie deals with Lucas doing it all and doing it very well indeed. The New York drug trade is covered completely by him as he sells his stuff at higher purity and lower cost than anyone else. He manages to get in the drugs inside the coffins of American casualties, which is apparently based on fact. It's all very interesting how he turns the business practises around.<br/><br/>Lucas is not the quintessential gangster and sports absolutely no rings on his fingers, no scantily clad women lounging in his pad and loud cars. Nope, he is the quiet demure businessman with a very low key approach. He is even married. And all that makes it very difficult for the authorities to figure out who he is.<br/><br/>Lucas's stubborn antagonist is a police detective named Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe). He does a very bad thing that gets him on the bad side of the rest of the officers in his police department. He finds $1 million in drug money and turns it in. The rest of the boys in blue are mad as hell because they expected it to be shared out.<br/><br/>Roberts doggedly pursues Lucas while maintaining his ethical standards. He carefully builds up his case against Lucas ensuring an airtight offencive. He vows to bring down Frank Lucas and succeeds. When Lucas is caught he is worth more than $150 million but manages to reduce his sentence by cutting a deal to expose three-quarters of the NYPD narcotics officers as corrupt.<br/><br/>Nobody especially the police like what is going on. It's not good for their living. They all get into Roberts's way.<br/><br/>This is a deeply engrossing story that flows very smoothly and develops the characters accordingly.

","Ridley Scott does like to tackle a variety of genres and topics, from classic sci-fi to religious epics. Now he has put the eternal battle for drug enforcement under his belt also. I'm just waiting for him to tackle the important subject of fluffy unicorns that shoot rainbows...Hollywood, make it happen. Based on the true story, gangster Frank Lucas monopolises the drug trafficking scene in New York City. Making both friends and enemies. Hot behind his tail though is detective Richie Roberts who is cracking down on the city's drug war. How do you make such a formulaic film so compelling you might ask? You bring in the big acting guns. Oh yes! Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. Washington in particular gives a commanding performance where he owns every scene. Whether it be a calm demeanour or full on rage mode, you don't mess with Frank Lucas. Crowe is absolutely fine, but feels completely underpowered when comparing to Washington's performance. It's not his fault, he is just up against a powerhouse. Supporting cast, again, just didn't make much of an impact. The story was involving for the most part, felt very realistic. Fantastic drug heist shootout during the third act. Scott's artistic flair makes even the most basic of scenes look exciting. The biggest negative, and is unfortunately a massive deal, is the first hour. It is such a drag and is completely uninteresting. It's either too quick or too slow, never perfectly balanced. Stuff happens to which I just don't care. As soon as Roberts is on Lucas' case is when the film gets going. Also the personal aspects to Roberts' life does not develop him as a character and feel unnecessary. It's a long runtime and it does feel like it occasionally, but once the plot gets going it is rather engrossing and does host one of Washington's better performances. I could listen to him say ""My Man!"" everyday."

","After his mentor is killed, ""Frank Lucas"" (Denzel Washington) decides to assume his former boss' place as the key drug dealer in Harlem. However, there are other drug lords who have also been waiting for this opportunity and they have decided to move into this territory as well. Because of that Frank takes a huge gamble and, rather than dealing with established middle men for his heroin, decides to procure his product directly from an original source-Thailand. This results in his being able to obtain pure heroin and cut it up to his own standards which happens to be of a better quality and for a cheaper price than anybody else can match in New York. Needless to say, this increases his customer base at the expense of the Mafia. And that doesn't make them very happy. It also increases his visibility to various law enforcement agencies for completely different reasons. Some want him off the streets while those more corrupt want to share in the profits. Regardless, a lot of people suddenly become interested in him and that means trouble-for everyone. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this is one of the better drug-related movies out there with Denzel Washington performing in a very excellent manner. Russell Crowe (as ""Detective Richie Roberts"") also performs well but make no mistake-this is Denzel Washington's movie all the way. In any case, I enjoyed this movie and have rated it accordingly. Definitely above average."

","""American Gangster"" from 2007 purports to be the story of drug lord Frank Lucas. My understanding is that it's about 1 percent accurate. However, the film, though long, is an excellent study of pervasive corruption.<br/><br/>The cast includes Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Josh Brolin, Ruby Dee, and Ted Levine (from Monk).<br/><br/>Washington plays Frank Lucas, a criminal who is determined to make it big in the drug trade. He flies to Thailand and arranges to have 100% heroin shipped to him, cutting out the middleman, and also putting the Mafia out of business. He calls the heroin ""Blue Magic.""<br/><br/>He brings his family up from the south and has them working for him in various fronts - auto shop, dry cleaner, etc., but what they're doing is selling heroin.<br/><br/>There is some discrepancy about how the heroin was shipped. In the film, it is as Lucas himself said, false bottoms in the coffins of dead soldiers. But someone else said it was in furniture. <br/><br/>Lucas has so many cops on the take -- he's involved three-quarters of the narcotics squad, the main cop being Detective Trupo (Brolin), a real greedy guts.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the film, we see the rise of Lucas and on the other side, how a special force was assembled to stop the sale of a drug called Blue Magic, which is Lucas' drug. The lead officer is Richie Roberts, who, with his partner, found $1 million in a drug bust. <br/><br/>When Roberts wants to turn the money over to the evidence room, his partner tells him that if he does that, no one will work with him - they'll think he can't be trusted and will report them. Unreal. But Richie turns in the money and is given the management of the new force and told to choose only people he can trust. Roberts ultimately passed the bar exam and became an attorney.<br/><br/>The real Roberts criticized Washington's portrayal of Lucas, saying he came off as ""almost noble."" Not to me he didn't. Roberts says that he was vicious, violent, illiterate. It's true that Washington did not play Lucas as illiterate. But in depicting his violence and viciousness, not acting overtly violent works better on film. Washington throughout seems reserved, somewhat soft-spoken, so that when he loses his temper, it's terrifying.<br/><br/>Though long, ""American Gangster"" doesn't really feel long and is an absorbing film with interesting character studies. Dirty, corrupt cops are all over TV and movies. I have a feeling they may be all over our police departments too."

Big kudos for Cinematography too.<br/><br/>The story of heroin in Harlem is a dirty one, and the way Scott infuses horrible snapshots of the victims of this evil substance is just plain masterful. Not too much, not too little, just enough. The same is true for the more violent scenes.

"luke-a-mcgowan","9","1","2","21 July 2015"," These similarities and differences make the meeting between the two characters far more satisfying than Heat could ever be
","As crime epics go, American Gangster is fairly pedestrian but also one of the more enjoyable that I've ever seen. A double-whammy of this and Thelma & Louise has done a great deal for my faith in Ridley Scott's direction.<br/><br/>This three hour film rarely drags after the first 20 minutes, which is a big achievement in both scripting and editing. The film balances the stories of two compelling men - African American gangster Frank Lucas, and the honest cop trying to catch him, Richie Roberts. Lucas, the respectable, intelligent crime lord is portrayed adequately by Denzel Washington. He never captures the Al Pacino ruthlessness or the Jack Nicholson cockiness, but he's still a compelling character to watch and even root for at times. Russell Crowe is very reminiscent of his Bud White LA Confidential days, but it was great then and even better here. He is less of a thug and has a few moments of nerves and timidity that give his character a humanity rarely seen in Crowe performances. The thing I loved about the film was how similar and different Lucas and Roberts are. They both hate corrupt cops and strive for integrity in their dealings, while taking hugely unorthodox actions to succeed. Meanwhile, compare the two - Lucas is a ""bad guy"" who loves his mother, goes to church and cares for his family above all else. Roberts is the ""good guy"", but he's engaged in a bitter divorce because of his infidelity, and never has time for his son. These similarities and differences make the meeting between the two far more satisfying than Heat could ever be.<br/><br/>In the supporting cast, Josh Brolin is terrific as Detective Trupo, managing to be a terrific antagonist for both Lucas and Roberts. Ruby Dee is also excellent in a small part - she blusters and flails in her loving attempts to connect with a son whose world she can never fully understand. There's a level of honesty and generosity to her performance that makes me commend her Academy Award nomination, even if her limited screen time would have made me uncomfortable voting for her for a win.<br/><br/>American Gangster is beautifully scripted as well, which is vital for setting it apart from its many counterparts. Of the many beautifully constructed scenes, Richie's divorce proceedings and Carla Gugino's rant is probably the film's highlight. It gives both a perspective of how Laurie sees her husband and how Roberts sees himself, all whilst giving some of the film's best quotes and a blistering dramatic moment all in one. A great mixture of words and delivery is always necessary for a great film, and American Gangster never disappoints on that front.<br/><br/>It may be a long burn, but American Gangster is very satisfying to complete, far more so than Heat or the Godfather Part II, and I really recommend that you check it out."

","Compared to other movies by Scott, I believe this movie does not receive the credit it deserves. First of all, the movie features fantastic acting all around from Crowe, Washington, Brolin, and company. What I liked the most, however, was how the movie was directed. Ridley Scott's direction and the camera work is absolutely fantastic. I do not know how to describe it in words, but just the way each scene is portrayed through the lens makes the movie feel that much more lively and exciting. The running time is admittedly long, but I think most, if not all, would not mind that. Time will fly as you watch this modern crime classic."

","Excellent movie on all counts, a crime epic telling the early 1970's rise to power of Harlem drug kingpin Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) alongside detective Ritchie Roberts (Russell Crowe), the N.Y cop trying to nail him. I liked how both of these men followed moral codes, just on different sides.<br/><br/>Directed by Ridley Scott, it's pretty much essential crime movie viewing, reminding me of 'Scarface' and up there with 'The Departed, Casino, Goodfellas, Carlito's Way, The Godfather, and Blow.' The story is well put together and absorbing although I'll admit to never being completely swept away, maybe because it didn't seem all that original. Still it's filled with atmosphere, style, a clever (interesting) plot. It's gritty, violent -but probably not as much as you'd expect, with excellent performances from Washington & Crowe.<br/><br/>The cast is also a veritable who's-who and definitely part of the fun in seeing who will turn up next. (Armand Assante, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Common, Cuba Gooding Jr.,Idris Elba, Josh Brolin, Norman Reedus) <br/><br/>There are a couple of brilliant scenes that definitely stand out here; Denzel walking up to Idris Elba in the middle of a busy street and showing all of Harlem who's in charge now, in a very violent and shocking way. Another favourite would be Crowe (and backup) waiting outside Sunday church for Denzel, its all very civil and beautifully shot. The final big bust is also awesome, tense, violent and chaotic. 4/20/15"

Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is a rough and tumble honest cop who tracks down the source for the heroine which killed his partner. Meanwhile Lucas faces against mob boss Dominic Cattano (Armand Assante) and Trupo.<br/><br/>It's a vast interconnected crime drama with deep complex well-written characters played by some of the best actors around. It's gritty and dark with good flashes of the Ridley Scott style. It references the French Connection. It doesn't have quite the immediate realism of the documentary style movie.

","American Gangster stars Denzel Washington as a crime lord Frank Lucas, and Russell Crowe as honest cop Richie Roberts. As the film opens Frank Roberts, a long time driver and confidant to a black New York Mob boss takes over the operation as the then boss dies unexpectedly. At that time, Frank was dealing with the New York Italian crime family serving as a middle-man in the distribution of a cut rate product (Heroine). Frank has an epiphany one day watching television, hearing of the drug problems prevalent amongst U.S. Soldiers serving in Viet Nam and Thailand. He enlists the help of a cousin (a soldier) stationed in Viet Nam to contact the Heroine supplier directly, hence cutting out the middle man (Italian mob). Quickly becoming the consummate businessman, enforcing a strict code of ethics and honesty and loyalty with-in the organization. Employing family he employs a no room for errors style of doing business. Richie Roberts is an anomaly, an honest cop swimming alone in a sea of corruption. He is quickly alienated by fellow officers when he turns over almost a million dollars he finds in the process of a bust. An law-abiding cop, he is soon enlisted by a federal drug task force to fight crime in the city. Meanwhile, the human side, his wife sues Richie for custody of his son. The reason, absenteeism. Too much time fighting crime, a dilemma for an honest man. Ultimately he accepts the position and leads the task force soliciting the help of other honest cops, the battle begins.<br/><br/>This films theme; supply and demand, buying direct, cutting out the middleman and selling a superior product at discounted prices. Even in the world of drugs and thugs the lesson holds true, now and then. The film employs a variety of techniques successfully. Including; panoramic views of the city, and close up shots of action. Including direct and indirect sounds; trains, horns, steam emanating from the streets, and one that stood out in my mind. The sound of gas slowly poured it on a lost soul...the spark of a lighter...the sound of gas igniting...poof! Followed by a volley ofshots putting his victim to rest.

","Based on a true story. In the 60's and 70's(completely believably recreated, meticulous as every other aspect of the production, and the music fits period and mood alike), Harlem-resident(and still proud) Frank Lucas(Washington, suave, yet when his temper gets a hold of him, terrifying) wants to take over his late employers drug empire... and expand it, importing heroin directly from the Far East. This chronicles his rise, and gives equal screen time to the attempts of Richie Roberts(Crowe, confident and honest, with a weak spot for his kid) to find(he's smart about hiding what he's doing) and apprehend him. This is gritty and doesn't pull its punches - whilst clearly admiring(even if not condoning) Denzel, it never shies away from showing him break bones and faces, there is racism from both sides(or, er, colors), and some of the cops are shown to also be corrupt. It feels visceral, and is immensely realistic. The pace is fast throughout(and one or two bits have gripping tension), and scenes never go on for too long - heck, a lot of the time, it'll go to a new geographical place, and much of this subverts your expectations(clearly showing how recent it is). Mood is set swiftly, and can change in an instant. The humor works. All of the acting from this ensemble cast is great(create a drinking game, take a shot every time you recognize a talent... or do a trivia-based one, see how many of them you can name), and even with the many characters, not only do they all feel genuine, like they'd exist outside of fiction, you don't have trouble remembering who wants what or why(it juggles them all well). Now, this is clearly done with a love for the subgenre - however, it doesn't quite live up to the likes of Heat, Goodfellas, Godfather and Scarface, and, in fact, feels slightly derivative of those classics, taking at least one event from each(and then not doing it better, only almost as well). There is a lot of strong language, some brutal, graphic, disturbing violence, a little sexuality and full female nudity in this. The DVD comes with an interesting, informational commentary by Ridley Scott and writer Steven Zaillian for the theatrical cut, and both that version and the unrated Director's Cut(that adds 18 minutes, and thus runs 2 hours and 41 minutes sans credits, or 7 and a half minutes more with), which I suggest you go for if you aren't scared off by the running time(don't worry, it keeps you watching) - not that it's short without it(it's not a completely different viewing, it's just even more of a good thing). I recommend this to any fan of biographies, crime-dramas and/or fans of those involved in making it. 8/10"
"thekyles99","6","1","2","5 November 2012"," Great true story with little fabrication!!
","Personally i think that director Marty Scorcese is the king of this genre however will have to admit that Ridley Scott did a fine job here, alleviating from his usual sci-fi genre that he also directs so well. American Gangster is the rags to riches story of former drug king pen during the 70's Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington). After being a driver for 15 years for then Harlem king pin Bumpy Johnson (Clarence Williams III) Bumpy dies leaving Lucas to take over his business . In a rather ballsy movie, he decides to eliminate the middle man (the mob) and buy the drugs from the war torn country of Vietnam himself. Now i personally have watched a load of films on drug trade and trafficking, usually finding a majority of them quite cool and somewhat fascinating, however there is nothing cool or fascinating about creating false bottoms and using the coffins of dead soldiers returning home from that dreadful war as ways of getting his product (heroin) into the U.S. in fact that was despicable. The other half of this tale comes to us in the form of broken down do gooder detective Ritchie Roberts (Russell Crowe) A cop who has, aside from a failed marriage, a bad time with his fellow officers after Roberts searches an abandoned vehicle and finding no less then 1 million in cash stowed away in it's trunk turns it in to his precinct as it was 'The decent thing to do' <br/><br/>Robert's upon hearing smidgeons of information about the goings on of Frank Lucas decides to team up with a few of his fellow officers that he can still depend on to spend the rest of the film doing surveillance, wire taps etc to bring Lucas's drug empire to a halt. After watching this film i decided to research a little as i usually do during a real life event flick as to see how much was shinola. From what i read it seems that Scott's team did a pretty good job depicting the events around these two individuals lives however there is of coarse the usual fabrications...this is Hollywood remember? I enjoyed American Gangster immensely and think it deserves to be up on the movie shelf right alongside movies that are already there Goodfellas, The Godfather trilogy and Scarface."

I could have forgiven this, but the movie did a poor job of setting up the story. All of a sudden this guy decides to become a big time drug lord flying to Thailand to better the business. Why? Where'd that come from? Hm, the boss died so I think I'm going to do business with deadly Thai heroin suppliers cuz, well, just cuz. I mean, I know its based on a true story, and there were probably some plausible reasons behind his progression as drug kingpin, but I guess with all of the mimicking of Blow, I expected that part of the story to develop as well as it did in Blow.

It is interesting that while watching the movie i wanted Frank Lucas not to be catch by the cops although he poisoned people with drugs and caused their deaths. It can be said that the mixture of ex-boss mafia style and the Italian's succeeded until catching. If loyalty of Frank's relatives would be as strong as the Italian's ones the ending would be so different.

","Ridley Scott's 'American Gangster' does exactly what it says on the tin: it's the tale of the rise and inevitable fall of a New York crime lord. Based on a true story, it's original part is the fact that its villain was a suave African American who out-manoeuvred the mafia; the film is also the story of the rare honest cop who brought him to justice. There are some very familiar elements here: in spite of the different racial background, one could argue that 'Goodfellas' is one inspiration for this move, while the use of 'Across 110th Street' on the soundtrack is depressingly predictable (even though I like the song!). I also found the start of this movie a little confusing and uninvolving. But Scott is an experienced hand when it comes to mainstream but classy entertainment, and while the film's later part offers relatively few surprises, its unarguably gripping, and makes you want to know more about the real life of its protagonist."

Unfortunately, his greatness is tied up in exporting pure heroin from Vietnam and selling it. He is a murderer, a liar, and every way a criminal. He is charming on the outside and deadly on the inside. There is no way that a thinking person could admire him. If his vendetta and his business were directed only at bad guys, we might think that it is OK. But he kills indiscriminately, many dying as innocent victims. Russell Crowe's prosecutor is determined and insightful. He is himself a loner (a role Crowe does well at in many films), but he must butt heads all the way along. He has committed a ""crime."" He has found and returned thousands of dollars in drug money found on a case. He is seen as a bit of an idiot and hence not on of ""the guys."" Everything plays out well. Two masterful actors doing what they do best. I think my most memorable scene is the one where they come upon the poppy fields in Vietnam where this stuff is being cooked and dried. It would be like going to SonyCorp or some big Asian business; but this is a factory used to make one of the most destructive substances.

Due to making sure that it is 100% pure,he is able to make sure that due to supplying himself,he is able to sell the drugs cheaper than anyone else and become the most successful gangster due to him being the only one selling 100% pure heroin.Lucas becomes so powerful,that he is able to bribe everyone from cops to people on the street,and whilst Lucas is living the high life,undercover police officer Richie Roberts (who is strongly disliked by the rest of the department,due to returning a ""lost"" million dollars.)And even though he has almost everyone against him,Roberts is doing everything he can to to stake out for as long as possible,in order to find out who is cutting the drugs(although he has no idea that the man who is running the cutting business,is the same man who is bringing the drugs into the city)<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>The screenplay by Steven Zaillia moves at an amazing pace,making the two hour and fifty minute unrated extended cut feeling as if it is a ninety minute movie!,with the scenes where Roberts is doing everything he can just to get a quick snap of a guys face given an excellent urgent feel,and Lucases rise to power is has a very tidy look,with a very dirty undertone that completely suits his world.The strange thing about the film is even with a very big running time,most of the supporting characters are not given the dept that they deserve and are sadly over-looked (with Nicky Barnes being one of the main ones).An impressive thing with the film is the grading,which gives it a fantastic 70s gritty look.<br/><br/>Whist Washington gives a very good performance as Lucas,the makes it seem that he is an unbreakable brick wall,Russel Crowe easily gives the best performance of the film as Roberts,with his investigating style feeling oddly similar to his role in State of Play,and even though Roberts has some very big flaws (such as having more interest in the case,instead of his wife and kids)there is enough determination with the character,the it is very tough not to be supportive of him during the gripping stake outs and investigations,which are the highlights of the film.

The gangster story bemoans the corruption of the American Dream. It shows individual initiative through illegal means, a corrupt, paranoid community and a success that is defined only through wealth.<br/><br/>The gangster genre is really a form of crime story, and when you write one you need to be very aware of this larger context and deeper theme. It is all about how an individual succeeds in American society. Knowing this allows you to tell a larger tale. And it prevents the audience from distancing themselves from your story by saying, ""Oh, that's just a bunch of foreigners killing each other in some pocket on American soil."" Writer Steve Zaillian knows this larger context, which is why he can justifiably call this story of a black drug lord American Gangster. True to the form, he uses the story structure of the rise and fall of a king. Frank Lucas is the American businessman gone bad, and the fact that he is black is relevant only in that he represents the latest ethnic group in America to take this dark path to success.<br/><br/>But Zaillian isn't content to simply twist the gangster form by using a black main character. He tries to expand the scope of his story by using the larger crime genre. This is a broad category of stories - with gangster as one of the sub-genres - that focuses on the battle between cop and criminal. Ironically, Zaillian's choice only serves to diminish the scope and power of the film.<br/><br/>Crime stories derive much of their pleasure from two main elements: the plot machinations between the cop and the criminal and the blending of moralities by which the cop and the criminal live their lives. The first element is almost non-existent in this story. Frank's rise to power is unique only in his use of US Army personnel to bring his heroin from Southeast Asia. Cop Richie Roberts uses techniques that have been standard on TV crime shows for years.<br/><br/>This weakness in plot puts a serious dent in the dramatic power of the film, because it also means there is not enough mano-a-mano. There's none of the pleasure of Heat or The French Connection here. Frank and Richie, played by two powerhouse actors, have essentially one confrontation in the entire film. It's a good one, but it only highlights how much direct confrontation is missing in the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The writer's choice of having two central but separate characters takes an even greater toll on the other key element of the crime story, the moral blend. We normally think of cop and criminal at two opposite extremes of the moral spectrum. A good crime story will use the battle between these two characters to show that the moral difference between them is much more ambiguous.<br/><br/>Zaillian shows the moral contradictions within each of these characters individually. One of the reasons the classic gangster story is fascinating is that the gangster holds two wildly different moralities within his own head. On the one hand, Frank believes in family, integrity, and professionalism. He also believes in selling dope and killing people who get in his way. The gangster's ability to compartmentalize these impossibly different ways of living is one of the great examples of the human mind's almost infinite ability to rationalize.<br/><br/>Cop Richie is pretty good at compartmentalizing his morality as well. He turns in a million dollars of corrupt money and goes after dirty cops, but he's also a bad husband and father. An ongoing dramatic confrontation between these two men could have produced a deeper look at what is truly moral and immoral in American society. But it never happens.<br/><br/>Instead, the most interesting aspects of these characters and their real moral contrast come at the end of the film, in written epilogue. Richie, the incorruptible cop who brings down kingpin Frank and three fourths of the cops in the narcotics division, switches from prosecutor to defense attorney, and his first client is Frank. He succeeds in getting Frank only fifteen years in prison. But we've already seen that Frank has not only destroyed hundreds of lives through his drug running, he is a cold-blooded killer.<br/><br/>When I read that my eyes popped out of my head. And I wondered, Where's that movie? This script just started getting interesting on the last page.<br/><br/>FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com"

","The uncut version is nearly 3 hours long - which makes it about 20 mins longer than the theatre release version. The added scenes are certainly not detrimental to the film - if anything it adds even more depth and character to it. American Gangster is very much similar to Godfather with the difference that this movie is based on a true story. And you might be forgiven to think that this one looks more fictional than most gangster movies. The scams, double crossing, shooting people in the head in the middle of a street in new york, the impotency of the police in front of the obvious, the level of corruption in all spheres of the society and the widespread epidemic of drug abuse in new york, are simply astonishing. The historical aspect is very accurate as well. Ridley Scot does a great job by keeping the balance right - make it frantic and fast paced or follow the melodramatic line of the godfather? He has indeed found the right balance. But what he has achieved more prominently is immerse us into the 60's era of new york. There are a few allusions to the difficulty of a black man toppling the Italian mafia in those days; but I felt that maybe that aspect could have been developed further. This movie is a very very good watch - not lesson in cinema, as who would want to beat the godfathers in gangster movie - but this less fictional movie however is not very far away."

","American Gangster is, without a doubt, a good movie. I wasn't bored but found a few annoying things about it. I got what I wanted though, two solid performances and a good story.<br/><br/>Richie Roberts (Russel Crowe) is a cop who is going through a divorce and is in danger of losing custody of his son. He is seen as a boy scout to his corrupt colleagues, he turns in millions of dollars in a brief case to his authorities. Meanwhile we get the story of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), who rules the Harlem drug trafficking. Soon, Detective Roberts is assigned to bring down Lucas's criminal empire.<br/><br/>I really found the consistent use of nudity annoying. Despite that, the film doesn't glamorize the life of a drug lord, it gives you gritty and sometimes horrific realism. It was good, but like I said it wasn't great. I doubt that crime fans will not be pleased, I most definitely was.<br/><br/>The film also reveals things about drug trade that isn't shown in Scarface, which is seen as a definitive drug lord film. You see how they use there business relationships to make an empire. Lucas uses his relative's small businesses as fronts, just clever. It also shows how the dealer sees themselves, they see themselves as business men who will kill to get money and respect."

","There's a major problem doing a movie set in the 1970s, which was a period of major cultural transition. Many of the fashions of that day never went away; others were actually revivals from the 1950s. Still others came and went and then were later revived. I remark this because some reviews complain of the period detail in this film. But I have never seen a single film set in the 1970s anywhere true to that decade, which was the most memorably important of my life. So until someone can show me such a film, I just don't bother quibbling over the detail work set in that era.<br/><br/>That said history, both real and cinematic are important here. The film opens remarking two events, each of which received attention in major films: from the mid-1930s, the Harlem underworld was dominated by Bumpy Johnson, who claimed to have retired in the late '40s, but this was not true, and remained mob boss above 125th Street until his death in the mid-'60s. His early career was depicted in the recent film ""Hoodlum,"" but he also appeared as a character (as 'Bumpy Jones') in the original ""Shaft."" Just about the same time, in the mid-'60s, a large quantity of heroin smuggled in from France was confiscated by an earnest NYC Detective, Eddie 'Popeye' Egan, which unfortunately did not lead to the mass convictions of narcotics-connected mobsters probably due to mob influence on the courts. This event was narrated in the film ""The French Connection."" The confiscated heroin itself disappeared thanks to corruption in the NYPD itself.<br/><br/>Since Harlem was the big marketplace for illegal narcotics, it could be expected that these two stories would eventually intertwine; and that they did is documented in both texts of criminal investigators and reporters, as well as a number of fictional films from the 1970s; but this is the first film to tie the loose ends together. The sustaining element in both stories was the corruption in the police, the courts, and the government of New York, a problem that has never been completely resolved.<br/><br/>American Gangster has to be judged as a recorded episode in this history, and it can be fairly compared with the movies previously mentioned. To be frank, it lacks the grand scope of ""Hoodlum"" and the energetic realism of ""The French Connection,"" but is on a par with some of the better films dealing with other aspects of this history - which it appears to reflect honestly, having both central players on board as consultants. It's not one of Ridley Scott's best movies, but it is a fascinating dual portrait of a shrewd hood running out of time and the honest cop hunting him down. Neither Washington nor Crowe are at their best here - I feel they needed more prep-time for their characters - but the turn in solid performances, as do the rest of the cast-members. And the work behind the camera is also solidly professional, as we've come to expect from director Scott's crews. But I admit I expected something a little more, since the core story and its history are so profoundly interesting, raising unsettling questions about American society and its particular economic culture. ( I can't remember in what movie a character explains that heroin is the perfect commodity, since its addicted consumers will spend any amount of money for it and get pretty much nothing in return.) So American Gangster is not the final statement on the continuing problem of the culture of narcotics or that of police corruption; but it is an interesting and entertaining gangster film, and a fairly reliable document of the events it portrays."
"mstomaso","9","1","2","15 October 2008"," Opinion of a mob movie non-fan
","I do not, generally, enjoy movies about organized crime. Even the combination of Ridley Scott, Denzel Washington, and Russel Crowe did not entice me enough to lure me into the cinema for American Gangster. Although I now lament this missed opportunity, I have to say that the Collector's Edition DVD set was well worth the wait and the expense. Almost uniquely, the bonus features offer penetrating authentication of this essentially true story about the rise and decline of 1960s/1970s crime boss Frank Lucas (Washington) in Harlem.<br/><br/>Opposite Lucas, and very interestingly mirrored by him throughout the film, is Essex County, New Jersey, policeman Richie Robertson (Crowe) a stalwartly honest cop who is waging a personal and professional war on drugs and corruption. The lives of the two protagonists are remarkably paralleled in the film, and the eventual culmination of the story will probably surprise those who are unfamiliar with the history of Lucas and Robertson. And the characterization (from top of the bill to the bottom) are excellent.<br/><br/>Essentially, this is a heroic tale, but it is also a great deal more which I can not tell you about without writing a spoiler.<br/><br/>The subject matter is decidedly not appropriate for young people. There are graphic scenes of heroin abuse and some rather cavalier treatments of human life which are affective and appropriate in contextualizing the subject of the film.<br/><br/>The film is well directed, perfectly paced and casted, nicely edited and phenomenally well acted. Crowe and Washington reach their usual high standards, and Josh Brolin, Ruby Dee, Ted Levine, John Hawkes and Armand Assante provide great support.<br/><br/>Unlike many films in this genre, action is very much subordinated to story and character development. In fact, action is actually given just a few quick minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>Recommended for fans of Scott and the cast. Very highly recommended for fans of true crime drama."

","Frank Lucas was a real true to form American Gangster. Detective Robbie Roberts was a real true to form American Cop-Master. The true story of the grueling process on the evolution, execution, and resolution on how Roberts pinned Lucas is revealed in the masterful Director Ridley Scott film ""American Gangster"". Denzel Washington stars as Lucas, a 1970's black American Kingpin who builds a drug empire by smuggling heroin in coffins of dead soldiers from the Far East. Russell Crowe also stars as Roberts, the righteous lawful detective who heads up an undercover-angel law enforcement team whose master plan is to be ""frank"", nail Frank! The great Scott masterfully orchestrates the film as a two-sided good cop/bad gangster symphony; you got Lucas up-rise to gangster notoriety as one story and Mister Roberts passionate determinative quest to nail the American Gangster in the other. Crowe and Washington do not even share screen time together until the film's final chapter. Though this is ultimately a cerebral tale of a cat-and-mouse chase of a law-biding cop's mission to nail down an egoistic hoodlum, the film's major theme that is investigated is police corruption. Crowe and Washington were, not surprisingly, brilliant as Lucas and Roberts. The supporting acting gang of ""American Gangster"" also did show their true good enforcement acting colors: Josh Brolin was wickedly conniving as crooked Detective Trupo, Chiwetel Ejiofor was a hoot as Frank's brother Huey Lucas, Ruby Dee was divine as Mama Lucas, and Cuba Gooding Jr. still showed us the acting as Kingpin competitor Nicky Barnes. Screenplay extraordinaire Steven Zaillian penned a gangbuster striking scribe for ""American Gangster"". But my Great Scott, in the end, American Gangster's main hero was Director Ridley ""Believe it or Not""! Don't be afraid of the ""American Gangster"", seize it today! ***** Excellent"

","First things first. Great Movie. It had great acting from Denzel and Crowe plus all the minor roles as well. It had a decent concept,true story of an astonishing man and his astonishing downfall. But sadly this wasn't a Ridley Scott victory.<br/><br/>Some have said this film was better than the Departed but I disagree. The Departed is no way near as good as Goodfellas and shouldn't be compared with American Gangster. American Gangster and Goodfelas is a good comparison though, simply because they are crime biopics. Goodfellas is still better though because Scorsese did what I thought Scott would do and that is utilise the cinematography to every extent. The Departed had all round good performances from cast and crew. This didn't.<br/><br/>Scott was clever in some places but this was more like a Tony Scott film than a Ridley Scott film. He has once again recreated a world for the audiences but you don't notice it enough for it to be as effective as it was in Blade Runner or Gladiator. When I watched this a second time I noticed the Harlem of poverty, despair and chaos. Its run down look is meant to achieve what Los Angeles 2019 did in Blade Runner but it falls short of the high set Ridley Scott mark. The scene Detective Trupo knocks over his coffee cup before killing himself was the scene I felt spoke the most volumes visually. It's just so symbolic. Maybe the only problem I have with it is that I expect too much from Scott. I just feel that the Harlem of the 1960s and 1970s could have been made more visible without compromising the brilliant story.<br/><br/>Crowe acts at his best in this film but as one would expect Denzel is just superb. Brolin is good as wheel and the rest of the cast is just above able.<br/><br/>Unlike the Departed this crime story doesn't deserve the Best Picture Oscar simply because it could've been better and there are better films for 2007. Denzel is great but no way does he beat Day-Lewis' performance. Not a must see but a good film and worth a look at."
"david-a-nimmo","5","1","2","11 August 2008"," Average gangster film
","This is very much a run-of-the-mill gangster film.<br/><br/>The story itself has the potential to make a gripping movie, but the acting from the leads is poor, and the directing average at best.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe's good cop in a corrupt force is completely clichéd and his attempt at an American accent is TERRIBLE. You would expect such a high profile actor to be able to make at least a reasonable job of this.<br/><br/>For me, Denzel Washington was the real weak link in the film. He does not slip convincingly into the character of a big time heroin dealer.<br/><br/>He is far too likable. We are meant to believe that he is capable of killing those who cross him in cold blood in front of watching bystanders, but for someone who is so charming throughout the movie it seems unrealistic.<br/><br/>The movie would have been more interesting had it explored some of the parts that were glossed over, such as Lucas's rise from a street henchman to how he came to be at the top of the organisation, and the effect that his powerful heroin had on the streets.<br/><br/>Instead, we get pointless sub-plots such as Crowe's custody battle, which adds nothing to the film except to make it longer than it needs to be.<br/><br/>This is not a ""bad"" film, but it's forgettable."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","1","2","18 July 2008"," Modest gangster film (spoilers)
","On the brink of death an aged gangster bemoans the state of America. He sees that corporations are taking over and that the little man is being cut out. 'Where's the pride of ownership?' he wails. Damn soulless, faceless McDonald's are everywhere.<br/><br/>This might seem like quite an honourable concern. It sounds like the old man is grieving over the homogenisation of the modern world. But in reality the old man is only upset because it's nearly impossible to shake down large corporations. Shop owners are meant to be vulnerable and powerless. They're meant to pay him a cut of their earnings. But multinationals are far more powerful than the old man will ever be. It's impossible for him to get a piece of the action.<br/><br/>When the old man dies, Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) decides to take over his operations. But while the old man had reached the limit of his ingenuity and had become a relic, Frank sees where the business has to go. He has to become like the large corporations. He can't just sell random junk. That would earn him peanuts. Instead he decides to create a brand.<br/><br/>The heroin that Frank sells is called Blue Magic. It's purer than anything that's on the streets and it's cheaper too. And Frank can do this because he cuts out the middleman. He's both supplier and distributor. He's taken a leaf out of the corporation's book.<br/><br/>Another way that Frank is like the corporations is that he's highly protective of his brand. One drug dealer takes Blue Magic and cuts it up in order to try and make more money. But this reflects badly on the brand. It's no longer Blue Magic. Frank even says that his customers have a guarantee of quality when they buy his product. It's like he's talking about coffee rather than heroin.<br/><br/>What's notable is that like a good businessman, Frank does his best to stay as anonymous as possible. Occasionally he has to lay down the law and make a scene to get everyone in line, but otherwise he doesn't want to draw undue attention to himself. He just wants to blend in. However, he does have a moment of weakness. His wife buys him an expensive fur coat and hat. In a second he goes from anonymous-looking businessman to black gangster. And wearing this outlandish outfit to a boxing match, and getting the best seats in the house, he alerts himself to the cops  previously he flew under the radar. Suddenly he has the attention of both Detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) and some bent cops led by Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin). And then on his wedding day, Trupo tries to shake down Frank for money. Frank's indulgence has cost him. It's exposed him and made him vulnerable. Therefore he burns the hat and coat while his bride sobs.<br/><br/>All of these details and all of these parallels between gangsters and corporations make American Gangster an interesting film, but it never really takes flight. In fact, visually it's surprisingly bland for a Ridley Scott film. He captures the grime and squalor of 70s Harlem well enough, but with his usual widescreen frame jettisoned, it feels more like television. The film is solid but unspectacular.<br/><br/>Of course, that's probably intentional. The film doesn't want to showboat. It wants to be a more gritty, realistic depiction of the drug trade. It doesn't want to have the glamour of The Godfather or Goodfellas. But this is still cinema and there's nothing that's really going to take your breath away.<br/><br/>Instead the film's pleasures are smaller. There's a nice scene where the wealthy Lucas family are sitting down to a sumptuous Thanksgiving meal and thanking god for all they have while junkies shoot up  we even see a child crying over a parent who has overdosed. This is the product that Frank pedals: misery. He makes himself fat over other people's weakness and stupidity.<br/><br/>But although this criticism is well made, you do occasionally feel that the film makes the mistake of liking Frank Lucas a little too much. Even though Scorsese's gangster films are more cinematic and therefore more seductive, Scorsese always stays objective  he knows these people are scum; therefore he just turns on the camera and lets them hang themselves. Scott, though, seems a little seduced. At the end, as Lucas cooperates with Richie, we see him laughing and smiling. Is the film trying to show us that deep down he's a decent guy? And there's also a heavy focus on police corruption in the film. Don't get me wrong. Corrupt police are just as bad as criminals such as Lucas. But you kind of get the feeling that the film is saying they're worse. Fact is, they're the same. The film shows that they all feed off one another. But although we get that one moment where we see junkies shooting up during Thanksgiving, the film soft pedals the misery Frank brought to the streets. He was a scumbag and instead he's made to look like a ruthless businessman who really had a decent heart underneath it all.<br/><br/>Another weakness is the familiarity of Richie's story  the cop who catches Lucas. His character has all the familiar beats  a failed marriage, a desire to be the one straight cop in the bad town, and the struggle to crack the ring. None of his scenes are bad, but you're constantly reminded of better movies such as The French Connection. And that's the problem with the whole film. As you watch it you're constantly reminded of better movies. The Godfather, Goodfellas and The French Connection all pop in your head and you realise that American Gangster can't hold a candle to any of them."

","This is based on a true story. Detective Richie Roberts (Crowe) heads up a special task force to eliminate the drug trade in New York City and has his eyes on Frank Lucas (Washington) who runs a drug operation there.<br/><br/>The thing about a movie being based on a true story is one really never knows if everything is true therein. But, I am looking for entertainment and I was entertained and what was true or not true doesn't matter to me. Well, okay, it does matter to me when it involves our political or military history. Gangsters? No. However, that being said , there are some things that needed work.<br/><br/>First of all there was no cat and mouse between Roberts and Lucas. They meet practically in the last 15-minutes of the movie. And, still there was no real tension between them. There should be some tension somewhere in this type of movie. Somewhere if not between those two.<br/><br/>When the movie began, I kept asking myself: when is this going to start? There was too much gangster foreplay going on. That gangster build-up wasn't necessary. I get it. There are bad guys out there and the longer this went on I kind of liked Frank Lucas. Not good.<br/><br/>The same on the other side with Roberts, a cop studying for the Bar in New York, coping with a custody battle with his ex, being hated by the NY Police force for honestly bringing in almost a million dollars in unmarked bills and not taking any (The movie says there are bad cops out there and there are many of them.), and then being assigned to a special task force (this to keep him away from cops, who wouldn't help him in the future.) I liked him too.<br/><br/>Still, I enjoyed this movie. The pace was fine, it was the cat and mouse part of the story or any tension anywhere that was missing.<br/><br/>But, to be fair, the session in the interview room between Roberts and Lucas was pure gold and was worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Violence:Yes; Sex:Yes; Nudity: Yes; Language: Yes, in the beginning, but then they forgot about it."

","Without the slightest intention to turn a movie comment into a moral debate, I can't ignore the reality that drug dealing is often considered the vilest of crimes, even if it's just a movie. With a movie star such a Danzel Washington whom the entire population simply loves on sight playing a kingpin drug dealer, a few fleeting shots of suffering addicts and one or two comments in the dialogue about those sufferings are far from adequate to provide a balance. One of the key things that make Don Vito Corleone so respected (as a movie character) is his steadfast determination to stay out of the drug business.<br/><br/>""American gangster"" is a solid, first class gangster movie, set in the 70s against the backdrop of the US's withdrawal from Vietnam. Ridley Scott maintains full control over the development of the parallel stories over the two-and-a-half hours of the movie. With under-acting that approaches minimalism, Russell Crowe plays an almost too-good-to-be-true honest cop outcast by his generally bribe-taking colleagues, frustrated and wasted until handpicked to head up a no-nonsense drug squad. But the winner of the contest, if there is one, would be Denzel Washington, who inhibits the deprived kid that eventually rises to become a black drug dealer that outdo the Italian Mafia.<br/><br/>The thing I like best is the final climatic showdown (and the two didn't meet until then), not a commonplace shoot out but a verbal duel (in an interrogation room) that is ten times more exciting. Particularly brilliant is Washington maneuvering like a slithering snake trying to wriggle out of trouble or at least minimize loss, changing tactics continuously – testing waters, probing, bribery, intimidation, logical reasoning, emotional appeal. That one scene is the true worth of the movie."
"johnny-08","6","1","2","23 December 2007"," Story of Frank Lucas
","Based on a true story, ""American Gangster"" tells us the story of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) who becomes most important importer of heroin on Manhattan, after the death of his mentor Bumpy Johnson (Clarence Williams III). Lucas does that by buying heroin directly from the source in South East Asia and that is his cousin Nate (Roger Guenveur Smith). His product is superior to the one that is currently available on the street and his prices are lower. His alliance with the New York Mafia ensures his position and he also has to bribe some cops, especially Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin). Parallel with the story of Frank Lucas we also follow the story of Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), who seems to be only honest policeman.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott directed this movie and I have to say that everything is made very good but I have a feeling that original version had 4 hours (just took one number) and that he had to cut a lot of scenes. There Scott gets lost, cause on one side he managed to create character of Frank Lucas completely and that is great, but on the other side almost every other characters suffer (especially Richie Roberts). And everything is perfectly made for Washington, but Crowe hasn't got much space to show his acting ability (which are great). Also some situations aren't explained completely. Like why is Cuba Gooding's character so little in this movie, after fight with Lucas he disappears. But what bothered me the most is that Lucas family just came to this big, new house without asking any questions. How did he get all that money and it is simply impossible that in his family, in short period of time, they all became killers and drug sellers. <br/><br/>But if I put aside these things, we get one very well directed and acted movie (especially Washington) about a man who managed to became the king of drug scene and he wasn't Italian, but black. Also the character of Crowe is definitely only completely positive one (but only if we look his career in police). So ""American Gangster"" is solid movie from director Ridley Scott, but it isn't his best in my opinion. ""Gladiator"" is still my number one, but ""American Gangster"" isn't movie to avoid for every Scott fan."

Oscar winning Steven Zaillian writing is the down side of the movie due to its misguided focus on ethnic role-play, unnecessary to the success of the story.<br/><br/>The spectator should be aware that various significant facts - e.g. Frank ""Superfly"" Lucas' wife was not a Miss Puerto Rico pageant, that her name was not Eva Oquendo but Julie and that she went back to Puerto Rico (she served time)  in the movie are completely wrong. <br/><br/>I wonder when we could reflect in screenplay write how lack of conscience, no qualms in using violence, social pressures, ethnic rejection and social isolation is the foundation to such true stories as the one of Frank Lucas.

","Now first and foremost don't get me wrong, it was a very good movie. IF you are expecting this to be a Godfather/Scareface/GoodFellas, think again. This movie is longer than it needed to be, and it wasn't as much of a edge-of-your-seat moment at times as you would believe it to be. I personally love mob movies, but don't think this ranks as number 1. Denzel yet again does a splendid job in his role as Frank (as if it was skeptical) and Russel Crowe adds a good character into the mix. When it comes down to it, the acting was great, length was too long, plot was good, movie was good, but in my mind the hype and the excpectance of it was too high. If your expecting this to be one of the best movies of the year, still watch it, but don't get your hopes up. If your not expecting it to be one of the greatest mob movies and think it will be just a good movie, then you will enjoy this film a lot."
"diand_","7","2","8","10 November 2007"," Causal ambiguity
","If a top classic movie is made, it is often unsure how this came about. That is, if all the right disciplines do all the right things this is just not enough. The positioning and interaction of these elements is what makes a true classic, so if for (a simple) example a camera move is followed by a shift in the story and the characters at the same time, you have an enhanced experience. It is more often than not the case that filmmakers are not aware how they made these interactions work. This causal ambiguity also explains why it is impossible to replicate just another classic by the same or different film makers. A top director is however more aware than the average ones of these interactions and often exercises a far larger control over the total work that in these days have turned into gigantic, almost non-manageable projects. The late Kubrick comes to mind as the genius and control freak in this regard, and he also let his movies evolve, thus avoiding the trap of rigidities and able to adjust the interactions.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott is one of the top directors of our time. American Gangster contains dozens of interesting shots and perfect location shooting and set building. Ridley Scott makes every scene worth looking at in itself. The apartments in a dilapidated neighborhood looking like prisons, the framing of the first shots (those with Bumpy) and the last shot in the transfer of one area into another, the many references to other (gangster) movies (Scarface, Goodfellas for example) are examples of his great talent. Also in storytelling, he refrains from presenting the story in a simple manner and let us work to combine some of the pieces.<br/><br/>But the story and especially the script is far too linear for Scott's talent. In Gladiator he could expand on the notion of the arena as a theater, in Matchstick Men he could play with the audience in tricking them in a movie about tricks, in Kingdom of Heaven he could link it to the Islam-Christianity dichotomy. But here, there are just some loose elements like Vietnam, drug-addicted NY neighborhoods and a black imitating Italians. Steven Zaillian's script is just badly written, not able to make this story work beyond the obvious and also contains some unnecessary elements that detract from the story (the love story for example. Next to this I find it hard to believe that this was edited by Pietro Scalia, who did the fantastic editing in Black Hawk Down and Gladiator.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington has never topped his performance in Training Day and is unable to do something extra for this movie; Russell Crowe tries to replicate his performance from A Beautiful Mind, and both are also not able to surpass the limitations of a weak script. American Gangster contains luckily an enormous amount of side roles that are true revelations.<br/><br/>So in the end American Gangster is in itself a decent movie, but pales in comparison to the movies it tries to build on, such as Goodfellas/Casino, Cidade de Deus and The Godfather."

","The pacing in the movie was the one thing that I had a problem with. I think that even though the movie was 2 1/2 hours long, the plot seemed like it was developing way too rapidly. There was a lot of nonsense in the movie that could've been cut out and a lot of plot lines that could have been developed better. Denzel's character came to power way too fast and his relationship with his mentor was developed for a grand total of 45 seconds.<br/><br/>Also, the talent of the actors in the movie wasn't used as well it it could've been. Denzel Washington didn't really have as much good dialogue as I was hoping for, although Russel Crowe was really good in this movie.<br/><br/>Another thing worth noting on. Has anyone else thought of it as funny as I do that Cuba Gooding Jr. has gone from legendary, academy award winning actor to not even being an ancillary character in a movie like this. Oh how the mighty have fallen."

","Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) moved to Harlem at an early age, where he worked for a crime boss. As the mobster's right hand man, he got a taste for power and for coming out on top. When the aging boss dies, the power shifts to Frank and he vows to be the ""master of the universe"" in his corner of New York City. Being extremely intelligent and ruthless to those who oppose him, Frank does what it takes to make his dream come true. He transports his brothers and other relatives from North Carolina to Harlem, for he can count on their loyalty to execute the workings of his master plan. Then, he travels to Asia himself and strikes deals with the Oriental exporters of heroin, guaranteeing a potent, superior drug and no ""middlemen"" to siphon off the profits. With the purest form of heroin and the lowest prices available, Frank's gang pulls in astronomical profits of the streets of Harlem. Frank lives like a king, with a most beautiful, pageant-winning Puerto Rican bride. But, there is one man poised to take him down. That would be Richie (Russell Crowe), a super-honest cop of the New York City police department. Richie once turned in a million dollars he found on the street, without taking a penny. When the drug laws enforcement agency of the United States comes calling, they nab Richie to head a cadre of officers dedicated to tracking down the kingpins in the drug traffic in NYC and putting them behind bars. With two hurricane-force men about to face off in a colossal test of will and power, who will be left standing? This is a great film, replete with very fine performances and a sensational tale. The acting crew of Washington, Crowe, Josh Brolin, Ruby Dee, and all of the others are made-to-order perfect in their designated roles. But, it is the story itself and the recreation of Harlem in the seventies that is even more impressive. Here is a world where the rules of middle town America do not apply and everyone must step to a different tune, one dictated by those who have the control. Ridley Scott, the director, as he did in Blade Runner, makes this lost world come to life brilliantly. There is some violence, yes, but just enough to show the reality of the situation and nothing in excess. Therefore, if you are thinking of another Scarface, you will be disappointed. As for the look of the film, it's costumes, sets, and cinematography, they are all beyond reproach. In short, this is a memorable film that tantalizes the viewer from beginning to end. Get the gang together and go buy your tickets ASAP."

","I got exactly what I expected - a really good, not masterful, but really good gangster film from Ridley Scott, one of my favorite directors. American Gangster is definitely long but I still feel like the editing was great...they packed so much information into a two and a half hour movie. It was fulfilling. They did a great job of capturing the era and the attention to detail was great - and I don't mean they just played funk music. Shots of old TV's with news on Vietnam, cars, everything. The production of this movie wasn't lazy at all. The acting was what I expected, great. Denzel Washington does get some heat for playing similar characters in every movie, but I say oh well, he is very good at playing this kind of role. Russell Crowe, who I believe to be one of the best living actors, is also great. He is very believable. This film is definitely worth seeing.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"JediMoonShyne2","8","2","8","26 October 2007"," The kind of film that Hollywood built its name upon
","'American Gangster' - Ridley Scott, 2007<br/><br/>True diversity is a rare buckle in the utility belt of your average mainstream director, yet English-born Ridley Scott has positively paraded this attribute over the years. To make a cult-shaped name for yourself through the genre of sci-fi ('Alien', 'Blade Runner') is difficult enough, but to build on this with drama ('Thelma & Louise') and thriller ('Hannibal', 'Matchstick Men') films requires some grand diversification. Therefore we shouldn't be surprised that his crowning moment came through another genre still - with sprawling Roman epic 'Gladiator' taking best picture and best actor gongs at the Oscars. Well, it's Oscar time again and Mr. Scott is back trying his hand at another foreign genre - the well tested drug/crime flick. 'American Gangster' is based on the true tale of heroin kingpin Frank Lucas - who used the Vietnam War to smuggle great quantities into Manhatten. Lucas is played by Denzel Washington who after tasting success as a villain in 'Training Day' seems intent on repeating the feat. Though as a much more pensive and world-weary criminal. Opposing him is common-man detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), salt of New York's drug-polluted earth and perhaps the most honest of the City's crooked police line-up.<br/><br/>'American Gangster' is a story of two sides - black and white. Not in the literal sense of the words, but instead the black and white of the morality scale. We are told the tale of two powerful characters that face off across a slowly crumbling City backdrop, mostly unaware of one another's presence. Messieurs Washington and Crowe are two of cinema's more traditional actors (of those who remain) and fit their respective roles perfectly. Each reversing their general image to take up positions that both contrast and complement well. We are introduced to them as hero and villain respectively, but as the film rumbles on this outlook inverts back and forth, showing us both the good and bad qualities of each individual - so in the end we are not exactly sure for whom we should root. The showcase of 'American Gangster' is of course this aforementioned stand off between two different but also similar essences of man - yet there is some decent support work to make up our ensemble cast. With Chiwetel Ejiofor impressing once again as Frank Lucas' impressionable young brother Huey, taking to the drawling North Carolina accent with ease. Though for all this impressive talent, the cast does lack a little personality - with perhaps too much time spent on developing the personality of Manhatten itself, instead of its inhabitants.<br/><br/>The bustling streets of seventies' Harlem are shot with a tender justice by Scott, who saturates everything of colour in order to show a City draining of goodness before our very eyes. We have been lucky this year to experience two wonderful reinvigorations of well-trodden genres, with David Fincher's 'Zodiac' joining 'American Gangster' as one of the finest modern portrayals of its respective type. Indeed many comparisons and differences can be drawn between the two. One of the negative aspects of 'Zodiac' was its bloated runtime, and at a lengthy 157 minutes 'American Gangster' could be expected to drag also. But this potential pitfall is skillfully avoided by the director - who's use of a striding score and decidedly restless cinematography ensures that while the film may slow down in places, it never stops outright. The only thing that perhaps proves to be a drawback here is the fact Scott isn't attempting anything drastically new with regard to plot - and although the interesting moral interchange between his two leads is unique enough, the sometimes clumsy dialogue lets the film down in places. An element that can be forgiven however when considering how much focus is placed on action and reaction, body language, expression and emotion.<br/><br/>'American Gangster' is the kind of film that Hollywood built its name upon, yet somewhere along the line forgot how to reproduce. And one that represents another impressively diverse rung on Ridley Scott's film ladder.<br/><br/>8/10"
"SirMoUK","7","2","9","7 November 2007"," Promises a lot, delivers very little
","Oscar season is here and the first real major film that wants to challenge for this years Best Film award is here.<br/><br/>Oh boy has the marketing machine worked its magic here. This film wants to be taken seriously, as seriously as The Godfather or Goodfellas, from everything from the slick trailers to the simple yet stylish movie posters and even intro credits.<br/><br/>The main selling point of this film are the lead actors Denzel Washington and Rusell Crowe.<br/><br/>I'll drop my first humdinger by saying I don;t think these actors are anything special nor are they even in the top few actors around at the current time.<br/><br/>Rusell Crowe has only ever impressed me in one film. The best film he has been in was LA Confidential, but that wasn't really down to him. In that film he played something of an oaf with little emotion. In Romper Stomer he played something of a thug. And in his award winning performance in Gladiator he played something, yes you guessed it, an oaf and a thug. I should add in here that Gladiator is in my opinion an utterly awful and overrated film with little substance. If American Gangster was to go on and win the Oscar for Best Film like Gladiator did then it would only cost the Academy Awards the little bit of credibility they have left IMO.<br/><br/>It is not all bad though because Crowe did put in a performance to be remembered in the film 'The Insider' which I thought was actually VERY good and easily the best performance I have seen form him (Beautiful Mind included).<br/><br/>Next we have Denzel Washington. An actor who IMO was nothing special. He then won an Oscar for Tarining Day and was propelled to mega-actor status. Since then he hasn't really put in a truly brilliant performance. The thing I don't like about Washington is arrogance, he exudes it, I am not sure if its on purpose or not but I think he can certainly add it - just look at his character in Training Day - arrogant to the extreme and this kind of carries on into other films, Inside Man for example. He is also a bit annoying in this film, whenever me says 'My Man' and smiles I just want to slap his face.<br/><br/>However, both of these guys have been in fairly decent films recently, especially Crow in 3.10 to Yuma. So I was of course open to them putting in great performances to make this a great film.<br/><br/>I am not going to go over every point of the film but I Will quickly go over its major flaws Accents - come on Crowe - you are meant to be one of the best. Crowes accent was all over the place in this movie. There is a thread running on IMDb currently running at 6+ pages debating this point but I am 100% sure his accent wasn't consistent throughout.<br/><br/>Gangster - this isn't a gangster film in the truest sense. Its nothing like Goodfellas/Scarface/The Departed/Usual Suspects etc. So you Will Be disappointed they used this title and made it look like something that it definitely is not (marketing eh?) instead expect something slower, much much slower...If you want to see loads of guns and killings and underground activity then this isn't the film for you.<br/><br/>The length and pacing of this film is all wrong. It is too slow and too long. The vast majority of scenes jump from one place to another too quickly. Most of the scenes are too short and there are probably only 2 or 3 really decent scenes. For my money none of these scenes really build up to some sort of peak like they do in the great movies.<br/><br/>So what about Washington and Crowe? Well it is fair to say Crowe was much better in 3.10 to Yuma and in this film he is only really something of a bit part character as he is probably only getting 30% of screen time compared to Washingstons 70%. They were both OK but nothing special.<br/><br/>Good points? Well there are not many. Of course the sets and costumes were definitely decent. The music was good but I was disappointed with the plot.<br/><br/>Having read some of the comments at IMDb the 2 most appropriate words would be 'uninspiring' and 'dull' - its an OK film but it's definitely not as good as they are trying to make it look.<br/><br/>Overall the film is above average. 7/10 - best of the year? Not at all. 3.10 to Yuma is much better overall and deserves any award before American Gangster."
"tman90","10","2","9","2 November 2007"," The Best Movie of 2007
","On November 2, 2007, a movie was released by the name of American GANGSTER. This movie just so happened to be the best movie of the year. <br/><br/>I can say this with a little less than 2 months left in the year of '07 with confidence because I know that this movie will be almost impossible to beat. This movie is so good that it knows it's good. (Now that is GOOD)<br/><br/>The story of American GANGSTER is loosely based on a true event involving two men. One by the name of Frank Lucas and the other, Richie Roberts. Mr. Denzel Washington plays the role of Frank Lucas, a heroin lord who ingeniously and quickly rises to power on brain power and audacity. Mr. Russel Crowe plays the role of Richie Roberts, a New Jersey detective who thrives on not being 'the dirty cop'. He grabs on to the Lucas case. These two actors are heavyweights. They are gods. Watching them go head to head is any movielover's dream. It is amazing to see so many superb actors in such a great picture. Ridley Scott stunningly directs a huge, long, complex movie into a highly energized, entertaining, and instant classic gangster flick. Watching this shows the viewer the vast differences in all of the various Mafia families- different race, different way of life. One thing stays the same and remains true for all families. You are only a true gangster if you can pull off the 'gangster'. This movie does just that. Total recommendation."
"Rooster9","8","2","9","26 October 2007"," Very good... and a little long
","You'll hear people describe American Gangster as a Black Scarface or a Black Godfather. Well, it's much better than Scarface, less compelling than The Godfather and certainly not a ""black"" film. It's a two-and-a-half-hour crime drama about the inherently capitalist nature of American crime that manages to feel epic despite it's small-scale story. In fact, it probably could have retained that same feel with an efficient 15-minute cut or, conversely, a serial adaptation to HBO. The character of Frank Lucas could easily sustain his own television series. After about two hours into American Gangster, I couldn't help but wish I could change the channel and pick up his adventures next week. The movie is that good... and it's that long.<br/><br/>Denzel is intense. Crowe is in top form. Scott has crafted an entertaining and meaningful film. But the greatest achievement is Zallian's screenplay which packs in so much story and believable character development with a pitch-perfect ending. Or maybe the greatest achievement is the editing, which builds such a compelling tale out of so many, tiny, efficient scenes that you have to wonder how many more hours of this film are sitting on the cutting room floor. <br/><br/>Maybe they should throw those extra hours back in and sell American Gangster as a miniseries. It really is that good, but it kinda is that long."

","In the 1960s Frank Lucas worked as a driver 'Bumpy' Johnson; when Bumpy dies Frank takes over his New York drugs empire. It is a time when heroin is expensive and low grade but Frank decides to do something about that he cuts out the various middlemen and buys directly from a producer in South East Asia and uses contacts in the US Military to fly the drugs from war-torn Vietnam to the States. Soon his high grade, low price 'Blue Magic' heroin his the streets of New York and nearby New Jersey. Meanwhile Richie Roberts, a cop who has lost the trust of his corrupt colleagues after handing in a million dollars of drug money he found rather than stealing it, is asked to head a new anti-drug task force. At first Frank isn't even on their radar; he is African American and everybody 'knows' the drugs trade is run by the Mafia. As the years pass Frank comes to dominate the local drugs trade and inevitable finds himself in the sights of Richie, who wants to arrest him, and corrupt cops, who want a slice of the action.<br/><br/>This is a really solid crime drama in a similar vein to films like 'The French Connection'. The film impressively captures the feel of the late '60s and early '70s. There is no question that Frank is a villain but even though we see that he is a murderer and has no moral problems with ruining more lives with heroin he is likable. Denzel Washington really impresses in the roll. Russell Crowe contrasts nicely as Richie Roberts, an honest cop who is determined to get his man even if that means making enemies. The rest of the cast, which includes plenty of fine actors, does a fine job too. At two and a half hours the film certainly isn't short but I was never bored. I liked how the passing of time was marked by the progress of the Vietnam War; something which also plays a key role in Frank's drug supply. Overall this is an impressive crime thriller that is definitely worth watching if you are a fan of the genre."
"zkonedog","5","1","3","12 March 2017"," A Great (True) Story, But Falls A Bit Flat On Film
","If one were to focus strictly on plot/story when evaluating this film, it would easily receive five stars. Whether it be the U.S. military flying drugs out of Asia, the corruption of U.S. cops, or the almost surreal life of mobster Frank Lucas, all those real-life accounts are riveting, making one question how such things could possibly happen in our great country.<br/><br/>Yet, as portrayed in this film, those stories became quite overextended or overblown, as a result making this film seem like a documentary instead of real life-inspired drama. True, I did watch the Extended Edition, but I am confident that the 18-minute less Theatrical Edition would have improved things only slightly. The film moves along at a snails pace, which while probably necessary in order to portray all the complex emotions of the movie, still may make the viewer feel as though this is a marathon viewing.<br/><br/>Also, the acting in this film is pretty toned down as well. I'm not sure if this was because that was just what the real-life people were like, but either way it was underwhelming. The cool, intense Denzel Washington only comes out in glimpses, which is a shame in a movie that features so much of him. Only Russell Crowe's character shows great character development, and even that is not up to the standards of most dramas.<br/><br/>To conclude, then, this film was likely the best it possibly could have been...but still doesn't translate into compelling drama. The complex drug storyline is very interesting, but the movie's extremely long run time and mellow acting will often make you feel as if you have been watching forever."
"cdjh-81125","9","1","3","23 November 2016"," Ridley Scott's Own Take on A Proved Genre
","One of the things I love most about Ridley Scott is his willingness to try everything, he's tried his hand at almost every genre in his career and while it's hasn't always workout for him I always admire the effort. But I don't just have to admire the effort here because I loved this movie, it's one of Ridley Scott's best and one of the greatest movies of 2007. A large part of that is due to its two central characters. I loved the character of Frank Lucas in this film he was so captivating I loved seeing his arc and business acumen and is by far one of Denzel Washingtons best and most complex performances. Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott are great together I loved Crowes character because again he was a complex one I loved seeing him want more than what he had and I loved the scenes between these two characters. The world of Harlem in this movie just sucks you right in you immediately see what kind of place this is and see what's been done to it by people like Lucas. Another thing I loved about this movie was the fact that everything had consequences, we see with our own eyes the fallout of Lucas' dealings and make him a more well rounded character. I think this movie has some of the best uses of violence in a movie because it's used to enhance the story, the extra blood or close ups of drug ridden dead bodies sucks us into the atmosphere more. I also really liked Josh Brolin in this movie I thought his character added something to this movie his story arc of being a corrupt police officer paralleled very nicely with Crowes head strong, good-cop arc and added to the bleak atmosphere Scott was trying to create. other characters I loved seeing were Lucas' brother it set up a nice dynamic between them, it's was good to see them get sucked into this world and I thought it added to Washingtons character to see him slowly isolate everyone he loves and creates for some really disturbing sequences. If I have one flaw with this movie it would be that it's definitely similar in terms of style and tone to other Gangster flicks but if it works for what To filmmakers are trying to accomplish and it does just that then I'm fine with that for the most part but the only area I thought this didn't quite work for was the love story I just didn't think it added anything to this film and I didn't really buy the chemistry between the two. <br/><br/>This is a fast paced, entertaining and long lasting crime thriller, it's one of Scott's best movies with great performances, very good character dynamics and arcs. It's definitely similar to other movies of this genre but it doesn't hold this movie back from its greatness. <br/><br/>91%/A"

Of cause ""1492: Conquest of Paradise"" for example, was a good work but I had always some problems with the pacing.<br/><br/>To be true, it was the same problem with this movie. Especially at the beginning. Some shots and cuts seemed so hard and unplaced... nearly like he was trying to make a Sci-Fi-Horror. <br/><br/>So the build up of the two main characters was a bit rough. And it took some time to get deeper into their story and meaning.<br/><br/>But when you get over this and you are still interested in the story, you will get a pretty good movie with many nice twists.<br/><br/>From time to time you will get some sweet Déjà-Vu's thinking of ""The Godfather"" and ""Catch Me If You Can"".<br/><br/>Also you can feel Washingtons and Crowes development as their characters grow with the story. Crowes spiritedly comic-relief character is the perfect counterpoint to Washingtons mostly serious Version of the black godfather of Harlem. It's a joy to watch them when their stories overlap.<br/><br/>A big plus are also the well detailed sets and a rousing soundtrack.

Mistaking ""autobiography"" for depth, and even truth, Scott's film is mostly a stylistic exercises, a vapid film cobbled together from, bits and pieces of other films.<br/><br/>Indeed, in our post ""The Wire"" world, virtually all postmodern ""gangster flicks"" reveal themselves to be, not only entirely vacuous, but without any real world relevance. Most would be far more honest had they embraced the dishonesty of, say, Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"".<br/><br/>So while Scorsese cribbed from the machine gun operas of the 1930s and 40s, Scott steals from the blaxploitation and rugged antihero crime movies of the 1970s. The result is a slick but soulless copy of such crime films as ""Super Fly"", ""Across 110th Street"", ""Black Caesar"", ""Serpico"", ""French Connection"", ""Crime Story"" and ""Prince of the City"".<br/><br/>Not only is ""American Gangster"" wholly derivative, but it is about as edgy as a Walt Disney fairy tale. Denzel Washington, who plays crime lord Frank Lucas, tries desperately to create an iconic character, but a poor script ensures that he embodies nothing but clichés. Every line of dialogue, every decision, every gesture he commits, oozes derivation. Spouting lines like ""Either you're somebody or you ain't nobody!"", ""This is my home. This is America!"", ""The most important thing in business is honesty, integrity, hard-work and family!"", the too-suave-to-be-a-thug Denzel Washington comes across as a back-to-front amalgamation of Don Corleone and Tony Montana, dumb wisdom and genteel thuggery wrapped up in chocolate frosting.<br/><br/>But then, every character in this film has been cynically designed by committee. We have Russel Crowe (doing a bad ""Starsky and Hutch"" impersonation) as the typical ""good cop with a messed up family life"", on the hunt of Washington's Frank Lucas, a gangster (and family man!) who goes through the motions and adheres to familiar gangster trajectories. ""Character development"" in both cases simply constitutes revealing both characters to be womanizers, as if this somehow ""greys"" them, makes them more nuanced.<br/><br/>Scott's films rarely say anything, but this one is particularly dumb. We get the typical ""crime doesn't pay"" message and the lip service to unattainability of the American Dream, whilst the one interesting theme of the film – the delayed victory of black capitalism – is quickly jettisoned. Better to treat Lucas' life as satire, a grotesque parody of market warfare, or take things seriously and examine why his rise coincided with the 1960s or how his cartel affected the black community. Heck, why not glorify the guy and treat his life as a viable and morally defensible career opportunity? Faced with the choice of either going to Vietnam and fighting for Uncle Sam or staying at home and selling cocaine, cocaine seems like a far better option. There are so many interesting avenues you can take this material, but Scott has always been devoid of any kind of world view.<br/><br/>But even as mindless entertainment, the film fails. Scott's ""violent scenes"" are supremely self-conscious, cynically injected into the film solely to titillate. This is calculated violence, rarely flowing organically from the film's plot. Similarly, the film's ""cat and mouse"" plot never ignites, its urban aesthetic can't touch Lumet, Frankenheimer, Ray, Mann or Friedkin, and the script never surprises.<br/><br/>The early 1990s offered a boom in ""black gangster"" flicks, films like ""New Jack City"", ""Tales From The Hood"", ""Straight Out of Brooklyn"", ""Dead Presidents"", ""Juice"", ""Clockers"", ""Boys In The Hood"", ""Menace 2 Society"" all popping up on cinema screens. None of these films are great, but they're all better than Scott's glitzy junk.<br/><br/>4/10 – With his distinct visual style, director Ridley Scott has spent his career conning people into mistaking his auterism for artistry. You want 70s grit done today, watch ""Harsh Times"" or ""Street Kings"". Otherwise, steal a ""The Wire"" box-set. Worth one viewing."
"dukee44","8","1","3","12 April 2010"," Almost a match for ""The Godfather""
","I enjoyed this film. Having never seen ""Training Day"", Denzel Washington as a ""villain"" was a refreshing change for me. Russell Crowe, although personally rather nasty at times in real life, played his part well, too. Actually, the entire cast was well done.<br/><br/>The idea that Frank Lucas could operate under the radar of law enforcement had almost a satirical feel to it. That character was smart and ruthless, leavened only by the fact he looked after his family and made their lives so much better, at least at the start. The first scene gives you an idea on how ruthless he can be. Frank Lucas stays behind-the-scenes until the night of the prizefight where he dresses basically like a pimp.<br/><br/>Crowe's character is the only police man who has clued in to what is going on with Lucas and the photos he takes of Lucas in his finery begins Lucas' downfall.<br/><br/>As in this type of movie, there is the prerequisite violence but not as much as some modern films. The pacing is well done and the juxtaposition between Lucas's successful crime life and Richie's domestic problems plus his treatment as a pariah by his fellow officers is well portrayed.<br/><br/>I did find the ending rather too ""feelgood"" but apparently that's what happened in real life. The ending stopped me from giving this film a 10."
"kenjha","6","1","3","4 September 2009"," Overdone
","This film looks at the rise of a black gangster in NYC in the early 1970s. The plot has similarities to ""The Godfather,"" but this film is a far cry from that classic. Although he sports a glum look to convey toughness and ruthlessness, Washington is miscast as the drug lord, a truly despicable character that is at odds with the actor's persona. Crowe fares better as an honest cop. Scott is certainly a competent director but the film could have used a good editor. While the plot is rather simplistic (was it really this easy for Frank Lucas to become a drug lord?), it is drawn out to epic length with repetitive scenes that add little to the narrative."
"g-bodyl","9","1","3","30 November 2008"," Great Gangster Film!
","American Gangster is one of the few gangster movies I have seen. I think it might be one of the best if not the best. Another thing that makes this movie great is that there is historical accuracy, not a 100 percent but still accurate enough. This film is about a detective named Ritchie trying to capture the drug warlord Frank Lucas who is involved in many operations. He did this to support his family. An outcome involving the capture of Lucas really amazes me. Nearly three quarters of New York cops were arrested and convicted of bribery charges. Ridley Scottt did a great job directing this film. He can do any genre without making a fool out of himself. The acting is pretty good. I think Denzel Washington is a great actor. Russell Crowe actually did something right for once. The technical parts of the movie is pretty good. The movie is somewhat boring but I was kept awake because I was intrigued about the plot. I rate this movie 9/10."

","I just finished watching American Gangster which comes out next Tuesday on video. I wasn't disappointed with the movie. It was as good as I thought it would be. Made to look in the 1970's in New York the costumes were great. I thought it was hilarious. The Black cop guy on Russel Crowe's drug force had visibly in one shot his upper arm showing. On his upper arm he has a Wu-Tang tattoo which is a continuity error. They should have costumed him differently as to look more professional but hey that's the least of their concerns on this production. The acting was good. I now think Denzel Washington is a more experienced actor but I still like Russel Crowe better. I didn't like Russel Crowe's fake New York accent. New Yorkers speak fast like Toronto people. The story line was good and portrayed things realistically. I love the mob influence and drug smuggling. Denzel's character got a slap on the wrist for what he did. That's amazing to be released after only 15 years. He lived out his term healthily and was released. Interesting ending with Denzel walking out onto the now 90's surroundings outside the prison."
"blackburnj-1","9","1","3","8 February 2008"," Return to Form for Scott
","Ridley Scott has been a little off form recently. ""Kingdom of Heaven"" was a disappointment and ""A Good Year"" was very poorly received. He does remain one of the most prolific filmmakers working today and all you need do is look at his back catalogue and know there is faith that he can pull many more great films out of the hat. ""American Gangster"" rewards this faith.<br/><br/>For the most part, this is a very fine thriller. It's gripping, quick and, despite a long running time, never dull. It features two actors at the top of their game. Denzel Washington's performance is electric and Russell Crowe is brilliant. A fine supporting cast, especially Josh Brolin, fill out the rest of the film with aplomb and they all exist in a wholly convincing world that Scott creates. All in all then, this is a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining film. However, the film is lifted higher by a thoroughly interesting social commentary that plays out in the background.<br/><br/>Washington's Frank Lucas is a fine cinematic character. He is a family man, a devoted husband and a mass murderer and a drug lord. Crowe's Richie Roberts is a good man, but a flawed man, whose integrity casts him out of the corrupt police department. Here, a murderer and mass criminal climbs to a privileged and wealthy place in society, mainly due to the ignorance and prejudice of that society, whilst a good man and dedicated public servant lives out a fairly squalid experience.<br/><br/>Scott's critique of the most successful capitalist culture is directed with vigour. The feel is frenetic and the look is superb. The sixties and seventies are evoked perfectly and the audience is utterly gripped. But the social comment, told with the aid of interesting and intelligent editing, shines through. Ultimately, a lot of this is due to the central performances. The scene where the two finally meet is brilliant and you simply cannot tear your eyes away from it.<br/><br/>This film has lasting appeal. It's entertaining and intelligent. The two sides, the thriller and the commentary, sit well with each other, though the latter is lost occasionally, and this film is anything but dull but the real joy is seeing a film made by two actors and a director pretty much at the peak of their careers. It has the makings of a classic and, just as Scott is entering into a busy period, this can only be seen as more reason for faith in his ability."
"SandyLeung","Null","1","3","12 January 2008"," A movie of a score 85 to me
","This movie does not let me down at all. It's exciting, gripping and inspiring with positive messages about gangsters, corruption, marriage, etc, like many other gangster movies.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington's role is more convincing as he should be as the calm, low-profile and strong-willed man. Russell Crowe's role is even a bit more realistic, as a man full of weaknesses and flaws. But personally I find his appeal (as in Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind) seriously fading, partly because of his hairstyle and partly the limited role he's playing this time.<br/><br/>The movie itself is convincing as it's based on a true movie. The plot is well developed and there are very few gaps to fill in. Something that displeases me is the excessive romances of the two characters, although I admit that they help to make up a complete plot.<br/><br/>The thing I like about the movie is that it does not involve too much blood and gun shooting. It is the ideas and characters which strike the audience and let them think, not the weapons or the blood.<br/><br/>Having said that, without the personal charm of Denzel and Russel, I seriously doubt if the movie would be as successful as it is. I mean, critically speaking, the movie's success still lies much in the good characters rather than the plot.<br/><br/>I am from Hong Kong and I find the movie's style very much like many local gangster movies, like Inferno Affairs and products of Johnny To, especially the ending scence withe background music of Amazing Grace.<br/><br/>Overall, I see no reason why this is not an excellent movie, and why Denzel should not be nominated, or at least dubbed, as the Best Actor of the year."
"ackstasis","8","1","3","11 January 2008"," There are two sides to the American dream
","There is one sequence in 'American Gangster (2007),' a very simple choice of editing, that perfectly captures the ever-expanding rift between crime and honesty. On the one hand, Frank Lucas spends his Thanksgiving with his family, in a warm, loving atmosphere with a delicious turkey sitting at their bloated dinner table. On the other hand, Richie Roberts spends the day at his empty apartment, his family having deserted him, cramming a few meagre morsels between two slices of bread. In an ideal world, it would be the dishonest criminal who is subjected to the latter scenario, a fitting reward for a lifetime of breaking the law and destroying innocent lives. However, reality has a bitter sense of irony: Frank Lucas, in fact, is a drug-dealer, one of the most powerful men in New York, and made wealthy through his substantial illegal dealings in heroin. New Jersey narcotics detective Richie Roberts is a straight arrow, a beacon of honesty in a law enforcement agency infested with corruption, and this lonely Thanksgiving snack is his punishment for a lifetime of unwavering dedication.<br/><br/>'American Gangster,' the latest film from director Ridley Scott, was based on a true story, adapted from Mark Jacobson's ""New York"" magazine story, entitled ""The Return of Superfly."" Frank Lucas is very much a real person {though I'm not sure to what extent writer Steven Zaillian took dramatic license with the events}, an African American who rose from humble beginnings to become one of the country's most powerful drug lords. From our very first glimpse of the man, we understand that he is not the sort of person you'd want to disappoint, and yet, channelled through Denzel Washington's acting abilities, he has an irresistible charm about him. If it were not for the illicit and lethal nature of his business, Frank Lucas might be considered a model American: a patriotic citizen, an ingenious capitalist businessman, and a dedicated family man. When the times become tough, he hands out food supplies to the needy Harlem people, and, every Sunday without fail, he accompanies his elderly mother to Church. Are these the actions of a bad man?<br/><br/>In playing detective Richie Roberts, Russell Crowe matches his co-star step for step. Though the characters do not actually meet until the end of the film {and, indeed, neither have even heard of the other until a fair way in}, there is a raw intensity to the cat-and-mouse game that they are both playing, and Ridley Scott enjoys creating stark contrasts between the two morally-conflicting characters. As far as human beings go, Detective Roberts isn't the most saintly man you're likely to come across. A neglectful father and husband, he regularly fraternises with criminal types, remnants from his unprivileged upbringing. However, Roberts, perhaps to compensate for his personal shortcomings, is deadly honest, a law enforcer who  to the incredulousness of his corrupt colleagues  uncovered $1 million in unmarked cash in the boot of a car, and actually handed it in. An interesting side-note at the close of the film proves dryly amusing, if very disconcerting: thanks to the co-operation of Frank Lucas following his capture, large numbers of law officers were found guilty of corruption, including three quarters of the special drug enforcement squad.<br/><br/>Though it runs for just under 160 minutes, 'American Gangster' moves along at a consistent pace, allowing for a lot of character and plot development, without ever getting bogged down with the details. The two leading players are, of course, excellent {and should be in contention come Oscar time}, and Josh Brolin also gives a strong supporting performance as Detective Trupo, a narcotics detective with a habit of using bullying tactics and accepting bribes. The one complaint I have with the film concerns its moral compass, as Scott expects us to sympathise with and admire Frank Lucas, as though it is acceptable to forget the death and misery that he caused to thousands of innocent victims. The closing intertitles also neglect to mention that, following his initial release from prison in 1981 {after serving a paltry five or so years}, he was again arrested and convicted in 1984 for further drug and parole violation charges. But, then again, I don't know what the man was like in real life perhaps he was a man whose capitalist skill ought to be admired, if only he'd directed his efforts towards a less despicable business."
"davideo-2","10","1","3","8 December 2007"," This time Washington and Crowe set the screen (and the box office) alight
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>The true story of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), former driver for Harlem kingpin 'Bumpy' Johnson, who after the old man's death uses the things he learned from him over the years to start up his own heroin empire along with his friends and family. He eventually comes to control 1970s NYC with absolute power, until Det. Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) gets on his case. One honest cop in a department full of corrupt officers who are themselves embroiled in the drugs game, from selling it themselves to using it themselves.<br/><br/>Twelve years ago, when Denzel was already a big star but Crowe was just a starting out Kiwi actor, they appeared together in Virtuosity, a sci-fi action film that tanked at the US box office and became one of the most high profile straight to video films ever in the UK. But all this while later, the acclaimed Ridley Scott has reunited them for this explosive real life gangster film with much more successful results. And, though they share virtually no screen time together, between them they keep the boat floating marvellously here.<br/><br/>The star of the show, though, is Denzel. My favourite black actor, he reliably sets the screen alight here. He's delivered some of his best work when he does intense, power-house kind of roles, but as Lucas, he turns in a much more restrained performance, a cool, calm, calculating psychopath who shocks you by punching a man and then slamming the top of a piano into his head but somehow manages to be just as un-nerving knocking a cup of coffee across a room after describing how police officers tortured and killed his brother when he was younger. In the supporting role as the good guy, it has to be said, Crowe is less effective, not turning in a bad performance, just nothing to write home about, especially compared to Denzel. Still, the film does a great job of juxtaposing two men, on opposite sides of the law but also on different sides of morality, Denzel's character a man with a dishonest and evil trade but who never forgets his roots and looks after his family, Crowe's a good cop but an absent father and shameless skirt chaser.<br/><br/>Scott has done a great job of bringing NYC to life as it (apparently) was in the early 70s, a grimy, unappealing sh!thole, a million miles away from the trendy, Central Perky look it has today. He allows his story to develop, and moves it along nicely with a neat list of supporting actors, as well as a cool, funky 70s soundtrack through-out.<br/><br/>Everything pays off quite marvellously here. It's taken a while to arrive, but as the film year draws to a close, one of the best chugs along just in time. *****"

","Russell Crowe has delivered many well-honed characters to us in films like 'Sum of Us', 'Mystery Alaska', 'A Beautiful Mind', and most recently '3:10 to Yuma'. By comparison, he must have taken Mondays and Fridays off during the filming of 'American Gangster', as his performance left me wanting much more.<br/><br/>The transformation of Frank Lucas from driver to kingpin and his relationship with his mother deserved more attention. Otherwise, it was a very well crafted genre film.<br/><br/>Well worth the price of admission as the smooth, slick Denzel Washington will surely entertain you."

","He is not credited anywhere but he is in the pivotal first scenes of the movie & is he referenced several times as the King of Harlem who mentored Denzel's character. The actor is no where mentioned in the credits. Is his character based on a real person like Denzel's? Denzel by the way is great & certainly deserving of a third Oscar for his mantle. Russell Crowe is also good but as in his last two movies ""Yuma"" & ""Good Year"" he seems to have given up acting almost entirely and appears to be playing some facet of himself. Everyone knows he's a great actor but he doesn't seem to be picking roles that really challenge him. Take Armand Assante for example - in this movie he takes a role (Mafia kingpin) and gives it a new twist. Knowing he can never compete with Brando's take he still manages to put a new spin on a tired old part. Cuba Gooding is wasted in his part but in the few scenes he does have he lets off a few sparks. And what about Ruby Dee? Should she be nominated just because of the body of her work? American Gangster is sure to get plenty of Academy nomination. The costumes for sure & Jay Z's soundtrack is outstanding. The photography especially for all the Harlem scenes are first rate."

The scenes feel disjointed and just feel like they have been clustered together, while the cinematography continues shaking the screen as you become dizzy while to attempt to pay attention to the film. Now that we got that out of the way the acting and dialogue remain strong in their form as they shadow the cons of the film and stand tall, as well as the script and interesting true story the film's based on. Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington both share their perspectives of the scenario happening and the film delivers the audience a two-sided coin that is tossed in the air on the occasions. This film could of been good because of these pros, but I just thought that those cons somehow pushed into the viewing experience, therefore ruining it, which is why I give this a 6.3/10.

","American Gangster is one of the most structurally sound films in my memory, and it ranks right up there with Chinatown, in terms of this structure. To wit, you have a Protagonist FRANK LUCAS (Denzel Washington) who is a gangster, a murderer, and a dope pusher, but at least to the law enforcement task force that is tracking him, he seems to live a very ordered life: breakfast at 5am every morning, then a meeting with the accountant or the lawyer, putting flowers on his dead bosses grave every week without fail, and taking his mother to church on Sunday. As one character says, ""Not the typical day in the life of a dope man, Ritchie"". Which brings us to our Antagonist, the cop, RITCHIE ROBBINS (Russell Crowe) who is the ultimate boy scout, a guy who cannot be bought and always does the right thing, except in his personal life where he sleeps around with a lot of women, never sees his son, and generally treats his ex-wife badly. So, after Ritchie and his partner turn in 1 Million dollars that they discover in the back of a bookie's car, they become pariahs within the Police Department. This drives Ritchie's partner to abuse heroin, which eventually kills him, and when Ritchie comes to the morgue to ID the body of his former partner, he discovers the stamped BLUE MAGIC baggie that was full of junk that killed his friend. Of course, the PLOT DEVICE of the BLUE MAGIC baggie sets the Main Plot off in motion, as it is Frank Lucas' dope dealing organization that has coined the term BLUE MAGIC, and Frank is so serious about it, he even chastises a rival later in the film for ""Copyright Infringement"" of his product's name. As though gangsters handled things with copyright lawyers. These dueling ironies and a plot device that sets off the story into the Main Plot from the Sub Plot are some the most brilliant techniques I have seen used in any film in my lifetime. With Ridley Scott, you can usually expect excellence, but sometimes he whiffs, like with THE COUNSELLOR. But, here he worked off an excellent script, with excellent ironies in it, and he executes it beautifully. The seeds that are planted in the sub-plot of the first 20 minutes of the movie, where Frank's mentor and boss ""Bumpy"" Johnson is waxing philosophical to him about the ills of capitalism, mass consumerism, and cutting out the middle man are all points that Frank remembers and incorporates into his own business. Rather than getting his ""supply"" from local, mafia sources, Frank takes a trek to Vietnam with $400,000 in cash, and has a cousin of his in the US Army take him to the fields in the Golden Triangle, where he can buy direct from the source. And, then he bribes Army logistics guys to get his bundles of dope on military transport planes back to the United States, and everyone gets a piece. It's the only way he's able to ""Be above the mafia in the dope game"", selling heroin that is twice as potent for half as much. And, Ritchie takes notice. Ritchie is a very interesting character with a lot of personal problems, created by his passions, but at work he is all about business and doing the right thing. And, it takes him some time to figure out Frank Lucas is the guy he's really trying to target. Frank says, early in the film that ""The loudest one in the room is the weakest one in the room."" And, by this rationale, Frank should have listened to his own advice, because it is at a boxing match that Ritchie gets a hunch he can figure out who the Dope King of New York is by the way and hierarchy of how the gangsters are seated down close to the ring, but Frank is wearing a Chinchilla coat and hat, and drawing all kinds of attention to himself from Ritchie, the Italians, and even the Special Investigations Unit of NYC drug squad. And, the film takes a bad turn for our protagonist from this point on in the film. And, unlike Ace Rothstien in CASINO, our character Frank Lucas knows that he's messed up wearing that coat, and he burns it. Ritchie investigates Frank, figures out what is going on, what Frank is doing, and this culminates in one of the MOST rewarding endings and last 20 minutes of any films I have ever seen, so I won't ruin it for you! Denzel Washington and Russell Crow have never been better."

","I think that American Gangster would have been a lot better without the cops or maybe just without Russell Crowe. Maybe more of Lucas in Thailand or more with the family. The cops take away from a good movie. Denzel Washington is great as Lucas and he owns the screen. Maybe more of his rivalry with Cuba Gooding Jr. There is so much good stuff underdone because it keeps having to go Russell Crowe's characters marriage problems and custody fight. That was not interesting, dramatic, good, well acted, nothing. If it had been a no name actor that might have worked so it didn't take up too much screen time. The movie ends up stilted and only occasionally good."

","Ridley Scott's American Gangster is not only a hard-hitting exposé of a Harlem crime lord who outwitted the Mafia and gained control of the drug trade, but a revelation of the unholy alliance that existed between drug traffickers, corrupt police officers, and big business elites in New York during the late 1960s. Denzel Washington is Frank Lucas, a heroin dealer and organized crime boss who made millions selling drugs on the streets of New York. Successful in minimizing the power of Italian distributors who controlled Harlem by eliminating the middleman and buying heroin directly from a Southeast Asian source, Lucas' operation was, in the words of Sterling Johnson, a narcotics prosecutor in New York, ""one of the most outrageous international dope-smuggling gangs ever."" Frank began his career as the associate of Ellsworth ""Bumpy"" Johnson (Clarence Williams III), one of the leading figures in organized crime in the early 20th century and an enforcer who protected the Harlem interests of the Italian Mafia. As the film opens, Bumpy and Lucas enter a discount appliance store where Bumpy tells Frank of his dismay at the disappearance in America of ""pride of ownership"", ""personal service"", and the loss of the middle man in the sales process. After Bumpy's sudden death, Lucas attempts to build his own operation and undercut the Mafia's monopoly on the drug business by going directly to the source.<br/><br/>Traveling to Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, Lucas concludes an exclusive arrangement to obtain 100 percent pure heroin which he sells on the streets as ""Blue Magic"", only 10 percent pure. Lucas operates under the radar, smuggling the dope into the States on military planes and bringing family members such as Huey Lucas (Chiwetel Ejiofor) from North Carolina to set up storefront businesses scattered throughout the New York/New Jersey area that serve as distribution centers. A determined enforcer, he is also seen as a suave businessman making arrangements with Mafia bosses and confronting his rival Nicky Barnes (Cuba Gooding, Jr.,) about infringement of his trademark use of the name Blue Magic.<br/><br/>In a superb performance as the opportunistic crime lord, Washington projects a low-profile surface veneer of sophistication that covers up an explosive brutality. He refuses to dress ostentatiously, goes to church every Sunday with his mother (Ruby Dee) and is generous to his Puerto Rican wife Eva (Lymari Nadal) but will turn on a family member instantly if his security is jeopardized in any way. Lucas has no problem dealing with New York's anti-drug Special Investigations Unit, paying off the majority of its members, in particular Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin). What he doesn't count on, however, is an honest cop like detective Richie Roberts played by the outstanding Russell Crowe. Roberts, whose personal life borders on chaos, has become an outcast in his own department after turning in a million dollars in cash that he found in the trunk of a car because it was ""the right thing to do"".<br/><br/>The relationship between Roberts and Lucas is the highlight of the film and their face to face ""negotiation"" near the end of the film is reminiscent of the meeting between De Niro and Pacino in Michael Mann's Heat. American Gangster is solid entertainment that is primarily a character study of two men on opposite sides who are determined to put their lives together, one to the benefit of society, the other to its detriment.<br/><br/>The strongest aspect of the film, however, is its courage in exposing the web of corruption that existed in the police force at the time. In one scene, Roberts tells his fellow officers about how hard it is for him to gain cooperation from federal agencies. ""I don't think they want this to stop"", he says. ""Judges, lawyers, cops, politicians, they stop bringing dope into this country, about a hundred thousand people are gonna be out of a job.""

","American Gangster (2007) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Set in the 1970s, a detective (Russell Crowe) tries to bring down a notorious heroin kingpin (Denzel Washington). 2009 will mark the 100th anniversary of the first gangster film and I'm not sure if one small sub-genre has given us more great films. This is an incredibly little picture that packs quite a punch with its violence, moral lessons and storytelling. The film clocks in twenty-minutes short of the three hour mark but there's not a single second that comes off boring and there's not a single second where something great isn't going on. We've seen the rise of gangsters before but director Scott does a terrific job at making it feel fresh and new. The cinematography is terrific, the soundtrack great and the film has an authentic feel throughout. What really makes the film special is the screenplay takes time to look at Crowe and Washington outside their jobs. We see how the two men work but we also get to see how the two of them deal with stuff in their personal lives. The film takes its time telling the story but this is a big praise because we get to see more than one dimensional characters. Both Washington and Crowe deliver great performances and I might even go as far as to say it's the best of both of their careers. Both come with that calm and cool grace that most actors try for but fail at delivering but that's not the case with these two. How neither of them got an Oscar nomination is beyond me but I think time will be very friendly to both of them. Another strong aspect is the supporting cast, which includes Ruby Dee, Josh Brolin, Ted Levine, Cuba Gooding, Jr. and a terrific Armand Assante. There's a lot of intense dialogue from start to finish and near the end with get a classic shootout but the best moments of the film might take place at the very end when Washington and Crowe finally share the screen together. For the most part the film is very fast paced but it slows down at the very end when the two stars come together and their little chat gives one a lot to think about what they've seen."

","Kudos to director Ridley Scott for pulling this together...and no punches pulled. In your face biopic based on drug-kingpin Frank Lucas(Denzel Washington), who ruled Harlem and was total master of his domain. His product was twice as good at half the accustomed price. Cutting out the middle-man, Lucas personally made the trip to the poppy fields of Asia's Golden Triangle to make the deals and made connections to have heroin shipped stateside in the coffins of soldiers killed in Viet Nam. Maybe too honest for his own good, super cop Richie Roberts(Russell Crowe)diligently worked to bring down Lucas, who was believed to be making more than a million dollars a day in drug sales. Lucas would turn informant helping Roberts and a myriad of law enforcement entities arrest crooked cops and foreign nationals, who were paid handsomely to make importing heroin easy as clockwork orchestrated by Lucas. Graphic violence and language. By all appearances American Gangster is as real as you can get and one of those movies not to be missed. Also featured in a very strong cast: Ted Levine, Josh Brolin, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lymari Nadal, Cuba Gooding Jr., Armand Assante, Carla Gugino, Ruby Dee and Clarence Williams III."
"edwagreen","Null","1","4","20 February 2008"," American Gangster-They Glorify Gangsters, don't they? **1/2
","Whether it's ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" or ""American Gangster,"" we have a tendency in motion pictures to glorify gangsters. The fact remains that these people are the absolute scum of the earth for what they have done to society.<br/><br/>Frank Lucas is made out to be the true hero instead of the cop who earnestly tries to bring him down. As a result, Russell Crowe's part as the cop, is really watered down and Denzell Washington, as Lucas, is glorified.<br/><br/>The first hour or so of this film is tedious at best. It is in the second half hour that a gripping story is told of attempts to smuggle in narcotics via the dead bodies of the heroes of the Vietnam War. Corruption is everywhere in this true story including the New York City police department. What a scandal!<br/><br/>As far as Ruby Dee being nominated for best supporting actress in this film, my comment is for what? Her part rivals Judi Dench in ""Shakespeare in Love,"" or Beatrice Straight in ""Network."" Yet, people are predicting that she will be the winner of the award this year. For what? She gave a good slap in the face to Washington but is that really acting? I don't want to hear that Dee will win for the compilation of great performances over the years. Fine, then she should have won years back for far more worthy material."

","The point is: American Gangster isn't revolutionary film - if you expected never-seen before gangster story. But there is main reasons why you'll never notice it: everything is superbly done.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott did amazing job: everything is on its place and fits perfectly - his way of directing carries script without any problem and you'll never have feeling you're bored although film runs over 150 min. Scott did great work with putting together main story and characters personal lives in a way that makes you interested in both. There aren't additional explanations of something viewer already knows - problem many films of this kind have and you'll notice many interesting lines in script that lead to questions director left for audience to think about - very nice. Fact that there are few action scenes shows what kind of director Scott is because film hold its dynamic tag line till last minutes, something to silence those who thought Scott isn't able to successfully direct anything except action.<br/><br/>Russel Crow and especially Denzel Washington gave great performances. Washington would probably earn Oscar nomination if his role wasn't so close to his Training Day bad guy role. Fact he used ""My Man"" line from same film didn't help a lot, although it fits very good.<br/><br/>So, here we are with (over)valued Oscars. Gangster earned 2 nominations and could earn much more without anybody asking any questions. Departed did earn more so Academy could redeem itself to Scorsese for not appreciating his earlier work. They should watch out - they could be redeeming to Scott one day."

","From the reviewers posted by certain people I had got the impression that American Gangster one of the top films to have come out of Hollywood , having said that only very few actors with big names like Crowe and Washington can carry off something as great as this without the egos clashing. For me American Gangster was truly worth all the hype , Ridley Scott set out to tell us a story , not only entertain us and he carried so well that it was so easy to get sucked into it. Denzel Washington played a rather different type of gangster , unlike a drug kingpin like Tony Montana or Nino Brown , George Lucas comes across as a charming caring, figure who at the end of the day was probably conducting business unaware of the ramifications of what he would end up turning Harlem into however Denzel Washington plays this character with such grace that one actually anticipates his presences on screen with his knowledge and Savoy. Russell Crowe as well plays a very flawed character with great ease and really sticks to his guns and during the course of this movie one can say that both men are fighting for what they believe in . Aside from Washington and Crowe everyone else played the part well , it was as if everyone really did enjoy their screen time which actually made it probably more realistic and not to mention the colours,lights, and camera angels used by Scott make this a true beauty to watch. My only problem was that it was over 2 hours long and I did get a neck ache afterwards but however in the whole there was never a scene that dragged on. My conclusion is that American Gangster is homage to the blaxipoltain flicks of the 70's as well as telling us a story which has not been stereotyped into a certain genre. Certainly this movie must be on your '100 movies to watch before I die' list.<br/><br/>American GANGSTER : 8.9 OUT OF 10<br/><br/>THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THE American DREAM..."
"moviesleuth2","5","1","4","3 February 2008"," Great, but its the same schtick
","Like ""Million Dollar Baby,"" Ridley Scott's ""American Gangster"" is a movie that seems to have been completely constructed to show up at Oscar time. Don't get me wrong, both movies are well done, gritty, and well-acted. The problem is...it's still more of the same.<br/><br/>We've seen this movie before. A criminal who is a criminal, despite the fact that he's portrayed with anti-hero sympathy. There's the story of the cop who's trying to catch him, but asking himself why he's doing it at the same time, which runs parallel to the criminal story. Of course, the two main characters don't meet until the end, which is intended to be they climax of the film. Yeah, yeah, we get the picture.<br/><br/>I'm guessing the studio is betting on the sad but true fact that the majority of America defines ""The Matrix"" as a film classic, and has never had any desire to watch any movie made before 1990. The people who fit this description are going to think this is a brilliant movie and may demand it get a ton of Oscars, blah blah blah. But for people with a wider range of film tastes and experiences will recognize that they've seen this movie before. MANY times.<br/><br/>I like Denzel Washington. He's a great actor. But here, he is the exact same person he's always been. It's a good performance, but it's uncannily similar to his other high powered performances, such as ""Training Day."" I can't say the same about Russell Crowe. He's had some good performances, but to be honest I think he's really over-hyped. ""American Gangster"" certainly isn't going to change my opinion.<br/><br/>See it if you want. Just don't expect the ""American classic"" some people make it out to be."
"ste_et","8","1","4","27 January 2008"," American Gangster
","""See, ya are what ya are in this world. That's either one of two things: Either you're somebody, or you ain't nobody.""<br/><br/>This is the philosophy Frank Lucas lives his life by. When it comes to gangster films this sentiment is certainly true as the difference between a cult classic and a forgotten film is exactly the same as the difference between black and white. There isn't really a middle ground for those films that come in between, if they don't compare to such illustrious predecessors they are forgotten. Based on the true story of Frank Lucas' rise to notoriety and fall from grace, American Gangster is a tale of power of corruption set in Ridley Scott's graphic recreation of 1970s Harlem against the backdrop of the Vietnam War. Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) was the driver and bodyguard to 'Bumpy' Johnson, an Italian styled black gangster who ran most of Harlem. Following his boss' death, Lucas emerged from the warring factions to become the heroin kingpin of New York. Importing 100% pure heroin from the suppliers in Asia, to cut out the middle man, allowed him to sell better quality at a lower price. However, his reserved manner and economical lifestyle allowed him to swoop under the radar of the law. Business boomed for the Lucas Empire as the blaxploitation era of the 1970s raged. Enemies began to appear from all walks of life, but he was untouchable  or so he thought.<br/><br/>On the other side of the law was Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), a detective battling his way through a law degree at night school whilst battling for custody of his son. Richie is an idealistic and honest cop who earns the distrust of his corrupt colleagues which leads to him becoming an outcast. The reputation he gains for being 'an honest cop' leads to him being put in charge of a newly formed drugs task-force. His ostracization from the force allows him to see Lucas' rise to fame and fortune from the streets. From here the game of cat and mouse that cop and criminal become engaged in begins.<br/><br/>The paradox of the ethical and family valued 'bad guy' and the womanising, renegade 'good guy' leads to a blurring of audience's loyalties. The two share a rigorous dedication to their ethical codes that means they are set apart from their colleagues allowing for the growth of a mutual respect towards each other. Washington is particularly good as the calm and assured crime lord, only occasionally displaying the ruthless streak that underlined his authority. Crowe plays the dogged detective struggling to maintain his honest approach when his private life is crumbling. The fact that the two central characters only finally meet 20 minutes from the end is the result of an atmospheric tension that builds throughout the film with the stories of both men gradually being drawn together, in a way that is reminiscent of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in Heat. Whereas some gangster films rely on shoot outs and special effects to raise pulse rates, American Gangster, like its protagonist, is much more reserved in showing how Lucas dominated the landscape without much bloodshed. The few scenes that do display his violent streak are powerful in their sparsity. However, the problem is it just seems to drag on for a little too long with not enough happening to keep the viewer gripped to their seats. The running time of 2 hours and 37 minutes could easily have been cut down to around the 2 hour mark and there would not be much of a difference in the story. It is well dialogued, brilliantly acted and powerfully shot but the thing with American Gangster is that it just doesn't quite have enough to make it a 'somebody' but it's too good to be dismissed as a 'nobody'."

"Robert_90","4","1","4","21 January 2008"," OK film - nothing special
","I want to get this out of the way first - American Gangster is a lot like Goodfellas. Of course, that's an easy comparison to make - every gangster film of the past 20 years owes a debt to Scorsese's film, which set the bar with its dynamic performances and compelling yet realistic storyline. Comparing the two films is something of a back-handed compliment because Scott's film is also an engaging affair, but not quite to the same extent as Goodfellas. Maybe because realising just how much it's like Goodfellas distracted a little from Gangster's own merit.<br/><br/>There is quite a bit of merit, though. Both Crowe and Washington deliver good performances. In regards to which was better, I'm going to nominate Washington as giving the better performance. He plays the benevolent gangster well, albeit with his fair share of actions that will polarise the audience (the most memorable being a very public execution of a rival). Crowe pulls the same trick in his own way - a too-honest cop with his own surprises - but Washington is just that extra bit more interesting. The movie is essentially about his character - he made it work well.<br/><br/>Apart from the lead performances that anchor the film, what else does American Gangster have to offer? A decent enough true-crime drama, with few thrills or action but what there is keeps you interested enough over the course of about two and a half hours (if any film can do that, it must be doing something right). Although on its own, American Gangster is a well-made piece of crime drama, it suffers from being derivative of earlier crime movies and even the odd cliché thrown in for good measure (including Josh Brolin as an über-corrupt detective who is an enemy to both Roberts and Lucas). Regardless, if you're into this kind of thing, you should enjoy it a fair bit. Just don't expect anything mind-blowingly original."
"barnsb","8","1","4","18 January 2008"," Great merging of plot directions makes this film an awesome watch
","American Gangster is a movie that must be watched closely in order to be fully appreciated. The character of Richie Roberts is portrayed wonderfully by Crowe and the background behind this character is paved well. Unfortunately the background of the character of Frank Lucas (Washington) was not fully shown to the audience from my perspective. I guess this is the case due to time constraints, but it seems his character launches straight from bodyguard status to drug-lord status without any real progress of development. Despite the background discrepancy with Frank Lucas, Washington portrays the character wonderfully and their is no doubt the acting in this film is top notch, but its expected with this cast.<br/><br/>This movie is able to take the basic plot of drug-lord vs police force, cut it up and add extra plot directions and munch it all together so it ends up being more like drug families vs corrupt police force vs honest police force. And the greatest thing of all, it does it successfully.<br/><br/>You really need to see this movie, its amazing how it is compiled and executed on the screen.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Certainly an original story, although it's probably told in an unoriginal way. The scheme is the one of a family drama, cat and mouse style, and the entertainment is really heart pumping. Wouldn't say the movie is clichéd, on the contrary it's got its originality and charm, focusing perfectly on Ney York city's mean streets. The director provided some unique shots (Vietnam connections, corrupt military personnel and so on). As for the lead actors Russel Crowe is in my opinion much more inspired but the pair works on the whole and never disappoints. This film has attracted a significant audience not only for being boosted by such stars but because it digs deeply in the story with style and pace."

"jemps918","8","1","4","7 January 2008"," A cross between The Godfather and The Departed...
","A cross between The Godfather and The Departed, American Gangster is set in the East Coast in the '70s and based on the true story of how Detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) brought down the low-profile heroin kingpin from Harlem Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington). While both men lay on opposite sides of the law and are notoriously flawed, they uncannily share a rigorous work ethic, enabling them to later conspire against something bigger than themselves.<br/><br/>The opening scene immediately establishes Lucas as a cool and collected gentleman from North Carolina who can get scary when angry. Meanwhile, Roberts is a scruffy but honest cop who is battling with his hostile wife for child custody while he goes to law school.<br/><br/>Both Oscar winners turn in award-worthy performances once more, but it is Crowe who most consistently and easily transforms into his character. He is an imperfect hero who buys dishonesty with honesty. His dedication despite his shortcomings makes the viewer relate to and root for him, even when Lucas tempts him: ""Would you do it again, return US$1M in unmarked bills?"" American Gangster gives hope that police corruption and widespread drug trafficking can be stopped even by the sometimes morally deficient. The message comes across clear with director Ridley Scott's compelling visuals, with crisp contrasts in montages reminiscent of The Godfather. Such deft cinematography could sometimes eclipse the dialogue, which contributes its fair share of memorable quotes.<br/><br/>A parallelism with the Italian mafia's affinity for family is evident when Lucas tells his siblings, ""The most important thing in business is honesty, integrity, hard work... family... never forgetting where we came from,"" and again when Lucas scolds his brother Huey for wearing an attention-getting suit, ""The loudest one in the room is the weakest one in the room!"" Lucas' drive to deliver his product at all costs threatens his downfall, when he refuses to heed his Thai drug supplier's strangely wise advice: ""It's not in my best interest to say this Frank, but quitting while you're ahead, is not the same as quitting."" This biopic doesn't bombard the audience with gore it could easily get away with but instead it allows for thought-provoking moments, such as one launched by Lucas: will putting the bad guy behind bars really change anything? Roberts' gritty retort: ""You represent progress, that's why they hate you. Success has enemies; be unsuccessful and have friends."""

Otherwise, this Ridley Scott film was a waste of my time.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe as Detective Richie Roberts lacked energy. He seems to be half there during the whole film.

"EijnarAmadeus","6","1","4","30 November 2007"," Enjoyable cop-and-crime romp
","Ridley Scott's long-awaited American Gangster runs for 2 hours and 33 minutes; it's a long and slow affair, and I'm not saying that this is a bad thing, because it keeps an enjoyable level of suspense and crime-drama from the very opening of Denzel's Frank Lucas enlightening his victim before emptying his clip in him to the majestic double-ending of church-choir's Amazing Grace and Crowe & Washington finally sharing the screen with vital excitement. So, American Gangster handles its runtime with quite an ease, but - Scott handles a classical cop & criminal topic here, and this requires more of a director in 2007's Hollywood than back in the 70ties; critics and audience (or at least critics) have become more demanding in what's a good thriller and what's not; in other words, Scott needs so show that he's got something fresh, vital and inspired to offer, and this is sadly where American Gangster falls short. Scott's earlier movies as Alien and Blade Runner and even Gladiator pulled off much of its exuberance with its visual spectacularity and greatness, and by no means, American Gangster looks terrific - but couldn't Scott have used his fine visuals even more to his advantage? He doesn't, and instead he focuses on making it more straight-forward, solid and even a bit typical look at the 60ties/70ties New York crime scene. Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe steers the show with sterling performances; Crowe's earnest cop who struggles over his wife-and-son situation in his private life is the only pure cop in a corrupted organization - and Washington's Lucas is a different, calm-smoked and cool up-and-rising gangster who wears a suit not a coat, and shoots one guy instead of six.<br/><br/>Mainly this is an enjoyable gangster-romp that features all of the classical gangster-elements of drive-by-shooting, cigar-smoking, family-issues, beautiful women, cheap drugs (drugs is after all American Gangster's main theme) and cops drinking coffee. And with all these clichéd-elements in place, why doesn't Scott pull up his sleeve and keeps those Aces coming?- no, he doesn't use any of his ""new"" tricks, he keeps both Crowe and Washington down on the carpet, not giving none of them great material and fine show-offs, good material yes, but never great. And there's plenty of supporting roles here, all sterling (Lucas' brother, Mr. Stringer Bell from HBO's the Wire, Lucas' wife to mention some) and American Gangster works utterly fine when it becomes brutal and effective, and this is mainly the two leads operating with great depth and substance, Crowe breathes more life into his character than the script could even hope for, as soon as Crowe opens his mouth in this you know that he'll do great. And American Gangster's brutality is its upper hand, it showcases Harlem and NY perfectly with coldness, grit and glory - from time to time it feels a bit like 21st Century's version of Serpico. And important to say; though it's disappointing classicé-twitch, the movie's firmness and entertainment makes it very good in the final climax. This is a grand achievement for Washington and Crowe, not for Scott - he repeats himself and steers away from originality - but ultimately Washington & Crowe wins, not often does great performances cover over for its director's faults, but American Gangster's does."

Who would not share his fortune with his family? Lucas(Denzel Washington) is sure one of the best family man role I have ever seen however despite the fact of being nice we must not forget that criminals of any kind are not the way of a civilized human as maybe the movie tried to show us(for instance Lucas got out of jail in 15 years that is so so little time for crimes he had done). If you think more real than you can see that if criminals like Lucas get only 15 years for what they had done than probably 10% of people on the earth will try to do the same thing(make money for his child, family) so there would be no fear for the future of their seed,genes, fortune because they can still hide that money and put it to use in future. There is a nice moral lesson in this movie which I kinda liked since it made me dream of perfect world where there would be no corruption and fortune for everyone - that's why I would say I liked the role of Russel Crowe as being one of the very rare that are not dirty cops.

This puts the noses of his competition well out of joint, but Lucas quickly establishes his dominance.

And thus it gives the viewers the opportunity to get to know the characters and to understand them. It gives the viewers the opportunity to experience the full movie and not the cliff notes versions. Most movies just don't do that anymore and I was pleasantly surprised to see it in this movie.<br/><br/>The direction, as always, is topnotch. The acting is unbelievable. Both Crowe and Washington have the opportunity to overact but neither does. They are both on point perfectly. Washington has the type of demanding screen presence that blows everyone else out of the water. Here's the thing with Russell Crowe, he is great at period pieces, he just has a look about him that feels like he's from another time, so this character was just perfect for him.<br/><br/>The movie is truly a delight, so much so, that you can forgive all the nudity and violence because it just adds to the realism the movie reaches for."

That is not a spoiler as this is based on a true story. I also recommend watching the biography of Frank Lucas or reading up on the story of Lucas prior to watching the film.

In the movie Frank Lukas always showed a lot of respect towards his mother.<br/><br/>Some thing I have to admit is that I personally did not like how Frank treated his family members. It seemed all his family members were scared of him. To me his Lukas wife played a boring role. The only interisting scene that involved her was when she almost got killed.

"christopher-day","7","1","6","9 November 2007"," A film that needed to be made, but could have been better.
","American Gangster is a film that tells two stories simultaneously: an African-American gangster who makes is living by means of illegal trade, extortion, and murder, but is a family man who makes family a high priority, and a cop who makes an honest living (too honest according to three-fourths of his department), but is not a good husband and father. The first thing most viewers will notice is likely to be the aforementioned parallels and contrasts with the two characters. This important aspect of the film is handled nicely and is one of its strong points. The main reason that this device works is that it does not get preachy and obvious; rather, the movie merely tells a story letting the viewer note each coincidence and similarity as well as the just-obvious-enough contrasts. Of course, Denzel Washington acts with a level of confidence and assuredness that a moral (as far as gangsters go) gangster who has risen above the Italian mafia would be likely to have. Whether or not the real Frank Lucas behaved in this way, I do not know, but the Frank Lucas in this film maintains his nonchalant demeanor even when he knows he is enjoying freedom that he knows he will not see again for quite some time, which surprised me because I was expecting to see a truly humanized and humiliated Frank Lucas at the end. Not to say it was a bad decision to continue Frank's cavalierly element into his downfall. After all, Washington is damn cool in this movie for lack of a better phrase. Why would anyone want to ruin that? In contrast, Russell Crowe nails his portrayal of Richie Roberts by giving him the lack of assuredness that a cop who is not trusted by his department and cannot seem to raise a family would be likely to have. It is not until he meets face-to-face with Frank Lucas, that he reaps the fruits of his honesty, and realizes that his fight was worth fighting. Another bonus in this film are the scenes in Vietnam when Lucas is acquiring Grade-A product. The addition of this locale is refreshing because the scenes that take place there feel exotic and contrast with the urban setting of the majority of the film (and other gangster films as well). Despite all these positives, there is one significant draw-back, and that is the script. This film relies heavily on star-power, and I kept getting the feeling that there was not much effort put into the script. This film is missing the colorful characters and witty dialog of films like Miller's Crossing and The Godfather. I understand that this film is bounded by the confines of being a biopic, but the fact is that this is an original screenplay. There are a handful of memorable scenes here, but not enough lines. The humorous scene when Lucas guns down a man in public and sits back down to enjoy his meal is treated to the hackneyed line, ""now what was I saying?"" This script is not as clever as it should be. Nonetheless, its a great story with enough gravity to it to entertain, but it is not the awards-contender that I was expecting."
"bobbobwhite","8","1","6","6 November 2007"," Denzell owned this film
","I've read a lot about Frank Lucas, the Harlem drug lord of the 80's depicted in this story, and even though I liked this film for pure entertainment, it did vary so much from the truth about Lucas that it was closer to fiction. It did do the broad strokes about his life pretty well, but purposely added or subtracted many connecting details for greater audience entertainment value. Director Ridley Scott usually puts a lot more suspense, fear and terror into his films so I was surprised that there was so much less than his usual in this story of the kill or be killed jungle of street drug dealers in Harlem. There is almost no life on earth tougher and more life threatening every second of the day than that of a drug lord, and it was in reality much more threatening to his life and that of his family than was shown.<br/><br/>Denzell Washington as Lucas, even though he is as coolly intense as an actor can be, did not let much ""street"" break through his high and mighty, cool cat demeanor, even when the story might have been better with more of it for greater crime realism. However, his prominent role was by far the best one in the film and more convincing than Russell Crowe as Richie Roberts, an(the only?)honest cop soon to become a defense lawyer, who dogged Lucas to jail after he finally found out that Lucas was at the top of the drug dealer food chain, a perch that was heavily supported by the men in blue, most of whom were on the take. Crowe was satisfactory overall in his bad husband/good cop role, but it was Washington who really owned this film. He is such a powerful presence as an actor, and when he was watching or listening to someone you could almost feel the wind from the wheels turning in his head. That alone conveyed well the stone cold calculation necessary for survival at the top in his jungle.<br/><br/>A very entertaining film all in all, and I was glad to see that the storyline didn't kill Lucas off in a a fit of typical Hollywood, crime-does-not-pay, phony comeuppance, but he was shown briefly as he walked out of prison in his $50 suit, looking sadly out of place and a nobody in the modern outside world after so many lost years in prison. What could be more pitiful and humiliating than that one thing for anyone who used to have real power? Does any crime ever pay if you have to spend even one night in the very cruel and unloving embrace of the graybar hotel? Not to me."

"movieman430","9","1","6","4 November 2007"," A welcome return to the traditional gangster formula.
","The first frames of American Gangster show Frank Lucas, Denzel Washington, setting a man on fire and then shooting him to death. You would think this would set the tone for an incredibly violent film. Instead, American Gangster decided to take it s...(read more)low, and build its tension at a slow boil over it's rather long 157 minute run time. American Gangster is a very good, very effective, and somewhat unsettling gangster film that will almost certainly have it's place at the 2008 Oscars. It is the first mainstream gangster film to return to original genre format set up in the 30s, the rise and fall of a gangster. American Gangster is two stories. First it is the story of Frank Lucas' rise to power as a heroin dealer in the 1970s. This is where the film spends most of it's time; exploring both the business side, and the personal side, the film spends a lot of it's time on Frank's family. The second story is of Richie Roberts, Russell Crowe, a narcotics detective attempting to take down a drug empire in a world of dirty cops. Both stories are equally captivating and if there is one fault of the movie it is that the two stories feel awkwardly separate at first, and that's because they are. I said earlier that the tension is set at a slow boil. Throughout the film there are seemingly random shots of drug use used to establish setting, and Ridley Scott cleverly sneaks in Vietnam coverage on the television that in many cases parallels the story. This simmering tension is incredibly effective, making the sociopathic tendencies of Frank Lucas really jump off the screen. The violence is often abrupt, gritty, and once the climax of the film is reached, we're given one of the better, most realistic shoot outs I've seen in a while. The acting in American Gangster is top notch, Denzel delivers his lines with an unsettling calm that really makes the character feel dangerous. Russell Crowe makes the cop feel endearing and yet human, and keeps you rooting for him. In the end, American Gangster is a really really good gangster film and on top of that, just a great movie in general. Does it rank up with the crime classics like the Godfather and Goodfellas, no, but it's damn close. Ridley Scott takes all the right elements and makes them fit into one incredibly entertaining film."

A film with this type of setting is crying out for a New Hollywood brat like Scorsese to bring it to life . Scott merely gives it artificial respiration <br/><br/>That said Ridley Scott isn't helped by the popular culture we live in . This type of story has been done to death . An American gangster film has a fatherless figure pursue the American dream through criminal means only to find that the dream becomes a nightmare and it costs them everything .

"willmarhoffer","9","1","7","12 November 2007"," masterful director + masterful actors = masterful film
","Once again director Ridley Scott makes a genre film that may very well define that genre for years to come. Based on the real life exploits of Harlem Heroin Kingpin Frank Lucas, and the cop who brought his empire down, this powerful film does an excellent job of recreating the 70s. Russel Crowe delivers a fine performance as cop Richie Roberts, but this is Denzel's film all the way. His prescence on screen carries a weight of calculating, but doomed power. Frank Lucas is one of the most memorable characters I've seen. In a film with nudity, violence, and drug use it all too easily could have become exploitative, but surprisingly these elements are merely necessary parts of the environment in which the characters live. This one's all about the characters. A near perfect Rise and Fall film and contender for several Oscars."

This story is an amazing one, it tells us about an actual person who went from being at the bottom to making his way to the top. Frank Lucas went from being a driver to a ""mob boss"" bigger than the Italians; which is a huge deal. This portrayal of Frank Lucas' life was magnificent, Denzel did a fantastic job and portrayed every emotion with complete clarity and utter brilliance. And even though Lucas was kind of a butt face he knew what he wanted and how to get it, he was an advocate for himself, his family and unlike most mobs he had morals and values he stuck with!!!"

Before watching the movie, I did my research on the huge Harlem heroin epidemic in the late 60's and early 70's. I learned about the key players involved in the movie which really made it a lot more enjoyable. Its really funny how all the ""King Pins"" were suppose to be these ""Hardcore Gangsters"" who ran Harlem, but in really it was just clicks of 5 or 10 people who were friends in the drug business. Yes, they had respect, but they lost it as quickly as they got it. And in the end, all of them ""Ratted,Turned,Flipped"" what ever you want to call it. They all sold each other out like cowards to save their behinds. So, you can call them American.... But way to far from Real Gansters."
"julesjem","9","1","7","6 November 2007"," A well crafted picture of the ""real"" war that was going on during Vietnam.
","One might imagine that ""American Gangster"" is merely another cops and robbers, good verses evil, film noire esq movie. Though this is true, there are so many other wonderful elements that are incorporated to bring it out of the typical good guy verses bad guy role. First, performances by both Washington and Crowe were very meaningful to their respected characters. In particular, Crowe portrayed a man who set himself apart from his daily life because of his morality. He was convincing and unforgettable.<br/><br/>What really set this film apart from others of the same genre was the fact that Ridley Scott included constant backdrops of the Vietnam war, clips of Richard Nixon giving various addresses on the nation's condition, and Scott took a risk by taking a bite out of America's biggest war to date: the war on drugs/drug use and organized crime. It's wonderful that when the film ends you are not sure who represents the ""good"" and who represents the ""evil.""<br/><br/>While there could be disputes made over the acting, be it a matter of opinion, Ridley Scott delivers yet another amazing film to his credentials. The 2 hour and 37 minute movie masters its subjects and delivers not only action, reality, and American history, but art as well. Scott paints a clear picture of some of the problems that the United States has within it's own borders. Certainly something to think about and appreciate given the current state of the world."

"michaelgs","7","1","7","5 November 2007"," Standard gangster film made good by performances and occasionally brilliant directing
","A biopic about a drug dealer starring Washington, Crowe, and Scott. Thank God for the Oscars. It is wonderful seeing two actors with such brilliance (both have appeared in several films already this year; guess dominating the Oscar races makes for steady employment in Hollywood) and a good director to guide them through their material.<br/><br/>The movie suffers a little from having two such big movie stars in one film. This is mostly Frank Lucas's story, and I didn't really get to know him as much as I would have liked. Russel Crowe plays a police officer who seems to have a crummy family life just to give him a fatal flaw. Russel Crowe is the right man to play him, injecting a good deal of street sense intelligence into him and making him gruff enough to counter his role as the purer-than-driven-snow cop.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, I will say that the most effective scene in the movie is when the two meet for the first time. This scene left me shaking with emotion, not because the scene hasn't been played out in thousands of gangster/caper movies, or because of the soundtrack which has played in thousands more. Seeing these two characters for the first time is so well shot that there is a potency and mystery in simply these two men just staring at each other.<br/><br/>The movie is not without flaws though. One key part of the story is the corrupt nature of the NYPD Special Narcotics Unit. However, the point-man for this part of the story seems strangely insulated from the rest of the story. He does a lot of generally sleazy things and makes a few hazy threats at Denzel and Crowe, but doesn't inject himself in enough to make the payoff entirely satisfying. Also, while the courtroom scenes involving the Crowe character's divorce are brief, my suspicion is they would have been more interesting on the cutting room floor, especially if they had made room for more scenes involving Lucas's rough edges. My guess is even the most stylish gangster in Harlem wouldn't be as smooth as Mr. Washington."

As a whole, it is a fractured mess of bits and pieces that never gel together.<br/><br/>What the movie really needed was flashbacks. Perhaps if the movie was told on the last day of his getting out of jail, with flashbacks of his youth, his early days with Bumpy where he learned his craft, then we could appreciate it later. But, the movie missed the mark for me, with no explanation of motivation for any characters except greed.

"lotus_chief","9","1","7","4 November 2007"," One of the best films of the year; although not groundbreaking for its genre.
","It's pretty interesting hearing the overall consensus on American Gangster. Either you love it or hate it. I don't know how it can be so clear cut but whatever. American Gangster is a very well executed film; the acting and directing is first-class. The hype around this film ultimately hurt it however, it was really billed as a 'modern day Godfather'. I doubt very highly that that was the aim of the movie makers here.American Gangster is nothing like that. Nothing new is done here as far as the crime genre is concerned, it's just so BRILLIANT in its execution.<br/><br/>Acting <br/><br/>If there was any doubt as to Denzel's acting ability and prowess, there shouldn't be after his performance here. Hell, there shouldn't have been any doubt after Malcolm X, and that was 15 years ago! He and Morgan Freeman have a similar presence on screen; he is simply a master and commands respect and attention. There's nothing else for me to say about him, he carried the film. Russell Crowe was very good as well. His character's story is not liked very much, but I for one liked his story. From his character dealing with corruption to the issues with his wife; I liked seeing not only Frank Lucas come up in the drug world, but Richie Roberts (Crowe) come up in the 'cop world'. Crowe's character added a good balance to Denzel's powerful performance; and I felt the two sides of the story came together very nicely. As far as the supporting cast, Ruby Dee..not exactly a role that really pushed her to the limits, but she hit it on the head with great subtlety. Arguably the best supporting actor in the film, in my eyes, was RZA. He really showed that he's dedicated to making it in the movie industry in more ways than one (movie scoring & acting); and he REALLY came through here. It was ironic seeing him play a cop, but he did it very well.his 'junkie' scene near the end was classic. T.I. & Common were decent as well, but they really didn't have much to do; RZA had the biggest role out of all of them, and out-shined them all. I'm not a fan of Cuba Gooding Jr., and I must admit I was surprised seeing him here, but he was good as Nicky Barnes. His one (well, only) scene with Denzel was a sight to see; it's a great scene; right up there with Denzel & Crowe in the end. Armand Assante was a welcomed sight as the Don, I've always liked him as a character actor, and he does mob guys flawlessly. Josh Brolin was wonderful as the corrupt detective; he was as creepy as Matt Dillon in ""Crash"".<br/><br/>Direction <br/><br/>You can see Ridley Scott's influence throughout this movie. There's such a sense of control, pace and outright direction throughout. From the set pieces to the camera shots and how the story is presented, there's a very mature look and feel to the movie. This is one of the classier crime films, reminiscent of Michael Mann's touch in ""Heat"". There's still a grittiness to it, which again is telling of Scott's direction.<br/><br/>Story <br/><br/>With the public being bombarded with the 'real story' behind Frank Lucas on various documentaries on television in the days and weeks leading up to the film's release, this also hurt the film. There are reports that Lucas himself said that the film is 60% accurate, and if you saw the documentaries on Lucas before seeing this film, naturally you would be disappointed somewhat, because everything wouldn't add up. I am fortunate that I didn't see all of the extra features on television, no doubt done to further hype the movie which it REALLY didn't need. People have to remember that this is BASED on a true story. This is a movie, NOT a documentary. The more people realize that, the better.<br/><br/>Hype <br/><br/>The hype machine for American Gangster was too much in my opinion; and ultimately took away from the film. I will admit that I came away with slight disappointment when the end credits started rolling. There was such a craze and hype surrounding the film that you couldn't help but expect a ""next Godfather/Goodfellas/Casino/Scarface"" type of filma cult classic of sorts that's so grand in stature that you had no doubt that it would indeed be an addition to that list of genre-defining, pioneering gangster films that we all love. It falls short of that, which is why feeling a little disappointment afterwards is almost inevitable. There is nothing new here; nothing innovative, nothing genre-defining (or RE-defining for that matter). No 'extremely realistic shootout scene' as featured in ""Heat"", or ""quotable-laden, cocaine filled shootouts"" as featured in ""Scarface"". No characters as memorable and legendary as featured in ""Godfather"", ""Scarface"" or ""Goodfellas"". Denzel's Frank Lucas comes damn close (because he's THAT good), but I don't think it quite reaches that status. There is nothing in American Gangster that REALLY stands out in that way.<br/><br/>I would say, however, that as far as black gangster films go, it may very well be THE best ever made to date. With its sheer brilliance in its execution, acting, directing, storytelling, maturity and class; I could say with confidence that it is. And that, in and of itself, makes it one of the best movies of the year hands down (I see at least 3 Oscar noms here), if not one of the best of the new millennium.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

Anyone who has read anything about the life of Lucas would agree that Denzel Washington did a wonderful job portraying his character. It's one of the better gangster movies I've seen in a long time. Based on true events, the movie is very well written and performed. I don't understand how people can say it was horrible. It's based on true events, which can't be taken too far out of context or it will lose it's truth. All of the actors and actresses did an exceptional job.

"nemrutmail-sf","8","1","7","4 November 2007"," Excellent portrayal of the human condition
","Unlike other reviewers, this movie resonated w/me on more of human level and less on the gangster theme. It's as if Ridley Scott used the latter as an excuse to explore the duality that is inherent in all of us and the often subtle shades of gray between what is considered good and bad in our society.<br/><br/>The story itself was beautifully portrayed by Denzel Washington as the family-oriented yet ruthless drug dealer and Russell Crowe as the straight but womanizing cop and neglectful parent. The story raises the question of what is 'good' vs 'bad'? Are they merely a social construct impeding our natural human tendencies, or perhaps, simply one and the same inherent in all living beings. Afterall, how do we reconcile the behavior among very human primates who lovingly care for their young but will not hesitate to brutally kill and eat the young of other primates? American Gangster is one of the few Hollywood gems that explore the deeper, often contradictory nature of human behaviour, and in my opinion, far surpasses other films in the same genre."
"vovazhd","8","1","7","4 November 2007"," ""American Gangster""; fitting name
","Crime-drama/gangster movies generally fare well (The Godfather, Goodfellas, The Departed, etc.). American Gangster continues that streak. It follows the rise and fall of a black family crime empire, headed by Frank Lucas (played by Denzel Washington). Lucas is successful because he imports drugs directly from Vietnam, resulting in a stronger dose for lower price. The real hurdle is met when a detective, Richie Roberts (played by Russell Crowe) pursues a lead to bring down the empire. The plot starts off slow, following the distinct daily lives of Lucas and Roberts. After the first hour or so of setting things up, everything comes together to form a compelling story. The last hour is extremely high quality across the board.<br/><br/>The direction from Ridley Scott is as expected: clean and elegant. The acting from Washington and Crowe is also as expected: powerful and believable. These two factors are the key to what makes American Gangster so good. It reminded me in several ways of The Departed: the first hour sets up and develops the characters, while the rest is a beautiful clue hunt and battle of smarts. The whole thing is unpredictable but flows in a logical way. One thing that I especially liked was the Vietnam War reflections. Throughout the film, there are snippets of television news programs that reveal the breakdown of the war. It effectively parallels the growth and decay of Lucas's drug empire. The drug production sets were realistic and effective. While most of the movie revolves around the drama aspects of crime, there were some fantastic action sequences.<br/><br/>In the end, I was left with plenty of material to think about. There are interesting points about the drug empire and moral questions that arise from the conclusion. The main message is not hidden; it is expressed explicitly in a dialog between the two characters toward the end. Ultimately, I was left satisfied. One of the best movies of the year, so don't miss it."

With a great cast, director, writer and producer I knew it was destined to be at the very least a good movie. But that's all it was -- a good movie. I saw this movie earlier tonight and left thinking I had seen a good movie -- nothing more. I saw nothing I hadn't seen before. But what I had seen was great acting, directing, and a great soundtrack. I wasn't surprised at any point but left pleased. Yes, Denzel Washington was great in this movie and he displayed much of what he used to win his Best Actor Award in Training Day. I think he may get nominated for Best Actor but will not win.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe. How was Russell Crowe? He showed he can continue to play a wide array of characters and make them believable but his performance wasn't unbelievable. Don't bet on him getting a nomination this year.<br/><br/>As the Academy is inconsistent, I don't think this film will prevail as the favorite. But wait, it's inconsistent -- so who knows? I can say this though: expect this to entertain you even if it is quite long which means something.<br/><br/>8/10. I'm looking forward to No Country For Old Men to satisfy my craving for a classic."

","My wife and I have been looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time. She loves Denzel and I like Russel Crowe in everything he has made. Also, Ridley Scott has been my favorite director since the death of Mr. Kubrick; Blade Runner, Gladiator, Master and Commander, are all examples of his brilliance. I mention all this because although I thought American Gangster was a good film, and Mr. Washington and Mr. Crowe were both excellent in their roles, I am a little disappointed with Ridley Scott's directing. The character development was good, the feel of the sixties and seventies was right on and the music was great, but the movie was just not the tour de force I was hoping for. I don't know exactly what it was, some other people have said; the length of the movie was too long, or the movie didn't flow as well as it should, and they may be right. But these are not things you come to expect from a Ridley Scott movie. If anything, most of his movies leave me feeling like there should have been more. Anyway, this was a good film and although it might have lagged a little in the middle, I still recommend this movie for the great performances of the actors."
"mvb2","10","1","7","3 November 2007"," GREAT MOVIE 10/10....Denzel is the man
","Anyone who has ever enjoyed watching a Russel Crowe or Denzel Washington movie can't go wrong by watching this one. The two of them together make a great effort to put up a fight for movie of the year. Denzel's acting is great and I only wonder why he has not been putting out more movies. Despite whether or not Denzel portrayed Frank Lucas as his actual character, it still is awesome to see him craft the part into his own and make Frank a likable individual. For 2 1/2 hours you are strictly engaged to the movie, which is very hard to do. It feels as if anything can happen at anytime in the movie making every character decision suspenseful. The only thing I think should have been different was the ending. Richie Roberts should have been waiting outside of his car for Denzel. I know it was based off a true story but the ending was just to dull for me and didn't cut it."
"adina981","10","1","7","3 November 2007"," Excellent Movie-Period
","Reading the comment for American Gangster made me wonder if that person was asleep for the movie. I am pretty sure they were because this movie is engaging from the first scene to the end. Denzel, who plays Frank Lucas, is in my mind, very reminiscent of Al Pacino in the Godfather-he is cool, calm, collected and methodical. The plot ties in everything-war, organized crime, politics, drugs and money-OH MY! This is truly the inter-workings of a man who many people underestimated because he was black. When you see the effects of his business, it really opens your eyes. To me one of the best movies of the year hands down! The ending was incredibly surprising-definitely worth a trip to the movie theater to see!"

","I went into this movie expecting a lot from it.. because of who is staring in it and what it represents.. Well i was very pleased this movie grabs u from the beginning and doesn't let you go until the end. Denzel deserves an Oscar for this one no doubt, i would say this was one of his top performances.. no so much the same for russel crowe but was still entertaining.. This is in my opinion the best movie since casino and goodfellas but its not a wiseguy movie. It shows you the gangster side of the story and the good clean non corrupt cop side of the story then comes together in the end.. This definitely deserves movie of the year without a doubt in my mind... 9/10 for me.."
"lostein","10","1","7","3 November 2007"," Riveting Powerful and Exciting
","I was very impressed with the acting all across the board. I thought Russell was great...maybe its the role, maybe its Denzel always being Denzel, but I thought Russell had the harder, less flashy but more nuanced role and he was great. But all the many supporting players rose to the occasion. I was surprised to see some actors I hadn't realized would be in the film like Joe Morton and Ted Levine. I think the big revelation is Josh Brolin...this should make his career if he doesn't blow it picking bad projects down the road. Many of the scenes will haunt you... and there is a line (don't worry, I won't give it away) that really cracked-up me and my 3 friends who all work in law firms, we just burst out laughing. I think you'll know it when you hear it.<br/><br/>One indication of how people felt.... even at its long running time there was hardly any movement...i.e. people getting up to hit the restrooms... people seemed riveted.<br/><br/>This film brought back the wonderful days of movie-making from the 30's - 50's when yes there were stars but supporting players also got a lot of attention and good material. There is a lot of texture, wonderful cinematography and food for the mind. I will be seeing it again."
"buzzbruin","7","1","7","3 November 2007"," Not as good as I expected
","After all the hype, I expected more. It is way too long for a simple story. It is too derivative with steals from Godfather, Good Fellas and number of other gangster films. The revelation to me was a great performance by Crowe, probably his best. He played it perfectly--an underplayed restrained but in the end a magnificent job of acting. I never realized how really good he is as an actor, He plumbed the depth of this good cop and yet made him all too human, showing his angst as well as his moral certitude. For once he did not rely on his persona and charm. Acting students should see him if they want to see a big star show how really good a star can be!! I admire him for stopping to give such a great acting job in the middle of a star-laden career. Denzel also gave a wonderful performance. Even though he relied on his superb electric personality. Any film he is in is usually worth watching. He is at the top of his craft, here going from suave polished kingpin to savage killer.But the rest of the cast except for Brolin is wasted. He gives another amazing acting job and shows he is a top professional. The film was poorly edited and Zalians script was Disjointed and character development other than the leads was non-existing. It is surely worth seeing for the two stars work but because of the poor writing and editing it doesn't rise to the level of the great crime films."
"titopejaten-1","10","1","7","3 November 2007"," Godfather = The Departed = American Gangster
","That is how good I think this movie is, is right up there with the best.

This is the kind long movie that don't fell long at all, in fact if this movie is make in three franchise movie with this cast I will watch every second of it and by DVD, see it again and again. As usual after seeing a true story movie I check out in internet about who is this guy where they are right know and I thing is a shame they don't make it in a three part sequel.

"blanbrn","6","1","7","3 November 2007"," In depth crime drama that stays well bottled up in it's own period of violence, power, and corruption.
","""American Gangster"" is clearly a film that stands as one of those classic time pieces of power and shows it's culture very strong. Directed by Ridley Scott who shows so much power and greed in this drama as it showcases the rise of power of real-life 1970's Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas(Denzel Washington) and the struggles of a conflicted cop Richie Roberts(Russell Crowe). The contrast is typical good guy against bad yet the viewer sees both as conflicted as Roberts a divorced cop with his own problems of women and commitment while Lucas is seen enjoying success as a family man from illegal means as he makes his fortune thru smuggling heroin from Southeast Asia. Really a good cop like film that captured the time and culture of the 70's well by showing the rise of the street drug culture really the film brings back memories of ""The French Connection"". As typical with gangster films this is filled with greed, blood, and most of all corruption. The performances are strong from both titans Crowe and Washington as this was really a good culture film that stays bottled up so well in it's 70's time frame yet it ends in my opinion showing corruption showcased as a champion like theme which has became so common in our money hungry culture."
"ferguson-6","8","1","7","2 November 2007"," My Man
","Greetings again from the darkness. Every now and then we experience the convergence of a creative team who each bring their ""A"" game. Director Ridley Scott has had ups and downs but certainly was focused on this project. Writer Steve Zaillan has delivered a couple of screenplays along the way that were probably nothing more than paychecks. We all know Denzel Washington has been known to work for the money and not the art. This group partners here with acting stud Russell Crowe to remind us of how cool movies can be.<br/><br/>One of the more fascinating things about the film is how the two powerful leads don't share a scene until 80% of the film is over. Based on a true story, Denzel plays Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas as a street wise, true to the gangster code, businessman on a mission. It is my favorite Denzel role ever. He moves just like an animal on the prowl, eyes always moving ... until he sends the cold stare at someone before uttering ""My Man"" ... which is usually one of the last things they hear.<br/><br/>Crowe is just tremendous as the squeaky clean cop, who sucks as a father and husband, but is true to the code of justice and law. A pariah for turning in a trunk load of untraceable cash, Crowe is moved to a special drug investigative unit and he takes the assignment very seriously indeed! Watching him peel back the layers of the investigation and having it turn on a $50,000 fur coat and microwave oven, really is compelling. Once again, Crowe is at his peak. OK, the guy had a momentary lapse in ""A Good Year"" (directed by Ridley Scott) but his resume is tough to match by most any actor.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is stellar and affecting. For some reason, he is not listed in the credits, but Clarence Williams III is Bumpy, Lucas' boss and mentor. Williams is perfect for the tough, yet pensive leader. Josh Brolin (""Grindhouse"") is chilling as the corrupt NY detective. I wanted to shoot him myself. Long lost Armand Assante is captivating as a drug lord who just can't compete with Lucas, so he partners up. Cuba Gooding, jr. escapes from crappy kid movies long enough to play a frightening gangster who loves the spotlight and doesn't enjoy being dissed. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Ruby Dee and Joe Morton all have nice turns as well.<br/><br/>The final showdown with Denzel and Crowe reminds a bit of ""Heat"" when Pacino and Deniro FINALLY share a scene. With a touch of ""Serpico"" and ""Blow"", this one adds the touch of dueling codes ... street vs. cop. Just a fascinating (mostly) true story with amazing performances! I really love good movies!"
"ClaytonDavis","7","1","7","2 November 2007"," An American Tale: Washington goes East
","Director Ridley Scott brings to the screen, American Gangster, the true story of Frank Lucas, the notorious drug smuggler during the 60s and 70s revolutionized the drug industry. Oscar winner Steven Zaillian writes the crime piece but doesn't provide the viewer with enough fuel to launch the film off the ground. The countdown to take off was great and then the viewer stayed stagnant with the engines going for nearly forty-five minutes before the rocket took off. All the dialogue seemed too forced and too aggressive to engage us into the film. It was like a five year old telling us to ""Watch this, watch this."" Alright Mr. Scott and Mr. Zaillian, I'll watch just stop telling me to do so. I think there was too much anticipation built up into a mediocre storyline.<br/><br/>Academy Award winner Denzel Washington stars as Lucas bringing forth a candy cane version of his ""Alonzo"" in Training Day. As the ferocious Frank, Washington manages to inherit all the fury and anger of a troubled young individual yearning for success and leave his inhibitions at the door. As a terrific turn for the veteran actor Washington does an admiral job on a character we hardly know and introduces him to us full force. How can Washington manage to be so good and make all this seem effortless? Beats me, but the fact that it looks so easy and the character doesn't demand too much of Washington may be his undoing in this upcoming awards season. While a nomination isn't out of the question, with two wins to his credit, this performance holds no measure to his previous works. Zaillian was unsure how malicious he wanted to portray Lucas and ended up portraying him as incredibly unsure of himself and how he wanted to be. But maybe that's the character and Scott just failed to let us know.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe plays Detective Richie Roberts, a narcotics cop battling more than the drug war on the streets of New York. The monotone detective never lets Crowe break out of his exterior tough demeanor. A big star like Crowe definitely takes on this supporting turn with a sense of humility and that perhaps is the triumph of the performance. With big starring turns in Gladiator, Cinderella Man, and A Beautiful Mind, I would never expect Crowe to take on such a quiet role and do it with dignity. An impressive turn but doesn't have the pivotal scene that one actor yearns for that steals any scene.<br/><br/>With 90% of the film having Washington and Crowe separated, the anxious and satisfying meeting in the finale settled all tension built up throughout the film's narrative. Ridley Scott seems on the back burner of this picture as he allows his stars to run the show. The supporting cast even shows some brightness off and on.<br/><br/>It's Ruby Dee as Mama Lucas that capitalizes on her limited screen time. As a veteran actress she does have the power and potential to break into the extremely weak Supporting Actress race. She shows vulnerability yet an intense courage that evokes the audience when she's on screen.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin's exciting and villainous turn as a crooked cop turns out to be a strong turn for the actor who is having one hell of a year with an acclaimed turn in No Country for Old Men. Chiwitel Ejifor has a presence in a film that is soothing but doesn't flow with the characters he chooses. He might be Hollywood's best kept secret at the moment with the wrong roles.<br/><br/>In the end, American Gangster may not have enough steam to jump into the Best Picture race. With Scott being so ""overdue"" for a Oscar, that may the film's only hope. With comparisons be thrown around to The Departed, (which doesn't measure by a mile) last year's winner, the film already has an uphill climb ahead. Serious potential for Washington and Dee for this year's Oscar race. The film is enjoyable but tries too hard to start off with a bang and ends up leaving the viewer disenchanted and we spend too much of the premise trying to play catch up.<br/><br/>Grade: ***/****"

","I had the opportunity to see a special screening of American Gangster, staring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. The movie was outstanding! It is one of the best of 2007. Both Denzel and Russell's acting is flawless! It was such a joy to watch these two extraordinary actors go toe to toe in this intense, fast paced film. I enjoyed the pace of the film as well as the development of the main characters. There were two scenes in particular that didn't contain any dialogue that really stood out to me. One is when Frank Lucas ( Denzel's character) is at the reception after the funeral of his mentor and he's watching all the people around him. As a viewer you're wondering what's going through his mind, while he's observing everyone. <br/><br/>I think he was picking out the people who he could trust and the people who were really sincere in expressing their grief. The other scene is when Russell's character( Richie Roberts) is sitting in the court room, and he's staring at his wife. He soon realizes what he has to do. It was simply brilliant! I hope both of these two great actors will get nominations for their outstanding performances!"

","this is one of the best based on a true story gangster dramas i have ever seen. this film goes right up there with Goodfellas. the only issue i have with the film is how sudden the end seems to occur. the way things began to quickly unravel was totally unexpected. having knowledge of the back story, or the actual story, makes this film even more interesting. the relationship between Frank Lucas and Ritchie Roberts is not portrayed in the film with great detail, but the subtleties of the beginning of the relationship are introduced. although Lucas is an unapologetic criminal, he is also a business and family man. Roberts is honest to a fault with serious family issues. the ironic parallels are presented in the film in very interesting visual sequences. this movie does not try to turn Lucas into a hero, but it is difficult not to admire what Lucas was able to achieve given his environment. there are many reasons to see this movie. if you like gangster movies, see this. if you like Denzel, see this. if you like movies that actually employ African-American talent, see this. finally, if you just want to see an interesting story of two highly motivated individuals with opposing goals, see this.<br/><br/>not surprisingly, the real life relationships that were portrayed in this film are even more interesting than as portrayed in the film."

He first came to light (to me) in Romper Stomper, which no doubt brings him to the attention of the likes of Ridley Scott when casting for similar movies.

","American Gangster is a great film and, I believe, is sure to become one of the classic ""gangster"" movies. Based on a true story, and set in the 1970's in New York City, gangster Frank Lewis becomes the most successful drug dealer in the city. Lucas begins buying heroin straight from the manufacturer, and creates a monopoly in the heroin business in New York. Lucas moves his family to New York after his business has taken off, and each of his brothers begin working for him. Detective Richie Roberts, a good cop out to end heroin sales, decides that the only way to bring down the drug rings is to go after the drug lords themselves. Met with dirty cops, and bullets around every corner, Roberts is determined to bring down Frank Lucas and his drug ring. Will he be able to catch Frank Lucas, stay alive doing it, and bring down New York's most notorious Heroin dealer? Denzel Washington (Frank Lucas) and Russell Crowe (Richie Roberts) are excellent throughout the film. Washington has that demeanor about him that when he walks into a room, he can instill terror, but still be a lovable guy. Crowe is also excellent, as usual, working with director Ridley Scott once again. Crowe also worked with Scott on Gladiator, which is another film I would highly recommend. American Gangster is very similar to Gladiator, with just a modern day story in place of ancient Rome. Scott does an excellent job at recreating New York in the early 70's, pulling the viewer even further into the life of crime. Costumes and sets are done wonderfully, and the cinematography is shot in a darker-than-real-life way to present the type of lavish lifestyle of Lucas, and the raw, dirty lives of the junkies in the world that we are taking a peak into. Themes of strong family ties, and how a life of crime can destroy a person run throughout, and should be easily noticed by the viewer. Some will not like the ending, but I think that overall, Ridley Scott does an excellent job looking in to the life of Frank Lucas in American Gangster."
"dasheight","8","1","8","6 November 2007"," Fantastic
","Ridley Scott's most driven film in ages and simply one of the most entertaining crime epics in years. What's most fascinating is how low-key Crowe's and Washington's performances are, considering the nature of the story. It's unfair to compare one film to another, but if we're strictly talking genre, it would have to fall somewhere between ""Scarface"" and ""Serpico"" - while falling just short of those films. ""American Gangster"" is, so far, the most entertaining film of the year. Go into the theater, buy some popcorn, settle back and after the previews are over, prepare to have a time at the movies you haven't had in a long time - it's a great story told by a great filmmaker."
"Birdhasflown","9","1","8","4 November 2007"," Ridley Scott fashions Crowe's intensity and Washington's commandingly cool presence in one of most entertaining crime pictures in ages
","Audiences know a good crime-saga when they see one, as American Gangster brought in $16 million dollars on Friday alone according to showbiz-data.com, setting itself to double the weekend take of last years destined crime-classic The Departed. The proof is in the pudding as famed British director Ridley Scott helms the true life story of drug lord Frank Lucas and the detective on his trail, Richie Roberts in Scott's greatest conceived film since Gladiator. Scott beautifully and brutally orchestrates Russell Crowe's determined and intense Roberts and Denzel Washington's smooth but fierce Lucas, in a sublime crime epic that transcends the genre. <br/><br/>Frank Lucas's boss passes away in the beginning of film, prompting him to step into his shoes. Denzel Washington embodies Lucas as a cool commanding criminal who wears business suits rather then super-fly fur coats and jewelry as he adheres to keep a low-profile. Lucas carries profound ideals such as ""the loudest guy in the room is the weakest,"" and that the man who draws the most attention to himself is the one that ends up in jail. He is in a lot of ways the Michael Corleone of Harlem as his intelligence and poise promote fear in his enemies. Although a gentlemen, Lucas is not afraid to conduct vicious acts of violence as he walks up to rival mobsters in broad day light and guns them down. This is one of Washington's most multi-layered characters, and he pulls it off with ease.<br/><br/>In noticing the high quantity of narcotics in Asia during the Vietnam War, Lucas immediately gets on a plane for Bangkok to work out a drug trafficking deal to get pure heroin in the United States. By securing this ""product"" he cuts out the middle man, thus causing his power and control to grow. He executes his plan with fortitude as he quickly becomes the city's leading drug lord. <br/><br/>Lucas's rise to mafia kingpin paints an engrossing portrait of capitalism in its most distasteful form, as Lucas becomes $150 million dollars richer as his product baffles police, junkies, and other criminals alike with its potency and lower price; and the audience feels the same effect. <br/><br/>The late 1960s and early 70s are fleshed out with breathtakingly dark and menacing cinematography. Ridley Scott and cinematographer Harris Savides heighten Gangster's realism as its stage is set upon gritty, foreboding mirages of night clubs and alleyways, where desperate junkies, crooked cops, and criminals loom everywhere. Savides had conveyed such dark gloomy visions in The Game and Zodiac. The screenplay also characterizes the time period with authentic hard clenched dialogue of the streets. <br/><br/>The focus on Crowe and Washington's dichotomy leaves out many story lines. We want to have a better sense of Lucas's father relationship with his nephew, and we wonder what happened for Roberts to cause his wife to take away his son. Their unwavering livelihoods however distract Roberts and Lucas from their beloved families, as Lucas is determined through his police work, and Lucas becomes paranoid to protect his business. <br/><br/>Much like L.A. Confidential or Miller's Crossing, Gangster delves you into the characters daily lives, where you get a distinguished sense that the world of the criminal and cop are not too far apart. These conflicted worlds of the police officer and criminal are both littered with selfish depravity, greed, and envied power as Lucas and Roberts are surrounded by evil on both sides. This includes a crooked cop, who uses his power to blackmail both Lucas and Roberts, which makes for a captivating twist in this crime epic. <br/><br/>Ridley Scott personifies the brutal effect organized crime has on innocent people's lives. Distressing shots of dead parents OD from Heroin inhabit the screen as a motherless child cries alongside her. These apparent scenes heighten the film's realism even more. Lucas's ""product,"" is becoming the city's epidemic as thousands of New Yorkers are able buy his affordable Heroin. These wrenchingly unsettling images prompt the viewer to cheer on honest detective Richie Robert's crusade to rid the city of drugs as he becomes the film's hero. Russell Crowe exemplifies the character's courage and integrity through much evil as his struggle becomes the film's most captivating storyline. <br/><br/>American Gangster is intelligent and engrossing as it eloquently takes us through the rise and fall of one of the most notorious crime figures in history. Before you know it, 3 hours go by and you wonder what hit you, maybe it was the gritty dark atmosphere of New York City that was so captivating or maybe it was the dualism of Crowe's intensity and Washington's fierce but commandingly cool attitude, Gangster is simply a crime epic for the ages."
"Tua89132","7","1","8","3 November 2007"," Excellent, yet without depth
","American Gangster is clearly a movie born from the lessons learned from movies such as Scarface, The Godfather, and other gangster flicks. Denzel Washington and Russel Crowe perform quite well at their roles. Washington plays Frank Lucas, a black entrepreneur who uses skills he learned from his earlier career to become powerful and wealthy in the dope trade. Crowe plays a detective who's scrupulous honesty on the job makes his life harder. The characters are quite enjoyable to watch as they make their way throughout the film. The key enjoyable aspect about this film is all the parts are B+. Nothing is fantastic yet nothing fails to disappoint. The movie is long, more then 2 hours and crawls at a slow pace you'd expect from a character study. Yet although the characters are fun to watch, they lack depth, as if the film is not really concerned with their personalities beyond what is required for the story. Ultimately this movie is entertaining and it is quality, however its ultimate lack of depth combined with its slow pace prevent it from becoming a hallmark of its genre."

","American Gangster seemingly has all the ingredients of a great movie: a great story, (multiple) Oscar-winning stars, a very solid supporting cast, and a good director. However, the film is not the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>How do you go wrong with a gangster movie starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, and Ridley Scott directing? Watch American Gangster, and you'll see.<br/><br/>The film lacks a great deal of character development, and it seems the details on both sides of the story are left out in favor of attention-grabbing scenes and montages.<br/><br/>You have to give them credit. Even at 2 1/2 hours, American Gangster never drags. However, it seems awfully abbreviated, as if someone cut out most of the scenes that involved plot/ character development. With those details included, this could have been a 4-hour movie.<br/><br/>Overall, American Gangster isn't a bad film. It just isn't the epic, Oscar-winning film it was marketed to be."
"DonFishies","8","1","8","3 November 2007"," An electric performance from Washington does not help the film's meandering storyline
","Much like Martin Scorsese before him, Ridley Scott continues to pump out films with his eyes set out on a little Gold statue for himself. Sure, his last real shot was with Gladiator, which won Best Picture and Best Actor, but failed to net him Best Director. Now, hot on the tails of Scorsese's own Oscar-winning masterpiece The Departed, Scott has climbed into the saddle and created his own crime film in American Gangster.<br/><br/>Gangster, much like Departed, is a parallel story. On one end, it follows the story of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), a businessman who deals in the purest heroin New York had seen at the time, and in being black in the early 1970's, is not exactly making a lot of friends. On the other side is Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), a sex-infused detective hell bent on defeating corruption and just being an all around good cop.<br/><br/>Right from the offset, the audience knows Lucas and Roberts are going to meet at some point in the film. Scott hypes this up, much like Michael Mann does in Heat and Scorsese does in Departed, by juxtaposing Lucas' rise to the powerful heroin magnet he becomes over time, and Roberts continued battle against corruption both within the police and on the streets. The film never lingers on either one for too long, instead choosing to jump between either man's story every few moments. We share their conflicts, and we share their near triumphant moments. But it also brings about a sense of pathos and ethics, in wondering who we should be cheering for, and who we hope wins by the time the blockbuster meeting takes place.<br/><br/>But on that same token, the film fumbles over itself. Yes, it is a rivetingly deep story for the most part, but it has more in common with misdirection and red herrings than I would have liked. Characters are continually introduced and brought into the fold, yet nothing really becomes of them (such as Cuba Gooding Jr., who I hope can now use this film as a replacement for half of the garbage listed on his resume after Jerry Maguire). Yes, they do build up the story, and yes, a lot of these events with minor characters help move the film along, but they just do not feel all that needed in the grand scheme of things. A few of the scenes feel like filler just to pad the film into getting prestige status as a three hour epic on par with the greats of the 1970's. It feels a lot like it is cheating itself out of being truly great by playing these scenes up, and really could have felt a lot tighter and stronger if many of these were cut right out of the picture. When the film wants to be electrifying and blazing fast, it is. But in many other cases, it tangles itself up in near boredom inducing sequencing.<br/><br/>One reason they feel so unnecessary is the cheapening and misuse of many of the supporting characters. Characters like Gooding Jr.'s Nicky Barnes and Josh Brolin's rival Detective Trupo are clearly important to the film, but they get next to no time to really shine. When the film is not meandering through scenes it does not need, it races through scenes that could have helped strengthen it, especially if it was left at the same running time as it currently sits at. I wanted to know more about these characters, and I wanted to discover their significance. But despite some really great work coming out of these supporting characters (especially from Brolin), the film just does not call for anyone to really care about these characters and their impact on the film. It just seems to care about the Denzel and Russell show more often than not.<br/><br/>Washington, in the main character role, is absolutely electrifying as Lucas. The role is his juiciest since Training Day, and he knows it. He plays the character with a smoldering sense of tenderness and downright evil. I have yet to see an actor who could trade the two traits off so interchangeably and so inexplicably easy as Washington does here. I did care what happened to his character and was scared for him, but at the same time, I was terrified of the guy too. He was not someone to mess with, and Washington makes it crystal clear that the man should be feared. Crowe on the other hand, is a bit of a tossup. He is really good here, but only when he wants to be. He looks very unenthused for the majority of the movie, but delivers when the scene asks for it. He is a strong performer no doubt, but his subdued and near unnatural performance does not any chance to stand next to Washington's overpoweringly memorable take equally.<br/><br/>While it has story and character issues, the film itself is filmed quite beautifully. Harking back to imagery from the likes of Scarface, The French Connection and The Godfather, American Gangster paints the image of a nitty gritty New York. The film is a very dark picture, and it lends itself to some pretty stark imagery. There is minor light and bright images littered throughout the film, but there is a certain sense of subdued grey that is carried for the majority of it. It definitely felt authentic to the time period, and the details in keeping this way are numerous. Even the costumes have been detailed to a point of timed perfection. Both helped make the film more riveting when it was losing steam quickly.<br/><br/>American Gangster, for as much as it does right, does not live up to everything people had hoped for. It has everything the greats have, but it just does not seem to know how to line up all the pieces. It is a worthwhile venture, but not one that needed to be so lengthy.<br/><br/>8/10."

","I first heard about this movie when Fuqua was going to direct it so immediately I was hooked. I loved Fuqua and Denzel in Training Day so anything short of that would be a disappointment. The fact remains if your looking for a great movie you will not find in this movie. It's a 3 hour documentary that portrays Frank Lucas to be a modern day Robin Hood to Harlem. The movie has it's flaws as many does. The 2 hour and 40 minute flick does not need to be this long. The story of Richie Roberts and his child custody case does not need to be included but I guess it adds character to Richie Roberts and the type of man he is; a man dedicated to obeying to the laws and doing the the job correctly and obiding. Surprise Surprise Denzel once again gives an Oscar winning performance. Although I can say with a strong opinion if this movie does win Picture of the Year it is not better than The Departed. The Departed had more action and did with less time. You do have to realize that Fank Lucas is a complicated business man and telling his story under 2 hours just could not happen but I feel as though Ridley Scott got caugh up in the heat of the moment and wanted Denzel and Russel on screen more than that was necessary. So although I may not be a qualified source to give a true accurate rating for this movie, I have seen enough movies in my life and enough Denzel movies to give my insight. A solid 7.0 out of 10 I feel does this movie justice. It is worth seeing but do not expect to see a blood bath given out by Frank Lucas because sorry to disappoint you but it does not happen."

","A wonderful movie with superb acting by Washington and Crowe. I keep hearing people talking about the lack of violence and action in the movie, but it was actually a refreshing thing to see. ""Scarface"" was a good movie, no doubt, but all of the language and blood detracted from the actual story at times. This film was wonderfully written and didn't need violence to give it a very dark atmosphere . It is about corruption and how easily people can fall into it. Frank Lucas was such an intriguing character in this movie and every time he spoke I was drawn into what he had to say. Look for Cuba Gooding Jr. to have a small role in this movie as well, he's great as the very showy club owner. I really enjoyed ""American Gangster"" a lot and I suggest everyone who likes Martin Scorsese pictures to go see it."

"RecoWilliams","10","1","9","3 November 2007"," It feels good to be a Gangster!
","Like many of you I have been disappointed by the movies released so far this year. There have been very few Oscar Contenders and more than that there have been very few movies that will draw people out. I have loved the Game Plan, Across the Universe, Kingdom, Things We Lost in the Fire, Transformers and a few others. But that's a very short list consider about 10 movies come out every single week and it's November.<br/><br/>American Gangser has filled a void that I think many cinema goers were missing. The fact that this movie was based on a true story, a plus. The fact that Denzell and Russell meet again after 11 years when they appeared together in Virtuosity, a plus. Back then Crowe was the bad guy and Washington was the good guy. And if you remember that movie, it wasn't good. The fact that American Gangster is directed by Ridley Scott, a plus.<br/><br/>The movie draws you in from the very beginning. If you were like you me you were already sold by the trailers. But the fact that this was based on a true story, drew me into the story even further.<br/><br/>Washington plays Frank Lucas, a real life American gangster, who takes over organized crime in New York City. His rise to success is simple he uses the formula that any successful corporation uses: ""Cut out the middle man"" That revelation was given to him by his mentor ""Bumpy"" who died in a franchise store while talking about how he misses the middle man. Kinda ironic of how Frank Lucas took over.<br/><br/>At the same time you have Crowe who plays Richie Roberts, a cop who is trying to fight corruption in the police force. The movie took an approach of where you follow Frank Lucas and care about him and at the same time you follow Richie Roberts and you care about him.<br/><br/>It's kinda odd because you are rooting for both sides. Richie Roberts is a goodie two shoe cop who does everything the right way. Frank Lucas is a ruthless crime boss who wants to do what he cans to help his family.<br/><br/>The movie is filmed in a gritty and raw New York/New Jersey. The back drop of the Vietnman war and the American soldiers addiction to narcotics really hit home. It was like a juxtaposition our soldiers are fighting for freedom in a place that is enslaving them with drugs. And not only that they were sending that bondage back home.<br/><br/>American Gangster will not be a Scarface or a Godfather, but what makes American Gangster stand alone is that it's just a street story. This movie shows you how easy it is to get caught up on the wrong side and not even realize that you are there.<br/><br/>Crowe and Washington will both probably get Oscar nominations for this film, and I think they expect it with the November release.<br/><br/>Go see this movie. I must say Hollywood is getting it right. First ""Kingdom"" then ""Across the Universe"", then ""Things we Lost in the Fire"" and now ""American Gangster."" 2007 has a shot of not being the worse movie year ever in history.<br/><br/>American Gangster will develop a cult following and I fear it spawn a whole new generation of American Gangsters.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 10 out of 10. The only thing I wish they would have done differently, but I'm sure this will be on the DVD is to show the real life Roberts and Lucas who were consultants on the film. <br/><br/>""The movie critic who still pays the price of admission"" Go see this film!"
"TheGOLDENWALRUS","6","1","9","3 November 2007"," A decent movie
","I've been looking forward to this movie for a long time. I love gangster films (mainly Scorsese's films) so I couldn't wait to see this. It was nice to see Russel Crowe as the good guy considering in 3:10 to Yuma he was the bad guy. Now the strangest role was the fact our hero Denzel Washington was playing the bad guy. The movie was long but it was a fun and enjoyable ride.<br/><br/>Russel Crowe plays Richie Roberts who takes pride in what he does. He's not a dirty cop (you learn quick that pretty much everyone else is) and he does pretty much everything by the book (kind of like Simon Pegg's character in Hot Fuzz). In fact, very early in the movie, he finds almost 1,000,000$ in unmarked cash and still turns it in even though he almost new that the other cops would take it. His character was very well developed as we learn that constantly doing good wrecks his family life as he goes through a divorce at the same time in the movie.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington plays Frank Lucas who deals heroin from South America (if my memory serves me right) and quickly becomes the biggest drug-lord in the city. He's a smooth talker and pretty much has no competition. In fact, he brings his whole entire extended family into the mix as they live in his big mansion.<br/><br/>You already should know the plot so I won't do much explaining. It's a cat and mouse movie (even though the leads only have about 5 minutes together in the whole movie) and it is a fun one. I do have to tell you though, I felt the length of the movie was a good half an hour too long. There were plenty of unneeded scenes so the movie didn't flow as well as it should of. The character development was good but this movie could have been so much more. I did find that the ending was rewarding and you learn a lot of interesting facts about Lucas and Roberts that will probably make you gasp in amazement.<br/><br/>It was well directed for the most part. Perhaps a few shots lingered too long but overall Ridley Scott did a good job. There are some bits of humor in the film. My favorite part was (thanks giving or Christmas day - can't remember) when a dirty cop finds heroin on Lucas and he promptly says in a caring voice, ""No need to start anything, why don't we go home and have pumpkin pie and warm apple cider."" (something like that). He then gets in his car and beats the hell out of his brother. I really like Washington in this role. Sure he's just like he is in most of his other movies but we routed for him just like how we routed for Al Pacino in Scarface. In fact, Peter Travers calls this movie the black Scarface. I do agree. Russel Crowe Was great like usual as we also routed for him. To me, the biggest enemies were the dirty cops.<br/><br/>I wasn't at all blown away but it was worth the tickets and the wait in the long line. 6.5/10 is my verdict."

","5 November 2007. Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe along with this time Denzel Washington put together a story that has a beginning, middle, and ending. This movie is no Godfather, and interestingly enough there are some casting decisions to include some aging actors recognizable from other crime thrillers that in my mind detracts from the hard-hitting, serious side of this story. The personal relationship between Washington and his bride is underdeveloped, in fact, their meeting is something of a mystery. Even Washington's character and his father is also underdeveloped which later plays a rather important part later in the movie. The Ridley Scott had both Russell and Denzel play more complicated characters each with both good and bad elements. The movie, however, seemed to overreach and incorporate some much by having to sacrifice some detail. Russell's character chasing after the bad guy in a drugbust seemed unnecessarily showy, more for the action crowd than for cinematic clarity. Denzel's confrontation with another dealer who wants him to pay 20% isn't particularly resolved. Overall,there are good performances, a complex plot that is handled well. Eight out of Ten Stars."
"christian94","7","0","2","9 January 2017"," American Gangster = American Hero
","Pros: Interesting story and strong performance by Denzel. Cons: Predictable. A few directing and acting flaws.<br/><br/>In the tradition of Blow (2001), here is a real American Hero...<br/><br/>America has been glorifying gangsters way before hip hop and gangster rap, way before television ""The Sopranos"" (1999), hit movies Scarface (1983) and Goodfellas (1990). Guns and seemingly limitless funds (read ""fun"") were an end and a mean (by a mean I refer to both the demeanor and misdemeanor, and I mean by any means necessary) before the Godfather (1972) et al. had every prototypical Italian American and his neighbour imitate Brando, Pacino, De Niro or Pesci ad nauseum and quote lines of gangster movies like people used to quote Shakespeare. The American Dream, before ""American Idol "" (2002) produced prefab Pop Stars, was of an entrepreneurial spirit realistically closer to the original spirits-bootlegging Scarface than say an arguably antisocial, enigmatic, Bill Gates. America's gun culture endures. Thus the title of the movie alone, alas, says a lot about the American subconscious. <br/><br/>This may even go beyond the United States boundaries as Hollywood and U.S. influence on the world culture is still very powerful--in Japan, you have the Yakuzas From Bonnie and Clyde (1967) to American Gangster (2007), movies about money and violence has been very popular. For example, there is a clear preponderance of high ratings for such movies in the Internal Movie Database – IMDb, the most popular movie website in America and on the planet. At the time of this original article (Nov 2007), four out of the five overall best- rated movies in the TOP 250 out of hundreds of thousands are of that kind! <br/><br/>In this rendition of the gangster movie genre which focuses on a clever, ruthless 'black man' in Harlem's 1960s who builds a drug empire, the glorifying is not overt, yet it is not really made in a way that you will realistically root for the ""good cop"" instead of the ""bad a*s villain"". The movie has depth in content in that it deals with connected racial tension and government involvement in corruption and drug trafficking. A big angle to the tale is that bypassing regular drug channel and getting the product straight from the source in Far-East Asia with the help of the US Army in Vietnam, this 'black man' or nig*r (America's subclass or worse than nothing) was able to overshadow even the Italian Mafia's chokehold on organized crime, which unsettled more than a few people from both sides of the law. Also, the systematic corruption in New York law-enforcement agencies that permitted the fight on drug trafficking to be very lax as well as these state employees actually profiting from this decadence in the streets, was brought to light and to life quite vividly. <br/><br/>In this picture, Denzel dazzles and is a great villain in his portrayal of Frank Lucas, although not to the degree of his Oscar- worthy Training Day (2001) performance. He gets a chance to shine occasionally and more so towards the end, but the script and directing did not allow him to show his full arsenal on celluloid. Russell Crowe plays a cop again (L.A. Confidential, 1997) and is as subdued as his character. What I did not like is that the subplot of his personal life, although maybe interesting on paper and a worthy contrast to add complexity and not fall into black-and-white territory, did not really work and detracted instead of enhanced the picture. These were the only parts that really felt long and underused out of the otherwise well-paced 157 minutes. Carla Gugino did not really hit the mark as the wife, but it seemed to me that it was more of a storytelling mishap out of Ridley Scott's directing. He should have handled it differently to have a better impact or not use it at all and maybe spend more time on Frank Lucas' personal or ""professional"" life. <br/><br/>Besides this little lack of character development that can be seen for pretty much most of the characters, the film is a good story, well told and well placed into the context of the time and place of the narrative. The conclusion wraps everything up nicely. Thank you, come again."

","It's kind of messy, the way real life is, but that's okay. It's also okay that it borrows some scenes and themes from ""The Godfather"" and ""The French Connection"" too. It's still a well-done original.<br/><br/>Russel Crowe is an honest cop in Essex County (Newark), New Jersey. He finds a bag full of money from a dope dealer and turns it in, as he's supposed to, although this violates the police practice of keeping that sort of dough. It earns him snubs at the office.<br/><br/>Across the river, In Manhattan, Denzel Washington is a driver and protégé of a big time Harlem heroin dealer. When the dealer dies, Washington take over the business, eliminates the middle men, and charges less money for dope that's far superior. It earns him the enmity of all the other dealers because he's undercutting them. They are not admirers of the unfettered free market, never having read Adam Smith. The NYPD is as crooked as the cops in Newark. Everybody wants a cut.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back in dystopian Newark, a special squad of drug enforcement cops is organized and Crowe is assigned to lead them. Their mission, should they choose to accept it, which they'd better, is to disregard the many junkies and street corner operators and go for the big game. In this case, after much sniffing around, in and out of their jurisdiction, Crowe's elite group finds Washing to be at the head of the organization, more powerful and richer than the Italians or anyone else.<br/><br/>Crowe finally busts Washington, earns a law degree, and after prosecuting him in court, defends him and gets him off after only fifteen years. Both men were consultants on the film and both bitched about its inaccuracies.<br/><br/>It was considerably better than I'd thought it would be. I mean, look at the title: ""American Gangster."" Roger Corman would have had a field day with it.<br/><br/>Instead, there are several parallel stories interwoven with one another. Washington brings his family from North Carolina to New York and sets them up in his mansion. His mother is Ruby Dee, who was my co-star in the unforgettable mini-series -- umm, er, whatever it was. He attends church with them, says an earnest grace before meals. What kind of a gangster do you call that? There is, of course, a final kinetic shoot out, intercut with scenes of Washington at Sunday church service. Very ironic, as ""The Godfather"" showed. But you won't find too much gore in the movie. There are murders and suicides on the screen but the camera lens isn't splashed with blood.<br/><br/>Both Washington and Crowe deliver decent performances, as does the supporting cast. No one stands out. They're all professionals. This isn't a masterpiece, it's not gripping like, say, ""Prince of the City,"" but it's a neatly done genre piece that's worth catching."

","In scope of portrayal and general razzmatazz this has nothing to lose on Scorsese and reminds of something he would do. A rise and fall story centered on a Harlem gangster who rode to the top on heroin shipments from Vietnam. It's that kind of film where we get the full chronicle - humble beginnings, turf wars, crime empire. A good cop is on his trail, seemingly alone in a sea of corrupt law enforcement. We get snappy montages played to marvelous music of the time - the late 60s.<br/><br/>The portrayal is a bit more complex; a man who wanted to do capitalism like everyone else, pursue the dream so he can finally have Thanksgiving dinner in a lavish villa with his family; but addicts dying in filthy rooms pay for it. The point here is a world hopped on greed where appearances are rendered void. The heroin is smuggled on US army planes.<br/><br/>What drew me in - and why I believe it works - is that we are more deeply enmeshed in this world than an action movie or the usual CIA fare. It reminds a bit of what they were doing in the 70s where crime was lived through with its squalor and not just posed for in cool soundbites. It actually shifts back and forth, one foot in Goodfellas movie gangland, the other in street chronicle. We travel derelict atmospheres around New Jersey, junkie apartments and disheveled neighborhoods. Crowe anchors the lived aspect as shabby cop, Washington seethes and glares like a movie gangster.<br/><br/>I would have liked to see less of the chronicle, more of the streets ,more of the human haze. It's a fascinating era anyway - one of those world-formative cornerstones where hopeful change and malaise swirled in the same air. We don't really veer far but we're given the broad outlines of a world in shift - from the North Carolina farm where he grew up to an upscale loft on Ali - Frazier boxing night. This was while soul music of the era was taking the same leap and corporations were consolidating vast empires, including movies. It was in this heady climate that Scorsese got his start incidentally."

","American gangster"" is a gangster movie that doesn't add anything new to the genre . It's weaker than classics such as ""Godfather"" , ""Godfather 2"" , ""Goodfellas"" or ""Casino"" , yet it's a strong movie on it's own . To be honest it isn't pure gangster movie . The story of cop Richie is just as important as the story of gangster Frank . In a way the movie reminds kinda Michael Mann's ""Heat"". <br/><br/>The movie is long and epic . The whole picture has a ""French Connection"" feel. It's an entertaining portrait of late 60s-early 70s Harlem and America. Lots of drugs , Vietnam war , desperation , world where cops are as dirty (or even dirtier) than gangsters. As Richie says at one point of the movie all those cops , judges , lawyers , district attorneys are really too happy with the fact that drugs exist , because it gives them work. Lawlessness and organized crime exists because of the mutual benefit that the gangsters have with the law . No one, including the law, wants it to stop. The movie offers real-life look into the narcotics business top-to-bottom and across the board. It also shows what it means to be a cop and to strive for something.<br/><br/>The story is based on true life of Frank Lucas who here isn't a stereotypical black gangster gone wrong , but instead an elegant, intelligent man who rises to the top. Denzel Washington shines here . He's menacing , confident , cold and feisty. In my opinion he did a good job making his character different than the bad guy he portrayed in ""Training day"". ""American gangster"" is also a story of Ritchie Roberts , a cop who defeated him. He's character is much less interesting , since he's basically a boy scout , yet Russell Crowe manages to create a likable character . He was able to convince me about the pure innocence of his character. Roberts and Lucas may be operating on opposite sides of the law, the one thing that both men have in common is a strict code of ethics that separates them from their opportunistic colleagues.<br/><br/>The movie also has interesting supporting characters . Josh Brolin turns in an outstanding and memorable performance as Trupo, a decidedly sinister and shady cop . Ruby Dee rightfully deserved the Oscar nomination for her role of Lucas mother . It was good to see Cuba Gooding Jr. in a good movie with a good performance for a change. Chiwetal Ejifor makes a believable side character. Armand Assante gives a god performance as the mob boss. <br/><br/>""American gangster"" is truly engrossing and captivating picture that I did not once find it boring or slow at all. The pacing to was just right to have enough of a character study going on, but also enough to keep audience interested and entertained. Ridley Scott did a great job as the director . He also improved as an action director - police raid scene is really great. <br/><br/>This movie is a good addition to the genre of gangster movies . We haven't yet seen a really good movie with black gangster until this one. I give it 6/10."

","No one could or would believe that a black man, a former chauffeur, had risen above the Italian mafia to quietly rule the east coast heroin industry. It's the Frank Lucas story glorified a bit by Denzel Washington being Denzel Washington. Director Ridley Scott poses Russell Crowe's Narc as a polar opposite of his target, unbeknown to him for the majority of the film, making it easier to like, no less enjoy, Denzel's portrayal. Our bad cops, run by Josh Brolin, further places our lone good cop unto the island of himself. The ex-wife custody scenes even further isolates our protagonist. When issues are black and white, he can easily make the right decision. Add in some gray and he's wishy washy. On the flip side of the coin, there is no loyalty but to Franks' old boss' ideals... meaning these guys are very much alike in that manner. The drama is superb and there is a well done early 1970's feel to this crime story, constantly interacting with Viet Nam footage, that make this an underrated gem!"
"jknow2012","6","0","1","30 June 2012"," ""American Gangster""
","In ""Amican Gangster"" we have an action/crime/drama movie which is a biographical depiction of the life of a guy named Frank Lucas(played by Denzel Washington). We follow Lucas (who existed in real life) as he becomes some kind of heroin kingpin in a matter of years after going overseas to South East Asia and sending some of those drugs back in to the United States. As a result of his journey & what he came back to the U.S.A. with, the streets of America became more downtrodden & full of crime & violence than ever before.<br/><br/>Now as far as the movie is concerned, there is next to nothing in the way of character development for the main character in the movie, in other words, there is hardly anything that describes anything about who Frank Lucas was before the time of the beginning of the movie. This leaves the movie feeling incomplete from the very beginning. There are quit a few big named actors (Such a as Russel Crowe & Cuba Gooding Jr.) and a ""who's who"" of the music industry list as supporting actors and extras (RZA, Common, T.I., Anthony Hamilton). Anyway, the plethora of high profile actors & music stars did not make the movie any better. Perhaps it made the move way more hyped up and anticipated in order to ensure box office success. Anyhow, the glamorization of drug dealing and the glamorization of the insensitivity that it takes to sell heroin to thousands of people knowing the disastrous effects that it has on their lives, is what this movie is basically all about. Why would any big time director hire an all star cast to do this? I don't know. Maybe the director got a kick out of doing that. Other than that, we get to see the average police vs. bad guy scenes and of course, the crooked cops are prevalent in here too. Besides that, Denzel Washington DOES NOT seem to be casted well for this role. Even though this movie may be based on a true story, something seems to be way off in seeing an ""African American"" heroin dealer in the 60's walking around the streets and moving through different social circles & gatherings while talking like he's a freedom fighter who's being responsible by showing his people how to make a better life by selling drugs at the expense of the rest of society."
"Magenta_Bob","8","0","1","22 May 2012"," Light Version of The Wire
","Sort of like Polanski's The Ghost Writer or Spielberg's Munich, Ridley Scott's American Gangster has been one of those movies by a big director that no one ever talks about but that I rated highly without remembering why. Having now also seen the extended version, I do think it is a very good film, although I can see why it is neglected alongside his far more memorable sci-fi output.<br/><br/>""The loudest one in the room is the weakest one in the room"", Denzel Washington's character Frank Lucas says early in the film. That's what makes him so strong; while clearly the main character, he is one of the quietest, not just due to his taciturnity, but also in the way he dresses and carries himself. In fact, during the opening scene, where Clarence Williams ominously talks about the degeneration of America and how ""the grocery store on the corner is now a supermarket"", it takes a few good minutes before Washington says anything. Deviating from these principles, by wearing a huge fur coat in public and starting to distribute drugs in larger scale and ""pushing out all the middlemen"", which Williams also complains about, is the beginning of his downfall.<br/><br/>That's sort of how the film at large operates. It is very understated, and apart from the brutal first shot, probably less violent than the average gangster film, interrupted by just a few outbursts from Washington.<br/><br/>Other than that, the film is steeped in the classic gangster movie tradition (case in point: it uses the score from The Godfather or something very similar, but with different instruments) and does not bring anything new to the genre, but at least it manages to take a lot of the good aspects of such films, making it a very solid effort all things considered. What I especially like is that it depicts the gangsters and the policemen in equal depth, without romanticizing either side, which made me think of it as a (much less ambitious) light version of The Wire. The drug unit's office is a seedy looking warehouse or something that even looks a bit like that of McNulty et al (and it has Stringer Bell!). And to be sure, like in Baltimore where one generation of dealers replaces the previous, the dope world in American Gangster neither starts nor ends with Frank Lucas."

There you learn that according Frank Lucas and others, the movie is ""1% true and 99% Hollywood"".<br/><br/>Also, the real Richie Roberts was upset with the movie because of(WARNING: SPOILER HERE)the custody battle scenes. After all, according to him, he never had a child!!!

","Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe do a superb job in their American Gangster lead roles. This time out, the positions they play are reversed from their previous film together titled Virtuosity. In Amercian Gangster, Frank Lucas (Denzel's character) is on the wrong side of the law while Det. Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) does everything in his power to bring Lucas to justice. Whereas, in their first film together Virtuosity, Crowe was the absconder of justice while Washington assisted the police to bring order to society while pursuing Crowe.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline, pace, and subject matter of the movie. Veterans Josh Brolin, Ruby Dee, and newcomer Lymari Nadal, all added exceptional performances in their supporting roles to fulfill director Ridley Scott's vision for the storyline.<br/><br/>I also noticed the fact that Denzel Washington had worked with the late Ossie Davis in Malcolm X and completed the cycle in American Gangster by starring with Davis's widow Ruby Dee.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I also noticed that their seem to be many Denzel Washington detractors who cannot accept the fact that he won the Oscar for Training Day and therefore they are unable to let the past go. As a result, they infiltrate legitimate movie cites like IMDb and pose as fans in order to post negative comments that are far from the reality of the brilliance of director Ridley Scott and his talented actors in the American Gangster movie cast."

","From Golden Globe nominated director Sir Ridley Scott, I remember seeing a few adverts for this film, being a simple title and with a four star rating from the critics it certainly looked worth trying. Based on the true story, Harlem, Manhattan crime lord Ellsworth 'Bumpy' Johnson (Clarence Williams III) dies from a heart attack, and his employee Frank Lucas (Golden Globe nominated Denzel Washington) takes over leadership of the gangland. He also establishes himself as the new importer of illegal drugs to the USA, specifically heroin, that he gets direct from the source in Bangkok, South East Asia. This is done successfully by hiding the drugs in the coffins of dead military personnel, and Lucas establishes his product under the name ""Blue Magic"", selling it at lower prices making him a fast earning millionaire. Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) in Essex County is the New York police detective investigating the mafia crimes on the streets and in the underworld, and of course he is trying to find the head of the drugs smuggling ring. He eventually comes to the conclusion that it could be Lucas, but the rest of the authorities don't believe that an African American could be guilty of this crime. In the end of course Lucas is indeed caught and sentenced to prison for his drugs smuggling over the years, but the final text reveals he was let out early for cooperation. Also starring Oscar nominated Ruby Dee as Mama Lucas, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Huey Lucas, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Nicky Barnes, Josh Brolin as Detective Trupo, Ted Levine as Lou Toback, Armand Assante as Dominic Cattano, John Ortiz as Javier J. Rivera, John Hawkes as Freddie Spearman, RZA as Moses Jones, Carla Gugino as Laurie Roberts, Common as Turner Lucas, Tip Harris aka T.I. as Stevie Lucas and Joe Morton as Charlie Williams. Washington is really good as the drug dealing criminal, Crowe is also pretty good as the cop trying to find him, the story is simple to follow, it is well written, well directed, and certainly a biographical gangster crime drama worth watching. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Achievement in Art Direction, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Music for Marc Streitenfeld and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Denzel Washington was number 28 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 40 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!"
"daluzer","8","0","1","28 December 2010"," The most important thing in business is...
","I like to think about this movie as the way the poster depicts it. In the same color. <br/><br/>Its trailer itself is better than many movies made across the globe.<br/><br/>I agree that its no Godfather or Goodfellas. Neither is the story completely true to the facts. (I wished that the scene where *Frank is coming out of the church and Ritchie is waiting outside to arrest him* had happened in reality). But then... its a very stylish, charismatic and surprisingly inspiring tale of two completely different people.<br/><br/>While Ritchie Roberts (Russell Crowe) remains irresponsible to his family engrossing himself into making a career out of cleaning the streets as a loyal and honest cop, Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) is dedicated to his family's progress by involving them into the profitable business of importing pure quality of drugs from Vietnam and plaguing the streets with it. Ritchie lifts up his career by destroying Frank's. <br/><br/>What is similar in both these characters, however, is that... both of them are striving for something morally correct even after being the killers in two opposite sides of the law. Ritchie fighting against corruption in his own side. And Frank establishing himself for recognition of black Americans, in power, in his side.<br/><br/>The details of the period in America are very interesting. The way Ridley Scott tells the story with every action of Frank having a substitute reaction by Ritchie and vice-versa is amazing.(This is my favorite Ridley Scott work, parallel to Gladiator). The performances (obviously, and) especially by Crowe and Washington are strong and outstanding."

Although these films have there merits they are just films not religions or golden nuggets of s**t Cr***ed down onto the earth by the great almighty and it seems to me from some of the reviews I have read no one should even attempt to ever again make a film about organised crime even if the story happens to be based on true facts and happens to be an interesting story unlike the godfather which a lot of people keep saying this should not be uttered in the same breath as, in truth it shouldn't the films and stories are completely different this happens to be interesting whereas the godfather happens to be an overlong poorly put together pointless piece of nonsense that happens to be made by a director that makes Ridley Scott look like a cinematic genius even though this is a guy that made black rain, g.i Jane and white squall, that said I did enjoy this film the depth of the story probably would have been better used if spanned across a T.V show like the wire as it does have a lot of depth and there is a lot of things going on so the fact that Ridley Scott has been able to put all of this together into a two and a half hour long movie in my opinion is impressive and it stands as one of his better films and probably his best since Gladiator"

Where as Washington's character is in control of both his personal and 'work' life. Washington is on top form, equalling if not surpassing his Oscar winning performance in Training day (2001). <br/><br/>The costumes and makeup are excellent. The supporting actors give weight to the production and there are some memorable performances from Chiwetel Ejiofor, Josh Brolin and Ted Levine to name few.<br/><br/>I've seen both the theatrical version the 175 min extended version that includes approx. 19 minutes of additional footage. While the extra footage doesn't jump out at you, the ending is notably different but just as captivating. For a lengthy film America Gangster zips along at a fast pace, accompanied by a great music soundtrack and a enhancing score by Marc Streitenfeld. <br/><br/>The 1970's is painstakingly created with amazing realistic set design. Scott's direction coupled with Harris Savides cinematography captures the feel and tone of the time. Scott not only recreates Manhattan but also Vietnam and the war is at it's height. Credit deservedly should g to Steven Zaillian's writing and Mark Jacobson's tale that show working of a drug empire, from the high level corruption and to the impact on the street.<br/><br/>A perfectly crafted film and gratifying cinema."

","As someone who grew up in Manhattan - close to Harlem, and as someone who ...'dabbled,' I can tell you that from a different perspective then your average commentator on this film, Blue Magic was very different from the dope junkies here in New York City got at the time. And, it WAS worth the trip (and danger. Harlem was NOT the gentrified place it's since become. It was a VERY rough & tumble area (and in a strange way - safer - if you were white. Harlemites didn't trust whites up there - thought we were all undercover cops, so they gave you a wide berth.<br/><br/>As far as portraying the city, the climate at that time - American GANGSTER's dead on. Denzel's performance I especially like, because, so many people don't get that the REAL strength, power, evil(?) does NOT come at you looking like such, but comes at you in a plain, unassuming guise.<br/><br/>Frank Lucas understood that, and Denzel portrayed it - chillingly.

","I don't really have much experience in watching gangster films, but I do with watching Ridley Scott's. As I made clear in my review of Body of Lies I'm not his biggest fan. I didn't like Kingdom of Heaven, and I didn't think that Gladiator or Black Hawk Down were as great as their reputation. American Gangster was completely different. The story was so simple, unlike so many gangster film- a crime lord running a drug empire. And that's partly why I liked it. I thought that Denzel Washington was fantastic, definitely the best I've ever seen him in. I also prefer Russell Crowe in this role as a pose to the character he plays in Gladiator, though I thought he made a better performance in Body of Lies. It was very well made, though it seemed to waste a lot of time setting up the story. The other problem was that Washington was so good that when he wasn't on screen it was really noticed. There was also no real climax, I would have loved to see Washington's character developed even further and I was a little disappointed when he was arrested. What I would have liked to have seen was more on Lucas' empire, more of the fear at which he ruled his employees, though I guess it was restricted by the real-life events. The story did waste time on Roberts' (Crowe's character) life and it was too long as a consequence of this, again I missed Washington. It is well worth seeing though, it is very brutal and realistic, and at times quite scary, yet all the time fascinating. I still preferred Body of Lies though."
"michaelkoroma","Null","0","1","29 December 2009"," A snapshot of organised crime, the problems of demand and supply of narcotics amidst waning Mafia influence, the power of Afro-American criminal gangs and police corruption.
","To categorise his film as a gangster thriller only equates it to the vast run-of-the-mill types that litter Hollywood history. Rather, it's rightful place is amongst the pantheon of epic crime dramas that are distinguished by setting, acting performances, visual style, fashion and direction, in exploring the American Dream against the backdrop of a momentous period in U.S. history. American Gangster follows the rise and fall of Frank Lucas, erstwhile driver to a Harlem crime boss; but Ridley Scott’s direction is in effect a snapshot of the history of organised crime in the U.S. – in particular the problems of demand and supply of narcotics amidst waning Mafia influence, the growing power of Afro-American criminal gangs, and police corruption in the 1970s. Crowe’s portrayal of a pariah cop in his own precinct whilst locked in a custody battle for his son is profound. The look and feel of the Big Apple in the seventies, from inner city New Jersey to the rundown projects of Harlem, its diners, restaurants and nightspots, vehicles, fashion and music is a master-class in cinematography and art direction. Above all, Washington’s performance in the lead role is outstanding from a startling opening sequence to the end of Lucas’ reign. Scott is also very subtle in his use of reportage of the Vietnam war on TV in the background, the ringside seats at Madison Square Gardens for Ali v Frazier, and Nixon’s declaration of an end to combat operations in Vietnam, all of which has a significant bearing on the plot."
"classicsoncall","9","0","1","15 October 2009"," ""Out at home, baby!""
","Somehow the real life story of Frank Lucas blew right by me. I recall the Knapp Commission investigation of police corruption during the 1970's in New York City, but that had more to do with Frank Serpico and his story. This all happened around the same time the way it looks, and maybe the stories overlapped somehow, but I just don't know.<br/><br/>One of the main takeaways I have of this film is how easily and widespread it is for our public servants, read cops, to get involved with dirty money. I had such a naive outlook growing up, but after years of hearing about corruption in law enforcement, politics, the government, you name your venue, and nothing comes as a surprise anymore. It sometimes makes me wonder how long civil society can keep hanging on by a thread, but I guess you just have to go back to the well of human decency and good will.<br/><br/>As for ""American Gangster"", I found it to be a revealing look at how a poor kid from the South could rise up the ladder of organized crime and become a hero in his own back yard. However for one honest cop, where there's a will, there's a way. The intricacies involved in discovering the mastermind behind Blue Magic made for an intense and gripping story, as Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) exhibits a genius for undercover detective work while failing miserably as a husband and father. It's interesting to speculate how much longer it might have taken to investigate Frank Lucas if he hadn't worn that bodacious fur coat and hat to the Ali/Frazier fight. Uncharacteristically, we see Frank violate his own personal code and come to regret it.<br/><br/>In direct juxtaposition to Lucas' savage grip on his organization, I'm always fascinated how major crime bosses live by their own unyielding code of honor. For Frank, it's all about honesty, integrity, and hard work, but always within the parameters of his skewed world view. Which leads me to consider how a black crime kingpin rationalizes the damage he wreaks on his own people in the name of the almighty dollar. Why aren't Jesse Jackson and Reverend Al Sharpton railing about that? It's just a confusing world out there.<br/><br/>As a crime film, this one is right up there with the best of them, both fictional and non-fictional. Based on a true story, this one brings added poignancy to the screen, knowing that the principals played out a real life drama in the seamy underbelly of New York's Harlem."

","I enjoyed the movie, but an original masterpiece it ain't. Frank's (Denzel W's)explosive and irrational character is basically a black version of Warren Beatty's BUGSY and the rest of the movie is full of clichés' that we've seen a hundred times before; they simply substitute the stereotypical Italian character with a black man. Particularly strange was Frank's dialect going from ""ghetto black"" to Harvard educated white(depending on his mood).But for me, what really separates this movie from the true American gangster classics (Godfather or Goodfellas), is they were based on fact; American Gangster is pure fiction. Not a mention of the racial tensions of the early 70's, in fact we are supposed to accept that no brow is raised over Frank marrying a non-black girl; even momma declares ""she's the most beautiful woman in the world"". Frank's family, inner circle and entire world is an organized and well run fictional BLACK euphoria ... emphasis on the word FICTIONAL."
"tml_pohlak_13","10","0","1","14 June 2009"," ""Get in line. That one stretches around the block, too.""
","American Gangster is a brilliant crime film, and that's all there is to it. Not only does it deliver pure, escapist entertainment, but it is also more thoughtful and thought-provoking than the average ""organized crime"" film.<br/><br/>The first thing I will comment on is the direction. I love Ridley Scott's direction. For one thing, he has an excellent grasp on building suspense, which in American Gangster plays a major role in keeping the audience involved. His direction is first-rate, and I noticed that he used the imagery of coffee very often in the film. A shot near the end of the film, where coffee is spilt all over a bed, is particularly effective (not to mention aesthetically pleasing). However, there is one aspect of American Gangster's direction I highly disliked, and that is the over, explicit sexuality, in particular the numerous naked bodies of women. I'm not a fan of these kinds of images in film (particularly when used in excess), but other than this problem, American Gangster's direction is pure gold.<br/><br/>Another thing I particularly like about AG is that the characters do not feel like archetypes or stereotypes, which is a huge danger for any crime film to fall into. A particularly interesting move is that Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington's characters are practically the same because they're exact opposites. Crowe's detective finds $1 million in unmarked bills in the trunk of a car and returns it. Yet he cheats on his wife—he's an honest cop, yet dishonest in family life. Washington's character, meanwhile, is a criminal. But he truly loves his wife and his family— he's honest in family matters but dishonest where the law is concerned. The two are shadowy reflections of each other, and this only helps the story even more.<br/><br/>Another fascinating thing about American Gangster is that it doesn't end in the conventional, blockbuster-style shootout. As for the music— it's effective, but forgettable— nothing to write home about.<br/><br/>Here we get to the themes of American Gangster. One of them is family, and how it really does matter. Frank Lucas is sure to take care of his family. For instance, when he shows his mother her new room, it is revealed that he had a dresser built for it, built from his memory of a dresser she had when he was a child, one that was taken away. Frank, as is pointed out, also stands for progress. He is a successful black gangster, even more successful than the Mafia crime families. This is pointed out late in the movie, that he doesn't just ""represent himself"", he is a symbol of progress, and not a crude caricature of the ruthless drug dealer.<br/><br/>The Verdict: Other than the excessive numbers of nude women walking around on camera, American Gangster is pretty much flawless. It is both entertaining and thought-provoking, a rare mix.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 10/10"

","This film is not particularly interesting as for the story which is that of a gangster who is captured by the police along with thirty members of his family, and decides to help the police corner the whole drug dealing system in New York, and particularly the rotten cops who are getting some kickback money for closing their eyes. It is not either the case of a clean cop who arrests all those gangsters and then turns lawyer and takes as his first client the fink of a gangster he arrested first and has his prison term reduced to 17 years instead of 70. The real point here is that this gangster is black. He becomes the dominant drug dealer in New York in the early 70s. He uses direct buying in Vietnam during the last war years and has that drug flown to him in military cargo planes, the last time in the coffins of dead soldiers. The only interesting thing here is the fact that he is black and no one can believe that famous gangster who no one knows can be black in New York, in spite of the ethnic and racial cleansing practiced by the mafia. But the film proves nothing, except that those who are anti-black racists are also anti-jew racists. Anti-Semitism goes along with racial racism. But that is nothing new under the sun. The film is well done and shows cruelly well how a cop from New Jersey has better not come and hunt on the land of the police of New York, on the other side of the Brooklyn Bridge, or whatever. But that still does not make it a great film. A good film indeed but flat as for the plot.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID"

","1st watched 4/22/2009 – 6 out of 10 (Dir-Ridley Scott): Good crime story based on a true story about a drag trafficking African American man, played by Denzel Washington, in the late 60's who started a heroin business smuggling drugs from Vietnam through military personnel. He worked with his cousin to find the purest form of the drug and get it smuggled in shipments to the U.S. and employed others in his family to distribute it. He formed a company around his family similar to other mafia groups and used some of the same violent tactics to keep himself on top. Russell Crowe plays a detective who puts together a group to sniff out the drug lords and the characters run parallel to each other in the story until near the very end. The story is gritty and told well with good acting although there's not a lot of positive things to hang onto(I guess that's the nature of the story, though). The matter-of-fact way of storytelling works at times but not at others. The movie is slow at the beginning but it eventually pulls you in and gains your attention. I also like the way the director showed how each character didn't really receive their due rewards till the very end. The good guy had bad times and the bad guy lived it up most of the movie which is unfortunately more the way it is in real life. The ending is a little bit corny when the characters hook up to put bad cops in jail, but I guess they had to throw in something positive. All in all this was a good movie, but not great."

Well, a TTL story, most of its kind are lengthy- just to prove the point that the bad guys are actually good guys and some if not all the good guys are bad guys. This story is based on a real-life and the real thing is that the real thing is a lie, everything else are just lies- that's the real real life.<br/><br/>The picture is good because it was created pretty fine, the air is what they wanted to tell us, it happened a long time ago when there was still the 'h' in humans. The story included crook cops and crook lawyers and crook businesspersons presenting today's humanity. Everybody is a crook because of human instinct called self-preservation.<br/><br/>This story was world changing for America, imagine- a crook businessperson aided by a lawyer packed three-fourths of crook criminals I mean cops to prison or home? Oh I wish all crook people, the liars go to prison too. I wish in real life the good ones prevail, or the bad guys who turned good, or the good ones who turned crook and realize in the ends, they wished they stayed to be the good ones.<br/><br/>Maybe a family movie, for the crook family so that they will see or realize the crooks sometimes loses. A family that stays together burns in hell together. A family that stays good together no matter what, remains to humans after all, and to be human is the greatest gift of all- not loving yourself loving yourself purports for self-preservation, 'between me and you I will kill you so I will live.'

"dromasca","6","0","1","28 February 2009"," half-baked mob saga
","'American Gangster' has in place all the ingredients for being one of these big and successful American sagas that Hollywood knows to do too well. The film is built around the true story of an interesting character - Frank Lucas, one of the first Afro-American mob heads, a self made gangster but also a businessman and a man of family, it enjoys the presence on screen two leading actors of Oscar fame, it is directed by a well known name, and even screen time exceeds the two and a half hours, which became kind of normal for the big American films recently.<br/><br/>And yet, Ridley Scott's film fails, and the failure is to be found in the two many inconsistencies in building his characters, and in the lack of success of making the story in the film both successful and true to reality. Denzel Washington's interior light and dignity plays an ambiguous role here, we know and like him too much from other scene appearances to really get shocked of his Frank Lucas's evilness, he is more convincing when shown taking his mom to church, or building a business plan or even turning down his accomplices, than when killing a man for to impose his power in a scene which seems out of the character's space. Russell Crowe as detective Richie Roberts is on the contrary more convincing when dealing with his personal troubles, and less when trying to be the on corruptible character who nails Lucas. A typical case of two excellent actors that do a good job but do not raise to the levels of excellency we expect from them.<br/><br/>While the parallel lives of the two characters advance on parallel tracks, the tension is built towards the final confrontation that is meant to be the climax of the movie. We are filled in with too many standard and expected stuff from other more minor movies - for example the juxtaposition of the failed family and parental life of the 'good' detective vs. the devoted family life of the gangster. If this is meant to be kind of a social comment - the good guy is paying with his personal life the price of being right, while the bad guy is the one apparently realized, well, this sounds kind of trivial and moralistic. It is only the usage of the TV sequences that puts the story in the perspective of the 60s and 70s and the ravaging effects of the drugs trade on the American society. Nothing new or unexpected here however.<br/><br/>'American Gangster' could have been one of these big American sagas. Or maybe not, maybe we had too many of these on screens in the last ten years and we should rather take a break."

","Sometimes the craft of a movie speaks for itself and is reason enough to recommend it. These days this often means a certain trade-off, since the audience gets a magnificent special-effects razzle-dazzle instead of a story, leaving the reviewer to praise the former and yearn for the latter. Not so Ridley Scott's ""American Gangster"", which scores high marks in every department and presents us with a crime- and police-drama of the tallest order.<br/><br/>As the title suggests this is, like last year's ""The Departed"", yet another major walk down America's mean streets. And like Scorsese's Beantown yarn, Scott is not just simply confronting us with cops and lowlifes, but turns the American Dream on its ear. <br/><br/>Here's a master class of capitalism seen through the eyes of Harlem-Crime-Lord Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), who during the Vietnam war rose to fortune and power by personally shipping in pure heroin from Vietnam and Thailand and selling it at discount prices. A sly scheme that enabled him to eliminate the middle-man, the competition and which made him a host of enemies. Among them the corrupt NYPD, who was turning over a substantial profit from reselling seized drugs and extorting the powers that were. In the middle of this dangerous quagmire honest New Jersey-cop Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) investigated both Lucas and his fellow officers and managed, in true Serpico-fashion, to bring the house of drugs down - at least for a split-second.<br/><br/>Labeled as ""based on a true story"" ""American Gangster"" for once actually earns the overused header, which is usually there to legitimize utter fiction. Scott's drama pulls of the rare feat of staying within the worlds of a familiar genre, clichés included, and at the same time demystifies our notion of noble gangsters and crooked cops. <br/><br/>Washington and Crowe are perfectly cast and provide their roles with the necessary gravitas and ambivalence. There's a sense of star power, but both leading men use their persona to take it to different levels. Washington's Lucas, mostly all charm as the drug-peddling benefactor of Harlem, unleashes bursts of violence and thereby undercutting any sympathy that may arise. Crowe's bulky physique is hammered by the characters sacrosanct work ethic, which keeps him close to the streets and away from his family.<br/><br/>Populated with familiar faces in small roles, and new faces in larger ones, there is a seamlessness and believability to every part that makes the movie a joy to watch. Yes, there are a few too familiar and mannered performances. Armand Assante's Don Cattano is a rehash of a dozen other mob-baddies and Josh Brolin's evil cop could basically wear a sign that says so. But leaving this aside, it's an astonishing ensemble that stays true to the material, skillfully weaved together by distinguished writer Steven Zaillian. As in his legal-drama ""A Civil Action"" Zaillian uses procedural techniques to advance the plot and creates a solid canvas, which forms the starting-off point for Scott and his collaborators. Taking Arthur Max' ever superb production design and combining it with cinematographer Harris Savides' muted color palette, consisting of deep blacks that remind us of the great works of Gordon Willis, Scott and editor Pietro Scalia maintain a strong pace from start to finish, never loosing focus and accompanied by a seventies soundtrack let loose a rollicking soul-beat manifesto. <br/><br/>After his paid holiday in Provence that resulted in the cutesy but bland ""A Good Year"", Scott now cooks up a fast-talking potboiler, turning themes of corruption and the necessity of crime into a depressing but always riveting street study. ""American Gangster"" shows the murky connection between crime and law, and of course their financial co-dependency. The movie argues, and rightly so, that terminating the drug or any illegal business would cause huge unemployment and seriously damage the economy, since all business is subject to one market force. So whether it's drugs, prostitution, weapons, Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, the trough is the same, as is the color of money. <br/><br/>Now will the real American Gangsters please stand up!"

","I knew next to nothing about this movie before renting it, and when I saw that it was running at close to three hours, I expected to be colossally bored by another vanity epic. But then I was riveted, my head blew off and my eyes melted. I sat transfixed in front of the tube not thinking about the time, and after the titles rolled I started to watch the director's-comments version until I was forced into bed because the birdies started to tweet outside. What a movie.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott simply strikes a right balance between action and authenticity. It's like a triple whopper with extra onions which is entirely made out of organically harvested yogurt. OK, that sounds gross but you get the point.<br/><br/>While it's the many garish scenes of action, sex and brutality that keep the viewer's interest (let's be honest, folks), many of the subtler scenes stuck with me. For example when crime don Lucas buys his mother a lavish home (a gangster movie staple, big gangsters always buy their mum a nice house), there is also a brief scene in which he shows her a dresser he has had made for her, which is a copy of one which the family has had repossessed many years ago. Or later there is a brief scene where his mother tries to set him straight for planning to murder a bunch of cops. Or how Lucas chats up his later wife. These scenes strike home amidst all the mayhem.<br/><br/>Another thing that this movie gets right is that it shows Lucas as being, maybe very clever, but not a criminal mastermind. He does make mistakes, and they do come after him. And while he may think of himself as a gentleman, we also see his unbridled brutality lurking under this veneer.<br/><br/>Two things which I didn't ""buy"" from this movie:<br/><br/>* the scene where Frank Lucas shoots a rival point blank in the head and in coram publico: that would be a pretty stupid thing to do as murder isn't exactly legal, not even in New York City, and Lucas isn't stupid.<br/><br/>* Richie Roberts and the women: Roberts is the hard man women think is good to find. I get it. But the endless stream of foxy attorneys and salacious stewardesses who beg him to ""Furp me like a cop"" is just a bit too puerile (or maybe I'm jealous).<br/><br/>Anyway, great movie."
"policy134","5","0","1","20 November 2008"," Scott doesn't bring anything new to the already over-exhausted genre
","Really disappointing. I am not a fun of most of Ridley Scott's movies. I thought Blade Runner, although a triumph in stylish production design was a very dull experience. Gladiator had the same problems, although Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen gave excellent performances. The best film of his is one of his most mainstream, Thelma & Louise and it is vastly overlooked today as a great achievement in both story and eerie, almost ghoulish style.<br/><br/>I have to be very careful here because I know that in each of his films there are commendable elements and the same applies here. I don't know if it's the jumping back and forth between the two main characters or if it was the storyline of the Vietnam connection. It seems like we are being taught history instead of being absorbed in the story.<br/><br/>The plot keeps the two main characters apart for most of the running time, maybe trying for a Heat-like approach. The problem is that as individual characters they are totally uninteresting (a fact made even more sad when you think of the caliber of the actors, especially Russell Crowe). A subplot about Crowe's character is totally unnecessary and could have been cut right out without an audience noticing.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is supposed to be charming and dangerous at the same time but doesn't really succeed. There are several gap in his storyline (mind you I have not seen the director's cut). He virtually goes from nothing to a big shot in 2 seconds.<br/><br/>At last, Crowe and Washington's big scene together at the end. It seems false, smarmy and you can almost see the winking at the audience. Okay, maybe that's exaggerating but if Scott was trying to emulate a similar scene in Heat, he failed immensely. The epilogue tells what later happened to Frank Lucas, and at that point I thought: ""Who cares?"" The story was uninteresting so why make a point of showing that it was actually based on real people."

","An enterprising black drug criminal and a whiter-than-white cop go head-to-head from the late 60's onwards.<br/><br/>Life writes the best jokes and the best drama, so the lucky authors are simply those that write them down on paper first. If WE are lucky they are the great writers themselves and can frame the story in the best possible way. American Gangster falls short of being an all-time classic, but is clever enough to have studied (and learnt) from a wide range of movies from The French Connection through Serpico through to the quality TV of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. It also borrows from a few failed movies like New Jack City.<br/><br/>It says in the bible that in the world of the blind the one-eyed man is king. Frank Lucas (Densil Washington) wasn't that smart, but he was smarter than those around him. Rather like Al Capone. If you listen hard enough to this production you can see he doesn't even follow his own limited advice! (I always judge criminals by their skill at staying out of prison - so Lucas can't really score very highly on my own Richter Scale.) <br/><br/>Richie Robers (Russell Crowe, who you may be interested to know has a mother-in-law local to me and sometimes visits) is not a great all-round actor because he isn't that smart as a person (you can't play smart unless you really are smart - Brando's problem). He is best playing pig-head and obstinate working class types with a sense of fair play. So well done the casting department. <br/><br/>Washington is the kind of actor that probably can't walk past a mirror and not look at himself. He refuses to wear the afro of that the real Frank Lucas sported and wants to be Joe Cool at any point when his life isn't endangered. Densil doesn't do sweaty or jerky anyway. In truth, he is getting a bit samey.<br/><br/>The problem with movies is momentum and falling in to the trap of simply repeating yourself. Easy traps to fall in to when real life (which this is - in outline form) does the same. When this is good it is top class - when it sags (which it does at various points) it comes across like above average TV drama. Equally it can't walk away from cheap thrills and the blindingly obvious. I don't like being in the company of professional lookers of the other way. However saintly they are framed - they are freeloaders of the first order. Pimps of scum rather than plain scum.<br/><br/>Moral issues are dealt with fairly and - to be frank - in an arbitrary manner. Thrown in from nowhere and going nowhere. Long shot of dead junkie and crying child from the book of movie cliché. Praise director Ridley Scott for including them (didn't have to), but about ten seconds thought has gone in to it.<br/><br/>If I'd have written the piece I would have gone more for the early years - learning the biz on the knee of the famous (original black gangster) Bumpy Johnson. Indeed this point (suggested as fact in this movie) may not have been the whole truth and nothing but the truth. <br/><br/>At the end I counted myself as very well entertained and curious enough to read more about the real people on the screen. The only downside is that Cuba Gooding Junior proves that unless he has a good script he just fades in to the wallpaper like an extra. No star charisma at all."
"gregmovies","8","0","1","29 August 2008"," One of the best crime films I've seen
","Ridley Scott's biopic/mob film ""American Gangster"" is one of my favorite organized crime movies. The script, direction, cinematography, and acting (particularly from Washington) are all impressive. As a fan of mafia and crime movies, the plot and story make for a great popcorn flick. However, this film does have its downsides. Crowe's storyline sometimes feels like a rip-off of ""Serpico"". The Richie Roberts' plot line is less interesting than Frank Lucas', and Roberts' family problems hurt the pacing and seem uninspired and unoriginal. Washington's great performance and the fascinating story more than a make up for these slight defects though. There are two versions of the film, the R-rated theatrical and the unrated director's cut. The DVD contains both versions, and the unrated version adds time and plot, not more objectionable material. I slightly preferred the theatrical version, but thought the unrated versions ending was marginally better.<br/><br/>I give American Gangster a strong 8/10. If you liked it, I recommend Serpico, The Godfather, Scarface, the Departed, Goodfellas, Casino, Eastern promises, and A History of Violence."

","American Gangster is a very well done gangster/cop movie. Denzel Washington plays Frank Lucas who rises up to be a dominant gangster in the Brooklyn/New York area. He has his brothers work for him and makes his money off of selling pure drugs.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe plays an honest cop who heads up an anti narcotics division led by his boss (Ted Levine, Silence of the Lambs). Crowe, along with members of the crew, are tracking down the big men of the drug world, and soon find themselves on Frank Lucas's tail.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch. Denzel Washington makes a very nasty, but yet likable gangster and Crowe makes a a good, honest cop with a bad home life. Also notable is Josh Brolin. He doesn't come in much until about an hour after the film has been rolling, but he makes a very believable dirty cop out to make money by selling drugs that he confiscates back to gangsters after cutting them down to hardly any purity.<br/><br/>The movie is long, complex and sometimes hard to follow, yet it is worth a watch, or two, or more.

"shortyrags","7","0","1","21 July 2008"," A Solid Crime Drama
","Ain't no love in the Harlem city...so it goes with American Gangster, a film about the rise and fall of famed drug-lord, Frank Lucas, played by Denzel Washington and the turmoil of the cop, Detective Richie Roberts, played by Russell Crowe, assigned to his case. At heart, this is a film about gangsters and is Scott's attempt at making the African-American Goodfellas. While the premise and the performances dialed in are both strong, the film strolls along a little too casually, and slowly begins to wear down the viewer (and not in a good way).<br/><br/>American Gangster is naturally based upon true events, seeing as most films nowadays do require some external inspiration. Nonetheless, the premise and characters presented are not only good on paper but are fairly well executed in the film. The story moves up and down the locales of New York City and delves into criminal themes such as corruption, redemption, and revenge. Frank Lucas was written into the film with such a mystique, that is reminiscent of old gangster mob heads. With that said, the story feels like a rehash at times and the crew has simply changed the names of the characters. There is a certain lack of originality here. The chase against Lucas, led by Detective Richie Roberts, is the important counter story to Frank's. At times, the Roberts sequences can get boring and at times, it felt like the writers did not have enough material for Crowe to work with.<br/><br/>Having said that, both star actors turn in wonderful performances, marred only by their lack of originality. At times, I felt like I was watching Alonso from Training Day. I also felt that at times, I was watching Eliot Ness trying to catch Al Capone. Both actors are great and do what they can with the roles, but the characters have been seen so many times before and have been done so well before, that their performances aren't quite as powerful. There are great supporting performances such as the one by Josh Brolin, portraying the corrupt Detective Trupo. In terms of the cast, Scott and his crew pretty much nailed it with the rapper T.I. even getting some screen time.<br/><br/>The film does however, tend to drag at times. The ending is prolonged and could have been finished a lot faster. It felt like it was being stretched out just for the sake of it. There were some scenes that were just pointless and unnecessary. However, some scenes were brilliant such as the raid on Lucas' drug ""plant."" The music is a nice blend between urban and hip-hop culture effectively purveying the shifting music culture of New York City in the 70's. In fact, the film does a fairly good job of capturing the whole 70's New York City culture and it is visually and audibly astounding at times. There's not a lot of instrumental work here, which is a shame, but there was a lot to like about the music, anyways.<br/><br/>In the end, Ridley Scott creates a solid film about crime and drugs and the rise of African American drug-lords. The film, however, is not very original and it takes a lot of concepts from previous gangster films. The performances, while great, are similarly branded with this lack of originality and it just felt a little too much like the same rigmarole. To make me truly love this film, Scott had to make it a little more special than he did. As it is, the film is a little too run-of-the-mill. The film is certainly not bad; like I said, the film does a good job dealing with the element of criminality and the police trying to stop it. But there have been too many other gangster and crime dramas that have done better and more importantly, have stood out more as something special."
"bobsgrock","7","0","3","16 July 2008"," Ridley Scott is no Scorsese.
","Make no mistake, American Gangster is a very well-made, brutal and intense crime epic that covers the span of time under the rule of Frank Lucas, perhaps the first African-American to fully rule the drug underworld of New York City by himself without the support of another family. Still, all I could think while watching this was that it couldn't compare to The Godfather or Goodfellas. I'm sure Ridley Scott, a fine director in his own respect, wasn't trying to make a film comparable to those, but it still feels like the true story was put together in the same those were. The acting here is strong with Denzel Washington giving a calm, cool and calculating performance as Lucas, who perceives himself as more of a businessman than a drug dealer. Russell Crowe is also very good as a straight cop who has a terrible personal life but follows his job exactly by the book. The supporting characters are good and the cinematography perfectly captures the tough, gritty streets of New York and Newark during the 1970s. I did like this as an entertaining film, but in the end, it takes a course so similar to Goodfellas I couldn't believe it. I guess it did have to follow the way the real story occurred to be realistic, but it still copies the outline from a much better film. To be blunt, Ridley Scott is no Martin Scorsese or Francis Ford Coppola, and despite all the good stuff from this, I prefer the much more stylistic directing of Scorsese or the powerful storytelling of Coppola."

","I was really tempted to write ""African American Gangster"" in the summary line, but since that's what most will read, sometimes even without looking at the actual comment of the movie, I was afraid it would stir too much discussion. But here in the text I can write it, because I can point out that it's a joke on the title of the movie and of course on all the PC thing going on right now (in our society). Just my kind of weird humor.<br/><br/>But back to the movie, that could be called the ""Heat"" of Russel and Denzel. Yes the two have played in a movie together before and who can't remember the classic Sci-Fi B-movie they were in? No seriously, does anybody remember the name of that movie? ;o) I have seen that first collaboration (minus Ridley of course), but it must have been at least ten years ago. It was nice as I recall/remember for the sort of movie it was. The funny thing is, that they might have had more on-screen time together back then, then they have now! <br/><br/>Still now with Ridley directing them both and Russell C. leaving the staring (or ""better"") role to Denzel, this movie is already considered a classic by many. Russell wanted the Denzel role here, but since Denzel gave him the better part in the Sci-Fi B-movie I was talking about earlier, Russell thought he owed Denzel (that's how it was written in Film magazines). But Russell's role got bigger (he fought for that of course), making his character more believable. And here are other similarities to HEAT. Russells cop is similar to Pacino's character. Caring only about his job and not so much about his family/wife. Of course he has some ticks/nuances that are different from Pacino's role, as has Denzel's character too, who's more of a family man (so to speak). But Denzel's character seems to have some similarities with the Nic Cage character from ""Lord of War"". Only a few things that seem to be identical, but then again this also could be just a coincidence.<br/><br/>Anyway the point is, that Ridley made another great picture, having assembled a cast and crew that were/are on top of their game. Highly recommendable! :o)"

","The movie was like a documentary. But unlike a documentary, it has a lot  and I mean a lot  of historical flaws that just mean shoddy craftsmanship. (Check out the ""Goofs"" section.) ****Spoiler Alert**** (I saw the DVD unrated extended version) <br/><br/>I rooted for the black guy, as well as the white. They were both archetypes trying to do a quality job. Unfortunately, the black one killed people without much remorse; although: I have to say I liked the gun to the head in the middle of the crowded street. Yup, nobody here saw nothing.<br/><br/>Bumpy and the mob boss were poorly written: maybe that's how they are, but they came across as stilted.<br/><br/>And, I disliked the Puerto Rican beauty queen  although god knows she grew into the role. I liked the mom's comment: ""She's an angel."" That sentence conveys so much: the judging of goodness by looks alone (can't judge a book by its cover), the straight from the heart comments of the Mom, and that an angel is supposed to represent the ultimate (that word archetype again) of what a person can be. And, maybe because I have issues with my elderly mom, I really liked that the Mom slaps her son and says ""Don't lie to me."" Go, mom.<br/><br/>Of course, I liked the putting away of 150 criminals by the white and black man working together. And the cops. Wow, I hated the cops. How could they follow a rule that says: ""Cops kill cops they don't trust""? And by not trusting: meaning cops who do not take bribes or do not steal. That is a shame. We still have the blue wall of silence, where cops do wrong and do not ""rat"" on each other. Well, my feeling is that if you don't rat on fellow cops, you are implying that you, too, are a rat!"

","Spectacular, absolutely spectacular. There are not many films out there about which I can say this. However this one deserves nothing less. Everything is perfect. I don't think there could have been more suitable actors for the roles. Denzel is brutal and greedy, and at the same time elegant. Out of all the black actors out there, he is the only one who could play such a role flawlessly. Crowe played the good guy, the tough, honest cop who put his job above everything else, who did what he believed what right despite all the corruption around him. Characters like him have been in hundreds of movies before it, nevertheless his character is very distinct and original.<br/><br/>There are very few crime movies out there with an atmosphere so dark, yet so realistic. I was born in the eighties, but this movie gave me a feeling like I was reliving the sixties. It is absolutely brilliant. One movie that I can say goes along with this one is Blow. Blow is the story about how cocaine spread, and American Gangster is the story about heroin. However the movies do have many similarities, the differences are just as copious. To name one, there are many fun, happy moments in blow, and in this movie there are none. Although this is one of the movie's greatest strengths, the serious portrayal of greed, corruption, lust for power and justice.<br/><br/>I strongly advise everyone (who's an adult) to see this movie, either rent it, buy it, steal it, I don't care how, JUST GET IT!"

","An internet search reveals much about the two main characters in this film. They were, and still are, real people whose lives are portrayed fairly accurately in ""American Gangster."" In one interview Lucas says the movie is about 75% accurate regarding his life. Likewise, Richey Roberts in a different interview cites some discrepancies, but overall the characterizations are correct.<br/><br/>The movie tells the stories of Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts using parallel story lines. Lucas wanting to get rich, and seeing street drugs as the way to do it. Circumventing traditional routes and middlemen, he went directly to SE Asia and bought very pure drugs at the source, and used American servicemen to help him smuggle the drugs into the USA, using special made coffins with concealed bottoms.<br/><br/>While Lucas was developing his business model, Roberts was studying law at night while working as a Detective in New Jersey. Based on his good work he was eventually given the task of heading up a drug squad with the mandate to go only after the big guys. Fate would eventually bring Lucas to Roberts.<br/><br/>This is an extremely good movie. Even though the theatrical version on DVD is about 2 and 1/2 hours long, it never seems long. Denzel Washington a few years ago beat out Crowe for the Best Actor Oscar in ""Training Day"", an award many thought he did not deserve over Crowe's role in ""A Beautiful Mind."" But here Washington redeems himself as Frank Lucas. And, that same Russell Crowe is here as Det. Richie Roberts. Both of them are superb.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: The movie follows the historical account pretty well, as Roberts and a squad of police raid Lucas' home and his drug operation, and seize his assets. Lucas went to prison but his sentence was cut short because he cooperated to identify a very large number of men on the NYC police force who were dirty. Roberts became a defense attorney and ironically later defended Frank Lucas in court. He also became the godfather of one of Lucas' sons."

","American Gangster is probably the best film i have seen from 2007 apart from possibly Superbad. It involved some great shooting scenes and had a gripping storyline. I feel that films that are based on true events create a great feeling and emotion as you no that the scenes would be similar to those of real people. Although Denzel plays a horrible man bringing heroine in to the US, inside dead soldier's coffins you feel a bit worried when he is finally busted. Although he has been bringing in possibly the deadliest drug on the planet he has been doing so to provide him and his family with a life that they possibly do deserve. Richie Roberts (Russel Crowe) plays a good part in the drama as well, providing the chase on Frank (Denzel). Gangsters are not his only problem in the film either he has to struggle with his family life as he enters court trying to stop his ex wife leaving the state with his son. But does he really deserve him?. If this wasn't enough for the underrated cop he is faced with croockid policemen through out the film, being payed of by big dealers to let all kinds of drugs into the country. As Richie gets closer and closer to busting Frank he realises that it is not only the gangsters causing the trouble in the city. When he finally catches Frank in the big bust at the end of the film, both men work together to try and get Denzels sentence lowered and to catch the police offers braking the law and it turns out there are a few more than were first expected."

","This is one of the better ""ganster/mob"" films that I've seen in recent years, basically because of the way the movie manages to blend personal story lines in an unromanticized way into the grimy reality of life in the underworld.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around the story of Frank Lucas (an excellent performance by Denzel Washington) who starts off the story as the driver to one of Harlem's leading gangsters and traces his rise to the head of New York City's drug trafficking lords. As with many ""mob"" stories, the truly frightening thing in many ways is how normal this guy's life is away from ""work."" He's got a mom who loves him and who he takes to church every week, a beautiful wife who seems totally in love with him, a nice home, powerful and apparently legitimate friends and he runs his business - his drug business, and a legitimate club that presumably helps to account for some of his money. Starting off with basically nothing after the mobster he works for dies, Lucas ruthlessly rises to the top in a businesslike fashion, by importing high quality drugs from Thailand, using US military planes as transports.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe on the other hand is Detective Richie Roberts, an honest cop - one of the few apparently, and ostracized by other cops for turning in almost a million dollars rather than keeping it. One of the most memorable lines in the movie belongs to his partner (played by John Ortiz) who says by way of warning what awaits them on the force and in an attempt to convince Roberts that they should keep the money ""cops who turn in a million dollars also turn in other cops."" (In other words, there's not a cop on the force who'll trust you enough to work with you after this.) When that prediction turns out to be true, Roberts ends up heading a federal investigation into drug trafficking, and Lucas becomes his chief prey.<br/><br/>The story of dishonest cops, mainly represented by Det. Trupo (Josh Brolin) provides the continuous backdrop to the movie, and it's very well done. It's a shocking note at the end of the movie that three quarters of the NYC Drug Enforcement Agency ended up being charged in the federal investigation.<br/><br/>This is a very good blending together of these three stories, based on fact and brilliantly acted by Washington and Crowe, as well as the supporting cast. It's violent, but not gratuitously so. The last bit of the movie (featuring the co-operation between Lucas and Roberts after Lucas is caught) seems to fly by a little bit too fast, and one of the closing captions tells us that Lucas was released from prison in 1991, but doesn't tell us what he's been doing since then, which I would have liked to have found out - did he go back to the life, or did he stay straight? Aside from that, though, this is a very good movie that will not disappoint. 8/10"

","American Gangster is a very good, enjoyable film, a great addition to the gangster movie genre. The film starts as Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), a major gangster in New York in the 1970s, and Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), as the police detective who investigates Lucas' Empire. The film shows how Lucas rise to power, importing heroin from Thailand, using the coffins of soldiers who died in Vietnam. He is shown to have a decent life, respected in his community, rich and occasionally has to commit acts of violence. He is smart, well-read, a good businessman and loyal to his family. His brothers became his lieutenants, he loved his mum. He befriends celebrities but he is not flash does not draw attention to himself. Roberts on the other hands is an honest cop, working in New Jersey and struggling in his life. He is given the opportunity to head a special unit to invest drugs in New York. He is the opposite to Lucas; a poor dresser, has a poor relationship with his family and not particularly well off.<br/><br/>Lucas is a sympathetic character, and runs a good operation. Roberts is a fault character but he is trying his best; he was working hard to clear up the police force. They are issues tackled in the film such as drug use, police corruption, race and the American Dream. It also has a fun little in joke that it takes a cop from New Jersey to sort out New York.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott shows that he is a master of film-making. He has shown that he can make sci-fi, historical epic, war and now gangster and police film and I hope his next films are just as good."

","This movie is a true story based on the life of an African-American drug dealer rising through the ranks of New York drug dealers, using his charm, intelligence and sheer determination to overcome any obstacle to live the American dream. Sound Familiar? The best way to describe this film is a toned-down version of Scarface. Not as gritty and ""in your face"". Volatile but not very violent. Aggressive but not explosive. Interesting but not thrilling. <br/><br/>In the end, it goes a long way to be extremely entertaining but falls short of being gripping. It lacks the charisma and rawness of Scarface and the result is a low-impact but extremely watchable gangster movie.<br/><br/>It delivers your staple gangster diet of shootings, threats, revenge-taking, power-trips and ""what you gonna do about it sucka?"" lines that you crave so much as a gangster movie lover. With the added bonus of showing you not only how powerful a man can become but also the price he pays for it. Or does he? Definitely worth watching to find out.<br/><br/>I'm a great gangster movie fan and I watched this movie purely based on the fact that I thought Denzel Washington would make a fantastic gangster. I saw his performance in Man On Fire and thought he is ideally suited to play a cool, collected and deadly man. He plays the role more like a professional hit-man than a loud gangster. Class and dignity is a key theme. <br/><br/>Crowe throws in a good performance too but more forgettable. They're both Oscar winners but they lack the enigmatic factor. Don't get me wrong...the acting is descent but you get the feeling that the movie is somewhat saved by the actors, not by the acting itself. The headlining A-list names attract you, not their performances in the role. They've both had much better roles in the past (Training day, Gladiator etc). In other words you wouldn't go to see this movie if it were Ted Danson and Louis Gossett Jr in the main roles but you would be equally entertained when watching the movie itself? <br/><br/>You will enjoy this film because you love gangster movies and because there hasn't ever been a decent African-American gangster movie made until this one. It is worth watching but don't expect a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ultimately you will be very aware throughout the film that you're only watching it to find out what happens to the main character, not because the movie is good.<br/><br/>I'm giving it a 7/10 but only because I know you'll enjoy watching it if you're a gangster movie lover. If this isn't your genre, then it's still entertaining but would only score a 5/10.<br/><br/>For lovers of Gangster movies only then."

As he did in ""Training Day"" he stuns us with a turn as ""exceedingly bright black man who is in total control of everything, and actually already has it all figured out"".<br/><br/>It's a testament to the strength of this picture that it's long running time just flies by, as you get lost in a fascinating story, very well told."

"darqueknight","10","0","1","7 April 2008"," Frank's Stupidity Was His Worst Enemy
","I thought the movie was very entertaining and I purchased the DVD for my collection. A couple of things struck me as odd to the point that I researched them after watching the movie to see if they were true. Frank Lucas has been built up as a criminal genius, when in fact, he was done in by his own stupidity. For example: 1. Frank stumbled upon the idea of cutting out the middleman and offering a product that was twice as good as the competition at half the price. He quickly amassed a fortune in excess of 250 million dollars, 200 million of which was in real estate holdings. A really smart guy would have parlayed his criminal earnings into legitimate businesses. Why continue to risk your life and freedom selling dope when you have a fortune in the hundreds of millions? In Frank's case, selling dope was the only way he knew how to make real money. He did own some legitimate businesses, but they were just fronts for heroin distribution. He really had no idea of how to run a legitimate business and how to turn an honest dollar. He also could have sold some of his real estate, invested the money, and lived very comfortably off his interest earnings. However, Frank didn't trust many people, and I assume that his mistrust also included investment advisers. When Frank got out of prison the first time, after serving a 5 year term, he went right back to doing the only thing he knew how to do well: selling heroin. Frank's wife and some of his friends and business associates urged him to get out and quit while he was ahead, but he wouldn't listen.<br/><br/>2. It was unbelievable that the cops were able to walk right up to Frank's heroin manufacturing center in the projects. C'mon, no lookouts? No kind of advance warning system? No heavily armed gang to protect his multi-million dollar manufacturing operation? That's crazy. How in the hell could a large group of mostly white guys so much as set foot in a Harlem housing project without setting off a chain reaction of early warnings? Even more significant than the threat of a police raid, Frank should have been concerned about his manufacturing center being raided, robbed, or destroyed by a rival drug gang and planned accordingly.<br/><br/>Criminal mastermind/genius? Nah...just a lucky one trick pony who didn't have sense enough to quit while he was ahead."

"lizziebeth-1","7","0","1","21 March 2008"," Coasts in neutral for too long. What went wrong, Sir Ridley?
","The first thing everyone mentions--or likes--about American Gangster is that it's based on a remarkable true story. Well, three such classics were released 30yrs ago, around the time AG is set: The French Connection(1971), Serpico(1973), and The SuperCops(1974). There weren't more basically because the Knapp Commission nabbed the corrupt cops, making the story moot, until Blow(2001).<br/><br/>While AG(2007) references Dets.Eddie Egan and Sonny Grasso of the actual Marseilles (""French Connection"") drug bust, SuperCops(1974) spoofed two real undercover cops of the time. Nicknamed ""Batman and Robin"" by most of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Dave Greenberg and Bob Hantz worked their beat miles from Frank Lucas' Harlem.<br/><br/>So a lot of early 1970s cops got famous for doing their jobs, since the heroin-based ""black(secret) economy"" grew to employ so many people over the previous 20yrs that it corrupted police forces across the country.<br/><br/>Sadly as a biopic, AG coasts in neutral until Sam and Dave's Hold_On_I'm_Comin' at 38mins.<br/><br/>The Australian version comes out the gate like the Sopranos, unfortunately following its violent opening with a disjoint 1968 scene of Lucas(Washington) intently watching Bumpy(Clarence Williams.III)'s ""bread-and-circuses"" act from the back. It's also unclear that Frank is already dealing for himself when he's harassed by ""Mr 20%""(Idris Elba). These are editing issues.<br/><br/>Not only are signpost dates of the story often missing (or are so subtle that you only catch them by accident), but the structural choice to stay ahead of the audience for 4/5ths of this LONG movie robs our eventual discovery (about how the drugs were being smuggled) of emotional impact. Better-structured movies like Michael Clayton(2007) ""promise"" an explanation, and deliver at least two-thirds in.<br/><br/>AG also lacks humour, with only two such scenes: the one where Richie(Crowe) is offered a bribe of a new technology called a microwave and he replies ""No thank you"", and where he hauls a man following him off the street to discover the guy is just a process-server loosening his bowels into his pants.<br/><br/>The need to appeal to younger audiences forced some awkward overcompensations with the language, substituting Ebonics (1990s) for Jive (1970s). This is a subconscious irritant for anyone who's watched the original ""Mod Squad""(1968-1973), which, incidentally, gave Clarence Williams.III his career.<br/><br/>Worst of all, AG suffers horribly from megastar miscastings. Joe Morton (too sweet for a gangster), Cuba Gooding.Jr (overacting in a nothing role), and Russell Crowe (too much the Bronzed Aussie with a 1980s haircut!!) all should've been recast with unknowns. Denzel even looks wrong: the real Frank Lucas looked more like the pudgy Frank Hayes character from SuperCops(1974).<br/><br/>It's great that (as Lucas) Washington quotes Chris Rock's standup about African-Americans not knowing how to become ""wealthy"", but his acting choices for Frank don't always suit him. Denzel crucially lacks credibility speaking even Ebonics--witness his ""bid'ness"" and ""bup-bup-bup-bup-baaaaa"" while arguing with Nate(Roger Guenveur Smith).<br/><br/>Smith's ""a'ight"" is groaningly bad, too--it doesn't fit his uniform; while Ted Levine(""Buffalo Bill"" from Silence of the Lambs(1991)) and Armand Assante are just two mushmouths too many on AG. Crowe never gets the Australian out of his ""Jewish"" NY accent; and (as Joey Sadano) Ritchie Coaster can't get the Italian in. What is this? Duelling (Bad)Accents?! Whether these stars were miscast, rushed for time, or just poorly edited, SOMEBODY sold us ""an Edsil"".<br/><br/>""Sir""Ridley Scott is responsible for this disappointment, with help from his brother Tony and Brian Grazer. What went wrong? Presumably there just wasn't enough screen time for exposition or ""light-and-shade"" in this long movie pared-to-the-bone-from-being-really-overlong, so that even Oscar-winning editor Pietro Scalia looks like he screwed up. Scalia's second ""guerilla montage"" of drug-addicted devastation is so easy to miss (lasting only 27s) that it's virtually subliminal--so why make a biopic on the topic? One can just sense a much longer Director's Cut in the offing. Hopefully. Studio execs should just LET Ridley WORK.<br/><br/>Eventually the audience compensates for the uneven editing and figures out what the plot's doing and who everybody is, but it's no longer enjoyable.<br/><br/>Beyond that, there's the social discomfort of the family's corruption. Frank was ""buying off cops since (he) was 10yrs old"" and his mother was ignoring it for 30yrs. Much of our discomfort is editorialised through the irony of recalling more innocent imagery of North-migrating African-American families in slow-creeping Lincolns.<br/><br/>I had surprisingly strong revulsions against 1) Mama Lucas(Ruby Dee)'s unquestioning ACCEPTANCE of her career-criminal son's massive mansion; and 2) against Frank's ""Miss Puerto Rico"" wife, who thought that dumping a kind boxing champion for a murdering drug baron was the apex of social-climbing. But ""you don't know what you'd do till you're put under pressure; a'course 110th Street is a hellova tester""(Bobby Womack, 1972).<br/><br/>To his credit, Ridley doesn't shy away from indirectly critiquing 1970s Harlem, either. He encourages our dismay at Bumpy Johnson's ""Robbin' Hood"" act back in 1968 by showing how Bumpy, and later Frank, controlled Harlem with ""bread and circuses"" like Emperor Commodus.<br/><br/>Not for nothing', but 1968 was the last year of Martin Luther King's life; his words fell on deaf ears in Harlem, where people were more interested in Frank's frozen turkeys....we now know better, realising that this supplanting drug-economy made Harlem virtually a ""failed state"", not much better than Afghanistan today.<br/><br/>For anyone still unsure, there is a more sinister explanation for AG's disappointment, involving its 68 ""stunt people"", of whom only 28 at most appear on screen (during the Huey Lucas chase). Most of those do little work for the money. The stunts budget, then, probably pushed the whole so far into the red that there wasn't any left for cleanup of the booms in shot, at least 4x in the Sydney print! There are, of course, many things that work, but the studio's insistence on cutting AG for time made it into a ""frozen turkey"", when by rights Ridley Scott should have delivered us a Thanksgiving dinner.<br/><br/>Maybe the (40-or-so) missing stunt people ATE it.(7/10)"

","I'll make it short: I didn't see anything wrong it. It's a great story, although not totally 'new', but who cares? It can't be new all the time. It's well casted, well acted, shots are fine, nothing wrong with it.<br/><br/>==== spoilers ahead =====<br/><br/>What i found particularly interesting about the story is the reality factor of it. In the 'scene', being a leading figure, you don't have to go around shooting people all the time like a loon. In fact, it's the opposite. You don't show off, cause a lot of people will hate you for it and will want to bring you down. Most interesting was the side story (one others oppose to) of Richie with his wife, where she blames him he is NOT corrupt. And that is a fact. It's peer pressure, group moral. Drugs feed a lot of mouths, directly or indirectly and people close around you usually don't care where you get your money from. They just want you to get the money and keep them out of harms way. That is realistic. So the hero and anti-hero are both heroes and both lose their families. Nobody cares for heroes longer than the spotlights are there.<br/><br/>Such is life.<br/><br/>The general said it: quitting isn't the same as quitting while you are ahead.<br/><br/>And trying to save the world is rather silly and doesn't pay of, i can say from experience.<br/><br/>Nice movie."
"Zentaurion","6","0","1","19 March 2008"," Cops and Robbers
","Good effort, but Ridley Scott needs to try harder to do better in the genre.<br/><br/>It seems wildly over-rated. A lot of the early parts are confusing, in a bad way. The characters are presented in a raw and realistic manner, but not much characterization is given to build up a personality, instead things are strangely rushed in a way that a lot of events happen but the character's motivations aren't delved into. Russell Crowe's Richie is the good cop, he's a womanizer, he's a hard ass, and that's about it.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington for all the praise he got didn't seem to put much effort in. He was much more convincing in his role in Man on Fire. Here, he's cold and unblinking in one scene, a jittery rattled old man the next. There's nothing to draw out the conflict inside. For example, the scenes when he buys his mother the new house and watches her face so unemotionally, then remains impassive even as he hugs her. Same later when he hugs his wife. There's just this blank look on him all the time. You don't get a feel for the intensity inside such an individual. Maybe it was weak directing on the part of Ridley Scott.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe came across slightly better, maybe on account of having worked with Scott before. But the script doesn't really build on a personality for his character either. Both characters, Frank and Richie, seem paper thin by the end, so the focus pulls away from their actions and is just about the moral of the story.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is supposed to be great. But it didn't really stand out, and some of it was borrowed from movies like Jackie Brown.<br/><br/>A good one time watch, but gives not inclination for further viewing."

This movie has its moments, its true. I can not understand, however, how people may think it is comparable to such classic gangster pieces like the Godfather, Goodfellas, Carlito's Way or Casino. It is not comparable, unfortunately, it is not in the same league even. I can see these movies over and over, because there are pure magic in them. I doubt if i will see American Gangster more than one more time. I saw it once, i appreciate it, i don't miss it. It is too long, which is not the problem in itself. I know its fashionable to make long ""epics"" about 3 hours long and more but its not always good for the movie when there is not enough interesting plot, drama, tension, fascinating relations between characters. This is the case - long parts of the American Gangster are just boring because there was not enough substance to fill the ""empty spaces"". The paradox is that, on the other side, there are many things lacking here - especially on character development side, which could made us believe there are real people there, non Denzel and Russel playing their roles.<br/><br/>Good movie.

","The Ridley Scott mark is evident here simply because of the sprawling landscapes he is known far and wide for in telling the story of real-life crime lord Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) juxtaposed with the investigation and eventual capture by fictitious investigator Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe).<br/><br/>The movie is fast-paced with a sweeping panorama of the period spotted with memorable performances. That being said, a glaring disappointment was Scott/s inability (refusal?) to adequately utilize the support of such stalwart actors as Ruby Dee & Chiwetel Ejiofor, both of whom provided substantial support that appeared to have fallen victim to the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>An interesting parallel was indeed Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts as they both had enormous similarities, the biggest of which was their devotion to their work which seemed infinitely more important to them than their families. It is this poor prioritizing that provides the impetus for their actions. Crowe's character was somewhat more redeemable than Washingtons' whose character indeed had anger management issues which were all supposedly explained away because of societal pressures - blah, blah, blah...<br/><br/>It is also interesting that many of Washington's characterizations don't necessarily warrant much attention unless they are somewhat less than socially redeeming.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding, it is indeed a good film with flaws like any other (hardly a masterpiece) but well worth becoming a part of your film collection.

","Ridley Scott loves his villains. He has always attempted to show the characters with questionable morality in a new light. His characters are never black or white... they just roam in different shades of grey.<br/><br/>Frank Lucas, the character on the other side of law, a drug lord in 70s New Jersey, is Scott's principal character in this film. But Scott would never paint him out-and-out dark with villainy. He needs someone who would play it just according to the right shade of grey. And here we got Denzel Washington. In the scene where Frank shows his newly-bought mansion to his mother and says - ""Momma this is your house"" ... and in the scene where he puts a bullet through someone's head in the middle of a crowded street - Washington is equally convincing, a delightful screen presence.<br/><br/>These stories particularly need a 'good cop'. High morals, troubled personal life, on the verge of career end, standing alone among his corrupted colleagues - you know the stereotype. This is Ritchie Roberts played by none other than Russell Crowe. Crowe is proved champion in playing such diligent, meticulous characters. Here his accent, attention and mannerisms are perfect. Josh Brolin is again awesome in his supporting role.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, the screenplay does a good job in curbing the need of first-person narrations in such a story. It is surprisingly low-key, but is able to deliver the required amount of tension and style. The action sequences are extremely well-balanced, ruthless but never seemed tiring. ""American Gangster"" is definitely one of the best movies of 2007... but it falls short of absolute greatness, for a reason somehow unknown."

","When I started watching ""American Gangster"", I had no idea what it was about. By the end, I was surprised that I had never heard the story before.<br/><br/>The first character whom we meet is Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), confidante of Harlem gangster extraordinaire Ellsworth ""Bumpy"" Johnson (Clarence Williams III). Lucas's first scene makes him look like a heartless killer, but we soon see that he does have friends and can be a nice guy. When Johnson dies in 1968, Lucas becomes head honcho in Harlem. But simply being the big cheese isn't enough for this guy. So he starts another business venture: drug trafficking. The ongoing Vietnam War enables Lucas to import heroin from Indochina, and before long he practically runs Harlem. Part of his aim is to stamp out corruption in his inner circle.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Det. Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) has his own stuff going. While going through a divorce, he seeks to bring down Lucas's drug empire, and at the same time dealing with corruption in his own ranks. So here we have these two men mired in slimy settings, both trying to make good. Well, as good as is possible in this sordid world that they inhabit.<br/><br/>For me, the movie's main strength was focusing on this topic. Since I had never known about any of this stuff, any concentration on it will be good. Beyond that, the movie does a pretty good job with its various topics. Granted, the breadth of the focus makes it hard for the movie to delve too deeply into any particular topic, but I felt fulfilled just learning about what happened. No, it's not the greatest movie ever (I consider ""Blade Runner"" Ridley Scott's best ever). But I would still recommend it. Also starring Ruby Dee."

","Based on a true story of 70's drug trafficking, American Gangster stars Denzil Washington as Frank Lucas - a driver for Bumpy Johnson - a Harlem mob boss who is also something of a father figure and mentor. When Bumpy dies suddenly of a heart attack Lucas inherits the kingdom. Dispensing with the showiness of his rivals, and inheriting corporate branding techniques to sell his dope, Lucas' rise is swift. Along with his obsessive reticence Lucas is also unique in his pioneering method of bringing heroin to America via air force planes out of South East Asia. Crap dad/honest cop Ritchie Roberts (Russell Crowe) has his sights set on bringing down the operation but Lucas' 'under the radar' profile makes him an impossible target. Roberts' campaign can go nowhere until he can identify the ringleader.<br/><br/>Apart from the de rigor 'crime doesn't pay' platitude, American Gangsters' message seems to be that there's no accounting for taste and that those with zero dress sense can triumph over those in designer wear. The campaign of Crowe's unglamorous and dowdy cop with rubbish hair appears hopeless against Washington's immaculate Brioni suited drug lord; that is until he commits a massive fashion faux par by attending a prize fight dressed as a squirrel. ""The loudest man in the room is the weakest man in the room."" Failing to take his own advice the demise of Frank Lucas is mere paperwork after that.<br/><br/>The depiction of Lucas' corporate marketing - a la Coca Cola - to sell 'quality' heroin to the 'discerning smack head' is something of a hoot. Maybe that's how it went down in 70's Harlem but most users in my experience would inject the contents of a leper's colostomy bag on the off-chance of a hit. Also Lucas's smuggling of his product into America via air force planes from Vietnam is not quite the revelation. He may have believed this was his baby but it's a fair bet that this enterprise was closely marshalled and monitored by the C.I.A, partly as a means to keeping urban negroes in a state of stupor so as not to organise themselves 'Black Panther/Nation of Islam' style. Whether he was aware of it or not Lucas was almost certainly working for the 'man'.<br/><br/>The big 'toe to toe' between Washington and Crowe falls short of the build up. For one, it's a long time coming, and by the time this keenly awaited 'final reckoning' takes place Lucas has already been arrested and on the ropes. Nevertheless, it is a great scene but cannot hope to ignite the screen in the way DeNiro and Pacino's 'two guys over a coffee' showdown in Heat does where no one has got the upper hand and the prize is still to be taken. <br/><br/>American Gangster's DNA is impeccable; you've got a director in Ridley Scott who is probably incapable of making a bad film and two of the biggest and charismatic stars of the day in Washington and Crowe. On paper it must have been beautiful but maybe it's this fail safe 'cannot lose' combination that raises the bar of expectation to an unreachable degree which excludes American Gangster from the cigar handing out ceremony accorded the likes of The Godfather, Scarface and Goodfellas. The tone and timbre of the piece evokes the best of gritty 70's crime thrillers but there's a certain restraint about the whole affair  as if taking its cue from its antagonist  and restraint is an arm a mob movie can't afford to chance."

On top of that it was based on a true story. The movie's main time zone is from the very late 1960's to the mid/really late early 1970's. The film's about Frank Lucas a black driver for a crime kingpin in Harlem who rises to the top of the Harlem criminal underground. The movie's incredibly well made and very INTENSE!!!!!! Anybody who gets grossed out or frightened by gun fights,beatings, and drug injection scenes definitely shouldn't see this movie, for I am warning you all of those violent sequences happen in this movie and happen to the most graphic extent. But to anyone who's a fan of gangster movies, thrillers,blackxploitation and action films definitely should see it!!!!!"
"jedwalker","7","0","1","23 February 2008"," A gritty examination of human depravity
","American Gangster is a gritty, unglamorous look at the heroin trade in Harlem in the late 60s and early 70s. The film is based on the true story of Frank Lucas (played by Denzel Washington), an ambitious and visionary African-American crime lord whose power and control grew beyond the historic grasp of the Italian Mafia in New York City. Richie Roberts (played by Russell Crowe) is the detective, turned federal drug agent, who follows the heroin trafficking to its unlikely source before eventually stopping and even befriending Lucas. In the end, Lucas was sentenced to 70 years in prison (he served 15 years after making a deal), $250 million of his assets were seized, 30 of his family members went to prison, and 3/4 of the NYPD's drug enforcement division were arrested for corruption.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott masterfully directs this tale as an expose into a debased world, not a rags-to-riches story of racial triumph and the American Dream. This is not an update of ""The Godfather."" You won't find a romanticized, glamorous view of organized crime here. The film plays like a drug prevention ad, as graphic images of shooting up and the resulting, destructive consequences are shown over and over. The violence is not of the action-film variety, it's grizzly and shocking. The sex and nudity are prominent, but the effect is far more dehumanizing than enticing. Most importantly, there is no hero in this film, not a single character that can be embraced and looked up to. Each character has sacrificed their integrity whether the result is failing to do the right thing or continuing to do the wrong one. Over and over we are reminded that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God; the human condition is clearly depraved. <br/><br/>As much as he thinks of himself as a respectable businessman, devoted family man, and generous community leader, Lucas is a ruthless killer that builds his fortune off of the pain and suffering of the people in his community. Roberts also plays a role that differs from reality, aspiring to a self-righteous integrity that is sporadic at best. One on hand he's an excellent detective and prides himself in failing to take bribes, while at the same time he's a disaster as an absentee father and an unfaithful husband that constantly has sexual encounters with a wide variety of women.<br/><br/>The key scene takes place at the end of the second act. During a custody hearing, Roberts -ex and the mother of his child confronts his hypocrisy. She tells him that he thinks he's going to heaven because he hasn't taken dirty money like the rest of his peers, but she says that he's going to hell like everyone else. She exposes the deception of a theology of works...if we do enough good things, God will have to let us into heaven and right relationship with Him. But by including herself, she affirms the theological truths of Isaiah 64:6, Romans 3, and Ephesians 2:8. Our most righteous acts can't outweigh our inequity; our only hope for redemption is repentance and brokenness.<br/><br/>Roberts gets it, realizes she's right, owns his shortcomings and in that moment gains the clarity that ultimately leads him to take down Lucas. This process of redemption is repeated when Roberts confronts Lucas. This happens as Lucas is leading his mother and wife out of Sunday church with a choir singing Amazing Grace. Roberts confronts Lucas and eventually he acknowledges his sins, owns his inequities and finds redemption in bringing down the crime lords and dirty cops. Through this process Lucas and Roberts form an unusual bond that comes through the shared experience of confrontation and brokenness. And in doing so, they model the only remedy for the depravity of man."

"bartholomewrichards","8","0","1","23 February 2008"," The Business Model of a Gangster
","At one point during Ridley Scott's new film, Denzel as the titular gangster has to inform one of his middle-men of the importance of a brand name. The brand name in question is ""Blue Magic"". Heroin smuggled into New York straight from Thailand in the coffins of dead American soldiers. By cutting out the transporters, Denzel's Frank Lucas can sell this product at half the price of regular street heroin and ensure its purity at the same time. ""Blue Magic, that's a brand name. Like Pepsi."" This scene shows why Lucas is able to become so successful with the drug trade, it's just business.<br/><br/>It's not right to call this film a ""Black Godfather"" as some have, it would be more accurate to call it ""Gangster CEO"". Lucas realizes its better to sell things with a brand name rather than being a celebrity like his competitors. He skips the politics of trying to work with the mafia and goes into business on his own, which suits him. Frank Lucas isn't a politician, he's a business man. If someone owes Lucas money, he's gonna collect, and if they don't pay, they'll face the consequences; it doesn't matter if they're made men.<br/><br/>Lucas does his business and he stays quiet. The cops don't even know who he is or what his connections are until they see him wearing a ridonkulous fur coat to the Ali-Frazier boxing match. When they do notice him, its the beginning of his downfall. Before that, Lucas was the invisible man, he wore suits that were nice, but inconspicuous. Nobody would attack a man they can't see.<br/><br/>On the flip side of the coin, we got Russell Crowe (If your movie's set in the past, you best get Russell's ___). It's not nearly as interesting watching Crowe's Richie Roberts home life as it is watching Denzel's. In fact, the storyline concerning him and his wife is completely extraneous. But the sting operation he sets up with his group of honest cops makes a compelling parallel to the Rise and fall of Denzel. They both stay on the outside of their respective professions. Denzel doesn't deal with the mafia, and Roberts doesn't deal with dirty cops. In fact, Roberts is so clean, he turned in $1 million as evidence, only to become the pariah of the police station.<br/><br/>The film may go over the same rise-and-fall scenario as most gangster flicks, but it does it in a way that is refreshing. Frank Lucas is the ""American Gangster"" because he does things the American way. He takes advantage of the capitalist nature of Americans, even with illegal substances. If he had taken over Wall Street, he would have been just as successful. Plus, Denzel is the man in this film. Now how can you deny the appeal of that?

","It was a well crafted, interesting film, with some fine performances, but almost no one went the extra mile. Almost everything in the film works, but hardly anything is great. I thought Josh Brolin basically stole every scene he was in, and Washington also gave a fine performance. Ruby Dee gave a warm, fine performance. She is good, but nothing better than she had to be. I had real problems with Crowes performance, and particularly with the direction of the film. The first hour was amazing, as was the last fifteen minutes of so. The rest was just mediocre. The editing was probably the saving grace is much of the movie. It pieced together the many parts that didn't work, and made them better. Because of the editing, it worked. Because of the editing it was entertaining. It, and Brolins performance were the only great things about the movie. The rest of it is an oddly flawed epic, that works more than it should."
"Philby-3","8","0","1","19 February 2008"," Familiar but well told story
","Gangster movies usually bore me witless (""The Godfather"" and ""The Sopranos"" apart), but Ridley Scott is an interesting director and the story here is derived from real events. The style of the film is busy  there is often far more going on the tightly edited scenes than the viewer can take in at once - but as it progresses things fall into place and the two parallel stories of Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas and incorruptible New Jersey detective Richie Roberts eventually merge. As Lucas, Denzil Washington puts in his usual solid performance, and Russell Crowe, with a rather less interesting character- the only thing unusual about him is that he is an honest copper- fits the role perfectly. What is more, he speaks every line audibly, an object lesson to some of today's fashionable actors who all seem to think they are Brando. The gang members here, though, just about need sub-titles, and there are so many it is difficult to keep track of who's who.<br/><br/>Much of the story  set in the period 1968 to 1974  is familiar to those of us around at the time  US army personnel smuggling pure heroin from SE Asia back to the US of A in coffins, police corrupted by the vast amounts of money involved, the rise of black crime bosses. The movie doesn't dig too far into motivation  greed is accepted as sufficient. Frank Lucas's gang operates as a family business, with five brothers and numerous cousins in the organization but he keeps almost all the money for himself, resenting paying even $10,000 a month to bent coppers while amassing $250 million in offshore bank accounts. His boldest ploy was to cut out the middleman and buy pure heroin direct from a surprisingly urbane ex-Kuomintang general hiding in a remote South-East Asian jungle (probably Burma). His customers got Frank's ""Double Blue"" heroin at twice the strength for half the price. This of course killed more people, but Frank never seems to be short of customers.<br/><br/>Without giving the game away it can be said that Richie is fairly successful in his efforts against the heroin trade, but others, some selling other drugs, sprang up to take Frank's place. Ridley Scott doesn't go into the issue, but this story clearly shows the futility of treating drug abuse as a criminal law rather than a public health problem. Unfortunately the puritanical origins of the United States are still reflected in public attitudes towards addiction. The addict is a sinner and must suffer to be redeemed. Punishment is more important than rehabilitation, and drug dealers are beyond the pale altogether (actually I would go along with the last bit as long as it included tobacco company executives). Anyway, as I said, Ridley Scott stays clear of the issue. He gives us a familiar story, cleverly framed and well presented."
"gradyharp","10","0","1","18 February 2008"," A Superb Film That Exceeds Expectations
","This viewer rented the DVD form of American GANGSTER, having passed it by in the theatrical run, thinking that it was yet another 'crime and corruption in New York' genre film. It was surprising to discover that this very long film (just under three hours in the Unrated version) is completely riveting and in a way far different than the usual gangster film: this story, based on real people as outlined in an article by Mark Jacobson (transformed for the screen by Steven Zaillian), and while it has its share of grisly killings, it seems more concerned with the issues of integrity in the face of police corruption as embodied in the character of Richie Roberts, the etiology of the heroin use escalation following the Vietnam War, and the presence of a 'Black Mafia' lead by one Frank Lucas. It is delivered with compelling gusto and intelligence by director Ridley Scott and has some of the best acting of the year. In other words, this is not a film to be lightly dismissed as a Hollywood retread, but instead it is a tense drama with many very fine points.<br/><br/>Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) follows the footsteps of his idol Bumpy (Clarence Williams III) who 'ran' the Harlem streets, and when Bumpy dies, Lucas inherits his mantle. Lucas is wise, cunning, a gentleman, a powerhouse of ideas, and quickly finds a way to bring the best uncut heroin from the Far East to the streets of New York at a price that undercuts the other mobsters' product. To establish his control he enlists his family, including his brother Huey (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and rapidly becomes the kingpin of the streets.<br/><br/>Simultaneously within the NYPD we meet Detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) whose personal life is a mess but who, with his partner Lou (Ted Levine) discovers corruption in the NYPD and more particularly the Drug Enforcement sector of the police: Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin) works with the existing drug lords, grabs their drugs and money and then recycles both to his benefit. During a particular drug bust, Richie and Lou discover a stash of nearly a million dollars and turn the money into the police - a deed that makes the duo seem foolish and lose the respect of their fellow cops but establishes Roberts as a man who is committed to being a good detective.<br/><br/>From these two separate studies the film weaves the development of each character and the interaction between Roberts and Lucas we know will take place. The end result may be known to those who followed the story as it developed in the 1970s, but for those for whom this true story is new information, the resolution of the film is fast-paced, thrilling, illuminating, and just plain fine cinema. Both Washington and Crowe are in peak form, as are those in the many small roles (Ruby Dee, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Josh Brolin, Lymari Nadal, Carla Gugino, Cuba Gooding etc). This is more of a drama than an action film and while many may feel the final moments of the movie are weak, they do reveal the true ending of the story and say a lot about the narrow line between crime and criminal investigation. This is one of Ridley Scott's most successful films and one that will be around for many years as a model for the medium.<br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","American Gangster is an enormous entertainment, one of the contemporary gangster epics, and a terrific one-year-later follow-up to the 2006 mob opus The Departed. However, it's tough to give this movie the ceiling rating I badly want to give it, the 10 I tend to give the American gangster film, which generally gives me some of the most thrilling satisfaction I ever get from film, because Ridley Scott's adaptation of Frank Lucas's life is softened around the edges by purely Hollywood production values. The film is not shot with a particularly expansive creative eye but rather with the coverage-themed American studio approach and an intermittent amount of very standard character looks. Nevertheless, American Gangster is still cracklingly pleasurable.<br/><br/>It is blessed with a wonderful soundtrack, as has come to be a compulsion in the gangster genre. The film is rich with that heaving funk energy of its late '60s, '70s era. Sam & Dave, The Staple Singers, and Bobby Womack blare exciting classics that pump the movie's spirit, and Anthony Hamilton, in a lusciously visceral nightclub scene, sings a wonderful song masterfully fashioned to adapt to the film's period.<br/><br/>Also, Denzel Washington, whose presence drives nearly the entire movie, finds an infinite amount of comfort in a role that just may be a niche for him. Firstly, he's very becoming. It's not long before we're lost in the world of cold, ingeniously pragmatic, Frank Lucas, a multi- faceted man beyond the limitations of such an impersonal demeanor. Secondly, Washington is pleasing to watch. It's just a joy, as it tends to be with villains, to be in his subjectively honorable and increasingly unaligned company.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe, in more of a supporting role than opposite, does not stand out as he did, again so pleasingly, as the villain in 3:10 To Yuma, however beyond the standardization of his hero character, a disheveled, unorthodox, womanizing cop, there is a very amiable person that he fleshes out. There is one particular scene that I love for its implicit theme: While the rest of Detective Richie Roberts's (Crowe) clan of undercover street cops are watching a boxing match, Roberts, despite sitting amongst them, has his mind somewhere else and to me somehow seems more refreshingly individual than the rest of them. What makes Roberts the irregular hero that at least nearly matches the presence of the villain is his offbeat style of everything. No matter how many corny Hollywood good guy scenes he's given early in the film, the character shines through.<br/><br/>Really, most of American Gangster's minor faults, such as Carla Gugino's character, the wife of Crowe who criticizes him passionately for being too wrapped up in his work, are protected by the fact that it's a true story.<br/><br/>The movie may ride roughshod over many spots Ridley would've benefited from more carefully constructing, but inscrutable are its starpower, gritty twilight scenes of New York and New Jersey, vast scope, and tremendous climax, a razor-sharp heartpounder of violence, quick cuts, and drama which makes you feel like leaping out of your seat to applaud. Predominantly, there is an undeniably savory taste left in one's mouth, especially after the powerful final shot."

Throw in a small matter of that product the man in question sold was Heroin and that his competitors were often snuffed out,that he was basically using the Vietnam war as his own sort of ""in-and-out"" route of business and that he was actually one of the most feared and sought-after mobsters in America over the last thirty or so years,and that,to put it mildly,changes things.<br/><br/>And that's how you would classify one Frank Lucas(Denzel Washington,effectively combining his amoral bad-ass from ""Training Day"" with his more charismatic character studies as a hero from films like ""Crimson Tide"" or ""Remember the Titans""),a one-time gopher and right-hand man of legendary Harlem gang-lord Bumpy Johnson. When Bumpy passes in the late 1960s,Lucas moves quickly to consolidate power and uses his own sales methods to make the drug trade more direct,more economical and far more lucrative. IN short order,he's practically out-selling(and dominating)the established crime bosses(read:mostly the MAfia) in NYC,circa 1970 thru 1975.<br/><br/>His chief nemesis is one Richie Roberts(Russell Crowe,kinda over-doing the ""New Yawk"" accent here,but still genuinely real),an honest cop of near legendary status.

It doesn't hurt that Steven Zaillian(spelling?)'s script is cribbed from real-life events and is given such a plain,unpretentious presentation that it could pass for(At least in some parts)documentary. Not too many parts here shine out besides Washington and Crowe,but Ruby Dee(as Lucas' trusting mama),Idris Elba(as a less-than-subtle underling of Lucas')and Cuba Gooding Jr.(as one of Lucas' prime business associates and grudging rivals;arguably one of the rare good parts he seems to get these days)do stand out.

The movie's multiple layers rely heavily on the visual differences of each characters' environment. For Frank Lucas, the shots are steady and make him look decent. While for Crowe the shots are always walking and moving. Even in the final confrontation, it just kept Lucas on the stairs of the church but Crowe looking upwardly to him. Despite the many critics about the movie being too far from the reality, it deserves an Oscar nomination just for the visual style.<br/><br/>Well, many people are talking about Washintion's Lucas is too decent-looking and better educated than he really is in reality. However in my perception, Washintion just deserve another Oscar nomination for this role because of following reasons. 1, Yes, he looks decent in the movie, but remember he just looks so in most times. The movie is so brilliant that Lucas alter between a decent gentleman and a street-gangster time to time, indicating the truth that he was mentored by another gangster on the street. And all his gentle movements and vanilla scent are just sugar and cream on a gun. 2, his interactions with his siblings and relatives are just realistic that, after all, Frank Lucas and his family came from street, not a university. Washinton's performance honestly expressed the confusion of Lucas as he would never realize the reason his business failed, until he was morally blamed by the good cop.<br/><br/>And, I'd like to mention the ending. It totally went out of my expectation. I was expecting Lucas to shoot himself just like other tragic drug-dealers. But I was wrong. The conclusion of the movie is very very socially responsible. The decision Crowe's role made as indicated by the subtitles is inspiring.<br/><br/>Excellent."

","This is a very long movie. I must admit that I felt every minute of it. It is not that it is a bad movie. The story of Frank Lucas (played very well by Denzel Washington) and his rise from aide to top drug honcho during the turbulent and decadent late 60s to early 70s is very interesting. I thought this story alone would have made a pretty good movie in itself. His devotion to his boss, his commitment to his mother (Ruby Dee), his relationship with his wife, his violent streak, his business acumen, all make excellent However, this interesting storyline is interrupted by so many seemingly interfering events that were given too much time. The entire story involving the life of Russell Crowe felt like an entirely different movie altogether. But since he is Russell Crowe, the story of this policeman-lawyer, needed to be extended more than it really should. The character of Josh Brolin of the corrupt cop Trupo is also given too much time. That one episode involving Cuba Gooding Jr. was also quite incidental, not really material to the flow of the story.<br/><br/>So overall, this is not a bad movie. I feel it needed streamlining. It felt like it was trying to tackle too much, thus diluting the total effect."

While nothing extra-ordinary stood out, this was actually why I was impressed. The storyline of American Gangster does not need anything special, or overdone - and this was achieved. Being such a large film, I'm sure the temptation would have been there to experiment, but Savides didn't - resulting in a fantastic cinematic result.<br/><br/>Co-Written by Steve Zaillian, he was the perfect writer for the job, having had already been proved with realistic, historical and 'intense' films such as Clear and Present Danger and Schindler's List, the dialogue, characters and historical scene settings are fantastic.<br/><br/>If detailed story lines and long, sometimes a little slow, films are not your thing, then you probably won't be a big fan of American Gangster.

Ridley Scott gives an effective picture of the New York that was, the one that threatened to implode in the 1970's, and of the rise and fall of the gangster Frank Lucas. Lucas took the lessons of American capitalist entrepreneurship to the heroin trade, offering a better product at a better price than his competition, and was rewarded with wealth and a certain sort of fame.<br/><br/>Washington and Crowe are excellent throughout, especially in their long scene in the prison interview room near the end of the film. The other actors are fine, especially Josh Brolin, who should pick up a supporting actor Oscar nomination for his work in this film--he was utterly convincing as a corrupt cop. And Ruby Dee was a pleasure to watch in her few scenes as Lucas's mother.<br/><br/>Though long, the film kept the viewer interested through effective pacing of events. The Vietnam War is the background of this story, as it allowed Lucas to develop his drug distribution network, and events of the war are always peeking through on televisions throughout the movie.

"gina1177","8","0","3","12 January 2008"," French Connection
","American Gangster immediately reminded me of French Connection - which I coincidentally had watched only a few days before I saw American Gangster. The main theme of both movies is a cat-and-mouse game between the gentleman head of a criminal organization and a rather gruff cop, based on a true story. In either case the Manhattan atmosphere is caught brilliantly, as is the era of the late 60s/early 70s. Thus I would conclude that if you liked the one, you will also enjoy the other.<br/><br/>However, American Gangster is less dark and more glamorous, as it emphasizes on Frank Lucas' rise to wealth (and stylish lodgings) and is accompanied with an entertaining soundtrack.<br/><br/>The main cast is great - especially Russel Crowe acts brilliantly again.<br/><br/>Yet I have something to criticize. In my opinion, the character of Frank Lucas is too plain. He is described as a (only) two-dimensional person - the loving son and generous family guy on the one side and the hard criminal business man an the other side. Sadly, you hardly get to see any facets in-between, so that Lucas is bit of a cliché, q.v. any mafia movie. Plus, in the sake of putting across the nostalgic atmosphere, the setting and outfits are a bit too glamorous, idealizing the circumstances."
"jpschapira","8","0","3","12 January 2008"," And he's done it again!
","When someone knows how to do something, they can do no wrong, and Ridley Scott knows his drill very well, by heart actually. He could do the same thing and fail, but he has the miraculous gift of making really good movies like ""American Gangster"", which make you pay attention, think and even provide entertainment. <br/><br/>The film shows the rise of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) in the drug-dealing market during the early 70's. He was black and of low profile and making more money than anyone; imagine how the Italian families and the rest of the mob felt. Denzel plays Lucas as a patient listener who listens every advice carefully and always worries about protecting his back, but also is fearless when it comes to take responsibility. <br/><br/>It's a beautiful contrast to watch him giving wise advices one minute and killing someone in the middle of the street the other, and it's even greater to see how his work rises to another level when he works with true authors like Ridley Scott, not his brother Tony. He had fun in Tony's ""Man on Fire"" but he had a blast and delivered better in Spike Lee's ""Inside Man"". <br/><br/>Going back to Ridley. It takes a mastermind to do all the tricks in almost three hours. He gives the camera no specific role: Harris Savices' camera sometimes stands watching from a hiding place, other times it's a permanent part of the action; the rest of the time it dedicates to create compositions like a plane passing through the middle of two street signsThat's as close as I come to explaining something that is only wonderful when you see it.<br/><br/>Like seeing Russel Crowe perform; knowing he's played a role so similar in ""L.A. Confidential"" and that he's the only one able to compose something so different. Knowing that whether with Ron Howard in ""A beautiful mind"" or with Ridley here, Brian Grazer can always get something spectacular out of the Australian.<br/><br/>And together with Scott he also gets a lot out of the entire ensemble (without counting a truly underused Cuba Gooding Jr): Carla Gugino in a formidably unexpected role, a scary portrayal by Josh Brolin, a joyful turn by Armand Assante, a living proof that if you forget about Chiwetel Ejiofor's performances is because he always seems one more human being, and a scene of incomparable emotion in the hands of a flawless Ruby DeeFeel that one. <br/><br/>High point? Steven Zaillian's script. Low point? Marc Streitenfeld's score, not the soundtrack. The secret of risk? Having Denzel and Crowe in the same movie not putting them on screen together until the very end and not delivering something breathtaking in that moment. That's a great director. The secret of excellent film-making? I'll tell you in some kind of comparison but I won't give names because it's pointless.<br/><br/>In an everyday picture of this type, the bad guy would be a monster and the good guy a heroic martyr. You would only remember their names and know nothing or not care about their families and friend; if the movie provides the characters. There would be a small valid reason for the good guy to start killing; you wouldn't question it and there would be a shooting scene every five minutes, with cars flying through the air and all that. <br/><br/>In ""American Gangster"", besides the three dimensions of the characters' family and friends, there's only one shooting scene; and when it comes not only a character wants it but we do also. Because we know the character and we know how important it is for him. Read carefully: we weren't asking for a shooting scene; we would have been fine without it but we accept it because a character needs it. Oh, and we enjoy it of course. That's Ridley Scott."

","Finally got round to seeing this. While it's not Goodfellas (what is after all!) and it's not Scarface, 'American Gangster' is never anything less than thoroughly involving. Denzel chews up the scenery like you haven't seen since 'Training Day' and I would not be at all surprised if he walks off with the Oscar again next year. He conveys the ambition and ruthlessness of Frank Lucas effortlessly but we are never truly repulsed by him since many of those around him are worse (stand up Cuba Gooding Junior and a very scary Josh Brolin). <br/><br/>On the one hand he provides his extended family with a way out of extreme poverty, on the other he draws them (Mafia style) into his burgeoning organised crime network. But success does not always bring happiness and Frank is soon racked by self-doubt. Russell Crowe is close to his best (and maybe biggest) as the one good cop in pursuit of Denzel - the final showdown between the two is a highlight. Also look out for Brits Idris Elba and Chiwetel Ejiofor offering solid support. <br/><br/>Production design is top notch creating a vivid sense of place and period as you'd expect from the director who gave us the genius of 'Blade Runner' and 'Alien'. Ridley Scott juggles the various story strands with aplomb so that the film has a truly epic feel - while the Frank Lucas stuff is drawn from real events I heard they beefed up the Russell Crowe part. Plus you are left wanting more in that a lot of interesting stuff seems to have happened outside of the story told in the film.<br/><br/>An intelligent, adult but nevertheless entertaining mainstream Hollywood film (yes all those words can sometimes fit into the same sentence!) - highly recommended."

"dunmore_ego","7","0","3","6 January 2008"," Smooth Criminal
","Whadaya know - Crime DOES pay! Or so it seems at the conclusion of *American Gangster*, when a career gangster and a struggling cop are laffing it up in a montage, collaborating to bring down the gangster's empire. I'll get to that subtle mismanaged message in a moment.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington plies his smoothie-smooth smoothness as Original Gangster, Frank Lucas, simultaneously elevating the movie and ruining it. You see, the real Frank Lucas in 1968 Harlem was a devil of the streets, an iron-balled, malevolent drug boss, who ran the ghettos and 'burbs like a chinchilla-coated, pimp-fisted Hitler. Casting Denzel was less about conveying the horrifying aspect of a sociopath crime lord than it was about presenting a man-toy whom women wanted to DO as much as men wanted to BE; his velvety charm, less about repulsing people than coercing them through box office turnstiles.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is Lucas' nemesis, the dogged, disheveled detective, Richie Roberts, as unsophisticated and unorganized as Lucas is classy and controlled. Roberts alienated his police pals by turning in a million dollars drug cash he found on the streets, instead of swanking it amongst himself and friends. Everyone is painted as morally swingshift, only looking out for themselves; even Roberts, though he is determined to smoke out Lucas, cannot get his own house in order, as he studies for bar exams while his Movie-Convention Nagging Ex-Wife (Carla Gugino) never has a decent thing to say about his child visitations or his three-day-growth existence.<br/><br/>Then there's Josh Brolin, struttin' leather-coated and coolly cruel through Harlem's underbelly like a kingpin himself, until it is revealed he is a dirty cop playing both sides of the street.<br/><br/>Lucas inherits legendary Bumpy Johnson's street empire when Bumpy dies in his arms. Rather than allow the neighborhood smack to wind its way through innumerable middle men, Lucas goes straight to their Bangkok source and sets up a direct line of purchase, smuggling the heroin into the U.S. in the caskets of dead G.I.'s returning from Viet Nam. They called it the ""Cadaver Connection."" His sizzling-pure product (called Blue Magic) becomes renowned for being twice as good for half the price. Even Richie Roberts' partner succumbs to the taste. While Roberts and his ragtag team of do-gooders try to sniff out who is flooding the streets with H so good that veteran junkies are dying from its potency, Lucas is busy buying a mansion for his mama and setting up his many brothers in positions of power on the streets, a familial tactic employed by old school Italians.<br/><br/>This movie lacks for iconic moments: *American Gangster* might be taking its cues from *The Godfather*, and may be aiming for characterization rather than shoot-em-up, but there are few magic moments that burn themselves into your brain.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott directs excellently, but his writer (Steven Zaillian, from an article by Mark Jacobson) gives him no moments like Brando's opening monologue, or Michael proclaiming, ""It's just business, Sonny""; or Luca Brasi's tongue-tied meeting with the Godfather et al. When Lucas ironically proclaims ""This is America!"" it is as far removed from Amerigo Bonasera's sincere proclamation of ""I love America"" as Denzel is from Brando.<br/><br/>Even when Denzel is quoting some of Lucas' own priceless thuggery, he is just Too Sexy-Smooth to pull off a chilling take. We are never ""horrified"" by this monster of a man  the first scene features him expressionlessly shooting a man dead who is already on fire. But it's Denzel. Lucas set up one of his initiation moments himself and the reality is disturbing: giving one of the baddest neighborhood thugs $5000 in dope and then harassing him for payment publicly, with the unswerving intent to shoot the guy as a lesson for the neighborhood The paradoxical message in *American Gangster*: obviously, the MPAA forces scriptwriters to bring gangsters to justice  and ultimately, Lucas is caught - but the overarching message this movie sends is that life's gonna suck anyway at some point (just look at Roberts' sorry life, even being on the ""right"" side of the law), so while you've got a grip on Life  squeeze! For all it's worth. You may stay on top, but if it all falls through, you would have still lived a better life than the average bear. For didn't Lucas live miles above Roberts throughout his life? Money and cars and mansions and a Puerto Rican model for a wife. At the end, the Robin Hood of Harlem was reportedly worth more than $150 million. And then when he *did* get caught, he sang like a canary, gave up his backstreet boys and was sentenced to 70 years, out in five. I think that five years of confinement is worth 20 years of mansion living. How 'bout you? Denzel and Crowe play the final laughing scenes like a coupla buddies over beer and pizza. Why not? Lucas cut a deal finer than his Blue Magic. In real life, Roberts even became Lucas' defense attorney in the 1990s.<br/><br/>Crime = glamour. Crime = hotness. Crime = smoothness.<br/><br/>Now where'd I put my chinchilla fur coat?"
"asphixia_drop","7","0","3","6 January 2008"," Drugs and the law, such a love story, a never-ending corrupted love story
","Here's another movie about drugs. This time it's about heroin, which is certainly worse than cocaine (I'm thinking of We own the night). It's a true story and that's what makes the movie exciting, to think that the whole thing took place not even 40 years ago, that Frank Lucas (and Nicky Barnes) gave an interview to the NY Times in 2000 and is still alive. Richie Roberts, the cop, is also alive. Both of them helped the actors, Crowe and Washington, in building up their roles for the movie.<br/><br/>It's always weird to think that a guy who, directly or not, caused the death of so many people is still alive and still making money indirectly from his old drug business. The movie doesn't depict him as a hero, for some reason you never find yourself hating the man at any moment. Maybe it's the suit or maybe it's because Denzel Washington doesn't look like a dealer. I don't know. But you can ask yourself a question: what's responsible for all the bad things, is it the drug dealing or is it corruption? OK, the drug business is an open door to corruption. But what really makes you angry in the movie is not so much the junkies dying like rats, no, it's all the corruption the drug business brings about. Money is money, no matter where it comes from. You want it, you take it and you'd better not turn your conscience on. But Crowe does and that's what leads him and his boys to arrest Frank Lucas. Crowe is this very upright, honest cop who resists to keep for himself thousands of dollars he randomly finds in a car at the beginning of the movie; he accepts no bribes; he believes in the law and becomes an attorney.<br/><br/>But at the end, he paradoxically finds himself in a position that requires him to ask for Lucas' help to get the NY corrupted cops arrested. That's the best part of the movie. The most amusing is to read that the two men became friends in their real lives. It's also crazy to learn that 3/4 of the NY police cops where corrupted by the drug business...and that the heroin came into the US thanks to the US Army planes, hidden in the dead veterans' coffins! Then who's to blame really? I'm not saying drug is not a bad thing. I just think it's a fake problem. You don't feel bad for the junkies because you know they would be junkies anyway. You feel bad for the cops, for the army, for any officials who make their living on bribes, leaving the dealers alone. You feel that you live in a corrupted world all wrapped in hypocrisy. Arrest as many dealers as you want, it won't solve the drug problem. Why? Because the states somehow take part in the drug business while they claim drugs are evil. It's never-ending.<br/><br/>OK I didn't really talk about the movie itself but more of what it inspired me. So yes, it's a great movie, the actors are good, it's well-written and flawless. I would just say that the story is quite long to begin and not all the first scenes are relevant for the rest of the story. It's also very violent but I don't pay attention to that since everything is so violent now. I liked it because it makes you think, it's not a basic action-movie, it's far more than that."

","One of the good gangster/mob epics, this movie is long and needs to be that way since it attempts to tackle two stories and two protagonists. However, despite the length the intensity and story will keep you engrossed throughout. <br/><br/>It is the true life story of a crime boss in Harlem and an honest NYC detective fighting the drug war. One is a mob boss portrayed more as a businessman than a crook and has a very professional approach. The way he figures how to get, import and sell cheaper higher quality drugs than his competition is an interesting story. The other main character is an extremely honest detective whom is embedded in a profession filled with corruption. He is honest in his profession perhaps to compensate for the moral dilemma he faces from being dishonest in his personal life. A major theme of the movie was the corrupt policemen at the time in NYC who were taking bribes from drug dealers and taking advantage of the situation for their own personal benefit. This may remind you of a movie.<br/><br/>The fact that it reminded me of another movie and many movies was a weakness of this particular film. It took ideas and themes from Serpico  the corrupt policeman, Scarface the rise and fall of power of an intense personality, Goodfellas the rise and fall of a gangster and the ratting out, and Heat with the oscillating story of the cop and gangster. I literally saw scenes being repeated. This movie wasn't as good as those older movies because it combined what all those movies did and therefore forfeited depth in any one particular theme. It was also not innovative by any means. <br/><br/>However a very fun entertaining movie experience is created when all these elements of those great movies are put together and as a delightful relish the acting was good."

","My expectations were high for this movie, not only as it related to a favourite genre, the modern gangster film, but also of course the heavyweight talent bringing it to the screen, Scott, Crowe, Washington et.al. For me it didn't quite exceed the sum of its parts but that said there's much to commend it. The story gets back to front with pace and the scene setting is fine, evoking the required mix of ""French Connection"" (namechecked en route), ""Shaft"", ""The Godfather"" and even more recent films like ""Casino"", ""LA Confidential"" and ""The Untouchables"". The film however brings little that is new to the party in terms of plotting which is perhaps the main drawback here, we have sort of seen it all before, from the fable of the underdog protégé gangster rising spectacularly through the ranks, to the Mafia-style placement of family at the centre of Mr Big's (Washington's Frank Lucas) universe, to the taking of a trophy wife, to the ritual violence meted out to rivals and subordinates, plus of course the good versus bad cops and robbers routine as unsullied by vice, Crowe plays off against Washington's sinister well oiled criminal machine. The evocation of late 60's New Jersey and New York is well achieved, with language and fashions to match (a negative mark tho' for the too-obvious musical soundtrack motifs, great as they are, slightly more obscure selections from Bobby Womack, Staple Singers and Sam and Dave would have better grounded the movie in its chosen era), but I found the acting just shy of top-notch, certainly not Oscar-worthy. The twin leads, Crowe and Washington aren't stretched and to me, don't stretch themselves enough in their parts, plus it's fair to say they're given few memorable lines to deliver too. I would also have preferred the Crowe character to be more blemish-free to point up the contrast with Washington's don, (why does every divorce defendant in a Hollywood flick end up in a gratuitous sex-scene with their glamorous female attorney?). The Crowe and Washington characters are held back until the conclusion when they actually share a scene, but again fireworks fail to fly and one almost wishes the actors could have turned back the clocks to when they were less knowing about their craft (c.f. Crowe in ""LA Confidential"", Washington in ""Philadelphia"") and brought more attack to their parts. I'm not sure ""American Gangster"" adds much more than a semi-colon, never mind a postscript to the genre and the film does drag on about 20 minutes too long but there's enough grits and style to get by on here."

Say what?! That to even entertain the idea that the greatest criminals of all times employ simple strategies to succeed is absurd? I don't think so. I think that's what really successful people do, from businessmen to politicians, from manufacturers to scientists, excellency is found among those who are able to notice deficiencies in a particular process and to establish the means to compensate or eliminate those deficiencies. And the more elementary those means are, the greater the level of success attained. And by the way, just because one thing is simple, it doesn't mean that finding that thing is also simple: money is simple, love is simple, happiness is simple... but how many of us have them all?<br/><br/>And those who dare to compare Denzel Washington's acting skills with the ones of Leonardo DiCaprio!? Give me a break, Mr. Denzel Washington's performance in ""American Gangster"" shames the vast majority of American and European actors of all time. And no, I am not black, sorry! That's just the way it is. Same goes to Mr. Russel Crowe, I found his performance in ""American Gangster"" better than the one he had in ""Gladiator"".<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is that it dares to be intelligent in a genre that has become too much of a laughing stock. People associate gangster to intense shootings, violent extortions, executions, blood baths... and without all those lovely things (that ""American Gangster"" also has, but not exclusively) it just isn't the same thing for all the old gangster's lovers out there.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, I'm looking forward to the day when all movies about gangsters are a little bit more like this one, and a little bit less like almost every other gangster movie I've watched before."

","If This Film Doesn't Get Any Oscar Nominations, I Will Be Surprised. This Year was really generous in terms of REALLY GOOD movies and this is one of them.<br/><br/>It has an unbelievable subtext, which is a rarity in latest Hollywood films. It talks about heroin not as a drug, but as a nice metaphor of modern culture. And the fact that the main characters are real life persons doesn't change anything. This to me is a movie more about America as a country, than just another gangster film. I still can't understand why people compare this movie with Scarface, for example.<br/><br/>I don't think that Denzel Washington will win something (my personal favorite is Viggo Mortensen for Eastern Promises), but I really hope that Ridley Scott will get an Oscar for this film, because he deserved it. He deserved it before, but this film shows who he really is.<br/><br/>Harris Savides - the DP of the film - is mind-blowing. What this guy does with colors and natural lighting is fantastic.<br/><br/>So this movie might actually win some golden guys for Ridley Scott & Harris Savides."

","The movie was entertaining, but not riveting. Having read other reviews and accounts of the movie, I went in expecting more than I got. Nevertheless, it was a solid movie and Denzel was, as usual, terrific. Watching him go from an ordinary ""businessman"" to a criminal within a scene, as appropriate to the circumstances, was one of the highlights for me. Had I gone to see the film without the lofty expectations that I had, I would likely have given it at least one more star... I realize that that is unfair to the movie, but hype is part of the game and if a movie fails to meet the hype it has generated, then it is likely to find its rating lower than what you might otherwise have expected for it."
"teh_mode","7","0","2","23 December 2007"," Excellent crime saga
","Ridley Scott's best film since Gladiator tells the true-life tale of Frank Lucas, a delegate of the Harlem crime scene who rises to become the biggest importer of the heroine drug in American history. Played brilliantly by Denzel Washington, Lucas is an ambiguous character, one who justifies his heinous business through everlasting love and devotion to his huge family, notably his mother. The film also explores the story of the cop who rigorously fought to bring him down - Ritchie Roberts, an equally impressive performance from Rusell Crowe. Eschewing his typical manly marauding screen presence, Crowe's Roberts is shlubby, awkward and difficult with his corrupt co-workers. The film is both reminiscent and directly referential of the great 70s cop thrillers that inspired it, such as The French Connection and Serpico. Although it never aspires to be on the same level as those films, it does make for a ripping and insightful crime saga."

","What a flick. This is what you get when the big boys come out to play, and it all comes together in the end.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington's performance was superb, one of his finest. The sheer ability to mold and commit to his character shows that he has a firm hold at the upper echelons of the craft. Crowe, on the other hand, chose to be quite understated within his performance, (and it worked for this character!), definitely not the 'Gladiator-type' effort most have come to expect from him. Some might say that Washington's performance somewhat overshadowed that of Crowes, but I'm thinking that was intentional. Ridley Scott's direction was top notch as usual, as he flawlessly portrayed Harlem during the time period. His crews attention to detail speaks for itself.<br/><br/>Very cool movie. I'll watch it again when it hits DVD."

","***Warning!-This summary contains movie information and spoilers. *** I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in Drama, Action, Crime movies. American Gangster in a modern day classic that has an appropriately mixed ensemble cast of well known veteran actors and relatively known supporting cast members.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe do a superb job in their American Gangster lead roles. This time out, the positions they play are reversed from their previous film together titled Virtuosity. In Amercian Gangster, Frank Lucas (Denzel's character) is on the wrong side of the law while Det. Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) does everything in his power to bring Lucas to justice. Whereas, in their first film together Virtuosity, Crowe was the absconder of justice while Washington assisted the police to bring order to society while pursuing Crowe.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline, pace, and subject matter of the movie. Veterans Josh Brolin, Ruby Dee, and newcomer Lymari Nadal, all added exceptional performances in their supporting roles to fulfill director Ridley Scott's vision for the storyline. <br/><br/>I also noticed the fact that Denzel Washington had worked with the late Ossie Davis in Malcolm X and completed the cycle in American Gangster by starring with Davis's widow Ruby Dee.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I also noticed that their seem to be many Denzel Washington detractors who cannot accept the fact that he won the Oscar for Training Day and therefore they are unable to let the past go. As a result, they infiltrate legitimate movie cites like IMDb and pose as fans in order to post negative comments that are far from the reality of the brilliance of director Ridley Scott and his talented actors in the American Gangster movie cast."
"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","9","0","3","17 December 2007"," Greater things
","If Denzel Washington did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him. I guess while we're add it we just might as well throw Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe onto the ""necessary inventions"" list. Reason being is that we need people like them. We need people who can embody and portray things greater than the average man. Now on a personal level Denzel Washington (and others like him) is just a person like you and me. He gets up, eats breakfast, goes to work and occasionally thinks of a crude joke. Nevermind the fact that he gets $20 million per assignment, that's just his good fortune. Fact is, that when he is on screen, often times, he isn't just Denzel anymore. He's an encapsulating presence that you're fascinated by. Or in this case of portraying Frank Lucas, intimidated by. He portrays a ruthless, calculating and clever business man (aka a gangster), but Frank Lucas also embodies a certain sense of virtue. He may be greedy and treacherous in his methods, but he has a strong sense of diligence and honor. In one scene Lucas says, ""The most important thing in business is honesty, integrity, hard work... family... never forgetting where we came from."" That's something every working man should adhere to.<br/><br/>Yet why are so many tales of honor and virtue about criminals? People who by definition have too little or none? In this case I think the definition is wrong, they don't too little, they have a lot in fact. But they get things done their way. Honor among thieves. They may rob and corrupt (Frank Lucas was far from being an angel) but the fact remains they know how to get things done and get it done real good. That is the primary fascination we have with people who venture beyond our established laws and say ""I'm gunna do it my way."" The leap from the rules allows them to create their own laws, their own crimes, and as they form they are seen at the essence for what they are, which is the same old virtue and vice most of us deal with.<br/><br/>The other side of the spectrum is Ritchie Roberts, the man trying to bring Frank Lucas down and he is in a way similar. He is given charge of a special police unit for the job. Ritchie is fascinating just like Frank Lucas, he gets things done his way despite being on the right side of the law. The fascinating climax of the film has these two powerful opposing forces meeting for the first time. However, that's where my only complaint with the film is. The scene is, well, brief. They meet, make eye contact and then boom, next scene. Naturally the scene would be brief, especially in a movie, since from watching the movie we all know what is going to happen as the film has only been building up to this for two hours. However to better capture the intensity of that scene something more could have been done.<br/><br/>Though, by the time the film is over, a very brisk two and half hours I might add, you'll be ready to put this on the shelf next to Scorsese's best crime film's. --- 9/10<br/><br/>Rated R for violence, profanity, and drug use.

","If you are looking for a movie that is fast paced, this is not it. This movie was really show but don't worry, it was a good slow. Denzel Washington keeps making great movies. This time he was a rich man who sold heroin on the streets of New Jersey and Harlem. I loved Russell Crowe's amazing ability to move out of his Aussie accent and into a Jersey accent. Then there was the corrupt cop played by Josh Brolin. Geeze, he sure was mean wasn't he? And he was just in that movie called No Country for Old Men which was also excellent. I sure hope that the commentary is interesting on this movie when the DVD release comes out.

","Once again, Denzel plays a suave, sophisticated, cool-under-pressure hero, who only does bad to those deserving of it and is heroic. With the exception of Training Day that is what Denzel always plays.<br/><br/>Funny thing is that Frank Lucas (the real person) was none of those things. I've seen interviews with the now-paralyzed Lucas. He's laughs a lot, his speaking is far from smooth, he brags, he's 100% opposite to how Denzel portrayed him. The only thing done correct in this movie is that the guy was a ""business man"" in his drug-dealing. But hey, why change Denzel's acting to fit the character. Just change the ""real life"" character to fit Denzel! Also, Billy Martin was not yet managing the Yankees in 1973 as Denzel's character indicated in the movie. And I though Denzel was such a Yankee's fan. Maybe he should have notified the producers of this error instead of just reading the erroneous line."
"Monotreme02","8","0","2","7 December 2007"," A morality tale epic battle of wits between two titans
","One of the oldest film genres, the gangster film used to be populated with small, minute-scaled personal stories of redemption or personal achievement. But in the 1970's this genre quickly evolved, in particular with the help of directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese and Brian De Palma, into a genre identified with broad, sprawling epic depictions of loyalty, family, and rise-and-fall tales: the gangster epic. Directly continuing this grand cinematic tradition, Ridley Scott delivers a fantastic work or extensive, grand proportions in all the possible aspects of film-making technique, cinematographic craft, and historical precision.<br/><br/>Steven Zaillian, the man who penned Schindler's List and Gangs of New York, delivers a broad, sprawling and wonderful screenplay more than fitting of the word ""epic"". Zaillian provides us with a cornucopia of details concerning everything from Frank Lucas' rise to power, his work methods and his relations both with his family and with other gangsters; and on the other end of the spectrum, Richie Roberts' work ethics, relations with co-workers, eventual assignment to take down the drug kingpins, and all this coupled with his own personal problems and family life. We see the rise, the stay at the top, the fall, the aftermath, and everything in-between, and are spared no historical or fascinating detail whatsoever. That said, the script does have one major weakness: I feel Zaillian could have summarized the aftermath a little more than it ended up taking. But while the script certainly is meant to serve as a giant, broad magnifying glass to this particular period in American crime history  and certainly more than delivers on this historical plane  it's very hard to miss what Zaillian was truly aiming at here, and that is the facing off of two titanic forces of nature.<br/><br/>What is most fascinating about how Zaillian chooses to portray his two main subjects is not only how negated they are, but also the nature of these negatives. Frank Lucas, the drug kingpin who kills at will and who is single-handedly responsible for the cheap distribution of illegal and highly deadly drugs on the streets, is shown as a charming, relentless family man whose first and foremost order of business is providing his mother and brothers with a large estate to make sure they are set for life; he arranges meetings for his talented nephew with heads of baseball teams, he is faithful to his wife, he goes to church every Sunday with his mother, and he generally works his hardest at constantly keeping his cool. Detective Richie Roberts, on the other hand, is an undeniable good soul; a recurrently mentioned point in his career is that he found $1 million in untraceable dollars in the trunk of a car and turned it in. He is the laughing stock of the entire police force for being straight as an arrow and entirely honest, and his devotion in the taking down of first Lucas and eventually the crooked NYC police force is truly inspirational. But Richie is divorced, he skips out on the sparse meetings he has with his kid, he is a womanizer and we know that he cheated on his wife and engages in casual sex; he is a lonely recluse who takes night courses and always seems to be preoccupied with something else. Judging by their characters, you'd think that Lucas would be the one to root for, and indeed this negation, this battle of the wits, is the centerpiece of the epic drama.<br/><br/>And who better to play two opposing titan forces than two of the undeniably most titanic actors of our generation, Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington. Crowe's performance is pitch-perfect and he effortlessly embodies Richie's every trait, from his indecisiveness and preoccupied nature to his blind devotion and honesty to his flawless accent. And yet, he is indisputably overshadowed by Denzel Washington's powerhouse performance as the charming, murderous family-man drug kingpin Lucas, who he plays with an almost animal ferocity that comes so incredibly naturally to him. The supporting cast also features some familiar faces that deserve a little more time in the spotlight than they currently have, namely Chiwetel Ejiofor, who plays Lucas' brother who gets a little too caught up in the luxurious life Lucas provides him and who continues to deliver fantastic roles in the movies he acts in, both as a supporting and as a lead player; and Josh Brolin, who plays the corrupt cop with such dirty sleaze-bagginess that he can truly be viewed as the film's one true villain and who must have been in more high-profile movies in 2007 alone more than he has been in during the rest of his entire career beforehand.<br/><br/>I have noticed that many movies in 2007 are morality tales: the good guys have their many flaws and weaknesses emphasized while the bad guys are portrayed as likable, admirable persons despite their actions. Ridley Scott, undeniably one of our greatest working directors, delivers a fantastic entry into the crime epic genre that works both as a stunning and brilliant cinematic achievement, as a historic depiction of crime history, as a rise-and-fall story, and as a morality tale epic battle of wits between two titans. One is only left to regret the fact that Ridley Scott didn't shoot this epic in all of the 2.35:1 aspect ratio glory his films are usually identified with."

","Like a model student learns everything he is told to learn, ""American Gangster"" has all the elements a good gangster film should have (if you go by the book). On the one hand the gangster, Frank Lucas, a man who revolutionized drug dealing in the early Seventies, played outstandingly by Denzel Washington. He is someone for the audience to identify with his charisma, but at the same time this inhuman part of him works repellent. On the other hand there is the cop, played also very well by Russell Crowe. He, too, is a character to sympathize with, mainly because of his high moral standards and his human flaws. On a very personal level, however, ""American Gangster"" couldn't fully convince me. It's thrilling, dramatic and the material is very interesting, but I had the impression that it is done with a real fascination for the genre and not so much for the characters and the social network. All in all a good film with its share of minus points (amongst them Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character)."

And American Gangster is even by now one of the faves out of my favorite kind of movies. The story is brilliant. The acting is brilliant. The atmosphere is brilliant. Shocking one time, dirty another and again another funny. Ridley Scott coped fantastically with the challenge of making a realistic, depressing film, depicting the situation New York had to deal with in the 70's: corrupt cops, drug dealers on the rise, organized crime. On top of all this Frank Lucas, the first black drug-lord this country has ever seen, making millions with imported heroin from South-East Asia. On the other side, respectively on the bottom of the hierarchical order: Richie Roberts, a righteous do-gooder, a cop so just that his colleagues hate him. Roberts and Lucas are enemies, opponents. Though they are not seen on screen together before the last twenty minutes of the film, their stories are shown parallel, which adds much to the atmosphere I liked for example in ""The Departed"" so much. The story lines are so gripping, yet different that it is hard to keep your eyes away from the screen. My recommendation: go to the toilet at least twice before watching this 2-hours-37-minutes-blockbuster, so you won't have to miss one second. Ten out of ten. Chapeau, Mr. Scott!"

","A great star cast, trailer and the time duration of the movie attracted me to go and watch it.<br/><br/>It is a true story of a drug lord in 1960-70s America, Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington)  the first African American underworld kingpin. He learns his ropes early in life and manages to source the drugs from Thailand through Vietnam's US war plans bringing back coffins. Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), an honest cop (but dishonest husband entangled in a broken marriage and divorce lawsuit) gets the job of putting an end to the New York drug market. Frank operates with very low profile so Richie is not able to trace him early on, but evidently does  and pins Franks down, who is also under pressure from rival Italian drug mafia and local police. Franks divulges the entire network of corrupt drug chain operating (the largest expose until date) and hundreds are convicted. Frank serves two terms adding to 15 years and comes out of prison in 1991, with no family or money or life.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington  with quite similar looks to Frank, was waiting for this role since last 5 years, and when it materialized  in his own style has rendered complete heart and soul to the complex religious but society and people ruining drug lord. Russell Crowe on other side, portrays a more relaxed but real portray of Richie Roberts  very believable. In contrast Denzel's portrayal is larger than life, and the script intends to make a hero out of this terrible gangster  which is sad part of the story.<br/><br/>Otherwise, Ridley Scott has done marvelous job in producing and directing the movie. He maintains a tight script  moving between Denzel and Richie's life, and with a long run time, grips you within the first 40-50 minutes. The lead up to the final hour is very interesting.<br/><br/>Ridley maintains a 35 mm format for this movie and packs up a lot of 70s style of production  much similar to what one can compare with brown tone filming and a parallel to Scarface.<br/><br/>A treat to watch the engaging scene between Denzel and Russell, especially the style with which Denzel shifts the coffee glass! Ahthose scenes would be remembered in history of cinema in good face to face coming of two good actors.<br/><br/>(Stars 8 out of 10)"

","Director Ridley Scott has surprised me: he's finally made a movie I liked. Since the last one was ""Alien"" back in 1979, I'd pretty much given up on him.<br/><br/>""American Gangster"" is a kinetic, dazzlingly entertaining crime film. It features two strong performances from Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, but this wasn't a movie that left me remembering the performances. Rather, it's the great writing and assured directing that left me most impressed.<br/><br/>Washington plays Frank Lucas, a drug dealer in 1960s Harlem who applies the principal of the American dream and capitalism to his drug trade: make something better and sell it for less, and pretty soon your product will be the one to beat. Crowe plays perhaps the only honest cop in New York City, who's appointed the leader of a narcotics unit whose mission is to bring an end (or at least curb) New York's rampant drug market. All of this is based on a true story, but who knows how accurate it all is. And frankly, with a movie as entertaining as this, who cares? The film only slows down toward the end, when Washington and Crowe finally meet, and the screenplay decides it must tidy things up in a ""here's-the-moral-of-the-story"" kind of way. The rest is energetic and highly accomplished. The film doesn't join the ranks of ""The Godfather"" as one of the best American films about organized crime, but I'm not sure it tries to, and that's one of its best qualities.<br/><br/>A host of other actors appear in supporting roles, including Cuba Gooding, Jr., Chiwetel Ejiofor, Ruby Dee (memorable as Washington's mother), Ted Levine (who I'll never be able to see as anyone other than Buffalo Bill from ""The Silence of the Lambs""), Josh Brolin (who has now officially appeared in every movie released this year) and, chewing the scenery, Armand Assante doing his best Marlon Brando impersonation.<br/><br/>Like him or not, there's no denying that Scott does know his way around a movie set, and with ""American Gangster"" he's given us one of the best and one of the most entertaining films of the year.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","Based on a true story, this follows the exploits of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), a real- life gangster, and Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), the cop who tries to catch him.<br/><br/>The movie's opening is (possibly purposefully) convoluted and the feeling of bewilderment is heightened by the fact that 25% of the characters in the film seemingly have a speech impediment. However, it is the second half of the film where it really takes off; thrusting the viewer into the action, in exciting style.<br/><br/>The performances all round are brilliant. Crowe gives his character a believable third dimension, thanks mostly to sacrificing his ego and concentrating on the character's everyman facets; a role that Hollywood actors neglect in favour of the more enticing, fancy, confident, showy characters.<br/><br/>But it is Washington's performance that will steal the plaudits - perhaps unfairly. Whilst he is brilliant as the cold, but family orientated, business man/gangster; he is not stunning. Washington often plays parts similarly, whether he plays a crime kingpin, or a cop; that ruthless nature and unpredictability. Like, say, Tom Cruise, he reacts to situations superbly - as well as any actor out there - but it's always the same guy you see behind those eyes.<br/><br/>The script and direction, whilst mostly superb, is at times a little mystifying. For instance, Lucas is always telling his brothers not to be too showy and bold and brash (in reference to the clothes they wear, and the way they behave), but when a rival doesn't pay him back, Lucas shoots him in the middle of the street in broad daylight, before returning to the cafe to continue eating his breakfast with his family. A tense, stunning scene, perhaps; but I couldn't help feel it was at odds with the rest of the story and the character itself.<br/><br/>It is this lack of cohesiveness throughout that prevents 'American Gangster' from being truly great.<br/><br/>Overall, this is certainly worth watching. It's an engrossing crime-romp, bolstered by a stellar cast and good production values, but the inconsistencies throughout slightly damage the overall quality."

","Or possibly it's the other way around. Maybe the story of Frank Lucas, played by Denzel Washington, has been crafted into other incarnations in movies such as NEW JACK CITY and KING of NEW YORK. Frank Lucas is a big time (maybe the biggest) drug dealer in Harlem who happens to not only sell heroin at half the price of any other dealer, but it's 100% pure heroin, called ""Tru Blu"". That's where Russell Crow comes in playing the role of Det. Richie Roberts, an overly honest cop. Roberts can't seem to find out who's dealing ""Tru Blu"" until a minor slip up happens, one that makes even Lucas (a man who really dots his i's and crosses his t's) seem human. At this point it's a mission for Roberts to catch an uncatchable man in Lucas. This is due to Lucas's management of his operation and a corrupt Police Department. In what seems to be the year of Josh Brolin, he puts in another amazingly solid effort in the supporting role of Det. Trupo, one of the crooked cops. He really puts life into one of the main sub-plots and keeps it moving along. The only complaint I have, and it really is no one's fault, is as mentioned in the title, I've seen this movie before. OR at least major elements of it in NEW JACK CITY and KING of NEW YORK. Makes you wonder? And that's why I give it 8/10."

","Frank Lucas: See, ya are what ya are in this world. That's either one of two things: Either you're somebody, or you ain't nobody.<br/><br/>Expectations were high for multi-talented filmmaker Ridley Scott's latest feature film exploring the life of powerful African-American drug trafficker Frank Lucas (Academy Award Winner Denzel Washington) and his eventual capture by a down-on-his-luck Jewish cop Richie Roberts (Academy Award Winner Russell Crowe). I expected it to be a Best Picture contender for sure, but after having viewed it I realized I was sorely mistaken. I guess disappointed is the correct term I'd use for my feelings after having seen 'American Gangster'. Don't get me wrong, 'American Gangster' is a very good film, it's just not a great one. I guess the film's problem lies in how unoriginal it is. 'Gangster' just doesn't seem like an honest and genuine movie, it seems to borrow from a lot of other similar films and relies a lot upon gimmicks and catchy snippets of dialogue to con the audience into thinking it's the next Godfather. 'American Gangster' is anything but the next Godfather. It's very good, with some extraordinary performances, beautifully filmed sequences and some significantly powerful scenes, but it's nothing we haven't already seen before time and time again.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington steals the film with a charming yet terrifying portrayal of a man pushed to the edge. Russell Crowe is solid but underused as Richie Roberts. 'Gangster' also sports some outstanding supporting performances. Josh Brolin is brilliantly creepy as a crooked cop, the marvelous Chitwel Ejofor is excellent in a against-type role for him as Washington's f__ck-up brother, and flamboyant Broadway actor Roger Bart (The Producers, Hostel Part II) is very much out of his element as an angry, foul-mouthed and racist FBI agent.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's direction is spot-on as always, especially during an astonishingly well-shot sequence where Washington and his goons get arrested. The screenplay is another story. While taut, engrossing but kind of contrived for the most part, the ending is perhaps the sappiest I've seen from ANY movie all year. God! It made me want to puke crap! I apologize for being so graphic and raunchy, but I felt that was the best way to describe how the film's conclusion made me feel.<br/><br/>Despite it's flaws, when all is said and done, 'American Gangster' is a long but fast-paced, contrived yet entertaining, well-acted, well-directed and adequately written crime/drama that is well worth your time.

Despite this however, there are some pretty clichéd moments in this movie. The Roberts character appears to be the only honest cop in the city, and Lucas comes over as a family man, like just about any drug-lord in a movie like this.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott and screenwriter Steven Zaillian are striving for a movie epic like Micheal Mann's Heat, but there is a key difference. Heat, while dominated by the De Niro/Pacino pairing does have a number of subplots going on, giving the supporting cast things to do. Sadly here, Crowe and Washington simply blow everyone else off screen, leaving some decent actors, such as Josh Brolin, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Armand Assante, amongst others little to do.<br/><br/>While Crowe is good as Roberts, this movie is dominated by Denzel Washington's performance. Charismatic, charming, yet brutal and deadly when he has to be, this could easily see him getting another Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>The movie looks superb, like all Scott's movies, as is the attention to detail.

The thrust and parry, each one psychologically circling the other, figuring out the weak points and strengths of the other in deciding how to negotiate with each other, the mutual caginess and respect, was fascinating to watch.

"dkncd","7","0","2","23 November 2007"," Disappointing but not completely awful crime film
","""American Gangster"" is Ridley Scott's latest film that centers on the leader of a drug cartel and a detective dedicated to curtailing drug dealing. Though the story is based on true events, no doubt viewers will find parallels with other better crime films. The parallel that strikes me the most is with ""Heat"" (1995), which also portrays a crime story from the perspective of a detective and a criminal leader, but much more engagingly. ""American Gangster"" isn't an awful film per se, but it could have been better considering the talent involved.<br/><br/>The film does feature solid performances. Russell Crowe is effective as a relentless and incorruptible yet womanizing and sometimes quick to anger detective. Denzel Washington is also effective in his role as a self-assured and tough criminal leader. Both actors are acting in familiar territory and I wasn't surprised by the characterizations, but they were effective none the less. The supporting performances were also notable, especially Josh Brolin as a despicable crooked police detective.<br/><br/>The film's story is where this film could have been improved. The film's premise is a good one and it is well-developed initially. The ending sequence starting with an investigation of a plane is tense and effective. There is a memorable scene where Crowe and Washington sit down and discuss their situation which recalls ""Heat"", though the scene in ""Heat"" is superior. The way they incorporated reports of Vietnam into the film was effective and as were the scenes featuring the troubled family life of Crowe's character. It is the middle of the story that could have been improved. While there are some notable scenes in that portion, it seemed overlong overall and more tedious than it should be. Due to this, for me ""American Gangster"" did not realize its full potential."
"Chris Knipp","8","0","2","21 November 2007"," Superfly gets a posh makeover
","Scott's flashy, energetic gangster biopic loosely follows the story of a real black drug importer and dealer of late Sixties, early Sevenities Harlem. Frank Lucas (played by Denzel Washington with his usual rush of energy and charisma) did indeed learn the ropes of organized crime from his black boss Bumpy Johnson, did import drugs from Southeast Asia using military connections, did bring his North Carolina family up to be his network for heroin distribution, and was brought down by cops and made deals with Ritchie Roberts (played with his usual conviction and strength by Russell Crowe). Moreover Roberts and Lucas did work together to bring down various dealers and crooked cops--and get Lucas off with only 15 (or maybe fewer) years in jail, not served consecutively.<br/><br/>One can't help being of two minds about this film. In many ways it's just another gangster movie, and scenes in it will awaken memories of many others of the genre. It's hard to consider the black Superfly hero exactly a new creation either, Lucas reportedly he was not really the wealthiest or most successful black drug dealer, though he's made to seem so here. (The real Lucas reportedly was a definite presence in the shooting of the film and in the views of others is responsible for a number of distortions of the facts.) But the director of Blade Runner and Thelma and Louise, Gladiator and Black Hawk Down is not your average crap film director. He is a crap film director who can produce the occasional cult classic, and who awakens disturbed admiration even at times when his effort is somehow revolting. This film has great momentum and confidence, and its first half is a pleasure to watch. As seen here, and in the tall, regal embodiment of Denzel Washington, Frank Lucas is more than a top-dog gangster. He's a black hero and a bold economic pioneer, because he explicitly steps forth from the mold set by his mentor, Bumpy (Clarence Williams III in the film) to bypass the Italians and sell pure heroin, his own trademarked brand, at a lower price than the adulterated stuff on the street-- bypassing the usual wholesalers and setting up his own distribution system. And yet, while establishing a purely black business, he followed Italisn traditions in making that business his own kind of cosa nostra--once again a family concern, with his own mother (a glossily distinguished old lady) brought up to preside over a huge white plantation-style manse, taken over, refurbished in an elegant Afro style, and manned by discreet southern black crooks.<br/><br/>So what we have here is a very hollow victory for Black liberationists. A black man who achieved the distinction of feeding heroin to Harlem's addicts all by himself, without white supervision or control. Hooray. While the movie avoids a great deal of gratuitous brutality (and the mass killing spree is carried out at the end by the cops, wiping out Luicas' main heroin packaging station), he is clear a very cruel man, capable of bashing in or blowing off a head at a moment's notice.<br/><br/>Whatever distortion there may be, the glorification of the hero being the most morally dubious one, there are some convincing factual elements. Generally speaking an early-Seventies feel is nicely achieved through the use of down-tinted color and many, but not overstated, period outfits and hairdos. It's also an interesting point brought out in Scott's occasionally documentary-style passages that in the early Seventies American soldiers were returning Stateside in droves addicted to opium or heroin; that their various R&R points (notably Bangkok) obviously were well supplied with these drugs and accustomed to purveying them to Americans; and that (in the film anyway) Lucas went in country himself to find and cut a deal with a local kingpin, using a military cousin as the future intermediary. This is bold and original, but the boldest and most original stroke of all was to bypass organized crime. An independent businessman? The essence of American entrepreneur-ism? Hooray again.<br/><br/>There appears to be exaggeration and blurring of facts in the depiction of Russell Crowe's character, New Jersey crime fighter Ritchie Roberts, as a noble yet flawed opponent. Here Lucas may not have influenced the final cut, since he reportedly says Ritchie was a man who could not have arrested his own mother. It's really at the end that Ritchie stepped in to cut deals as a prosecutor, and the cops who worked to bring Lucas down are underplayed or demonetize.<br/><br/>Again as in New Jack City and some other films we're treated to repeated shots of a Harlem heroin packing plant staffed by naked nubile black women. Maybe they're essential to the story? How much is mythology here? Relatives of the real Ritchie say he wasn't a deadbeat dad as reported, because he wasn't a dad at all, and also not a philanderer. There is so much departure from the facts here, and yet the ending with its ritual string of on screen text-message follow-ups is mechanical and anti-climactic. Accomplished as it is, Scott's compellingly grand new black gangster movie is finally just another link in a conventional chain."

","Based on a true story, American Gangster, directed by Ridley Scott, is an account of Frank Lucas' (Denzel Washington) drive to become the most deadly man in America, circa late nineteen sixties. As a black driver and body guard of Bumpy Johnson he learns all that he knows from him in becoming an international drug dealer. He found ways to traffic drugs from the Vietnam War to the United States using the coffins of dead soldiers. This allowed him to buy straight from the manufacturer cutting out the middle man, which is alluded to early in the movie. This combination of low prices and high potency drugs allowed him to sell a ""better product then the competition at a lower price than the competition."" This equals huge profits. The unknown black man quietly became the drug kingpin of Manhattan. As he became bigger the target on his back also became bigger. When a rare uncorrupted cop, Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), caught a whiff of Lucas' hierarchy he rapidly became a wanted man. This finally led to his demise, and his employed family, which accrued to Lucas' reduced sentence of 15 years after he brought down three fourths of the drug officers in NYC, all of which were corrupt. <br/><br/>American Gangster depicts a great story line of how someone so unknown can become an illegal giant just by knowing how to play his cards right. It combines a great number of action scenes with scenes that let the plot flow in leading to the next twist. New problems are brought up and most are quickly dealt with by a bull headed Lucas in a usually brutal fashion. In addition to plot flow the story line also throws in a few allusions and fore shadowing. I mentioned one above but another is one early in the movie where whenever a television is in a scene it is always a broadcast of the war. This is very important to the plot in that it gives Lucas the idea of buying the drugs in Vietnam and trafficking it via the coffins of dead American G.I.'s, which is found out later in the movie. Richie Roberts is also an important character showing that good cops still do exist among a very corrupt city. The combination of stories is also well described in the movie showing the lives of both Roberts and Lucas. In that it Shows how two opposites can end up meeting in the end to bring down something that they both scorn mutually. Corrupt cops happen to be the intersection point in this situation. <br/><br/>The attitudes of how Scott wants the characters portrayed are also shown well. The opening scene shows a stone faced Lucas lighting a man on fire. This is followed by two shots from a pistol to the man's body as the man squirms around on the ground bound and aflame. Immediately the audience thinks that Lucas is all business and that if you cross him in the wrong way you will pay the ultimate price. Roberts' attitude is also portrayed well, however in a different light. A scene that highlights this is one in which Roberts and his partner search a car that contains nearly one million dollars in unmarked cash. No one would know if he and his partner were to take it as it is dirty and unknown to authorities. He decides to turn it in instead which is followed by a jeering by his fellow officers as he is called such things as ""boy scout"" alluding to his straight arrowed attitude and outlook on duty as an officer. Scott also shows a lot of talent in the way he can both make scenes that are both wide open, see: family gets new house from Lucas, and close fast paced scenes, see: the busting of the drug operation, look stunning. Overall we find a movie that has all of the ingredients for a blockbuster. When combined with the directive muscle of Scott it equals a cinematic adventure that exposes one of the best true tales of the century that seems to flex at full strength. It's a long movie at nearly two hours and thirty minutes, but well worth it."

","I'd been looking at the reviews for this film recently and I was quite surprised. It was touted to be one of the biggest films of this month, if not the biggest. I mean it has Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe in it and it's directed by Ridley ""Alien"" Scott. What's not to like? Well quite a bit apparently. There have been many good reviews but none have been what I was expecting with a creative team of this calibre. I was expecting greatness, comparing it favourably to recent gangster movies like The Departed. But it was met averagely, many critics saying it is good but it brings little to an already established genre.<br/><br/>I disagree. This is better than The Departed. It was only after looking at it's average reviews that I found that the general public seemed to love it. It seems as though the critics were out of touch with the public. This is a masterful film that keeps the viewer enthralled. It is 156 minutes long but it never seems boring, always keeping you on your toes as we move from the mob to the police to the corrupt cops and innocent bystanders that get caught (literally) in the cross fire.<br/><br/>It tells the true story of Frank Lucas, an African American mobster during the late 60's/early 70's who tries to take over the New York drug trade. He travels to Vietnam and finds a way to transport pure heroin via the American Military as they fly back from the war. The result brings him a stronger product that he sells for a discount price. He makes millions and slowly but surely, he takes of the streets of the city.<br/><br/>Hot on his tail is Narcotics Officer Ricky Roberts , dead set on bringing down organised crime and police corruption. He is a failure as a husband and a father and has links to mob members who give him the occasional snippet of info when he needs it. Then he stumbles across the path of Frank Lucas and from there on in, things get messy This is a fairly graphic film. There is violence from the start and very hard drug use. I was personally astounded at the detail they were allowed to show with the shooting up scenes and not in a good way. Graphic depictions of drug use have always made me feel more uncomfortable than violence and here is no exception. We see needles enter infected wounds as the users lean their heads back and gasp, loving the sensation it gives them. It's a sad sight of a sad time, where evil prays on the desperate without any feelings or remorse. In one particularly harrowing moment we see scenes of Lucas celebrating Thanksgiving with his family inter cut with images of his users lying dead, OD'd off his ""product"".<br/><br/>One thing we learn about Frank Lucas is that he was smart, calculated, very charming and totally evil. At one point we see him chatting casually with his brothers in a local diner before walking out and shooting a rival gang member in the head, in broad daylight, in the middle of the street. He walks back to where he was sitting before casually asking ""what was I saying?"". His brothers, much like the audience, are in shock.<br/><br/>In terms of what makes this film good, the main thing is the different direction Ridley ""Alien"" Scott has taken. He is a director renowned his focus on visuals, creating a perfect pallet of depth and meaning from a single image. In this film though he decides to ditch his trade mark style for something, ultimately, more gritty, down and dirty. Traces of his trademark still exist, for example: the Thanksgiving montage. When we see Lucas and his family the colours are light and vibrant, reminiscent of their mood. When we cut to the dead junkies, however, everything is dark and saturated of colour, with blues, blacks and greys being prominent. But this is not the primary aspect of the image and become more of a background detail. Very unlike Ridley Scott.<br/><br/>But this is only there for those who have either studied film or are out looking for it. For the rest of us, there is just a hard hitting and powerful gangster film. The visuals lay back and let the story and performances take over. And what a pair of actors they have in the lead roles.<br/><br/>As Lucas, Washington creates a man you both admire and loath. In many ways, his rise to power is reminiscent of the typical American dream, albeit a twisted version of it. He is smart and calculated and his charisma will make any woman swoon. He is also brutal and psychotic. You loath a man like him because he is the most charming amoral character you are ever likely to meet, and he kills people as easily as he makes money.<br/><br/>As Roberts, Crowe is a totally different beast. He's messy and disorganised. He has a wife who's left him, a child he hardly sees and, being one of the only honest cops on the beat, is hated by his colleagues. Crowe's ruggedness, designer stubble and awful haircut almost make you believe that we're not watching Russell Crowe but a real cop who's lost everything but still has his pride. The great thing about both these actors is their ability to get lost in their characters. You believe they are who they're portraying.<br/><br/>In short this is just a great movie. Accessible to anyone and written and directed with true gusto. This is essentially a cops and robbers movie but with Washington, Crowe and Scott on bored they have crafted a movie that certainly deserves some attention when the Oscars come calling.<br/><br/>5/5"

","I'm a Sir Ridley fan. The man is top tier film-making. He long ago mastered the ultimate trick, how to create distinct film worlds and render spatial relationships within them. His two brooding sci-fi epics were the pinnacle. Twenty-five years later, we still can't stop talking about them. And while everything he's done since then has ranged in quality from almost-as-good to the shockingly irrelevant, there's always been something noteworthy about each effort. This one's merely good, but that means it's still better than most of what I've seen this year.<br/><br/>When we observe it in the context of genre it's as exemplary as any other film of its kind. Of course it looks spectacular in how unspectacular it makes everything appear; it paces itself well, always moves with confidence; is full of good performers in good performances. The problem is that it has no soul. This time Scott seems content to internalize his selected genre instead of busting out. At the end I was satisfied but not deeply moved or exhilarated.<br/><br/>""Gladiator"" was exhilarating, at least as far as its action mattered. For better or worse, it popularized the fast-cranked discontinuous flow of modern movie action. I admit I was slow in coming around to it. Then ""Kingdom of Heaven"" did the same thing but with a much better screenplay. ""Matchstick Men"" played some havoc with its tired conman formula and redefined my expectations for that experience. But this one uses an old play book and never breaks step. Also, Scott usually has a knack for paring his material to the bare essentials so I was dismayed to find annoying clutter like the useless subplot about the Crowe character's marriage problems. And the cop-crook personality contrasts, meant to comprise a theme about similar-yet-dissimilar personalities met in conflict, didn't compel me in any way. <br/><br/>But the story gains something extra if seen as a sort-of sequel to a 1997 gangster movie you may or may not remember, ""Hoodlum."" That one was set in the 1930s and had the great Laurence Fishburne as Harlem racketeer ""Bumpy"" Johnson, who appears briefly in the first act of this as the Washington character's dying mentor (interestingly enough, played here by an actor who was an antagonist in the earlier film). Look at both movies together and you'll see a singular idea segueing from the first to the next -- that black criminals in this country could only gain a substantial foothold in the world of crime-as-free enterprise through its evolving currents, whereby they could commit to the same ruthless ethics as their white counterparts. Johnson was cowed by the white mob but somehow garnered a folk hero image from those he commanded, always while living in the shadow of those he enforced for. Frank Lucas was able to break away from that white-dominated system, even though he was still a hot-headed thug whose business destroyed many lives. All of this seems to be equated as differing circumstances of the day along with Lucas being more clever in his thinking, having more bravado, and maybe less scruples. Both pictures are heavily fictionalized and the first one isn't nearly as accomplished, yet Scott seems to emphasize some kind of unity by using the same combination of music (""Amazing Grace"") and setting (a church) for his ending, as ""Hoodlum"" did.<br/><br/>And yet there was hardly a moment I wasn't entertained. Even if he doesn't hit the same high marks every time, Scott always delivers something worth your investment because of the way he can think about scenes, storyboard them, mature them, shoot them, and then combine it all and throw it to you with a motivating cinematic idea at its core. His effort equates to some degree of achievement every time. Now contrast that with how things might have panned out if Antoine Fuqua hadn't been fired. He's from a younger generation, has always emphasized an admiration for Scorsese (particularly ""GoodFellas"") and word has it he wanted to hold up production long enough for Ray Liotta's participation in this. Well, Fuqua's no great talent (remember he made that lousy ""King Arthur"") and we would very likely have been left with a pallid Marty imitation, right from the fan boy handbook.<br/><br/>But rejoice. Instead we've gotten something just as good as real Scorsese, although still governed by many of the laws of crime film convention. How rewarding then that the plot itself doesn't matter too much.<br/><br/>I mean, just look at the climax Scott builds at the end of this film (when Crowe and his narcotics agents crack down on the public projects) and how there is not one element in that sequence that isn't anchored in a specific, advanced visual principle. Similar to what Pixar repeatedly accomplishes. From the composition to the editing, the resulting rhythm is that of another character who co-opts our stance as audience and as participant, anticipating the action most of the time as we do but still able to surprise us. It is as good as anything in ""The Departed.""<br/><br/>The man is always pushing. And the fact that he consistently instills such singular visions into these big commercial projects is even more reason to value him. <br/><br/>Blake's rating: 3 (out of 4)"

The submersion into 60's Harlem gangster life was thorough; however this movie spends too little time showing what drugs ""really"" did to people during that time. The glamor and glitz was on the screen too often I thought, and I found myself rooting for Lucas at times. I won't say this is ""typical"" for Hollywood's glorification of violence and criminals, but it was getting close. Crowe delivered a convincing performance; I didn't even notice any Australian accent slipping through at all. Denzel Washington runs away with the story, even with a good supporting cast. I'm of the camp that says Denzel is Denzel in all his movies, pretty much the same character all the time, but this sort of movie calls for that guy.

"Buddy-51","8","0","2","18 November 2007"," Top notch gangster picture
","In what is possibly the best gangster picture since ""Goodfellas,"" Denzel Washington stars as Frank Lucas, a real life drug lord who reigned over Harlem from the late 1960's to the early 1970's. Lucas rose to prominence when he began buying his supplies directly from a military connection in war torn Vietnam, allowing him to push a ""purer"" product at a cheaper price than any of his mob competitors. Russell Crowe plays Richie Roberts, an ""honest cop"" from New Jersey who leads an undercover investigation into the source of all this suddenly abundant street heroin, a search that ultimately leads him to Lucas himself.<br/><br/>As written by Steven Zaillian (derived from an article by Marc Jacobson) and directed by Ridley Scott - two old pros who certainly know how to craft a quality movie - ""American Gangster"" is an epic tale of crime and punishment that pays due homage to all the classic gangster pictures that have come before it. Americans have always had a love/hate relationship with law breakers and gangsters. Although we may be appalled by their callous indifference to the suffering of others, we can't help but admire their steely-eyed determination and entrepreneurial spirit, as well as their ability to turn the American Dream on its head with impunity (until they're finally caught that is). And Lucas is no exception, for here is the classic figure of gangster mythology - a boy from the streets who rises from obscurity to command his own empire, only to have it crumble before his very eyes when his own hubris and overreaching prove too much even for the gods themselves to countenance. In a strange moral paradox, much as we may like to see gangsters succeed, we also like to see them brought low and given their just desserts - if for no more morally admirable reason that that we envy them. Lucas comes replete with that special cognitive dissonance that all gangsters seem to possess, and which allows them to live two entirely separate and compartmentalized lives, free of the guilt and hypocrisy that keep the rest of us duty-bound and law-abiding. For despite his ferocious temperament, indifference to human suffering, and callow willingness to exploit human tragedy for his own personal gain, Lucas protects his neighborhood, dotes on his mother and family, and loves his wife.<br/><br/>Ironically, Roberts, the cop, has less worth celebrating in his own life - his wife is divorcing him and moving with their son to Las Vegas, his fellow cops don't trust him (for the reason that he ISN'T on the take), and his hopes of becoming a defense attorney may come to naught if he can't conquer his paralyzing fear of public speaking. Yet, Roberts has one thing going for him that Lucas doesn't - he knows the difference between right and wrong, even though he doesn't always act on that knowledge when it comes to his own personal (as opposed to professional) life.<br/><br/>Yet what truly distinguishes ""American Gangster"" from its recent movie counterparts - more even than the storyline or characterizations - is the tremendous amount of texture Zaillian and Scott bring to the picture. Every scene is filled with intense interactions between characters, intriguing background information (especially the TV reports from Vietnam), and spot-on period details. And even though Washington and Crowe appear together only in the closing moments, their powerhouse performances make the two concurrently running stories feel all of a piece. It should also be noted that, for a gangster picture, ""American Gangster"" doesn't feel the need to wallow in excessive violence or gratuitous sadism. It is much more concerned with the people involved than with their on-the-job activities.<br/><br/>As with even the best of movies these days, ""American Gangster"" could use a little trimming in its later stages, where it suffers a bit from distention and attenuation. Moreover, the final scenes feel a trifle implausible and pat despite the fact that they are reportedly based on fact.<br/><br/>Still, these are minor shortcomings in a movie that is firing on all cylinders for most of its running time."
"jdkraus","8","0","3","18 November 2007"," Not Ridley's best, but still pretty good 8/10
","I love director Ridley Scott, for his movies blow me away with his creativity and unique movie feats that deliver brilliant stories and top-notched acting such as: Gladiator, Blade Runner, and Black Rain. Since I'm a huge fan of his, surprisingly, I did not like this movie as much as his previous works. Maybe it's because of only seen his major successes. I'm not saying that I don't like ""American Gangster"" or think that it is a flop; on the contrary, I actually did enjoy it, but not as much as I hoped I would.<br/><br/>The story of the uprising and reign of Frank Lucas was really interested. I am no expert in the history of gangsters nor have I ever heard of Frank Lucas, but the movie really got in deep about his life and how he and his gang got pure heroin, nicknamed ""blue magic"" into the U.S. from South East Asia and onto the streets of New York City unnoticed by the government or the police for several years. I almost felt like I was getting a historical education on how dealers in the late 1960s and early 1970s got their drugs produced and sold on the streets.<br/><br/>Acting wise, Denzel Washington and Russel Crowe once again prove they are among today's Hollywood finest actors. They shine the screen with their performances as drug dealer and narcotic's detective. It was moving to see how different their character's personalities were, but somehow they were the same. Both were honest in their line of business. Both had violent lives. Both were good at what they did.<br/><br/>They aren't in any scenes together until the end of the movie, which really puts their acting skills to the test as their characters finally confront one another for the shocking climax. Now I don't know if they'll get any Oscars or even the nominations for it (since both already have at least one Oscar at home), but it would be fair enough to give either of them the Golden Globe award for Best Actor.<br/><br/>On a negative side, this movie is no action flick. There are no car chases and there is only one intense shootout at the end of the film. There are some stakeouts, but they aren't action-oriented. I'm not imply that this movie is boring because it lacks the car chases and numerous shootouts, but it did not have many plots going on or have the speed to make it go by quickly like Scorsese's The Departed.<br/><br/>Even though it does not have a boat load of action or an incredibly high body count, nonetheless, Ridley Scott does not shy away from inhumanity. It was violent for me to cringe in a couple of scenes, but it was not as bad as some of other gangster films I have seen. And the foul language wasn't as much as I anticipated. Overall, it was a decent gangster film, but it needed a quicker pace. The two and a half hour film felt longer than three hours for me, and I don't find most movies to be slow. 8/10"

","Ridley Scott never fails when it comes to the action genre. Furthermore, how can you go wrong when you pair two of the best actors of our time, Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, on the same screen. The violence in this film is what makes it captivating and memorable. In many ways its reminiscent of Goodfellas in that regard. However, unlike that film it does not score the unquestionable home run the cast and pre-release hype inarguably suggested it would. This is a film definitely worth seeing on the big screen. A valuable piece of cinema, but not one that blew me away in the manner I had hoped for. I had similar feelings for The Departed and we see how successful that film was, so this may be a better review than I had actually intended. On a side note, it was nice to see Cuba Gooding Jr. removed from the litany of Disney instant classics he seemed obsessed with over the last few years and back in the type of quality film worthy of an academy award winner.

"filmfan92","8","0","3","18 November 2007"," ""Gangster"" hands out the good stuff
","""Anerican Gangster"", the new Ridley Scott film about 70's drug titan Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) and the rogue cop Richie Roberts(Russell Crowe) who tried to put him behind bars, is a strange phenomena. It is, in different respects, one of the years greatest sucesses and most devastating disappointments. Let's start with the triumphs-the actors are dynamite. Viewers who want to see great thespians do their thing are in for a big treat here. Denzel is a fiery wonder as Lucas, and Crowe deserves a lot more appreciation than he's getting for his quieter, more tortured performance as a cop who has nothing left but the job. Even the supporting cast, be they infamous flop-makers like Cuba Gooding, Jr, or renowned character actors such as Armand Assante, turn in superb, note perfect performances. And Ruby Dee steals the movie as Lucas's elderly, principled mother. Behind the scenes, no expense is spared. The New York streets look delicilously ratty, the period music is catchy, and the cinematography brings a great clarity to the ups and downs of gangster life. The biggest disappointment is in the script. Steve Zaillian has written an epic, almost 3-hour script, but it comes down to a lot of ""and then this happens..oh, and next..."". Almost no character insight is given, no significant action driven by anything other than the desire to make money. And the build-up is agonizingly slow. ""Gangster"" has some classic scenes, but none of them can be attribute to the script, nor to Scott's clunky direction (I won't start on my personal opinions of this director). Still, definitely worth a look-when Crowe and Washington clash, you get the best-acted moment in movies since ""Heat""'s coffeeshop scene."
"deppj","10","0","6","16 November 2007"," Excellent film, nothing new, but a great film nonetheless
","This film is superb, loved every minute of it, the cast, the scenery, everything. The story is a simple one, a lot like Blow, and Denzel carrys this one off just as well as Depp did. Denzel, Is my third tip for an Oscar nomination, the other two being Russel Crowe for 3:10 to yuma and Viggo Mortensen for Eastern Promises, but I doubt Denzel would win, as his performance is very similar to a lot of his other roles, but still worth the vote. Denzel was class as always in this film, he remains the cool, charming and eye catching performer. There's not much more to say about him really, he's just Denzel, and I don't mean that in a bad way. Russel Crowe is excellent in the supporting role, unlike Denzel, his versatility is what I really like about him, he brings the warmth to the film and person you can relate to. The rest of the class are great, although I hope Buffalo Bill doesn't get many more roles, as you always want him to clear his throat. Some of the shots I really enjoyed, one in particular is just when Denzel is walking down the street with his brothers in New York, I don't know why, but it just sticks in my head. Great film, iconic, already a favorite of mine."

","Am I missing something? I did not see a credit for the ""Bumpy"" Johnson"" character, either in the Main Title of the film or during the End Credits. In addition, I believe the actor was Clarance Williams III. Am I correct, and why is there no reference to his character in the credits? I would also like to ask if I am correct that in the scene where a U.S. Prosecuter confronts Russell Crow's character, Richie Roberts, and says, ""get this kike out of here"". If so, why was this term, which is very derogatory to people of the Jewish Faith used? Was Richie Roberts Jewish? This line of dialog was very difficult to understand, so I may be incorrect in it's factuality. I have been employed in the Motion Picture Industry for may years and find the lack of a credit highly unusual, and when this has occurred, this was usually a choice of the Actor, due to some discord between the Actor and the Producer or Director."

","I went in to American Gangster with very high standards. I love Denzel Washington movies and while I don't really like Russell Crowe that much, I expect a lot out of him in his films. The two stars did not disappoint. Washington portrayed a vicious and cold-hearted drug lord one minute, followed by a man who loves his family the next. Crowe is the stereotypical cop who is putting everything in his life aside in his pursuit of Frank Lucas. I was also struck by the number of actors I recognized and had forgotten about in the film. The movie is gritty and realistic. I really enjoyed the way the put the movie up against significant events during the 1970s. All in all, American Gangster is a 2 and half hour delight. While it is not the most uplifting story, you will walk out of the theater knowing you saw a very well made movie. Ridley Scott, My Man."
"tnrcooper","7","0","6","15 November 2007"," Washington's character not as admirable as advertised
","In reading pre-release materials and anticipatory material about the movie, I heard that Lucas was a complicated, complex guy. I can't say I saw that much in the film. To me he seemed like a money-grubbing, cold-blooded, amoral drug dealer. Yes, he looked after his mother and his brothers, but is that really so remarkable? Joe Pesci loves his mother in ""Goodfellas"" but he has no compunction about shooting at the feet of a hobbled waiter or taking out rivals. I don't think there are many out there who do not look after their mothers. The Bible notes that if you love only those dear to you, what more do you do than others? (Matthew 5:47) It would seem that if Lucas was a more complex character, he would exhibit some reservations or depth of character about his role as a high-level drug dealer. That is not the case, however.<br/><br/>Washington is fantastic in portraying a determined, capable, but cold-blooded drug dealer, but I do not see any sign that he is concerned with New York City into which he is introducing so much powerful cocaine and heroin. Again, this is not to diminish the movie itself. It is well made although Russell Crowe seems a bit reserved for a hard-nosed Jersey cop and it does seem to drag on a bit. Those criticisms I could jettison completely were Lucas a bit more decent person. However to me there is little to advertise the guy. He imports huge amounts of very powerful, dangerous drugs, coldly kills those who cross him, and, to my mind, does little else that is admirable. <br/><br/>The film itself drags on a bit courtesy of a rather dry later-middle part of the movie which tracks the difficulty that Richie Roberts (Crowe) comes across in attempting to tie Lucas to the proliferation of high grade drugs on the streets of New York. Lucas' determination to make a mint comes from his belief that the man with whom he cut his teeth as a younger man Charlie Williams (Joe Morton) gave up too much of his money to middle-men in getting his drugs. It's because of this belief that his mentor gave up too much that Lucas attempts and succeeds greatly in cutting out the middlemen. Lucas is essentially the most cut-throat of American businessman-a greedy man who dislikes conceding any amount of possible profits to those whom he considers to be trespassing on his territory. It is this cold-blooded calculation which makes him a compelling character. That said, I do not find him even close to complicated. Cold-blooded, ruthless competitiveness in the drug trade does not really seem to me justification for making such a technically proficient, nicely scored, and well- acted (particularly Ted Levine, Josh Brolin, Cuba Gooding as an athlete with a small share of the drug market which has personally addicted him, and Ruby Dee as a not ignorant mother who accepts her son's largesse but is not in the dark. Washington, however, takes the acting cake, depicting a clear-eyed, enterprising businessman who happens to sell drugs."
"come2whereimfrom","8","0","5","15 November 2007"," Its 'The Wire' set in the sixties.
","The heavyweights team up for this film and it shows, Ridley Scott directs Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe in the true story of Frank Lucas a big time drugs baron in the late sixties. The story is rooted in truth so doesn't have the theatrics of say 'The Departed' but it is a traditional cops and robbers story played out brilliantly by all involved. Washington is brilliant as the uber cool Lucas ducking and diving his way around the big city with all his brothers fronting what appear to be legitimate business's that actually launder the drugs and money. Crowe (Richie) is the cop determined to take down Frank's organisation and find out where the stuff comes from and which cops pockets are being lined to let Frank become so powerful in the first place. Will Richie the laughing stock of the force behind closed doors, he refuses to take bribes and even returned a million pounds he found in a car, manage to hold on to his integrity and get the job done?. There is a very powerful scene in the middle of the film that flicks between Franks mansion and Richie's flat, Frank carving up an enormous turkey with all the trimmings and Richie making a crisp sandwich, it just goes to illustrate how far apart these two are, being good doesn't bring you wealth and happiness seems to be the message but will Frank get his comeuppance eventually or will the mouse always stay one step ahead of the cat? The whole way the film is shot with a pale wash bleeds the colours out slightly and gives a very authentic feel that works well when it cuts in actual footage of Vietnam, Nixon giving a speech or the recreation of a famous Mohammed Ali fight. But it really is the two main characters that give this film its momentum and without the performances of Washington and Crowe it wouldn't have half the impact it does and it's a story so wild it's hard to believe it actually happened. Gritty, real and engaging American Gangster is up there with any film by Scorsese or Stone and sees Ridley back on top form where he belongs."
"sistergal","10","0","6","15 November 2007"," Disturbing
","This was a well made movie and entertaining for adults however, I guess the movie industry will be determine not to let Tyler Perry and Bernic Mac get away with showing blacks as decent people. America thinks our morals have gone to hell. It makes it hard on black single mothers and all blacks who commute 3 hrs each day, each way because the jobs are moving out of our neighborhoods leaving latch key kids behind. Good jobs are drying up for blacks in an already tight economy. People are tired of us. America's children as we are called. Gangs are walking black neighborhoods not just the ghetto. Most black kids are being raised by single mothers (everyone knows this) and to be victimized by our males like this is scary to us. Just think what everyone else thinks. I hope some of the money they made from this film goes toward programs to help grandparents who are raising their grandkids off of social security checks because the kids parents are on drugs. In the black community this is alarming. Spike Lee was one of those kids. He is not a gangster. He is very creative. Make a movie about his grandmother. Make a movie about LL Cool J grandparents. What about single parents who raised responsible creditable business people and their struggle? Show balance. Every race has gangsters but blacks cannot afford to glorify them at this time. I know movies like these will always be made no matter what. Please slow it down. We as a community need you to be social responsible and give to programs that those you are glorifying have hurt. You are glorifying gangs (intentionally or not) that walk our neighborhoods and not yours. The movie actors and producers live with guards at their gates. Single mothers come home and lock 5 locks on the doors and afraid to come out at night. I am a little disappointed in Denzel. I know that kind of money is hard to turn down and if he did not take the part someone else would have. I just wish he had let it been someone else. Maybe it would not have been such a blockbuster. I know I was one of those people that have seen every movie Denzel played in because Denzel starred in it. Even my kids tells me. Denzel has a new movie out mom. I know you are going to see it. Even the bootleggers yell from parking lots to women. We got Denzel new movie. They don't announce the title. Not putting you down brother just please don't do another one. Other black actors and producers will now want to make gangsters movies to make those papers. What is going on with that series on BET called American Gangsters? Enough is enough."
"zardoz-13","8","0","4","14 November 2007"," A Turbulent Chapter in U.S. Criminal History
","The Ridley Scott crime biography ""American Gangster"" reunites Oscar winning actors Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe in the true-life saga of an arrogant African-American hoodlum who cornered the heroin market in the U.S. during the Vietnam War. Previously, Washington and Crowe appeared as rivals in director Brett Leonard's 1995 science fiction fantasy ""Virtuosity."" In this largely forgotten thriller, Denzel played the hero while Crowe played a villainous cyberspace serial killer that came to life. In ""American Gangster,"" however, they reverse their roles with Denzel cast as the villain and Crowe as the hero. Although it far surpasses ""Virtuosity,"" ""American Gangster"" doesn't qualify as a classic gangster film. ""The Godfather"" trilogy, both ""Scarface"" flicks, ""Goodfellas,"" ""Casino,"" ""Once Upon a Time in America,"" and ""Heat"" represent the cream of crop where mobster movies are concerned. While it shares many of the same plot elements of those vintage crime movies, Scott's film is driven by its characters rather than any kind of stylist violence. ""American Gangster"" contains no cleverly staged gunfights. Aside from an occasional shooting and the raid on the villain's heroin lab, Scott shuns violence and dwells for the most part on comparing and contrasting the two leads and their drastically different lifestyles. In other words, ""American Gangster"" is not about a crime lord building an empire.<br/><br/>""American Gangster"" charts the rise and demise of its two chief characters. Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington of ""Training Day"") spent fifteen years as the driver, bodyguard, and bill collector for legendary black crime boss Ellsworth 'Bumpy' Johnson (Clarence Williams, III of ""Reindeer Games"") who ruled Harlem for four decades. After Bumpy dies from old age, Frank slips into Bumpy's shoes and takes over the heroin racket. He rings up a U.S. Army relative stationed in Bangkok, Nate (Roger Guenveur Smith of ""Final Destination""), who runs a bar for servicemen called Soul Brothers. Frank flies to Thailand. Nate and he travel upriver into the jungle to deal with a renegade Chinese General (Ric Young of ""Kiss of the Dragon"") and buy $400 thousand dollars worth of uncut heroin. Frank funnels thousands of dollars through Nate to bribe U.S. Army officers, pilots, and Military Police to protect his product and fly it into America on board Uncle Sam's planes in the coffins of dead U.S. troops. Frank sells the heroin uncut at a bargain price, and the junkies come out of the woodworks. Yes, this really happened. Mafia Chieftain Dominic Cattano (Armand Assante of ""The Mambo Kings"") wants some of this action and in exchange the mobster promises Frank protection from the police. Unfortunately, Frank enjoys little peace of mind, especially from corrupt New York City Police Special Investigator, Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin of ""The Goonies""), who wants his cut of Frank's million dollar profits. Nevertheless, despite the corrupt cops, Frank flourishes because the dirty cops aren't about to let anything slaughter their cash cow.<br/><br/>Enter squeaky clean New Jersey detective Ritchie Roberts (Russell Crowe of ""Gladiator"") and his not so squeaky clean partner Javier J. Rivera (John Ortiz of ""Miami Vice"") who stake out a numbers runner with a million dollars in cash stashed in grocery bags in his car. When the numbers runner doesn't return for the loot, Ritchie and Javier confiscate the dough. Ritchie and Javier ponder their unique problem. If they turn a million bucks insupposedly the right thing to dothey will alienate their comrades because no cop will trust them. Javier wants to claim the cash for themselves, but Ritchie refuses. Afterward, their New Jersey comrades treat them like lepers. Since so many cops are on the take, they refuse to work with Ritchie because he isn't corrupt enough to trust. Eventually, Ritchie's boss, Lou Toback (Ted Levine of ""Silence of the Lambs""), asks him to head up a government drug task force to bust big time dealers. For a change, Ritchie's honesty provides dividends, but those dividends are not enough to preserve his marriage to wife Laura (Carla Gugino of ""The One"") and they battle it out in the courts over custody of their son. Eventually, Ritchie and his hand picked crew of honest cops ferret out Frank as their chief narcotics target. Everybody else dismisses Frank as a major crime lord. The U.S. Attorney General (Roger Bart of ""Hostel, Part II"") laughs at the belief that an African-American could be the mastermind behind a heroin empire.<br/><br/>""American Gangster"" rewards good and punishes evil. Unfortunately, despite its powerhouse cast, Scott's film is just good, not great. The shortage of violence that constitutes an integral feature of most gangster films is ironic when you consider that Scott helmed the incredibly bloodthirsty ""Black Hawk Down."" Instead, Scott imitates director William Friedkin's cops and drug dealers classic ""The French Connection,"" that Oscar winning scenarist Steven Zallian of ""Schindler's List"" makes reference to early in the story. Scott cuts back and forth between Frank and Ritchie over the course of the film's lengthy 157 minutes until they meet in the last half-hour. In the process, they omit a lot of the facts behind Frank Lucas and his million dollar heroin operation. Denzel Washington doesn't look as evil as he did in ""Training Day,"" but he is brutal as Lucas. At one point, he confronts a rival gangster, puts his pistol against the guy's forehead, and warns him about forgetting to pay his tribute money. When the rival hood dares him to kill in broad daylight in front of a crowd of people, Lucas pulls the trigger without a qualm. ""American Gangster"" is well worth watching for its audaciously true story set against a turbulent chapter in U.S. history."
"Oldhollywood9","8","0","6","13 November 2007"," Good Movie, but.......
","I think American Gangster is a really good movie, very entertaining story and great performacnes from Crowe and Washington. But I do have one gripe (I don't know if this was just a weird thing when I saw it, or if it happening in every film reel): the damn boom mic kept on bopping in and out of a lot of scenes. I lost count exactly how many, but it was extremely distracting. I don't understand why a such a big-time Hollywood film could miss something so obvsious like this, it doesn't really make any sense. At least for me, the film was kind of spoiled for me because of a stupid technical problem that they should have seen when they first shot it. Sometimes I could just see a little bit of the mic, but in a couple of scenes the mic might as well been hitting the actors in their faces. It's pretty ridiculous how such a blatant error with a respected director and actors behind it made it to the big screen."
"classicalsteve","9","0","4","13 November 2007"," The Godfather in Harlem - Brilliant Film if Occasionally Hard to Follow
","Denzel Washington does not play simpletons. His characters are complex mosaics layered with deep passions, personal convictions, and polarizing contradictions. Sometimes moral, occasionally hypocritical, these characters mesmerize you to the point where the cloak you see is the character and not the actor, which is of course the point. If there is anything that could be said of Washington's roles, they deal with the human condition at a raw naked level. As Frank Lucas, Washington steps into the shoes of an African-American Godfather and shows he can play almost anything brought before him. He probably deserves the Oscar for every one of his performances. Problem is, they can only give one a year.<br/><br/>Frank Lucas is the most unlikely of crime bosses, or so went the stereotype of the mid-20th century that propagated that only Italians and/or Irish could mastermind such complex money-making schemes. And Lucas is also discounted because he was the chauffeur of an Italian godfather for years. How could the hired help even dream, let alone instigate, such a plan? But what others didn't know is that day after day, his employer was also his mentor, teaching Lucas the finer points of maintaining a crime organization. And when his employer dies, Lucas takes these teachings and realizes them.<br/><br/>Lucas knows if there is demand for a product and/or service, even if illegal, there will be buyers. And they will pay a premium if supply is low and demand is high. And he also knows competition is inevitable. However, if he delivers a better product cheaper without compromising his profit, he could lure more customers away from his competition. And that's what Lucas does. By buying heroine and cocaine wholesale direct from war-ravaged Vietnam, he can cut out many-a middle man and sell better quality merchandise for less than the other mob bosses who are selling an inferior grade for more. Of course, it also means having a contact in Vietnam and paying off certain branches of law enforcement. And it also frustrates his competition who happen to be other mafia organizations. In the long run, it pays off as Lucas makes more dough than Texas oil magnates. But the catch is that it leads to bribery and killing.<br/><br/>His nemesis, unknown to him for most of the movie, is Richie Roberts, a moral if obsessed cop, played equally brilliantly by Russell Crowe, who is trying to piece together the puzzle. As head of an undercover narcotics division in New York, he knows the dope is being delivered and sold, but he can't figure out who is running the show. The name and face of Frank Lucas surfaces but is tentatively discounted. A recurring theme throughout the movie is the assumption that Lucas must be working for someone higher up, which becomes a stumbling block. No one on the force can imagine that an African-American is a drug kingpin.<br/><br/>The two stories run parallel, the investigation by Crowe and the story of Washington as the crime boss, moving toward the climax in which both stories collide. The plot is intricate and complex, and sometimes I wished the film would slow just a little bit to allow us to catch our breath so we could understand all the intricacies. Sometimes the hints are so subtle that it was hard to figure out all the threads. One sub-story involves Roberts' wife who files for divorce, which I thought was more of a distraction and didn't really relate to much else in the film. Instead, I wanted to hear more about the investigation. Still, an incredible movie, and again an Oscar-caliber performance by Denzel Washington."

I'm not going to tell you a thing to about the move because it's an experience you need to go through yourself.<br/><br/>Awesome movie..."
"thebengalimafia-1","9","0","5","12 November 2007"," A modern Classic!
","Apart from seeing The Departed last year, I can't remember the last time I saw a good mob movie. Maybe that's a good thing, since mob movies these days aren't what they used to be, anyway. It's also been a while since we've gotten to see Denzel as an out of control bad guy. Strangely enough, American Gangster isn't really a mob movie, and Denzel isn't out of control either.<br/><br/>American Gangster shows us how Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) took over Harlem in the 1970s. In the hay day of heroin, he sold it at twice the potency and half the price and he never got caught. How did he do that? By taking a Wal-Mart style approach to the drug trade. Lucas goes to the jungles of Vietnam himself and buys directly from the manufacturer. He then ships it back in the coffins of dead soldiers. That's when I realized what I was watching. It's not about the mob; it's about Frank Lucas, the man who won out over the mob, and about and the man chasing him, Ritchie Roberts (Russell Crowe).<br/><br/>Unlike most gangsters of the era Lucas never wears his career and money on his sleeve. As he reprimands his brother for wearing clothes that are too flashy, we get to see the beauty in his method. He dresses like a moderately successful businessman, keeps a low profile, and spends evenings at home with his family. He even takes his mother to church on Sundays. When he does make a ""public"" appearance, he's with baseball players and other celebrities, not drug lords and business partners. But all that subtle modesty doesn't stop him from shooting a man in the head in broad day light.<br/><br/>It's this ""modest"" lifestyle coupled with his death grip on his business that takes him to the top. Lucas is a polar opposite of the man trying to put him behind bars, Ritchie Roberts. Early on in the film, Roberts finds $1 million in cash and rightfully turns it in. For this, he is ridiculed by other police officers for being a boy scout. It was sad to see someone ostracized for doing the right thing. And scenes like this brought me back to the fact that I was watching a true story, not a work of fiction.<br/><br/>For nearly half of the film, Roberts doesn't even know he's looking for Frank Lucas. And how could he? Lucas keeps that ever so low profile, and it gets to the point where all business is done through Franks brother and then to him. The idea of a black man taking away the drug business from the Mafia was unheard of, but Frank did it. There's no ""guns blazing"" end to this film. Ritchie and Frank sit down and have a conversation. With Frank's help, Ritchie ends up taking down the majority of the Drug Task Force in New York.<br/><br/>There should be no doubt that the film does touch on both drug trafficking and police work, but it also takes a look at the effects on the families of the two sides, respectively. While Lucas does as much as he can to provide for his family, Roberts gives up his marriage and his son to put the bad guys behind bars. Both men have to deal with lying to the people they love, and oddly enough, they both face police corruption head on. This is probably what leads to their mutual respect.<br/><br/>American Gangster is a modern classic. I have to say that Denzel is such a likable actor, that even though he plays a ruthless drug lord, we're always sitting there, hoping he wins."

","Ridley Scott directs Denzell Washington & Russell Crowe in a factually based story about the Mob set in the late 1960's through the mid 1970's. The script is excellently written & the film is very well directed by Scott. This is by far the best I have seen this year & has the potential to be the best picture.<br/><br/>Washington is superb (best actor) playing a real life crime czar in the Bronx during the late 1960's. The opening scene has his teacher who mentored him die of ironically, natural causes due to his heart stopping. At the wake, Washington makes clear his intention to take over.<br/><br/>Once past this, Washington proceeds to do just that. A lot of prime news reel footage from the period & a couple of recreations of actual events serve as backdrops to help tell the story of his rise to the top. Meanwhile, Rusell Crowes Special Investigative unit starts off slowly in pursuit of not just stopping Washingtons success but also of trying to rein in a lot of bad cops on the force & on the take in the NYC police department.<br/><br/>This film has a lot of excellent support including a surprisingly strong supporting actress performance by veteran actress Ruby Dee as Washingtons mom. At about 2 hours & 45 minutes the film is a little long but it never gets bogged down or boring. In fact, it would be difficult to make the film any shorter & hold the entire story together. This is factually based drama at its best.<br/><br/>Oscar blew it last year by not nominating this but since the main stream media is still racist & years behind an American society that is not racist, they selected No Country For Old Men, a slasher movie for best picture last year. This proves that with the Academy- Jason Lives!"

The scenes of interplay are subdued sufficiently to appease the general audiences. The historical aspects of the movie is profoundly interesting and only somewhat surprising in view of the era from which the story is drawn. Denzel Washington plays Frank Lucas, a powerhouse of an individual who seemingly single handedly takes over a major crime syndicate in New York. Russell Crowe plays Richie Roberts, the adversarial New York, Jewish cop who sticks with his convictions despite multiple trials and tribulations on duty. He too delivers a convincing performance that is far underplayed as he can so easily do. Ruby Dee plays Mama Lucas, the little momma who can keep Frank eating out of her hand. This film is well worth the price of admission, and it provides an education of the era that will stay with you long after it is over. I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen."

","American Gangster is a guaranteed classic that will be played and commented on thirty and fifty years from now. I will be surprised if it doesn't win the Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor and Actress (Ruby Dee is a shoo-in) You-Know-What award and a few others.<br/><br/>American Gangster reminds me of two movies; when we're on stage with Frank Lucas, his family, and his organization, I am looking at the Godfather for this generation; when with Russel Crowe, doggedly chasing Lucas and his heroin, I'm watching a homage to The French Connection (which gets a subtle reference in the dialogue).<br/><br/>Highly recommended.

","I saw the film Near Palm Springs and the boom dipped into the shot at least 15 times. For a while there I thought it was going to have more screen time than Denzel or Russell. One time half the boom microphone was visible. Having said that though I though it was great and Denzel and Russell both showed why they have the gold men on their fire places. I love to watch Denzel on screen...amazing! I never knew this character existed but he was an interesting man in many ways. I love to learn about all types of history and film is my chosen method. I will see this one again I think. And by the way...did any one else see the boom as much as I did? I have to think there was some type of communication problem on the set.

"baileydad","8","0","4","11 November 2007"," A crime drama in the mold of classic gangster epics
","This may contain plot spoilers, so heads up.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington shines as Frank Lucas, a man who establishes himself as a crime lord in Harlem, in the same league as the Mafia. He uses connections and fortifies his empire using family members, all the while attempting to be true to the spirit of his predecessor. He is a cool character who is not above violent means to achieve his goals. The film does not try to avoid the criminal aspect of the character, but displays all the human elements - from loving to detestable.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a New Jersey cop named Richie Roberts , portrayed by Russell Crowe, becomes an outsider to his police brethren by attacking corruption whenever he encounters it. Despite this moral stance, his social life is a series of affairs, a broken marriage, and a variable relationship with his son. Due to his outsider status, Roberts is inevitably drawn into a anti-drug task force.<br/><br/>Lucas is a man who competes on the heroin market, but is also challenged by the Mafia, including one played (not surprisingly) by Armand Assante, who had played John Gotti in the film biography, 'Gotti'. Josh Brolin stands out as a seedy, thoroughly corrupt NYC police investigator who tangles with Lucas. Roberts is tied to the crime syndicate by virtue of having graduated with a member, but still imposes a barrier to ward off corruption. <br/><br/>A number of familiar character actors fill other significant roles, including Cuba Gooding Jr., Joe Morton, John Hawkes, and Ted Levine as Crowe's immediate supervisor. Ruby Dee has a worthy role as Frank's mother, who seems to be unaware of her son's activities, but is actually quite observant. Crowe is quite believable in his role, but his accent varies between NYC and Australia. He has yet to match the cop effort he gave in 'L.A. Confidential'. Like his character, Washington commands in his portrayal of a gentleman gangster.<br/><br/>Both leads share the same irony in character, flawed humans with ethics about remaining true to themselves. ""American Gangster"" is not the 'Godfather' or 'Goodfellas', but is a well-mounted effort based on a true story written in an article about Frank Lucas. Ridley Scott direction eschews his crisp, shining cinematography for a more realistic portrayal. Even the large Lucas family scenes are not over stylized in their brightness.<br/><br/>The movie covers a quarter of a century following the saga of Frank Lucas, and Crowe's involvement. Lucas' empire is spearheaded in the late 1960s by the drug abuse he hears from Vietnam news reports. Bangkok, Thailand figures into this period as the source. What ironically, is a cash crop overseas provides an illegal, higher quality and competitive cash source for Lucas. Adding to the irony, Lucas provides his family the fruits of his success, albeit at the cost of his fellow man in Harlem. He is also an outsider among other crime families and organizations, like Crowe is in the police force. <br/><br/>If you're interested, bring some snacks and a beverage as it's nearly 2 hours and 40 minutes. However, it's a worthy film that draws your attention over the epic viewing time."
"freaky_dave","8","0","4","11 November 2007"," This film leaves an impact
","American Gangster was an interesting film which was never boring even though it was nearly three hours long. THe performances were pretty good as were the surprise acts of violence. I wouldn't consider it a great film, but it is definitely worth seeing if you want to see how drug empires are built.<br/><br/>It is the 1970s, and detective Richie Roberts (Crowe) believes that there is a new Kingpin in town dealing heroin. The new Kingpin is Frank Lucas (Washington), and he has built an empire through payoffs and crooked deals. He quickly moves up in the ranks to become one of the most powerful American crime lords which rivals that of the mafia.<br/><br/>Roberts, and outcast cop in his own precinct because of his complete honesty and belief in the judicial system, works painstakingly to bring the empire of Frank Lucas down. In his efforts he has to deal with plenty of corruption. One man in particular gives him the biggest trouble, and that would be detective Trupo (Brolin in a fine performance) who makes it as difficult for Roberts as he can.<br/><br/>So here we have a battle of wills, and though Roberts and Lucas don't meet until near the end of the movie, each still remains an integral part of the plot. You can't really understand the movie unless you are able to see both men for who they are. It makes the ending even more powerful.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott, as usual, shows that he can still direct. The pacing was fantastic and not once did I think the movie dragged. The only small plot that I had a problem with was Richie and his wife's custody battle over their son. It just didn't seem to fit into this movie for some reason, but the rest of the movie is fantastic. I wouldn't say it was the greatest performance for Crowe or Washington, but what they brought to the table was well above average. I highly recommend this movie because it went into details about how corruption can destroy true justice if given the chance. It gives us a side of life that isn't so pleasant and throws it in our faces. A very good movie."

Although it was a tad on the long side, there is enough interesting material to keep the viewers watching.<br/><br/>What makes the film so well done is the fact that it is not a copy of anything anybody has already seen before. Although it may seem like it at first, the viewers can take comfort in that fact that they won't have any feelings of Daja Vu. Denzel Washington and Russel Crowe's characters were both very in depth characters, which is good because the viewer may also take comfort in the fact that they will most likely leave the theatre feeling very satisfied without any unanswered questions, thanks to the fact that both the story and the characters were explained very thoroughly. The acting was outstanding, thanks to Russel Crowe and Dezel Washington. The fact that their overall acting performance was phenomenal it may change your whole opinion on the movie for the better.<br/><br/>I have never really been a big fan of movies that are longer then they need to be, but that's just me. However like I said before, there is enough material in here that keeps the movie going, and there's enough that the viewers won't feel that the movie is to repetitive or overdone. This movie is just right for anyone weather it be a fan of action, drama, crime, suspense, or anything of that nature.<br/><br/>Although typically this movie isn't meant to be an action movie, there is plenty of action, which is a good thing because the movie does an excellent job of pulling the action off in a way that is for the better rather then for the worse.

"colinbarnard-1","8","0","5","9 November 2007"," Russel Crowe Can Do No Wrong
","I just came back from a Friday screening of this film. Despite the large Canadian audience's propensity to just sit there and not react to anything that was on the screen, what kept going through my mind were comparisons to ""The French Connection"" and ""Heat""- as good as the former, and way better than the latter.<br/><br/>I then began to think about how the script and direction dance around the developing, but separate, lives of the two protagonists. Yes, Denzel's character is a protagonist in this film. Both he and Crowe inhabit different worlds with a high degree of relative moral integrity suitable for each.<br/><br/>When the two characters finally meet up in the end, it is a much more satisfying series of scenes than what Michael Mann did with Pachino and DeNiro. Both appear to have a grudging admiration for each other, as they work together to bring down a common nemesis.<br/><br/>Because Crowe has to share equal billing with Washington, his character is much more 'everyman' than others he has played. I'm not sure I like the understatement, because at times he comes across, believe it or not, as somewhat bland. But a bland Crowe is still better than any other actor on the planet, including Denzel.<br/><br/>I was again impressed with Scott's direction, even though I think he is over-rated as a director: imitative and derivative (think 'Connection' again, especially with the gritty scenes of NYC and Jersey, and the muted, grey palette of colours). Assuming Ridley had 'final cut', he has put together a well-paced, eminently watchable film.<br/><br/>But for Crowe fans, ""Yuma"" is the better of his two films this year. But thanks for the Xmas present anyway Rus- I'll see anything you put out! I appreciate the humility in sharing the screen with Denzel, but I much prefer you as the focus of the piece, but that's just me."

","A bit of history between this film and myself. I remember reading about this project being killed in 2005. It sounded like a fantastic film, (a Harlem drug lord who smuggled uncut heroin into New York? sign me up) that was unfairly killed due to a too-high $90 million budget (which the film wound up costing). I vowed that if I ever became a film director, I would get this film made. Cue two years later, I'm watching Knocked Up, and I see a trailer for the film that I had no idea was rescued from development hell. I made a mental note of the date, and have been looking forward to it since the first trailer premiered. When I finally saw it, it was actually better than the trailer implied. All of the actors are fantastic with Denzel Washington's moral gangster and Russel Crowe playing one of the few uncorrupt cops in the NYPD (channeling a bit of Al Pacino's Frank Serpico in a bit in the process as well). Ridley Scott's direction is smooth and guided, and the dialogue is cool and natural. The film breaths with the atmosphere and style of the late '60s and early '70s. Overall, I give American Gangster a solid 10/10.<br/><br/>Films to view in addition to this: Serpico and The Godfather. The film seems to take inspiration from both films, both of which are magnificent as well and both star Al Pacino."

I must admit though, when i was sitting in the theater i was a little surprised. Never hearing about Frank Lucas before, i thought this movie was about life on the streets, and crime in NY (you know ""gangster"" things). I wasn't expecting to find that Denzel was a kingpin. I HATE drug movies but this one was good. The emotion was raw and enrapturing, the acting was so good i didn't consider it acting, and the action was intense. the nudity and drug use was too much for me to handle, but other than that this definitely goes with Washington's other classics such as Man on Fire and John Q.

","It isn't very often to see a film and be on the ""bad guy's"" side, even if what the antagonist's crimes, misdeeds and lifestyle is portrayed with such upfront, realistic brutality. The overall vibe and feeling surrounding Frank Lucas' character is one of unconditional respect, honor, and most notably made clear: loyalty. It is, however, strange to compare A.G. to films like THE GODFATHER or THE DEPARTED because this film isn't about the mob at all, at least on focus. This film shows a somewhat outcast of the drug distributing world that instead of playing by the supposed rules of the trade, is taking matters entirely into its own hands without any earnest caring for any other organization. As Lucas inconically proclaims: ""This is America."" Explaining that with every trade, there is competition, but no room for rivalries can exist, for that will just slow business down. Lucas' organization is looked upon by the police and mob as a rogue of the drug world, even at one point doubted by outsiders to be even existent. The trick behind Lucas' easily achieved success is that he did it without anybody looking, because everyone else already had something to look at, the Vietnam War. How the film wraps up is, however, the complete antithesis of just about any mobster, gang or drug trafficking movie ever made, that when its all been said and done, merely asks the only question one can ask: ""Now what?"""

","Frank Lucas: The loudest one in the room is the weakest one.<br/><br/>That's some solid advice from an unflappable, businessman/innovator who also happens to house an unshakable tyranny beneath his nondescript black overcoat. The man is Frank Lucas Â– a North Carolina-born crime boss who sold top quality heroine at discount-store prices to the good people of Harlem in the late 1960's and '70's. The advice would have been better taken than given as one loud moment, one indulgence in pride and riches, would ultimately lead to his unraveling. Having accepted an innocent gift from his beautiful wife, Lucas arrived at boxing title bout in a pimped-out chinchilla fur coat and matching fedora. All eyes were drawn to the man who dressed with such impeccable flare and had better seats than some of the highest profile gangsters in all of New York City. One of these sets of eyes belonged to Richie Roberts, a Jersey detective who was heading a covert task force determined to make big moves in the war on drugs. Before this, Richie didn't even know whom he was hunting but now he at least knew where to start looking. That moment is now a pivotal scene in Ridley Scott's American GANGSTER, a juxtaposition of Lucas's rise and demise offset against the blind pursuit to bring his untouchable operation to its knees.<br/><br/>American GANGSTER is (aside from seeming like a blatant attempt on Scott's part to latch on to some of the residual success from Scorsese's return to glory with THE DEPARTED) an exploration of the vast field of gray between what is supposed to be the clear black and white ends of the law spectrum. Lucas (a fiercely calculated Denzel Washington) hands out turkeys to his Harlem brethren while getting their children hooked on some of the purest heroine on the streets. Roberts (a disheveled and determined Russell Crowe) refuses to play into the dirty cop stereotype, even going so far as handing close to a million dollars into his superiors, but disrespects his ex-wife and disregards his responsibilities as a father. Still, both see themselves as examples that should be followed because they follow a strict life code built on core American values like integrity and hard work. What neither understands about themselves or each other is that abiding by such a rigid set of guidelines for a successful life touches every facet of your image, from where you live to what you eat for dinner to how you treat your family. Not to mention, while they spend so much time defining themselves as model Americans, they lose their individuality.<br/><br/>Both Washington and Crowe are impressive performers, each boasting past experience that would make them clear choices for the roles they were cast as in American GANGSTER. Washington, having done twisted and unpredictably violent in TRAINING DAY, now takes a more stoic approach to evil as he is unflinching even when lighting someone on fire only to shoot them in the head seconds later. (I guess he just needed to be sure his last moments alive were spent in agony.) Crowe, having played the manly cop in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, brings a certain nervous uncertainty to the authority figure icon. Each is capable of carrying a film on his own and, in American GANGSTER, they each essentially have to as the two share the screen for what amounts to maybe ten minutes. In what is perhaps Scott's greatest movie magic trick, he splits the film into two distinct pieces that exist on their own but depend on each other for purpose. While Roberts runs around the city chasing after L ucas, he never knows that it is Lucas he is actually gunning for. At the same time, Lucas never knows Roberts is after him until it is too late. <br/><br/>All that stands between Crowe and Washington now is Ridley Scott. There is no contesting American GANGSTER's ferocity but its dynamism is severely overrated. Good cops and bad cops have been done to death (although none nearly as delicious as the sleazy turn by Josh Brolin as the crooked cop ringmaster) and the same can be said for bad guys who love their mothers. By now, we all know the world is gray but strong performances, a sharp 70's visual style and companion soundtrack do their best to distract us from seeing that we aren't really learning anything new. The action moves into the clubs. The threads are slick; the tunes are smooth; the club is definitely swinging but the scene is getting tired."

","This is an excellent movie that once again showcases the talent of one of the greatest American actors today, Denzel Washington. This is a DW tour-de-force, another chapter in the illustrious screen career of this outstanding star. There are no accolades that can adequately describe his presence in this movie. Mr. Washington is part Pacino, part Brando, and ... yes ... even part James Cagney. The only drawback to this movie is casting Russell Crowe as a Jewish police officer. Mr. Crowe does his usual fine job, but his portrayal as a ""Jewish"" officer was a stretch. This movie also teaches certain facts about how to conduct a business, namely if you cut out the middle man you can reduce overhead, regulate the quality of the product and thereby greatly increase profit. That's a pretty good lesson to learn. The problem is of course that the equation leaves out one factor, the law. If you want to know what that means, watch the movie. By the way, this movie also teaches how to use a piano to discipline employees and why certain employees should not wear clothing. Of course, do you really want your employees going about without clothing?<br/><br/>Regarding Russell Crowe being cast as a Jewish police officer, this is another egregious example of the kind of blatant miscasting that can destroy the credibility of a movie. Why would any producer want to cast an actor in a role that the actor can in no way believably project? Mr. Crowe is no more believable as a Jewish police officer then would have been, lets say, James Cagney in a similar role. It just doesn't work, so why do it? By the way, when was the last time a Jewish actor played an Irish cop? Get the point?"

Ridley Scott's ambitious cops and robbers saga is overlong and not as compelling or informative as it could be, but well-cast and consistently interesting, with an impressive look at the past era that effectively captures the atmosphere of tension, violence, and brutality of Lucas' extravagant life.

","American Gangster is based on the true story of Frank Lucas, who became rich and powerful after he started smuggling heroin into the country from Vietnam on planes returning from the Vietnam war. A detective named Richie Roberts, starts to investigate Frank and soon starts to gather enough evidence to eventually bring him and his drug empire down. American Gangster is an impressive film for many reasons. For starters the film has a very intelligent and well written script that is perfectly carried out by the acting cast as well as the film's director. The attention to detail and capturing the mood, music and just the era of the late 60's and early 70's was also well done I thought. The film is longer in length, but I found it to be a truly engrossing and captivating picture that I did not once find it boring or slow at all. I found the pacing to be just right to have enough of a character study going on, but also enough to keep us interested and entertained. The editing and stylish behind the scenes camera work by director Ridley Scott, I also appreciated as well as the very powerful and believable performances by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe who play the two main leads. There have been a lot of different gangster films over the years and while this one could have been unoriginal and nothing new compared to a film like Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas, I felt that there was enough here to make this it's own movie without having to borrow ideas or formulas from other films that are similar in story and genre. This was a fairly original and captivating story which probably is helped by the fact that it is a true story and an interesting one at that. To capture the mood and era of when this all happened I give a big thanks to the film's screenwriter as well as Ridley Scott once again. Like I said earlier I was engrossed and captivated by this film and it never once stopped interesting and entertaining me. The film is more than a piece of entertainment helped by a great cast and crew who all do their best work here which is actually award worthy stuff and I wouldn't be surprised if this film did eventually get nominated for something in the next couple of months. This was an original and well done film that was engrossing and had a terrific pace to it helped by a great cast and crew that make this an award worthy film."

","American Gangster ties with Eastern Promises as one of the two top crime dramas of 2007. It had a well structured story, a good cast and fine directing by none other than the best.<br/><br/>There is one thing I take into account when I watch a ""cops vs. criminals"" film: protagonists and antagonists. Personally, I usually do not care much for the concept. If it is a fictional film then characters can be played out any way that works. In a movie based on a true story however, I prefer to see every character as human beings. American Gangster accomplished that. Frank Lucas was not some evil sadistic heroine kingpin. He was a man of ethics who decided to go into a dirty business. Richie Roberts wasn't a decorated police officer that everyone looked up to. He had to make tough choices when it came to whose side he was on. These people weren't played out to be perfectly good or bad. It made the movie very authentic to the real world and the real story.<br/><br/>I am among the many who believe Ridley Scott deserves that Academy Award he has coming to him. He has made some of the greatest movies of the past several decades. From science fiction to war to historical and many other genres in between, the man has accomplished more than most directors ever could. Ridley is a true artist, and American Gangster can be added to the list of proof that he is."
"the_Poppuns","8","0","5","2 November 2007"," Very good but...
","I don't think that's good enough. There were a lot of extremely talented people on this project so the fact that it's just a very good movie is kinda disappointing to me. A lot of it was typical. Typical story told in a typical style with typical acting. And mostly I mean Denzel Washington. Very early in this film I though 'you know Samuel L. Jackson would have been better in this'. In my opinion, he's not only a better actor, but he also doesn't play himself all the time. I know this isn't a popular opinion but I think Denzel plays himself most of the time. Role to role it's Denzel, looking like Denzel, playing Denzel in a very Denzelly way. So I kinda wish another actor had had the lead here (even if it was Chewitel Ejiofor who seems to be making a career as the guy who walks slightly behind and to the left of Denzel) and at some point I just wanted them to get back to the scenes with Russell Crowe.<br/><br/>As luck would have it, I saw a History Channel program last night called ""Gangland"" that focused on Frank Lucas. So I basically had a primer for this movie and it seems fairly accurate from what I could tell. So any comparisons to other films would have to do with style because it's not a ripoff of anything. Other movies it might remind you of are Blow, Scarface, Heat, Serpico, Donnie Brasco, etc. It almost makes you wonder how Al Pacino wasn't in it, but those movies were better in my opinion probably because of the way the stories were told. This was a basic story about a drug dealer who eventually gets caught. He's mean, he goes to Vietnam, he's still mean, he works with dirty cops, he's mean... You never really get any motivations or psychological reasons why he became who he did. He just did. I think that made the Roberts characters more interesting. Maybe he was just a more interesting person in real life I don't know, but even the background stuff with his family just seemed tacked on. I guess I expected more from these people. I think some of the supporting cast was great but then they had a few rappers in there. And I'm sorry but that bugs me. Please no more rappers. I go to a movie to see actors pretend to be hoods not real life hoods.<br/><br/>I don't know. I guess a lot of little things got to me in this film. But it not really bad. It's just that it's nothing new. Nothing profound. Nothing mind-blowing. Nothing amazing to look at. If someone asked me what movie they should see and they were thinking about this one but weren't sure, I'd send them to Gone Baby Gone. At one point I started to wonder what someone from New York like Brian De Palma or Spike Lee would have done with the same story and I imagined it being a lot better. But again, it's not bad. It just should have been better. If you're a fan of these guys by all means see it. I don't want to deter anyone who is really interested. It may be your favorite movie of the year. It just didn't live up to my expectations."

","Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts may not appear to be so, but they are flip-sides of a coin. Frank Lucas starts off as a little time bosses' apprentice while Richie Roberts starts off as a regular undercover cop attempting to climb into a better calling. Each have a choice for which direction they want to live their lives and each choose almost polar opposite directions. Frank Lucas becomes the most feared gangster in America by selling drugs to his own people and trampling all the opposition while Richie Roberts takes the justice side of becoming the most hated police officer in the force because he does the right thing and doesn't cheat under the table. It is a fabulous tale of how their paths cross as one must take down the other to achieve his goal and in the process perhaps let another achieve his forgot dream as well.<br/><br/>I don't want to reveal much more, but I will say this Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe nail their roles. One maybe flashier than the other, but I consider both just as great. There are a multitude of great supporting players here as well from Josh Brolin to Chiwetel Ejiofor. I think this reflects well upon the director Ridley Scott as he gets sort of Godfather effect from this crew.<br/><br/>The film itself is edgy chalk full of violence from beginning to the volatile ending which has a great amount of twists. It begins with the burning a man and ends with burning of ones past in a new world. Beautiful circle screenplay here, but it is not without its problems as the middle section exemplifies with a confusing editing job about the chronological path of the film. That is about my biggest complaint of this film which is quite long with a running time of nearly 3 hours.<br/><br/>It will satisfy fans of the trailer with its style and satisfy the critics with its structure and underlining story, but this film could have used a bit of trimming to save a bit of the confusion. Otherwise, I have no problem with this film following in The Departed footsteps."

","The most interesting thing about American Gangster is its dark and moody atmosphere. Ridley Scott is a master at creating worlds, yet he has fallen short, in my opinion, on his most recent projects Kingdom of Heaven and A Good Year. Here, his style is what carries a somewhat formulaic story, one that we've all seen before. Many of the characters are underdeveloped, i.e. Richie Roberts (Russel Crowe), and many scenes that were too short should have been longer. There were also many unnecessary characters and subplots that added to the film's length but added nothing to the story, i.e. Robert's ex-wife. Anyway, getting back to the saving grace of this film, I felt the acting was above par and everything about the film oozed late 60's and early 70's, I strongly believed that what I was watching was a physical moment in history. The costume design and club scenes as well as the references to newly created technology, i.e. the microwave, added to the period feel. Also the structure of the police system and Frank Lucas' (Denzel Washington) rise to power was so interesting that an entire film, at least the majority of this film, could and should have been dedicated to that concept. American Gangster did not blow me away, but it was better than many other films that share its genre. It was also very similar in structure to more influential films like Scarface, as in the rise and fall from grace of a drug lord. 7/10."
